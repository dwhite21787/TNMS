hello out there in rush land:
      I guess everyone of you out there have a specific verse or sound that
can make the spiders crawl up you back (in a good sense).
      I do.
      On 'Presto' after the line "humming your fav-or-ite song,
                                  you know I've hated that song for so long"

there is some type of harmonic disonance that is heard.  Check it out.
I have listened to it a thousand times.  It's great.

Ho...

I always figured that the Red Book was the book of codes used in
silos. These books contained launch codes..kinda makes sense with
the time of the album..it was in the days of movies like The Day
After and the Nuclear fear was pretty high..

One other thing..the user who has the quote:

  Todays Tom Sawyer...Mean Mean guy...

Why? Is it another Geddy joke> Or is it just a mistake?
(No insults intended..i figured it was in the vein of catch the fish).

<A NAME="207002">Subject:      The music of the spheres</A>

Somebody asked a few issues back about a line in the Digital Kid (or was that
the Analog man?!?)--"Like the music of the spheres".  They wanted to know
whether this was a reference to an earlier Rush song (can't 'member which
one but it wasn't Hemispheres -though that's a pretty obvious candidate).
Well, I read somewhere in an astronomy book 'bout some dude who used some kind
of orbital and/or physical data for the planets of Sol (ar Fed. ?) and assigned
pitches and durations for the data.  He thereby created a musical piece for
each of the planets--weird sounding music IMHO (there was a flexidisc in the
book).  So, maybe this is what "music of the spheres" refers to as the above
mentioned music was titled Music of the Spheres.  Maybe Neil was referring to
Holtz's -The Planets stuff?

Just to throw a spanner in the works, I just remembered a TV interview
with Alex shortly before PoW was released. (Rush on TV? in the UK!!??
Strange but true!)

Host: Rush's new album comes out next week. It's called 'Power Windows',
      and here in the studio we have guitarist Alex Lifeson who's flown
      all the way from Canada to be here, so I hope you feel priveliged.
      Alex, what's a Power Window?

Alex: (laughs) A Power Window is something that goes up and down on a car.

The following line may sound very cliche, but here goes anyway...

NEWS FROM A VERY RELIABLE SOURCE:

My mega Rush source recently talked to Andrew MacNaughton about the new album.

ALL TRACKS HAVE BEEN RECORDED.  It took only about 2 weeks, which I find
astounding by today's standards.  They are leaving for Europe in 3 weeks
for mixing, solos, production etc.

There are as of now 10 songs, although this could change a la Show Don't Tell,
Force 10...

and...

One is an instrumental.  I hope they don;t decide to tack on vocals like they
did with Hand Over Fist...

Projected release date is August-September.

<A NAME="207010">Subject: Presto Blues</A>

	There have been a lot of people lately saying that they don't
really like PRESTO as much as some of the other albums.  Being that
this album is relatively new, I may have an explanation.
	When HYF first came out, I really didn't like it as much as MP
and the such.  After listening to it a couple of times, it really grew
on me.  It's now my favorite album.  For me, a new Rush album takes a
couple weeks, or months to settle into the brain, tear apart and analyze
the songs, and hear the stroke of genius that is Rush.
	Considering that I was a starving musician in California last
summer, without my Presto CD, I didn't get to listen to it all that
much.  I am just now getting to really understand and really like the
album.  Presto is a bit different from earlier albums and for those who
don't like it as much, maybe you just need more time to listen to it.

<A NAME="207011">Subject: The Big Money/Owner of a lonely heart + Misc</A>

I felt the same as David Copley regarding The Big Money and
Owner of a Lonely Heart. There seems to be a lot of similarities in
the production. I also came across Geddy's glowing attributes of
Owner... somewhere (swiss cheese memory). It's not unlikely that they added
some production touches to The Big Money which unconsciously resemble
Owner..

On the same topic of borrowed riffs/songs/production and carbon copies,
didn't a review of Presto by Rolling Stone suggest similarities between
Anagram and Foreigner's ``Long Way from home'' or some such title (never
heard the song) ?

Long ago, someone on rec.music.misc suggested that the guitar solo in
Subdivisions is similar to the solo in U2's New Year's day. They are,
except that The Edge's solo is in a higher key. I haven't checked if this
topic is in FAQL. Rush-mgr?
Anyway, I don't remember if Boy or Signals
was released first or if New Year's day or Subdivisions were written
well before they were recorded.

A Guitar Player's article on Alex (in '86), suggested that his then playing
style had closest parallels to U2's The Edge and Andy Summers. The reason
for this classification was that all three guitarists have done a lot of
work with textures. In the Beyond Borders interview, Alex says that he is
not doing much work with textures since Rush is using kbds for that.
Strangely enough his role in the Beyond Borders project is textural.
In fact Rik Emmett called him their kbd player for that project.

Does anyone who is a drummer care to comment on single stroking vs. not
single stroking. Are Bruford and Peart primarily single stroking drummers
whereas say Phil Collins is not. Is single stroking akin to a single sharp
sound whereas ``not single stroking'' more like a diffused, broad sound?

<A NAME="207013">Subject: the _Sir Gawain_ song that didn't make it</A>

    Upon reading issue #206 in the interview with Neil, I was intrigued to see
the reference a song Peart had been working on way back when about the story
_Sir Gawain an the Green Knight_.  Having had to write a paper on this for a
British Lit. class, I am very familiar with the story and have even seen a
movie made about the story called _The Sword of the Valiant_ with Sean
Connery.  Having an affection for medieval ballads/stories/tales/myths,
I was wondering if anyone out there has ever heard anything further about
this "project" other than what was mentioned in the article.  I can't imagine
what it would sounds like or how he would tackle condensing the 80-page tale
into a musical wonder although it's not like they haven't done it a few times
before really (like I'm sure all of you weren't aware of that already...I
know, I know... ;-).

     Reading this also made me think of all the other "projects" that don't
make it onto the albums for whatever reasons (time considerations, record
company execs, "whatever"...) and wondered just how many of these make it
to later albums under the guise of a "re-worked" song or idea.  Is anyone
aware of any songs that did make it onto later albums that were originally
"shelved" at the time of the current release.  Just wonderin'....

After reading the Frequently Asked Questions list, I did not notice
any talk about the RUSH animated cartoon special that aired a few
years back on CTV (Canadian Television Network) and simulcasted on
local FM radio stations. I forget the name, but is was about (correct
me if I am wrong) the last man and woman in a city that was controlled
by a master robot and their journey to escape. Can anyone expand? It was
about 5 years ago. The music was from GUP? Has this been discussed in
the NMS before? I am a recent subscriber.

I don't recall reading this in the last few weeks NMS's: (was it?)
Last month, at the 1991 Juno Awards (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy Awards).
RUSH won the Album of the year award for Presto. (correct me if I am wrong -
I did not watch. TV - narcotic for the eyes). I guess, they were not there
to accept, but GOWAN did accept for them (Alex is on GOWAN's new album -
dicussed earlier in the NMS).

Power Windows Tour, Ottawa, Canada 1986, FM was the backup band - for your lists
.
This was and is probably the last Rush Concert in Ottawa due to RUSH's
so called "15K person minimun advanced booking requirement" - local radio
station. Is this true elsewhere?

to record "the same place they went last time".  All of the recording

A few things:

I don't know for sure what those dolls are, but I thought they might be

I just picked up a "new" CD bootleg of the Permanent Waves tour called
"Fly in the Night"

Good overall sound quality.  A bit better than "Red Stars..." but not as
good as the Yes and Genesis CD boots put out by Flashback.

Track listing:

1) Intro/Xanadu
2) A Farewell to Kings
3) Closer to the Heart
4) Something for Nothing
5) Cygnus X-1
6) Working Man
7) Fly by Night
8) In the Mood
9) Cinderella Man

The main reason I got it was to check out the live versions of the Farewell...
material.

According to the cover, this is a limited edition release, with only 1000
copies made.

Happy Hunting!!!
