Yo RushHeads,

What always blew my mind at Rush concerts was the lazer works.
I've always wanted to know more about the behind-the-scenes set up
of the lazer and lightwork.  Each time that I've seen them (always
in the San Diego Sports Arena), they've had mirrors around the arena
corners, sides, etc and create a web of lazer light via reflections.
In addition, they created images on the screen behind them, much in
the style of Lazerium shows (how many people have seen the RUSH versions?)
Incredible stuff here, I WANT DETAILS!!   What sort of soft/hardware
is going on behind the scenes?! Who does it for them?
Can I send Rush my resume (yeah, right).

Actually, I can answer one of my own question:  The lazer work for
the Lazerium shows is done by Lazer Images, based in Santa Monica, Calif.

At one particular Rush show (in San Diego), they had MAJOR electrical
problems, and the concert had to be stopped 3-4 times, as they fixed
a fuse, etc, whatever.....it was great fun, because the Arena lights went
on and Alex started to tap dance while "problems" were being fixed. It was
too funny.  PS. From what I saw, Alex is turning into Mr. G.Q. on stage.
Relax dude, wear a T-shirt.

Anyway any info anyone can share with me/us on the questions asked in
part II of paragraph I  is highly appreciated.

Hello fello Rush fans.  Here is the full scoop on the archive file
server that I'm running.  By sending email with the proper Subject
line, you can receive digest back issues, lyrics, the Frequently
Asked Questions, articles, transcriptions of tourbooks, and other
items.  I would also like to provide the raster bitmaps and GIFs
if someone would send them to me.  PUH-LEEZE!  If you have something
which I'm missing, please send it along.  See below for how-to.
A list of what is currently available is at the end of this posting.

The address of this archive file server is:

   UUCP'ish:  ...!uunet!ingr!server
   ARPA'ish:  server@ingr.com

This archive file server currently supports the following commands:

   GET     - request a specific file listed in the index
   HELP    - request the help file (this file)
   INDEX   - request list of requestable files
   MESSAGE - this is a message to server keeper (do not process)

Commands and file names are not case sensitive.  The body of the
email is _ignored_ unless the command is MESSAGE, then it is passed
on to the keeper of the server, currently me.

To make something available on the archive, send it with the MESSAGE
command so the server keeper can respond appropriately.

I am limited to sending 1 megabyte of text a day.  If your request
is processed after this limit is exceeded, you will be notified that
your request failed.  You will also be notified if your request
contains an invalid command, unknown file name, or other problem.

Use the MESSAGE command for questions.  Do not contact anyone at site
INGR.  This might cause problems and will put the existence of the
server at risk.  As a *LAST* resort, post a message to the list and
I will reply accordingly.

Enjoy, and thanks to all who have helped me to build this collection.

Attention all planets...

	Lately I've been hearing some pretty disturbing news from some
pretty reliable sources.  Apparently, someone was taken our beloved "Tom
Sawyer" and put it to _RAP MUSIC_ (pardon the oxymoron).  I have yet to
hear this myself, but it appears to be true.  The 7/8 solo section
figures prominently, from what I understand.

	Please, say it isn't so!  First there was the M.C. Hammernuts
ripoff of "Superfreak", then someone did a dance music bastardization of
Yes' "Owner Of A Lonely Heart", and now ... THIS?!?  Why?  Why RUSH???!

	In other news, someone mentioned Alex breaking a string during
YYZ here in Pittsburgh, on the _Power Windows_ tour.  Someone else said
he broke it during the same song, right before the solo, in another
city.  Well, I was listening to a bootleg last night of _Power Windows_
in Pittsburgh, and he broke it *right before the solo* here.  Just
thought I'd add that little tidbit.

(Forgive me if this is old news; I'm still behind in reading my TNMS's)

"Yes, John Connelly..."
	...I too am a Rush keyboardist!  In fact, the guitarist (who happens
	and my to be my brother, Bob) and bassist/vocalist ("Hey Joe!") from
	my "latest old band" are also NMS subscribers.  3/4 of W + Z, eh?

"Techno-Geeks"
	Well, I used to be in the Audio Recording department here at The
	OSU, Inc., so I suppose I'm part music major.  But they eventually
	canned the program ("The bastages!") and I somehow drifted into
	Computer Science.  The rest is history!

"Cancer!"
	I heard Geddy had nose cancer!  BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!  ;-)

"Chronicles CDs"
	I can find them for $25.  Anybody beat that somewhere else?

"Look how fast I can play arpeggios!"
	I wouldn't put Mr.Big high up on my "best band" list.  Actually,
	I know they wouldn't even put in an appearance!  :-)  I believe
	that these "speed freaks" are very juvenille in their musicianship.
	I remember when I was early in my guitar career how I'd do all
	this fret tapping arpeggio bullsh*t and would play really fast just
	for fun ("Hey! Call me Mr.Sloppy!").  Heck, for one solo I even
	tapped with my hands over the top of the fretboard!  But eventually
	I realised it was all crap and started concentrating on some solid
	technique.  I'm so happy that I did.  However, I'd still love to
	tap a Chapman Stick any day!  :-)

"Rush's 'Anthem' satanic?"
	Mark Stemm and Bill "Axeman" Colyer (an old pal-o-mine. "Hey BBBill!")
	both think that "Anthem" was the song the "family channel" 'exposed'
	as being satanic.  Well, it could have been, now that I think back
	on it, but "the point remains the same!"  I know it was off of the
	p/g video, as Axeman confirms, so all you folks with a copy check if
	"Anthem" is on the video!

"Rush influenced Hackers"
	Adam Williams mentions ESI's inclusion of Rush quotes in their
	cracks.  I've seen one example with their quoting of "Mystic
	Rhythms" on a C=64 game.  I even think one of ESI uses "By-Tor"
	as his handle.

Oh well, that's it fer now...

$8.99 is not a bad deal, but shopping around pays off.  Rasputin's here in
Berkeley and San Lorenzo have good deals periodically - I paid $7.99 for the
first 4 studio albums at Rasputins, Tower and Leopold (fancy name for Where-
house) and $7.99 for Moving Pictures at Target (yes, Target - and you thought
they only had New Kids and Tiffany).  Also, used CD's are often a bargain -
most of the time they are in good shape (some stores are more reliable than
others) and always cheaper than new.  The Rush Albums I've bought used are
P/G for $8.00, Hold Your Fire for $9.00.  So, be patient, and you will save
beaucoup $$$.

Does any one out there know if the album A Show of Hands was recorded
digitally or analoge? Do the boyz record all of their shows?

Also, I would like to thank Joe Kung, wherever you are, for the song sheets.

   O.K. I'm a big fan of Rush for both their music and their lyrics.
But I don't think Geddy Lee is an "incredible" keyboard player. (He
is an "incredible" bass player).  But when you go to the show, everytime
Geddy does a simple little keyboard solo, the audience erupts as if
it were Peart doing a drum solo. Go figure! Yeah, I know-everyone at these
shows is all wound up (or stoned) and will cheer anything, but still...

Only slightly related, I had this vision with a bunch of people in suits 
(expensive suits) - the whole auditorium is filled these guys, it's like 
the theatre - and on stage Rush is playing. The audience cheers and whistles 
and yells - not at the drum solo, not at the bass or keyboard or even guitar
solo. They are cheering the lyrics.  "Well done! Well done! How poetic! 
Allusions, more allusions!" Kind of like Monty Python's "Novel Writing",
ayy.

  Oh, by the way, since I'm rambling on here, someone mentioned Paul
Gilbert of Mr. Big last week.  Just a note - he's considered one of the
hottest young guitar virtuosos today (meaning he's in every other issue
of every Guitar magazine).

I got my copy of the laser disc for ASOH (not Chronicles :-). I looked
for the import print (US print) but I couldn't find any. It turns out
that the Japanese print didn't have `Lock and Key' as it was mentioned
here before :-(.  But it had CD quality digital sound, and I really
enjoyed it!

Talking about breaking strings, I noticed Alex broke a string at the
end of Tom Sawyer in the video. It got tangled on the other strings
and made a small buzzing noize, but Alex pulled it off and played the
last chord while arming down to keep the pitch. Small precise techniques..

Just a few items:

>a live song "Anthem" also off of P/G video. They too put the "satanic" lyrics

Now I haven't seen the P/G tour video lately, but I am *pretty* sure that
"Anthem" isn't on it. For that matter, I don't remember ever seeing them do
that song live, so where did this footage come from?

 >[ They also claim that the star from _2112_ is a pentagram, and therefore

This is getting picky, but on the _Exit- Stage Left_ video, at the very end of
the tape, after the finale of "2112," the red star floating in water that I
assume was projected on the back screen was in the form of a pentagram. I also
have a 2112 bumper sticker that has the full inner-star lines drawn also. Not
that this means anything, but it's kinda interesting. What I heard once, and
promptly got rather upset about, is when some metalhead told me that Rush had
stolen Motley Crue's logo. Arrrggh!

By the way, keep those interesting "I ran into Rush" stories coming. I love to
read those most of all, and hope to have my own some day.
