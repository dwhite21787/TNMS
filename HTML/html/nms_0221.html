This is just a reminder to all you considering uploading files to the 
incoming ftp directory that Syrinx is a bit tight on disk space.  I am
still in the process of getting rid of issues 1-100 (maybe 1-200), and
moving them to another site with some availability.  (This means that
there will be some sort of automatic retrieval method in place.)  I will
also be moving them to another computer at my site, but they will not be
as accessible there.  As always, they are on the mail server at Ingr
until we hear otherwise.

Still, until this is done, there is not much disk to play with.  PLEASE
refrain from uploading any sound files, as they tend to be quite large.
There is one sound file currently available, but it is too big to go out
in mail from Ingr, and I can't make it available until I get more disk or
clear some space on the current one.  If and when sound files are available,
I'll post a big announcement here.

In the images arena, there are soon going to be quite a few more coming in
to the images directory, thanks to our co-founder, Jimmy.  There's about ten
or so files I'm awaiting a description of which will be available soon.

And, on a non-Rush note, the Yes show Friday night was *incredible*!  I
swear Rick Wakeman has about 14 fingers...  A must see for any 70's pomp-
rock fan.  High point:  "Heart of the Sunrise"; low point: No "Starship
Trooper." :-(  

It should hold me over until this fall sometime... :-)

 Speaking of Mystery Science Theater 3000... There is an allusion to Rush
in every show. The gumball machine robot is named Tom Servo. (For those
robot illiterates, a 'servo' is a type of feedback device used in closed loop
robotic systems.) 'Servo' was substituted, quite obviously, to disguise a very
clever allusion to Rush: Tom Sawyer. It fits the context exceptionally well...

[ Umm, not to say I don't believe you, but what sort of proof/evidence do
  you have to back this up?  I've seen many (~15) MST3K shows, and only
  one Rush reference in them all.                               :rush-mgr ]

Yeah, but on the Presto tour, they opened up with "Force 10" at Alpine Valley,
which is off the fourth album of the last live release. My guess is that they
simply go with good, strong, opening songs, like every other band does.

I posted this question a while back, with no response. At the very beginning of
"Time Stand Still," with the first guitar notes, there appears to be a nasty
droning sound underneath, like a bad taping or mixing job. Anybody else notice
it? Any comments?

One last question regarding the song "Distant Early Warning." Someone(s)
analyzed the lyrics not too long ago here. My question: can you find parallels
between Neil's lyrics and the video for that tune? My hunch is that they just
decided to have fun with it, having aliens pick up Geddy's son Julian and send
him off on a ride through the countryside on a missle. Doesn't seem nearly as
serious as the song itself.

Question for a friend: Anybody with info on a new U2 release? Mail me
personally, please. Also, when I tried to send to the address posted for a
Queensryche list, it bounced from their site. Anybody else with a lead on this,
or was it all a myth to begin with?

<A NAME="221005">Subject: Tom Sawyer</A>

Hello there!  Someone in the last posting (I can't remember who) asked if any
hard core Rush fans actually have Tom Sawyer as their favorite song.  Let me
just say that, since I started to really get into Rush about 2 1/2 years ago,
I have obtained all of their albums on cassette, 4 on CD, 5 posters, the
autobiography *Visions*, various pictures and tour books, two shirts, 4 of the
5 videocassettes, 5 or 6 bootlegs, and waited in line overnight for Rush tix
on their previous tour.  Is this hard core enough?  I'd like to add that my
favorite song is Tom Sawyer...in fact, T.S. got me started into Rush.  Is it
so wrong that a catchy song becomes one's favorite?  I don't think so.  And
the song isn't *just* catchy...it has some really deep lyrics...it is a
powerful song.  I guess what I am trying to say is that we all have different
tastes....later all!

Hey gang,
        Does anybody who saw the guy's on the Last tour ( Presto )
remember the support group . Mr Big.
        Well if you were there, did the guitarist from Mr big come ouy
( sorry out ) to play the encore ( IN the Mood ) with Alex?

I was reading an Interview with Paul Gilbert ( Mr Big ) in Guitar
World, where he waqs saying that it was one of the hairiest moments in
his life . as he walked on stage ( This was a surprise for the guy's
as they were not expecting him to come on )

        But It went well.

[ This must have been in one of the first cities on the tour - they did
  this at many of the shows on the Presto tour, with other Mr. Big members
  also.                                                         :rush-mgr ]

Hey,
        As far as I know Geddy has the very first production
Steinberger headless bass. Though what he is using now , I have no
idea of.

        AS for FM. There was a brit band called FM, but I believe that
they have now spilt up

  Find it hard to believe that Marillion were booed off the stagge
when they supported Rush - The fans must have been in a bad mood that
night.

Also, Neil is *not* the best drummist in the world. His drumming suits
Rush right down to the ground, but there are better drummers than him.
If you want to listen to some try -
        Dave Weckl - Chick Corea Band

and     Mark Collins - ( Sorry for the plug - He plays in my band )

Don't Flame me for this - I do like Neil's playing, but I think he
should change the solo he does ( He has been playing it for years )

As for the other guys. Geddy is one of the most awesome Bass players
in the business.
There are better soloists than Alex, but at chords and atmospheric
stuff, he is one of the best.

        Well thats my $0.02  for the day.

BTW , Hi to Chris Marshall at Hatfield - When will we have this Jam?

  You're a trip!  I think we should start a new tradition.. get really

one DJ was talking live to the Gedster (I didn't hear it, but I was told

be released in August. So there!

I must apologize for the misunderstandings that the recent posting of the
formation of a Progressive Rock mailing list has caused.  George Grinch and
I decided to direct all the people who wrote us to the existing list soon
after we posted our notices.

I sent the notice to many band lists.  For the Rush list I sent the notice to
the administrative address so that the Rush-Mgr could decide if he wanted
the notice in the newsletter.  When it didn't appear after a week, I decided
that it probably got lost in the shuffle, so I didn't write to cancel its
posting.  I was surprised to see it show up when it did, and unfortunately
was out of town at that time, so I didn't have a chance to explain then.

[ It's partially my fault for waiting so long to post it.  Things have a
  way of getting backed up...                                   :rush-mgr ]

As you probably know by now, the list "Gibraltar" is run my Michael Lamour
from the: gibraltar-request@maestro.mitre.org  address.

<A NAME="221015">Subject: Ayn Rand</A>

     Speaking of Objectivism, if you would really like to know
more about what's going through Neil's head, read "ANTHEM" by
Ayn Rand.  It's very short, only about 90 pages or so, and it is
easy to see that the song clearly comes from the book.  (It's on
Fly By Night for any of you younger Rush heads.)  Aside from the
fact that Anthem has great lyrics, I think that it is one of the
first really signature Rush tunes.  (Bytor and the Snow Dog
might give exception to this...)  We're really talking about
some teeth-gritting metal here, way back in the early 70's.

[ Yes, Rand had a lot of influence on Neil in the early days, but that
  was also over 15 years ago.  His musical direction is influenced by
  much more over the years ... Road and Track for one!  :-)    :rush-mgr ]

     For another interesting lyrical Rush allusion, read "Cry,
The Beloved Country"  (I'm sorry, the author's name slips my
mind right now.) for another idea about what "Absolom! Absolom!"
means at the end of Distant Early Warning.  (Besides, of course,
the obvious Biblical and Faulkner references.)

The above, excerpted from Geddy's interview, is why I was
frustrated with Signals (like Alex, I see).  Then they came back
with Grace Under Pressure, which I love.  I recently rented
the video to ASOH, to see if I would like the post P/G music.
It seems that Rush went back to the heavy keyboard-oriented
concept, as the songs selected for this video indicate.

Well, not exactly.

Ludwig, the drum company in Indiana, has two posters of Neil available for
a ridiculously low price.

One is from the Power Windows era, and the other has Neil with the Presto kit.

Here's the ordering information:

Order #   Poster         Cost
AV 8066   Power Windows  $2.00
AV 8070   Presto         $3.00

Send check/money order to:
Ludwig
PO Box 310
Elkhart IN 46516

The posters should take 2 weeks or so to arrive. They also have a large number
of posters of other drummers that the drummer-types out there might find in-
teresting. Ask for an order form if you're interested.

This might sound like a plug for Ludwig but I found it very interesting that
these posters were so inexpensive (as well as of such a good quality).
