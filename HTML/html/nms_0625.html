Hey, y'all:

	Oh, boy, I just got my T-shirt yesterday afternoon... it's
EXCELLENT! Good work to all who contributed to it's creation. I am certainly
proud to be wearing a "rare" Rush artifact. Which leds me to today's tale...

	In American Political Systems today, my friend Chriss Webb, who also
reads this magazine, sat down next to me. We were talking, and somehow Rush
got mentionned in the conversation. I asked: "Do you read the NMS?" He
didn't say a thing, but instead opened his jacket to reveal... the NMS
T-shirt! Wow, I was so startled... actually, I was pissed more than startled
because I hadn't put mine on in my rush to class this morning. Damn! Oh,
well, at least the T-shirts are beginning to become a trend. I'm just happy
to be one of the pioneers (if that label can be made...).

	Well, gotta run, homeboyz, cuz fact's a fact from Rome to Nome,
boy... (Oh, God, did I really say THAT?!)

Neil owes us absolutely nothing.  He is an artist and he creates for him-
self, not for me or you.  If you appreciate art there must be a reason and that
is left for the individual to decide for him or herself to decide what that may
be.  Should there be an interpretation in each book that is published, a
written explanation of every film released?  No, and it is ludicrous to expect
Neil, or any other artist for that matter, to explain himself to anyone.  If
you feel this is rude then so be it.

but my roommate has hockey for Super Nintendo and I love the video game.  Now
we watch real hockey and I know more hockey players than Gretsky.  What do you
expect from people who have spent the majority of their life in Kentucky?

<A NAME="625303">From: roehr@cae.wisc.edu!</A>

Hey folks,

   Just a couple of quick comments on all of this drummer/percussionist
discussion.

1) As far as "long-haired freaks" go in the drumming community, Neil used
   to be one too. He even sported that handle-bar moustache! Looks are
   definitely not everything.
2) People have been writing why some drummers are not as good as Neil, and
   why some RUSH songs/albums don't have as good of drumming as others. I
   feel that too many drummers are trying to put too many notes into beats
   and loose the feel (groove) which really makes a song good. The best
   explaination for people not liking RUSH was because there is so much
   going on in a song, that they can't afford to move slightly off of the
   beat and give the songs some groove. The drum beats people like most are
   usually the ones with the least notes. It is not easy coming up with
   simple drum beats that still sound 'cool'. Neil plays his beats to mix
   into the songs the BAND is playing as a whole. This same comment was made
   about his performance at the Buddy Rich memorial(since this was brought
   up here a couple of days ago). The other drummers were quite impressive
   and showed off their abilities. Neil didn't play as fancy as he could
   have, but he was the only one who really played WITH the band as a whole.

That is enough opinion for my first post. ;)

Hi,

In the past few issues of NMS, there has been a lot of discussion about
how Rush's music had detiorated or something to that effect. Well, at
least a lot of people seem to be saying that Presto was not as good
as, say, Moving Pictures or 2112. Somebody even went to the extent of
saying that Rush should have quit by now. This really shocked me. I think
no other group today has such an interesting range of lyrics and music
like Rush. Further, it only adds to variety if Rush's music is evolving
with time. Personally, I feel that the songs in Presto and Roll the
Bones are very good even if not as good as those in earlier albums. Like
a lot of other Rush fans, I feel that some songs like Bravado, The Pass,
Heresy and Scars have a lot of intelligent and realistic lyrics in them,not
to mention the excellent music. I really hope that NP,GL and AL never quit.

<A NAME="625006">Subject:      multiple comments on NMS 623</A>

In Yesterday's NMS I once again read an article attacking the band
for not answering questions on their music.  We are very lucky to get
any answers out of them at all.  Artists are not required to explain
their work.  There is no reason for them to.  Part of the bueaty of
art is that it means different things to different people.  Who ever
heard of someone like Shakespere answering questions about the
symbolism of his works.  Part of the enjoyment of art is the subtile
meanings and expressions that one finds and is able to analyze in the
art.  We have to rely more on our own ideas and understandings of
works rather than being spoon-fed by the creator.  It is arrogant
presumption on our part to assume that the creator of a work of art
will be willing to take away from the mystery of the work.   Each
person that listens to a Rush song will have a differant personal
idea as to what the song means.  There is nothing to say that any one
person is right about what they believe even if it is differant from
what Neil has meant something to be understood as.  That is just the
nature of art be it literature, paintings, or music.  We each have to
interpret each peice of art for ourselves and find our personal
understandings of the work to understand the true meaning of it.

Also for the guy who said Rush should have quit after HYF I have one
question.  Have you ever really listened to Roll the Bones.  Granted
that Presto was not a stellar album as Rush goes but RTB was one of
the best albums released by Rush.  RTB had some of the more intense
lyrics of any of the Rush albums.  The music was also of a differant
style that interwove inself into the music to produce what in my
opinion was one of their better albums.

I am also looking for a way to get a hold of the Over the Europe
boot.  Anyone with info please e-mail me.

   Well here's a list of who wrote the lyrics to all the Rush songs ever
released from Rush/Rush to RTB.  Of course only songs which actually contain
lyrics were included and there are still 102 different songs to date!  Here's
the list both by number of songs written and percentage of songs written.

  Author(s)                     # of songs   % of songs   Remarks

_______________________________________________________________________________
Total                             102         100.1

If you count all the songs that Neil Peart even had a hand in then he's
responsible for an amazing 86.4% of Rush's songs.  So there you have it, stick
those numbers in your pipe and smoke 'em.  Later....

I have to disagree. It is exactly by writing with a strong vocabulary
(and superior intelligence) that Neil achieves what he does. Everyone
has his or her own style, and everyone should write in a way that comes
naturally. I personally think that Neil's lyrics are, within their own
form, of as high a quality as the writings of the better playwrights of
history achieved in _their_ form. I wouldn't say the same for Bruce.

Alright folks,

    I am a little disgruntled at the extreme morality being shown about 'the
project'. There are people writing in saying "don't do it unless we get
permission". We won't ofcourse, but that is another matter. I just have one
question to ask these people :

Have you _NEVER, EVER_ made a copy of an album or something for somebody and
given them the tape??

If you _have_ then you can't condemn the project. It is simply on a larger
scale. No profit, limited exclusive distribution. 1 friend, 5 friends, 1400
friends....what's the difference? There are MANY BL's out on the streets
actually making profit for people and yet you probably BUY those! MUCH higher
distribution. I think some consistency in attitudes would be appropriate at
this point.
    My vote is doit and I'll get one. I have nothing out here in OZ and rather
than buy 9 or 10 from the states I'd love it all in one album with heaps of
the rare stuff!

    What else. Oh yeah, 4th member. I think I MIGHT be happy if the fourth
member was ONLY on stage for live performances and it was a KNOWN member of
the team already like Hugh Syme. Hey! Does anyone know if Skip can play
keyboards? HAHA! Those are my personal conditions... otherwise it would change
the band IMHO.

Not me. Neil has made his views on this subject pretty
clear. He, the dude on drums, rights the lyrics, and we the
fans buy the albums. That (and the odd ticket sale) is the
sum and total of what the band owes us. He would (almost
certainly) feel bad if an album or tour was bad, since he
does owe us a good performance for our money. But he's never
promised to tell us what he means- he's made it amply clear
that he *won't*.

Now, I would agree it would be great if he did want to say
more about what he meant, but I would not say he owes us.

Am I the only person who is somewhat dismayed that Peter Collins is
producing the new Rush album?  I liked the "middle Rush" period which he
produced, but I think it's a big step backward... also, adding a fourth

	As far as I know, all Presto CD's have the spine printed opposite
all the other Rush CD's.  This really annoyed the hell out of me, and after
awhile I got so fed up that I dismantled the jewel case, cut the spine off,
and taped it back on the RIGHT way.  Now it looks just fine and I can really

G'Day!!

    3 things I think. Shit, I've got to remember what they were now!
    Oh yeah:

_Dreams_: I had one about 2 years ago. I'd just read Visions and I dreamt that
I was talking to the boyz in a small room and they were all sitting down
EXACTLY like in the photo of Yehudi Menuhin in Visions! Except _I_ was
Yehudi! I was asking Neil some stuff about drumming and he offered me a few
personal lessons. F**K it was AMAZING talking to the guys!!!! (Not really
though I guess!). Anyway, then the alarm went off I think....damn..damn..damn

Videos:     I just got a copy of Chronicles from out local import shop (we
have ONE in Sydney called Utopia and I don't know WHAT I'd do without it).
Anyway, there I was all phsyched up to see the worlds greatest band ACTUALLY
PLAY (no gigs out here in OZ guys!) and I was AMAZED! Who the HELL did these
videos??? Struth! There are only TWO good videos on the whole thing. The rest
are just appalling. Big Money is good and I reckon Mystic Rhythms is a work of
art - *perfevt* for the song, but the REST are just terrible. "Time Stands
Still" was just RUINED by the video - it was FUNNY! Here I am trying to get my
friends to take Rush seriously and THAT comes out!! God forbid! Limelight is
OK, and that's about all. I was seriously dissappointed. What were the vids
from RTB and Presto like? Better I hope.

Perfect ALbum side :

    HERE HERE!!

    **HEMISPHERES** side 1 is _PERFECT_
    It is Rush all over in one smooth hit. My vote.

OK guys,
Sorry to bag the vids but I was let down. Comments appreciated. MHO only...

Hey folks - how are the bones rolling, for 'ya?

A question to the good readership of the NMS:  People state that they wish to
support/bitch  about the reinstatement/dropping of either Peter Collins/Rupert
Hine/Terry Brown.  (select statement to suit taste.  Void where prohibited.
Toll if any,...Persons must be 18 years or older or younger, may not appear
as shown, ....batteries not included.)

There have been many people stating their visceral opinion on the existence of
now Mr. Collins being the producer for the upcoming album.  There has been
much bad blood spilt over the exit of Hine.  People want to go back in time, to
a Teensian Brunsian state of mind.

Why?

If there are any recording producers out there can they provide a ray of
enlightenment as to what qualities are good or bad with all or any of Rush's
(sorry for the grammer error - Rushs')  material?  Anybody else want to
take up this thread.

There has been much discussed in passing, but little  content showing us what 
do you expect.

Let the conversation begin.....

Ken's right--the Presto CD sticks out like a sore thumb (to me at least)
because it's the only one with the printing on the spine reversed. I think
someone is playing a vicious trick by doing that.

I think Rob Capra is also correct--at 4:10 in Vital Signs it definitely
sounds like Geddy slips up and says "evalate."

Bill Sharp made a couple of good calls: there is no belching in The Camera
Eye, but rather some English chaps greeting each other; and the Rutsey
proposal was a riot.

I got my T-shirt the other day and was quite psyched. I assume Red Lenses
(and the Mars quote) if off GUP (or RUSH) because those are the only two CDs
I don't have (besides the live ones)--is this the case?

That damn Presto spine drove me crazy...all out of whack with the
rest of my carefully arranged Rush CDs.  The solution, in case anyone
wants to try it is to remove the black plastic insert in the case,
and the remove the paper cover backing which is serrated where the
spine of the CD is. Tear the serrations, flip the narrow piece of
paper around, and either place a small piece of tape on the inside to
hold it together, ot a small piece of that yellow tack poster hanging
stuff will work as well. Then carefully place the black plastic
CD holder back in (being careful not to "crush" the turned-around
spine) and presot (no pun intended :-) you have a properly-aligned
CD!

   Although there seem to have been a rash of surveys recently this is one
that I think is fairly necessary.  I know of several people (myself) included
who want to buy Rush boots but are wary of quality.  The CD Bootleg list
supplied by Meg is extremely helpful but still a little vague on actual
sound quality ratings as well as some other things.  It's been suggested to
me that I might conduct a survey of people that actually own these discs as
to what they think of them.  Heck if you get twenty opinions it's certainly
better than one or none!  Thus, here is a short survey of boots.  Note that
by filling this out you aren't actually admitting that you would do anything
so illegal as to own these albums, just that you've heard them or heard about
them somewhere.  :)  Please fill it out for any and all boots you have heard
by Rush and send to me.  Thanks!  I post the results in about a week or so
depending on how many responses I get.

-----Bootleg Survey-----
Please rate the following on a scale of 1-10 so a numerical average can be
found for all categories and a rating established.

Sound Quality - including quality of music, background noise, static, etc...

Accuracy of Recording - missing part of songs (intro, middle, or finish)

Likability - kinda arbitrary but would you consider it a must have for Rush
             fans (10) or not worth it in the slightest (1)

If you wish just send a quick note with the title and the ratings for the
three categories such as SQ-7, AR-8, L-4.  Thanks again.  You're help will
be appreciated by Rush fans everywhere!

       [ Why not just send it here to syrinx?  Where Meg can add it to
	 the bootleg list file?  That way people can ftp all the information.
	 So maybe folks can just mail meg@syrinx.umd.edu :rush-mgr ]

Granted, I am not an expert on drum corps performance.  I am a drummer,
however, and I would like to defend "rock drummers", who have been accused
of an inability to play corps material cleanly.  Perhaps Neil Peart has
not had the 16-hour per day training needed to play every possible
combination of notes which might appear in corps music, but he certainly
could hold his own.  Also keep in mind that Mr. Peart has been playing
drums for approximately 25 years.  Compare that to just nine as a drum
corps performer.  Secondly, I would like to name a couple of "rock"
drummers who I am sure would be up to the challenge of drum corps material.
The first is Carl Palmer.  I just came back from an ELP show in Detroit
and, after seeing Mr. Palmer perform twice now, I must say that he has
fierce chops and knows plenty of stroke combinations.  Another would be
Bill Bruford.  He may not play his stroke combinations on snare, but if
you listen to his rock/jazz/fusion work in various groups, you'll
discover that he could also hold his own, despite his admitted "weak
left hand."  Lastly, I want to mention a drummer who could certainly
handle any drum corps work -- Steve Gadd.  I would consider him a jazz
drummer, but since he's worked with a fair share of rock artists, such as
Paul Simon, it is possible to put him it the rock category.  Gadd was in
drum corps and has applied it to every aspect of his drumming.  Listen to
"Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover" or his work on Chick Corea's Leprechaun
for examples.  So, even though the best rock drummers may not be Pipe
Band drumming experts, they certainly have the experience and chops to
play at that level.  I'm sure they wouldn't, though, considering they
would have to wear those rediculous "little drummer boy" uniforms.

You know, I have liked Rush for quite a while now and I like them for the
music they play. All the guys are great personally, I met them backstage
at the RTB show in Minneapolis. But getting to my point, I dont want to
sound mean or anything but here's the deal:

	Who really cares if they add a 4th player? We don't have any say
in their decision. Right? Well, I believe they will do what is right for them. 
We cannot do anything about their decision. I'm sure whatever they do it will 
sound good and be good. And we will deal with it. If you are a TRUE Rush fan
you really won't judge their decision wrongly. And if you are not a
TRUE fan and they do what you dont want them to do, then just quit listening.
I'll accept whatever change if any, that they make, and like their new stuff.
And I'm sure quite a few good fans would agree with what I've said.

Sorry for being such a crab but it needed to be done.:)

Going on, I'm just curious, does anybody have any official dates on
when the new vinyl is coming out and if they are going to do a small
incognito club tour to brush up on everything before the big one?

Thanks, and that's all folks:)

I think that if Rush needs a new team player, it would be a new sound
engineer!  I have all the albums in Record and CD format, and all
their albums (except for MP, and AFTK) are extremely badly recorded.
Listen to all the background noise in the beginning of LVS.  How about
how bad HYF sounds?  The CD seems without life.  GUP could have a better
recording, thats for sure.  How about PW (One of my favorites) the CD (or
record) are way to bassy and waffle.  Compare any Rush album to the
Dark Side of the Moon (pink floyd) and you will see what I'm talking about.
I'm not comparing the music itself, but how the recorded music sounds!

Does anyone agree with me? Any comments or refutals?
I think the Mobile Fidelity People (of gold CDs fame) should remaster
PW and hemispheres, along with the whole catalog!

Power Windows only seems to sound good through a good stereo or walkman!

Please post concerning this topic since is something that has
bothered me for a long time!

<A NAME="625021">Subject: Jumping on the 'Neil ain't best' bandwagon</A>

Jello!

DOWN SOAPBOX

Just wanted to jump on the Neil bandwagon...

About Neil's drumming ability.  No argument can be made against
the fact that Neil is a damn good drummer.  That's a given.  But
he isn't anywhere near the best.  People, of course, have already
mentioned in these pages the other countless drummers that "are
better" than Neil (someone *finally* mentioned Manu Katche!!).
*BUT* the one thing no one's mentioned yet (at least I don't think
so) is the *profound influence* he's had on drumming.  Let me
elaborate on that.  Most of the top drummers -- Steve Smith,
Manu Katche, Greg Bissonette, Steve Gadd, Peter Erskine, Dave
Weckl, etc. have had some form of *formal training*.  That's a
large part of the reason why they're so good.  Look at the
influence they've had in the drumming community.
	Neil, on the other hand, has had, in his entire life,
*a year and a half* of formal training, and that was when he
first started playing!  Look at the influence he's had in the
drumming community.
	Very few players (that I'm aware of) have had *that much*
impact in drumming with so little/no formal training.  You could
defintely find a few -- wasn't Buddy Rich one of those; he started
playing when he was 4, I believe (??).  But there aren't that many,
compared to the "formally trained" drummers.  I think that, in
itself, is a testament to his ability and creativity.  Like I said,
he isn't the best, but he's done damn well, considering.
	On a final note, mention was made of the Buddy Rich Memorial
Scholarship Concert tapes.  Tape 3 doesn't show him well, but I
watched Marvin "Smitty" Smith's solo and compared t to Neil's on
Tape 4.  Technically, Smith's solo is much superior (is it possible
for a human being to move that fast??!!).  But, to be honest, I
found it boring and devoid of life.  It came across to me as being
presumptuous, like he was trying to prove he could play faster than
all the rest of us pathetic percussionists.  His duet with Steve
Smith was great (*love* those funk grooves!), though, but his solo
was just...boring!  Neil's was so much more fun, and maybe I'm being
biased, but he was playing *rhythm* -- it was just so much more down
to earth.  The man knew where he was and he knew his limits and he
wasn't about to pretend any different.  He knows where he stands with
those guys.  And that, *in itself*, is a testament to his
*character*.

sorry for the long-winded passage.  Just had to get if off me chest.

Speaking of which: That mumbling on Camera Eye is "'allo" and
"a'right guv'" which an American probably wouldn't know, as
you have to know the cockney accent. Hang around in London
for a bit, chat with a cabbie (what am I saying? (-: ) and
you may hear this phrase. If you watch the UK TV police series
The Sweeney (re-runs only, it's from the 70s), or the two films,
you'll *definitely* hear it! I'm a Londoner BTW. A'right guv'?

No doubt Rush have also heard it, on one of their visits. What I'd
like to know is, what's being said at the beginning? It sounds like
"that's true" but I think there may be something just before that.

The bell you hear at the end is Big Ben. Another London ref.

Hi all,

it is ages since I last posted so I thought I'd add my few pounds sterling.
First of all this thing about producers and PW/HYF vs Presto/RTB.  I must
say I was most surprised to see post after post saying how much they like
Peter Colins albums and dislike the Rupert Hine stuff.  I feel like I need
to be Mr Cygnus here and bring back some balance!  I find the sound of Presto
quite refreshing and RTB for that matter and find both albums far more
compulsive than Power Windows for example.  The over-produced sound that
Peter Colins seems so fond of I find rather dull. Oh well, I'm still looking
forward to the new one a great deal, time will tell....  maybee after the gap
from Colins they will be able to combine the best of both worlds, eh?

Now onto the other bits....

Fourth memeber? - Get real.
As for Mike <MWEINTR@american.edu> suggesting the 4th member may be a bass
player - very funny, ha ha.  Mind you I'd be right behind you in the (long)
queue at the auditions :-)

Which brings me on to Geds basses:  Christopher Dean suggested that he played
a Fender jazz on MP. Is this right?  The album sleve etc shows him still with
the old and faithful Rick.  Just Wondered.

Burps in the Camera Eye?  Best transcription so far goes to :

CMSGBULLIMOR@VAX.LIVERPOOL-JOHN-MOORES.AC.UK (good name that!)

with:

"Hello"    -  Southern English, Middle class, Home counties accent.
"Mornin Guv" - Cockney barra boy "in it!"

I heard this one as clear as a bell on my old cassette version let alone
on CD.  Maybe the attempts at sterotype English accents are so good only us
Brits can understand ?????

Ok, I can't just leave this 4th member stuff without making some comment. I
don't think they should add a fourth member. If they do, I'll still listen
to them. If they don't, I'll still listen to them. What difference does it
make, they know more than I do about it.

Look, about The Camera Eye and the belch :-). The first guy says "'ello"
which is not an uncommon greeting, although such permutations as "hi" and
"greets" are frankly a lot more common, and the 2nd says "mornin' guv" in an
overdone Cockney accent. Anybody who says that, even around here, is liable
to get laughed at. We're taking ROTFL material here.

Many comments have been made reguarding a 4th member being added to
the current lineup. I'd like to add my 2% of a dollar.
I've followed RUSH for more years than I spent in school.
Several concert programs and albums mention "Jack Secret".
Jack Secret is the little guy backstage who loads keyboard patches,
Samples and prepares the keyboards for Ged to trigger. During the
Roll the Bones concert in Salt Lake City, Onstage with the trio
was a 4th person, with keyboards, busily doing something.
Did this detract from the show? NO! It was hard to tell
what he was up to, because I had the worst seats in the house.
So to sum it up, RUSH have used a 4th for years! Perhaps not
in the writing stages but certainly in the performances.

As to females who enjoy RUSH, my wife has seen almost as many
shows as I have, and is always among the first to buy the latest
disks(perhaps this is due to my prompting?!).

And finally, I believe that the youngest RUSH fans must also
live under my roof. Every time we get into my truck, my 3 and 5
year old DAUGHTERS yell put on ROLL THE BONES! They even sing
along. Maybe I'll play 2112 next!

Anyhow, sorry to ramble on but it's always cool to communicate
with so many RUSH fanatics!

Well, near as I can tell (from interviews and listening closely),
he used the Jazz on select songs prior to MP.  I haven't heard anything
like the Rick-o-sound (the name Rickenbacker gives their stereo output
on the 4001) since Signals.  He's said he still has ALL of his basses,
including the `teardrop' modified Fender (picture in ATWAS), but really
enjoys recording and playing live with the Wals.

As far as MP goes, I think Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, and The Camera Eye
sound Rickish, but this could be my personal bias, and/or studio effects...

Wonder what we'll hear on the new album!?!?

I remember when P/G was released, I definitely thought I heard a

that the similarity was the fact that both groups had incorporated a Reggae
beat in some of their music. Examples that come to mind immediately are
"Spirits In The Material World" by The Police, and "The Enemy Within" from

Everything is opinion.  If Peart wants to leave it up to us, let him.
Plus the fact, he probably gets asked the same questions all of the time
and is probably sick of answering them.  You would too, most likely...

DFB3B0BE:
You're complaining about the reaction from "The Convention Organizer".  You
act like we appointed him to this title or something and he should be "above"
these things!  He's just another NMS'er like all of us that happened to be
generous enough to volunteer to try to get this convention off the ground.  He
has as much a right as anyone to tell you that you're ridiculous in thinking
that Neil has a responsibility to explain his lyrics to us.

Hi there...

	Not to belabor a "meaningless" little detail or
anything...but I had always thought that the people talking at the
very end of ATWAS were AUDIENCE MEMBERS (rather than RUSH).  It
sounds like they say "WOW!  What a show!  Man oh man, I guess that's
it!"...

	Does this sound resonable?  It might not ACTUALLY be audience
members (perhaps it is really a couple of crew mambers)...but I
thought that was what they were trying to get the feel of...you
know...the enthusiastic audience reluctantly leaving the hall after
the show.

	Feedback?
