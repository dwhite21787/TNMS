What's this i'm hearing about Lee and Lifeson not being able to write good
lyrics......

example...hey, baby, let's get closer to the heart....TNMS 1086....

Well....just remember, Lee wrote the lyrics for "Different Strings" and that
song is one of my favorites....and Lifeson wrote the lyrics for "Lessons"
off of 2112.  There's nothing wrong with the lyrics in either of these
songs!!!!  It might be that Peart might have a little more of a philosophical
mind than L and L, but they ALL can write lyrics.......

<A NAME="1089001">Subject: Apology/CP Video/Geddy's Pick</A>

Hello all,

	First, I'd like to apologize for misleading any of you.  I had posted
that Rush was writing right now and would release an album in the fall but
probably winter.  Well, that turns out to be wrong.  It wasn't a rumor, though.
I DID get my info in late Feb. from Val Azzoli, pres. of Atlantic.

	In reference to Gina's post, I have the CP video.  It is, by far, the
best boot video I've ever seen.  There are times when they placed a frozen
frame in places where, I hypothesize, the recorder stopped to watch the show
(first verse of Dreamline, first couple minutes of The Rhythm Method).  The
audio is on the whole time, however.  It has great sound and the guy had great
seats.  He was a steady camera-handler, as well.  It's definitely
worth...finding on the street...yeah, that's it, finding! :)

	Finally, there has been some stuff about Geddy using a pick.  Well, no,
Geddy never learned how to use a pick properly - for the bass.  What we're
forgetting is that Geddy is a guitar player as well.  Remember the ol'
doubleneck??  I would imagine, when he had to switch to rhythm guitar, he used
a pick.  I may be wrong - I never saw any of those shows.  Ok, waiting for some
of you dinosaurs to refute this! :)

	That's 'bout it for now.  Again, sorry for the inaccurate album post, I
thought it was credible. :(

I see no reason why you can't be a good Christian and a Rush fan either.
I personally happen to be a practicing Catholic and a practicing
Rushoholic.  Liking a group's musical talent and appreciating their
lyrics doesn't mean you have to agree with their political/social views.
It simply means you appreciate their ability to write and play music.
(Cringing in terror from all the flames about to come for that remark)
And I will be the first to say that they are about the best in the business
when it comes to writing and playing.  But I digress.  Appreciating
Rush is actually *very* Christian, because it is appreciating the boys'
God-given abilities and talents which are being put to proper use -
omnia ad maioram gloriam Dei.

<A NAME="1089003">Subject: Re: 04/18/95 - The National Midnight Sta</A>

Hey, everybody!

   In NMS #1085, Arvid Hokanson wrote about the complaints of Rush overkill
on Canadian radio,  saying that he can't really see these complaints of
"too much of a good thing".  Speaking as one who has burned out on
played-out Rush masterpieces like "The Spirit of Radio", "Closer to the
Heart", and of course, "Tom Sawyer" (I await the flames.), as well as
classics like the Stones' "Satisfaction", I have to respectfully disagree.
You can have way too much of a good thing.  Hearing the same songs over and
over again from a band that has such a vast and diverse catalog is kind of
depressing.  My examples are all great songs, but why can't program
directors dig out the more obscure, and in my possibly biased opinion,
better, songs like "Between the Wheels", "Losing It", or "Lock and Key"?
They play nearly forgotten Black Sabbath and Rainbow songs like "Heaven and
Hell" and "The Man on the Silver Mountain", why not "Mystic Rhythms" or
"Available Light"?

   Arvid did point out that this Canadian station played a lot of Rush,
which I guess implies the songs which aren't quite American radio fare get
some air time.   There's another problem of overexposure.  I listen to at
least one Rush disc a day.  But when I turn on the radio, I want some
variety.  Hearing the same band on the same station more than two or three
times a day doesn't constitute a variety, IMHO.

   I'm sorry if my tone seems hostile.  I just had to share my thoughts on
the matter.  I'm not usually this acerbic! :)

   Well, that wraps it up.  It's been groovy.

Hi friends!

I have been resisting the temptation to tell this story, but after reading
about Puanani's friend's friend's friend Neil in TNMS #1082, I've decided to
give in.  So here goes...

You may recall that during Major League Baseball spring training 1993 (or was
it some other year, they all run together) Geddy took the field with the St.
Louis Cardinals.  It seems that Brynn Smith, then a Cardinal, and Geddy are
good friends.  So what's the point, you may ask.  Well ... Gene Geisleman
(sp?), a trainer for the Cardinals, is a brother-in-law of my best friend
Eric.  I kept bugging Eric to use this connection to get us an audience w/
Ged, or at least get us good seats to the upcomming concert, but he wouldn't,
the bum.  Oh the things that may have been ......

So I guess it is now looking like we won't be seeing a new album until maybe
mid '96 ... I'm soooo depressed.  Ah well, hopefully Alex will give us all
something to cheer about in the near future.

	To the person who said that they saw Geddy's pick in a guitar
magazine...it IS Geddy's pick, as far as I know, but it is not for his bass.
Don't forget that he also plays the guitar on a few songs, like Xanadu, where he
plays the 12-string.  But I don't think he has EVER used anything but his
fingers on his bass.  briaN M eichorN

Well, both have used Moogs, although I'm not sure about Geddy using
a PolyMoog. I always thought that Keith Emerson's sound was equally
represented by a Hammond organ. He also used Yamaha keyboards (intro
to Fanfare for a Common man). Geddy has used Oberheim equipment for
a long time (see Visions) including the OB8 (Subdivisions?). Also
he used a Roland Jupiter 8 in the Signals era, and a PPG for p/g.
 I've no idea what he uses now, but I suspect there are a few
samplers (Akai, as Neil has used perhaps) hidden away backstage.

I don't disagree with you though. It's just that the sounds produced
are from many other instruments than Moog's. It's a shame that Geddy
doesn't seem to still be using the Mini Moog, live at least.

This is all from memory, so if I've got anything wrong, I'm sorry,
but on the whole I think it's right.

Thanks
James

<A NAME="1089012">Subject: lyric similarities</A>

The recent thread on similar musical passages in Rush songs and songs
of other bands leads me to note an instance of parallel lyrics.  Has
anyone ever noticed the similarity between the chorus to "Territories"
and the lyrics in Paul Simon's "The Boy in the Bubble" from the
*Graceland* album?  Both albums came out within a month of each other
so it's not an issue of intentional copying.  However it is fascinating
that two of the best lyricists in rock (Roger Waters is #3) hit on the
same themes at the same time.

"The whole wide world / an endless universe
But we keep looking through the eyeglass in reverse"

NP

"The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in the corner of the sky"

Hi all. I know this is a bit old - but with Spring Break, I've been backed\
up on my reading..
Anyway - In reply to the Christian Rush fan subject..
I'm Roman Catholic... In fact, I'm the stereotypical Roman Catholic
12 years of Catholic school, Irish/Italian ancestors...
Big families (except mine.. sigh.. )
schoolteacher mom.. I mean, geez.. what else could there be?
Anyway, I'm a HUGE Rush fan.. (I just spent my tax refund on a CD of Power
Windows, b/c I dint have a copy of it.)
I don't really find anything wrong with any of theirt lyrics.. I remember
being in school and hearing about them being Satanic... But, the star symbol
is not Satanic (you have to flip it, I tihnk ,m for it to be satanic)
Freewill, of all things, is my favorite song.. -
and because i don'y believe in predestination, Roll The Bones, and Freewill
have a lot of meaning for me.. not necessarily the meaning Neil had in mind.
but, in a way.. If we didn't interpret te songs to our own lives, well
then the songs wouldn't mean as much...
I don't think Roll The Bones is about leaving things up to chance as much
as it is working with what you've been given... (regardless of how you believe
you got it) and I things Freewill isn't necessarily saying religion is bad..
but saying, if you're going to believe in something, at least make sure you
believe in it b/c you want to, not because you're afraid, or b/c you want to
go to heaven..
geez - boy can I prattle..

The fact is that Mr. Peart is quite an intelligent person, and is rather

that he writes as well as he does.

The conversation about 'The Trees' has been going on ever since this
newsletter has been posted.  The lyrics have an  impact on most people
that listen to it, and because most people want to let their opinions be
known (why else do we have them?), this makes it a popular topic for
discussion that is probably not going to stop anytime soon.  For those
that are annoyed with the constant "trees" thread, just press whatever
keys are necessary to skip the offending posts.  This is, lest we forget,
a forum for thought and discussion, and no matter how annoyed you or I
may get, the right of speech does prevail (BTW, I, too, am tiring of
constant "Tree"-hugging discussion).

Now I will step down off my box of Tide...

Ah, but Alex and Geddy *do* still have input!  Remember *these* classic

   " ????? !"  -- Geddy, ESL (La Villa Strangiato)

   "One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball"  -- Geddy

I guess Neil hasn't *quite* had the impact we'd all like to THINK he did..

Hi Rush fans,

This is bothering me also, Cygnus.  When I saw Rush for the first and only
time on the CP tour (sorry, it took me awhile to see the light), I was
amazed at how it seemed that everything I heard was somehow played on the
stage.  I never liked bands that use a lot of overdubbing on the albums,
although Rush does it also. (I'm beginning to realize that overdubbing is
necessary to make an album sound good and that it's not bad to use the
technology we have.)  The fact that Rush writes all their own music and can
play it all without anybody else filling in really gave me a great
appreciation for them.  If I find out that somebody was backstage playing a
keyboard, I will not only lose some respect for Rush (although it will be
easy to gain it back), but I'll have to eat the words I said when praising
Rush to non-Rush fans.  I would also appreciate any information anybody else
has on this subject.

<A NAME="1089024">Subject: lyrical literary references</A>

Just a few additions to Corey Harbaugh's list of lyrical references:

The title of the song "Anthem" is borrowed from Rand.

"Entre Nous" is a phrase used several times by Gail Wynand in Rand's
novel *The Fountainhead*

"In the Mood" is of course a famous big band tune (Glen Miller)

"The Spirit of Radio" lifts the last verse from Paul Simon's lyrics to
"The Sound of Silence"

"Between the Wheels" refers to "Brother can you spare..." which is from
"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?" a depression-era song I believe

Lastly, and most obviously, "Red Lenses" which borrows the title of
this very forum from that mysterious Canadian TV show referred to in
the FAQ :).

Two quick points:
1) bravo to Will Collier's tribute album suggestions (in 4/20)!
2) rush-mgr:  even though you got snippy with my recent long and only
slightly Rush-oriented post  a couple of issues ago (deservedly so
in retrospect), my compliments on running an efficient, civil, and

In answer to the post about the ride cymbal: Neil probably uses an 20" Avedis
Zildjian ride cymbal. Either that or he uses an A Custom, of probably the same
size. I'll betcha that he does use more than jone, seeing how his ride patterns
have a wide variety of tonal qualities. At any rate, you can find out exactly
what he used on the Counterparts album by reading a copy, I think that it's
either the Dec, Jan, or Feb, issue (1994) of Modern Drummer.

By-Tor and the Snow Cone

Outside the video arcade
Looking for more quarters
My best friend By-Tor is a geek
A real snot-snorter

I see him approach me with something icy cold
A summer snack, crunchy, fruity and bold!

By-Tor and his Snow Cone!
If I walked away right now, they'd be each other's friend!

Across the parking lot I amble really fast
Because I just figured out By-Tor has gas
But I turn around to see him striking a mean pose
His Snow Cone attacks and ices him in the nose

By-Tor and his Snow Cone!
Square for battle -- let the fray begin!!

[imagine lots of horrid battle music here, with Neil on kazoo
representing By-Tor and Geddy's distorted Rick representing the Snow Cone]

Snow Cone is victorious!
No more geeks in the arcade
Let's go ba-ack!

Actually, Witch Hunt was a song that they never played on the Moving
Pirctures tour.  (As a matter of fact they didn't play it until the
P/G tour, if I remember correctly.)  The reason for this was that
it was supposed to be a studio piece not meant to play live
because they used a lot of keyboards and Neil double tracked his
drums.  Later on, after the Fear trilogy was complete (and the
technology was developed to allow them to play this song as a three
piece) they played it live.

I don't think they play Presto live because of the way Alex's guitar
abruptly switches from electric to acoustic guitar.  Now there are
guitars coming out that have both an electric pickup in them and an
"acoustic" pickup so that a player can switch sounds instantly.  Now
that technology has "caught up" maybe they will add the song!

Ernest Hemingway made heavy use of the phrase "grace under pressure"
and, if I remember correctly, also spoke of the "lost generation" after
WWI ("lost generation" from Between the Wheels). Both fairly questionable,
but could be construed as allusions to Hemingway.
