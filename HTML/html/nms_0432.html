<A NAME="432001">Subject: Oh man where have I been.....</A>

	Evening all, though I should be doing my work, I decided to catch up
on the NMS.  I also learned that one does not unsubscribe from the NMS over a
college break, because you never have any idea what will be going on when you
come back.

	I love everyone's T-shirt ideas, has anyone suggested "Rush-mgr:
Working Man does Marathon Mission not for Big Money, but of Freewill? You Bet
Your Life!" Cheezy, but accurate.  Kudos to Dave our Rush-mgr!! :)

	Also, last friday Subdivisions, a Rush cover band, played here at
Clark.  They weren't half bad (not the real McCoy, but got my fix), they
played the spectrum, from Working Man to Where's My Thing?, musically I gave
them an A-/B+, but the kid sure wasn't Geddy singing though.  Frank's little
review column recommends the show.

	Til next time, farewell where ever you fare...

	Frank.

Count me in for a T-shirt.  Didn't the RTB shirts leave a lot to be desired?
The concert was awesome, but I'm beginning to think that Rush should tour
without an opening band, like Yes did last summer.  And finally, this
newsletter SHREADS!

<A NAME="432004">Subject: Cassette Poll II - Update IV</A>

Over the weekend I made a rough compilation of the poll and so far things are
getting interesting. I have received 100 different song titles but I am looking
for at least 150 to 200, if it is possible.  I am still taking lists and will
be taking them for the next couple of weeks.  I should have the final results
sometime around the first or second week of March.  Remember, I need 20 to 25
of your all-time favorite Rush songs so I can compile them into a boxset of
50 to 75 songs.  I would like to hear, if possible, from all 1200+ members

Here's the addresses to send the lists

cschwabe@unix.cis.pitt.edu

Thank you for your support

<A NAME="432005">Subject: Send the Band a Complimentary Shirt</A>

With all the recent talk about an NMS shirt, I was wondering if anyone had 
thought of sending Alex, Geddy and Neil complimentary copies.  I realize 
that potential copyright and legal hassles might mean that this isn't a good 
idea, but hey, they'd probably get a rise out of it.  Who knows, Neil might 
even make a bandana out of it.

<A NAME="432306">From: mpickwick@lynx.northeastern.edu!</A>

Just wanted to add my 2 cents toward the t-shirts.  I think the
tabloid idea is definitely a go from what ive been reading but as
far as the stories/gossip for the front page goes i think that
someone (hopefully one of the three t-shirt volunteers) should
collect all the ideas floating around and have a vote.  This way
everyone could add their 0.02.
As for me, I like the star with  "THE NATIONAL MIDNIGHT STAR"
wrapped around it and the barcode with 1001001.  Also on the back
I think the best ideas have been either the cities/places from
songs like Bankok or Cygnus X-1 or Marc Kazigian's idea for
			NMS World Tour
			     2112
followed by all (or at least as many as will fit) the servers.

Well I think my 0.02 are about up, so keep rollin' dem bones.

	Hi there!  After reading the million or so posts in the last few
issues about the NMS shirt, I can't keep up with who's doing what and when.
So, whenever the shirt gets done, will whoever's distributing them please post
the relevant info?  I'd like to get one, but I'm going to wait until I see the
"FOR SALE" sign (or whatever) letting me know finally what's up.  Thanks.

Maybe we could meet and have a few beers or something!!

Keep up the good work Dave!!

Does anyone know if The Body Electric has ever been done live??

<A NAME="432009">Subject:      The journey -- from a sad man !</A>

       Hello all !!!!!
       First of all, I'd like to thanks all of you who porposed some
kind of help for this distant and upset man from Brazil. Believe, I'm
touched. It's great to see how the RUSH fans are like a "mafia".
I'm sure we have a communitary spirit at TNMS. As we have heard somewhere,
"It's one for all, and all for one". We are the real Priests of the Syrinx
Temples too !!!!!
       Well, the matter is that I'm having problem in getting the passport
here. As I said to James ?, there's a lot of burocracy. And... I don't know
if I'll get it in time to go to FL. The second problem, If I got the fuc**
passport, it's going to be really difficult to get the authorization from
the US embassy. They make a lot of restriction for young people, because
they suspect it's just a excuse to stay in the US for a long time working
and living ilegaly. I'm 19, and I studing at the university here, but
they say it's not enough. I'm not married and don't have a job.I think
it would be enough. The third and main problem, is that I would have
some money help from my father, but... he gave up. Please, don't ask
his excuse. I don't want to remember that!!!!!
       Well, in the next mail, I'll confirm if the travel is possible
or not.
       Again, I'd like to thank our RUSH-MGR and all of you from FL.
       Sorry my confuse english and ...
    ...If some of you have some interest in Brazil -- without any kind
of prejudices --, I'll have great plesure in exchange ideas and culture.
       Your distant friend,
                           Mauricio Alves.

PS.: If I don't have the possibility to go, me and my friends here in
     Brazil are planning to write to SRO or Anthem to, at least,
     make the guyz know that they have a lot of fan here, and also
     they would feel and meke great concerts here !!!!

Yo People,
Well, I'm all for an NMS t-shirt myself, 'cause I'm always looking
for new ways to snaz up my wardrobe :^)!
In any case, would we get hit with a lawsuit if we made slight of hand
(or in this case slight of shirt) references to Rush?

For example, the shirt could say: "RUSH over to your computer and subscribe"
or something like that.

	I just happen to be glancing at my MP cover when I noticed something
I had never seen before. I have the CD, and in between the letters U and R
in the word PICTURES at the top there is this little white thing. It looks
kinda like a spike/nail/screw but I can't really tell. It may even be some
sort of imperfection in either my copy or the original but it kinda looks
like it should be there. Anyone else have this? If so what is it and why
is it there? Why ask why?

[ On my original-release album (remember those?), there is no mark there.

Anyone:

	I've already seen Rush twice this tour, but it still isn't enough.  If
anyone knows of any dates of when they'll be on the East Coast, could
they please send them to me.  I would greatly appreciate it.

[ See the additional tour dates listed by Jimmy Lang in this issue.  Also,
  the original list of dates is at the anonymous ftp archive on Syrinx.
  The file is "rush/special/rtb.tour.dates".                    :rush-mgr ]

Crushed and Losing My Hair,
