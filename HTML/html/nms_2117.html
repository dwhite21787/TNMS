Looks like the 1978 CD will be "enhanced", although I haven't heard exactly
WHAT will be on it... we also now have a small image of the album cover
on the NMS web site, check it out!

I'm compiling a list of rock radio stations that should be (or already are)
playing tracks from DS. If you have heard ANY track from DS on your local
radio station, send me email! I should have the list up tomorrow. I'm also
making a message board for release parties or other Rush-related things
going on (which includes any local radio album releases). I've been collecting
a few from the digest, if you're having one, know of one, or want to do one
LET ME KNOW!

This is My first time posting to the The National Midnight Star. I must say
that the TNMS is the Best Rush Site on The Web. I am totally excited about
Different Stages. I also think the song list is excellent. I had the pleasure
of Meeting Alex and Ged at the Jones Beach Theater on the Test For Echo Tour
on June 25, 1997. They were very down to earth and it was a moment that I will
never ever forget.It was my 35th  Rush show since May of 1980 when I saw them
for the first time at Nassau Colisieum during the Permanent Waves tour. Rush
must have been reading my mind because before I went to the TFE opening night
at the Knickerbocker in Albany I was saying that the 2 songs that I would most
love to hear was 2112 and Natural Science when they played them that night it
was an incredible moment for me as a long time  Rush Fan. I was also lucky to
Hear Time and Motion which was my favorite tune off of Test for Echo.
                             I hope that the Different Stages Video thats due
out in December has 2112 on it. We shall see.. Last but not least, I want to
thank Alex,Ged and Neil for all the years of great Albums and tours.I truly am
proud of being a Rush fan and I always have been since 1978 when I was at a
friends house and I was looking through his album collection and saw the cover
to Caress of Steel . He told me the Album was not that good. I put it on his
turntable and cranked up the Volume and from the opening Riff of Bastille day
I was hooked Immediatly. I used to always play Rush at My parties at My Mom
and Dads House when they were away and slowly but surely my friends came
around and realized that Rush Rocked.I am just as excited about a new Rush
Release now as when I was 15 years old and I thinks thats what makes Rush so
special to me .I am married now and I have two children and I still listen to
Rush all the time. Rush is the best and always will be to me. I wish much
happiness and good health to all my fellow Rush Fans.Take care!!!!!!

<A NAME="2117003">Subject: Alex could learn from Eddy</A>

Listen to the opening guitar on "Without You," track 2 on Van Halen's
latest album, 
Van Halen III.  When I heard this song for the first time through my
headphones, it raised the hair on my arms and sent a chill down my back. 
Van Halen's not forgotten his roots in rock.  He's not afraid of that
raw, ballsey sound the true fans know and appreciate.  

When Counterparts was released, Geddy boasted in a radio interview that
the album was more raw than the latest two or three releases; and he
spoke truly.  Yet, the only really, really raw guitar I hear on
Counterparts is on Cold Fire, and a little on Between Sun and Moon.  

Eddy and Alex are close in age, and they've both lasted in the music
business for close to the same number of years.  Why is it that Eddy had
the balls to get back to his roots on his latest album, with a raw, down
to earth sound, while Rush softens with every album?  What the hell's
happened to Rush?  Are they getting old?  I know they're a progressive
band.  They did manage to pull out of that wimpish, overproduced 
Hold Your Fire/Presto/Roll the Bones phase and get back to rock and roll.
 Still, theraw power of the electric guitar is lost somewhat after it
goes through the engineer's panel.  
Listen to the amplifier noise on Van Halen III's  "Without You"
(3:29-3:49).  Not only does it defy tradition for a studio album, it
makes a statement: get back to the basics. Eddy's never been afraid to
make a studio album sound a little dirty.  He's made a pilgrimage back to
the band's roots and paid tribute to originality with a
rawness that is a pleasure to listen to.  Listen to "Fire in the Hole" on
the same album. 
That guitar sound kicks butt. 

Alex, you branched out on Victor with a worthy effort.  Can you please
inject the band with some testosterone in your next studio effort
(assuming there is one) and go out with a real bang?

Hey all,
	Just imagine, three CD's to play air drums to. Maybe it's me, but
after I bought AWIP (I play guitar and keys), I found that on certain
songs I also switch to the traditional grip when playing the air drums. I
also realized that other songs not on T4E, I switch back to the matched
grip. 

Anything similar out there in inter-thingie land?

     Michael O. Shannon wrote in TNMS #2115: "Hi, (etc...)...." ;)
     
     To Michael et al ->  I, too am on For Badgeholders Only, the Zeppelin 
     mailing list, and I share Michael's observations of the principal 
     topics on each respective list.
     
     While every group and artist may have their own following, we cannot 
     escape the many intertwining relationships that exist within the 
     close-knit family of rock n' roll.  This is why we frequently see 
     mention of a group's influences, or other artists they have performed 
     with, etc.  Moreso than Rush, these threads are discussed quite 
     frequently on FBO, perhaps because Zep has influenced a wider base of 
     musicians.
     
     Here on TNMS, I enjoy seeing the mention of other groups that are 
     influenced by Rush (many of whom I had never heard of before, but 
     after seeing their names a few times, I may consider giving them a 
     listen).  I also enjoy seeing discussions of who influenced Rush, both 
     in their earlier days (bands like Zep), and even today... (let's not 
     be closed minded and think for a minute that even The Boys work in a 
     cultural vacuum - where do they get their ideas for their sounds and 
     themes?)
     
     I think we can all agree that Rush, like the other classic groups 
     Michael mentioned, hold their own place in the history of rock (even 
     if they may get snubbed by the RnRHoF).
     
     Cheers,
     John

Hey Rushians,

I anticipated this situation:  U2 GH coming out
the same day as Rush' Different Stages.  So.....
I planned....but then Atlantic pushes Rush back.
That's fine.  Honestly, I could never buy one set 
over the other.....really.  Both Rush and U2 are seriously
the best ever.

Forget Bruce Springsteen (until later)....and all those
other November releases......jeez.

So what exactly is the official title of the new album?  Is it DIFFERENT 
STAGES or DIFFERENT STAGES * LIVE?  Only Atlantic is calling it 
DIFFERENT STAGES * LIVE and you'd think they'd the be right but their 
track listing is off slightly ("The Analog Kid" isn't listed) so they're 
not really on the ball.  Hell, their link to the NMS is wrong too!  The 
album graphic however clearly states "Different Stages * Live".

   [ The full title of the album is "Differest Stages Live".     : rush-mgr ]
     
Thanks to everyone who's visited my Rush page, especially those who've

Rushians,

In preparation for the upcoming listening party in Las Cruces, NM, I had
the opportunity to speak with the PR rep for Rush at SRO/Anthem
Entertaiment.  I learned some interesting things.

1.  There will be some enchanced cd material on one of the DS discs.

2.  There will be no CD-ROM Rush release.  If there is to be a "History"
type item for release, it will be on DVD and it won't be released for some
time.

3.  The PR rep said there was to be no video release for at least a year.
The earliest date for live video release would be sometime next year close
to Christmas.

These items all come from the SRO/Anthem Entertainment office in Toronto.

If it is such an idiotic argument (frankly), then why is the industry
standard to fill up every bit of possible space when issuing Best Of
packages.  The precedent has been set and if a label does not live up to
that, then they deserve to be slammed.  Besides, when did compilation
albums  comprised wholly of old material begin to incur lots of
production costs, artistic creativity, performance, and studio time.  As
the buyers, we are in control.  If you do not put out a package that
pleases me, then I will not buy your stuff.  I still feel ripped off.

I know many bands do this (Dream Theater, Metallica, and many others)
because , from what I have heard from other people, if you live in Japan,
you can often get a U.S. import at a cheaper price than the copy of the
Japanese press.  Therefore, they have to try to create some kind of
incentive to buy the Japanese version.  Since "Made in Japan" doesn't work,
they usually include a bonus track or two.  Unfortunately for people like
you and me, we would like to have the version with the bonus track. 
Depending on how soon I can get it and at what price, I'm seriously
considering trying to get this Japanese import.  Although I have already
have three different live versions of "Force Ten" (ASOH + two boots), it's
one of my faves, so I can listen to it over and over.  I also loved the
transition from "Natural Science" to "Force Ten" on the TFE tour.

To whom it may concern,
	All right, I know I need some Rush content, but I wanted to clear this
up.  Alan Clark DID NOT play in Bruford's band.  It was John Clark.  As
a matter of fact, the liner notes for the album list him as "The Unknown
John Clark".
	Rush content, Rush content.  What can I put in for Rush content.  Ah,
yes.  Some people have made the suggestion that because of the U2 and
the Bruce Springsteen box sets to be released at about the same time, it
could deflate sales of "Different Stages".  I don't think so.  Sooner of
later individuals will go out and by DS.  So the first week or two might
be slow, but what about long term sales?  ASOF and ESL still sell. 
Besides, how many Rush fans are going to pass up DS for the Boss or the
Dublin Quartet?  I doubt there will be any.

   he tried to adhere to his definition of a good show.
   
   Great music. A lively crowd. And a powerful sound system.
   
   The formula may not be easy to fill for any band, but in this case,
   Lee managed to gather enough material for three discs worth of live
   performances.
   
   "Usually performances are marked by me if it's a good one, or not a
   good one," said bassist-vocalist Lee, 45, (born Gary Lee Weinrib). A
   good show, he explained, has "got to be a combination of three things:
   us playing well, the crowd being receptive and the venue being
   responsive to the sound of the band."
   
   Packed with Rush favorites, the album centers on the band's
   technically precise renditions of such rocking Rush radio hits as
   "Closer to the Heart," "Tom Sawyer" and "Freewill."
   
   Culled from the threesome's 1997 tour of America, with a disc
   featuring material from a 1978 concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon
   thrown in as a bonus, Different Stages should provide relief for Rush
   fans who need a fix while waiting for the band to release its next
   batch of new songs.

[ Interesting how articles about new Rush releases tend to imply that they
  merely play to the devotees without attracting new fans.  -- Gautam ]
   
   Packed with Rush favorites, the album -- to be released Nov. 17 --
   centers on the band's technically precise renditions of such rocking
   Rush radio hits as "Closer to the Heart," "Tom Sawyer" and "Freewill."

[ Nov. 17?  Atlantic's still saying Nov. 10.  -- G ]
   
   Lee said that listening to material that spanned 20 years made him
   acutely aware of the evolution of Rush's progressive rock sound, as
   they grew from a spare power-trio approach to the more textural work
   that marks such recent albums as the 1993 release Counterparts and
   their latest issue, 1996's Test For Echo.
   
   The later material is represented on the live LPs with songs such as
   "Driven" and "Dog Years."

[ When did they play Dog Years live?  Stupid reporter.  -- G ]
   
   "The foundation of our sound is quite solidly three-piece, but as time
   has gone on, that three-piece format has [expanded] to a four-, five-,
   six- or 20-piece from time to time," Lee said . "So the nice thing
   about doing the Hammersmith album first was that it clued us back into
   the power-trio aspect of our sound that always seemed to be at the
   core."
   
   To accentuate the basic sound forged by Lee and his band mates --
   guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart -- producer Paul
   Northfield (Ozzy Osborne, Alice Cooper) abandoned standard production
   techniques.

[ I was under the impression that Northfield co-produced Different Stages
  with Geddy.  -- G ]
   
   "We wanted to keep it as close to a concert as we could," Northfield
   said, "and to that end, we mixed it in quite an interesting way, with
   guitar on left, bass on right and drums in the middle, instead of
   putting the bass in the middle, which is usually the better way to mix
   because low-end tends to sound better like that. It gave us a really
   wide stereo and keeps it very distinctive."
   
   With three discs and 31 songs (including all seven segments of the
   rock epic "2112"), the size of Different Stages approaches record
   proportions. Few releases, especially live ones, have ever been as
   lengthy.
   
   But that should not prevent Rush devotees from purchasing the trio of
   discs, said Cindy Maxwell, rock-editor of the trade-magazine Radio &
   Records.
   
   "Nothing comes to mind as far as a three-CD release," Maxwell said .
   "I'm not saying there never was, but I would wager that it's up there
   or among a handful. There certainly is viability for the Rush fan to
   own this CD. There's a lot of rabid Rush-heads out there. It makes
   sense to me to take advantage of that."
   
   Although the bonus live-disc, recorded at the 3,000-seat Hammersmith
   Odeon, helped determine the direction of the album, Northfield said
   Lee had disliked the tape so much 20 years ago that he'd squirreled it
   away in his basement.
   
   "At the time, he was not happy with it," Northfield said. "He wasn't
   feeling good about the way he was singing. But in retrospect, when he
   dug it out 20 years later, he thought it sounded great.
   
   "Because I think he had a little laryngitis when he was doing it, he
   was uncomfortable, but with 20 years' hindsight, it sounds great."

Brian, I have good news for you!  I placed a pre-order for two of these jems

have been quite happy with their service.  You can even sign up to receive a 
semi-weekly emailing that warns of upcoming releases from around the world.  
This is the section that they currently have on their website under 'New 
Releases' regarding the Different Stages release:

RUSH RUSH LIVE (+BONUS TRACKS) 3CDs This version will include 2 exclusive 
tracks as well as the limited LP style sleeve as well as 2 different 
miniaturized tour programs Japan...preorder............54.99

As you can see this will be quite the tasty item to have.  In fact, I think 
I'd better order me a couple more...

By the way, you can find Jart Music's website at:

Simple enough, eh?  Can't whip it with a wet noodle ^_^.  I'm sure there'll 
be other posts regarding where to find this Japanese release, with luck, 
someone may be offering it even cheaper, or information of a German

Your post was completely off-topic and your last comment proves Neil's

And yes, if I might offer my own 2p, getting involved in politics 
is NOT "Rush content", no matter what the views expressed in any

It wouldn't be a short list, because most contributors have the 
intelligence to post about Rush - an internationally relevant

Hi Matt,

I agree with you completely about who assumed control, but I 
WOULDN'T use the 2112 tourbook as supporting evidence!  It was 
written not by the band but by an English journalist called Geoff 
Barton who used to write for a music paper called "Sounds" and
did a lot to help Rush achieve popularity in the UK 21 years ago.
Geoff was an avid supporter of Rush until Hemispheres, which he 
thought was a bit too 'prog-rock' in the Genesis/Yes mould.  In 
fact I remember Geoff interviewing Geddy Lee during the Signals 
tour and asking if they had any plans to do some more "Sword and 
Sorcery" stuff, like Caress of Steel.

Unfortunately Geoff's contribution to the 2112 tourbook suffers 
from a lot of 'artistic licence'.  I think he missed the point 
slightly.  If I remember correctly (and I don't have my tourbook 
here with me at work), in Barton's version, the priests have not 
used their computers for decades, and I don't get the same 
impression from 2112 itself.  It doesn't say "our great 
computers.. fill these hallowed halls (but we don't have them 
switched on)" ..

"This country"? So you know where I am a registered voter do you? Are you

I also urge everyone else to, wherever they are, but I certainly don't

Totally the wrong end of the stick! I think you are a bit blinkered, in

in your elections, we've all got problems of our own - and anyway, we have

     "YYZ" is the flight code of Toronto's International Airport, so if you

     recall hearing Rush talk about the "meaning" of this favourite musical

     of the song.  Once I heard this explanation, I listen to the song a

Well, I heard the first glimpses of Diff Stages yesterday on the drive home.
101.1 WRIF in Detroit played the new version of TSoR to kick off a pair from
Rush on a Two-for-Tuesday (2nd song was Subdivisions).
As soon as I clicked it on I recognized that something was different about the
song, and then remembered that TSoR was the first single from DStages.
Apparently recorded in Chicago (Geddy screams "Awright Chicago!!"), it sounds
great!!  Can't wait.
Just wondering if all of the songs are recorded in different arenas and
chosen based on sound quality, performance, etc, or if the whole album is from
one show??  Wondering if any tracks will be from Grand Rapids or Auburn Hills -
that'd be cool.

Hi Rush-heads:  

Because of the recent acclaim for this Mars 2112 on this list, my wife 
and I decided to visit this restaurant last weekend.  It was an 
incredible experience to sy the least.

First we were greeted at a check in desk, where we requested "two to 
beam up" for dinner.  We then proceeded to the bar, which after the 
first drink suspended our belief of being on Earth.  The menu looks like 
a newspaper, called "Mars Today" looking a lot like "USA Today" in 
format.  The elevators look a lot like transporter rooms from Star 
Trek.

During our meal, we heard reports of uprisings in certain sectors, 
shuttles being cleared for landing, etc. We were very fortunate to meet 
the Empress, who was carried around on a throne-like chair.

The food was surprisingly tasty and generously portioned.  We had 
mussels in a coconut sauce as an appetizer, then my wife had a provolone 
and portobello pizza, I had a burger.  

Afterwards, we transported back to Earth and took the subway home to our 
humble abode, all the while discussing our visit to Mars.

While in Manhattan, New York City, USA, Earth, you can transport to Mars 
next time you're in town.

It is arranged by artist/group in alphabetical order, so for fun I flip

I have lurked on the digest for upwards of two years now.  I look
forward to the digest with each new one.  It has truely helped me and
I would assume most of us keep up with information on the boys.  The
internet has been such a wonderful gift to us.  

Anyways, been a Rush fan since the early 80's.  I have been lucky
enough to see them in concert 20 times since then.  No record for sure
but have thoroughly enjoyed every performance.  I am a classically
trained professional musician so am certainly in tune with fine
performers.  

One of the best parts of the TNMS is that it has helped to turn me on
to some bands that I would have probably never found if I had not read
about them here.  I want to mention a group that I just recently
discovered.  I am not sure if it has been talked about yet on the
digest.  

I have a sattelite dish and get MuchMusic, the Canadian MTV if you
will.  I saw a feature on there a few weeks ago about the band Big
Wreck.  They are a band I believe that is from Philly but moved to
Toronto for exposure.  Maybe it is the other way around.  Can't
remember.  Anyways, I was really impressed with their sound so I
picked up their only release, "In Loving Memeory Of..."  It really
rocks, especially the second track, "That Song."  

I hear influences by many groups, especially Led Zep.  I swear I hear
some Rush influence.  Maybe I just want to hear some Rush influence. 
Either way, I highly recommend it.  

I am eagerly anticipating DS.  Can't wait.  I am interested in seeing
if any tracks were recorded at the concerts I was at on the CP and T4E
tours.  I live in Cincinnati so I hit most of the concerts in the
area, namely Dayton, Columbus, Cincy and Indy.  Anyone know if these
were strictly from the arena sites or do they include the outdoor
venues?  I would assume they get better recordings in the arenas.  

I also want to take this time to thank the Rush-manager for all of the
hard work put in.  I know that I really appreciate it. 

Thanks for letting us voice our opinions.

Many of us remember back in 1981 hearing TSOR live from Exit Stage Left. 
Hearing it today brought back some great memories. 

 Drake and Zeke announced the radio CD release party for Nov. 4th, they 
are planning to play the entire 3CD set!!! They even mentioned that track 
two was 2112 in it's entirity and that 2112 will be the next song to be 
played on the radio. Cool or what? And I thought Memphis stations shunned 
RUSH. Way to go guys!!!

One question....Is there any planned 'national' radio release party, ala 
Test For Echo??

Thanks and hope you all enjoy it as much as I did when I heard it live 
last year.

Mark

I ordered the Different Stages CD from cdnow.com today and chose FedEx
next day delivery so I can get it on the release date.

The total cost is $31.13....

Coincidence?
