I just heard that there is a bootleg of the latest concert call "The Fly"
(no I'm not confused w/ U2).
It's from Italy and it was recorded on   Madison Sq. Garden show.
If anyone has any information on this or other Rush bootlegs, please e-mail me

<A NAME="460004">Subject: assorted</A>

Hmmm...where to start?

Alright.  First, can we not devote any time and energy to a group as
frivolous as Firehouse.  Musically and lyrically, they are the
antithesis of Rush.  Let them do what they want, as far as I'm concerned
they don't matter anyway.

Also, the analyzation of Neil's bandana is getting out of hand.  As has
been said, it looks cool and probably keeps sweat out of his eyes as
well.  Neil and his music are pretty deep, but a gypsy allusion to his
bandana seems to be pushing it.  He just wears one.

As for a boxed set, I believe that the time will come.  Now is not
really appropriate, seeing as they have a few albums left in them.  I
would like to see Rush do the same thing as Queen supposedly has.  Now
that Freddie Mercury has died, I assume the band to be defunct.  In
September, from what I hear, a boxed set is coming out, and I think that
it will be a nice tribute to the band.

Enough venting.

<A NAME="460005">Subject: Free Will</A>

  In TNMS 457 Nick Mascari from Case Western mentioned the Rush tribute band
FREE WILL. I am new to this group so I'm not sure how much he has said about
the band but let me reiterate what he said. They are GREAT!
I have seen them twice (3 times ?) when I was at Kent State Univ. and
including once last winter when the band got snowed in and they were stuck.e
The lead singer (whose name I don't know) said it looked like they were going
to be stuck there for a while so they took a little break then played about 3
or 4 encores. He mentioned that it was the most encores they had ever played.

The band also plays some of their own music and last time I saw them they were
trying to gt people to buy it at the show. I think their stuff is OK but I
don't think anyone goes to hear them for it -- it is their great rush sets that
draws in the people.

The only background I can remember is that I believe they are from Toronto.

If anyone sees them it would be great if you could get a tour schedule for 
them and if anyone hears that they will be here (Seattle area) let me know. 
Also let
us know if Rush is playing any of the summer dates here in Washington!

	Howdy there Rush-o-philes!  Since tons of people seem to have sent off
for Neil's Poster, let me answer some questions about it.  I sent away for the
last one (Presto tour), and it took about six weeks to get it in the mail.
For those who are wondering, this is not the first time Neil's kit has been
photographed for a Poster.  MD had adds for the Presto, HYF, and if I recall
correctly PW drum kits.  (I shuld've started collecting them sooner, ;).)  Now
for all the people who are curious about "the bandana" here's my $.02 worth.
Has anyone seen a recent picture of U2's The Edge?  Haven't seen him w/o a hat
have you.  He's losing his hair, it's natural, and instead of visit Sy and the
gang, he hides it.  Neil could feel that way too, I could also be dead wrong.
Like I said, just on opinion.  Ciao, and roll the bones

	Frank.

Well, the flames I got over Firehouse were a little hasty.  If Rush can name
anything it darn well it pleases, so can Firehouse, or The Beatles, or anyone
for that manner.  Call it Distant Jumping Conclusion or Mystic Ignorance
if you will, but from now on I'll try to think in more sensible terms.
(Thanks to Tero Valkonen, David Sandberg, and others for your two cents.)
I'm sure there are a few Firehouse fans, but to me their formulaic and top-40
ready, and _I DO NOT LIKE THEM._  (I can just see more flames coming, and
they won't be from my hair ;) )

On a much more Rush-oriented note, has anyone (esp. in Canada) got a list
of awards Rush won in the Junos (Canadian Grammies)?  I heard they won quite a
few.  They might not be "The Three Sacred Ones" (as Tero so astutely put it)
but at least they get the recognition they deserve, may it be in this mailing
list or around the world.  (D. Sandberg: I watched the Fountainhead before
spring break and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I got the book too but I didn't get
the chance to read it.  Amazing how one person can stand on his own and have
the ability to make their choices no matter what criticism they might receive
or what others think...)

In the past Neil wore a hat when he had headphones on. This was during songs
such as Red Sector A, that have a sequencer driving the keyboards, or
soetyhing like TimeStandStill which had to be synced to video. Ever wear
headphones and move your head around a lot? THey like to fall off... unless
there's something to take up any excess play... ergo, the hat.

I bet the headband replaces this, and also keeps the brow a bit drier. But
really, WHO CARES?!?

I hope they hit Columbus OH on the summer leg again... I wouldn't mind seeing
them a second time.

<A NAME="460011">Subject: Playing the oldies</A>

Yo.

On the subject of Rush playing their older stuff -- someone paraphrased
what Neil was saying about it, and you got the basic gist of it.  Neil
was saying, and he's mentioned this several times in recent years, that
the band isn't comfortable playing *some* of  the older material because
the songs aren't as exciting to them anymore, or they've outgrown them
(either as songs or the ideas they were getting across). Because of that,
they don't feel they can play them as faithfully as they did before when
the song first came out, or as faithfully as the song itself demands.

If they can't play the songs faithfully, then it's like, as Neil has said
before, "lying" to the audience and to the song.  "Lying" to the song
because they aren't being true to it because they would not play it the
way it *should* be played. "Lying" to the audience meant that, because
of the first aforementioned provision, they'd be lying to the person
who likes that (those) particular song(s) and they don't want to do that
to the song or the person who happens to like that song.

There are times, however, when I REALLY wouldn't mind if they DID lie to
me   :-) , but I wouldn't feel right 'putting them' in that position.

Anyway, I just wanted to add that to what someone (sorry, forgot who it
was) was saying yesterday.  So, I think that's the main reason as to
why they don't play a lot of their older material; I'm sure the other has
to do with not enough time in their set, but, what can i say?...

Not to keep dragging this on, but someone was getting ticked off about
the lack of recognition for Rush -- it makes me think of Alex's guitar
playing -- they're both underrated.  Anyway, to h*ll with people who
don't recognize talent coupled with genuine integrity -- it's their loss.

Hi.

  It seems to me that a lot of people haven't seen the Roll the Bones tour
yet.  Well, do so if you can.  It's great.  I can only say it's great because
it was my first Rush concert.  But I heard from a guy on my BBS (Sybil BBS)
network that he very much enjoyed the show as well.  If I were you, I would
trust his word over mine, since this was his 7th concert.  He was also
privileged enough to see the 2112 tour which produced All the World's a
Stage, one of my very favorites by Rush.

  I picked up an interesting Rush trivia from the previous issue of NMS, and
it was the fact that the first American radio station that played a song from
their first album titled Rush, was WMMS in Cleveland, there is a thank you
note of this on the inside cover of the album.  Very interesting.  But I
still think that the media is ignoring Rush as much as possible.

  I hear a lot about people liking Caress of Steel.  I love the album.  But
it's not one that I listen to every day.  I only listen to the album under
certain circumstances, or a trans of some sort.  The ideology that goes
behind the album is very solid and most interesting.

  But my favorite album is still Fly by Night.  I think the power that is
used to produce the songs on that album is unmatchable by any other band.
Sure, I can see a very talented band redoing By-Tor and Snow Dog, but very
few groups can write songs and music like that.  It takes a significant
amount of energy and thought to come up with such thing.  If someone does
come up with similar songs, I think I would have to really appreciate them
for their talent.

  And finally, I would like to ask anyone who knows the NAMES (NOTE ONLY THE
NAMES) of all the bootlegs that have been made of Rush over the years.

                   [ I hope you let this one go thru ]

[ I know of:   Stellar Dynamics
               Electric Lady(land)
               Fly In The Night  (labeled '80, probably '78 or so)
               Rush-N-Roulette  '79  }  I get these two mixed up - one is
               Russian Roulette  '81 }   Geleen, Holland, the other is Chicago

               Sailing Into Destiny  '83/'81

How about this one??

Being a fan of the Detriot Red Wings, I watch the telecasts on WKBD when I
have the time.  Well, the past couple of games I saw (I do not remember the
dates), I noticed something:  during pauses in the action, the people at Joe
Luis Arena were playing Rush.  During the two times that come to memory, I
heard parts of _Red Sector A_ and _Distant Early Warning_  I don't know...
It just struck me as odd to hear the Boyz during a hockey game.  But then,
I've been accused of insanity more than once. :)

   It's been about a month since I mailed the check to Ludwig, it's been

  a reference to Heartbreak Hill.

Pete MacKenzie asked:

I've been to Irvine Meadows a few times.  It's an open air amphitheater.
There are about 9,000 built-in seats and a patch of grass behind the last
row.  The grass holds another 5,000 or so.  I saw Boston play from the "real" 
seats and the sound was absolutely perfect.  Part of the reason, I'm sure,
was that Tom Sholtz is very picky about sound quality.  I believe Rush tries
to sound their best as well, so this could be a great experience.  I saw
Robert Plant from the lawn and was disappointed.  I don't know if it's that
he's not as particular about his sound or if the acoustics just aren't any
good from the lawn.  I do know that it was difficult to see from there
without constantly shifting positions.  If you go with a friend (rather than
a girl/boyfriend) and don't mind being separated, it might be a good idea to
get there early (like an hour or two before the opening band is supposed to
start) and stake out a spot at the rail and try to sneak down to the built-in
seats during the chaos that erupts as soon as the lights go down.

Another VERY helpful hint:  Park as close to the exit as possible.  I really
want to stress this!  This place is sort of out in the middle of nowhere and
there is only one road leading into the parking lot and after the concert
you can wait a seriously long time to get out if you don't plan ahead.  My
first time there I parked about halfway from the ticket window to the entrance
of the parking lot and it took over two hours to get out!  Park to maximize
your walk and run (or at least walk fast if you don't want to look as stupid)
to your vehicle as soon as the lights come up (and be in shape, because it's
probably between a quarter-mile and a half-mile just from the ticket-taker to
the lawn, not even considering the parking lot) and you can be out of there
in a few minutes.  But if you don't make it right away it can be frustrating.
You really don't want to be merging with 5,000 stoned, tired drivers into
four lanes of traffic.  I saw a dent or two (followed by a fight or two) while
waiting my two hours after Boston.

Bcc:

I can think of one real good reason for Rush to put out a boxed set. I just
recently got a CD player, so instead of me buying all 20 of the CD's right
away (what, at least $300, right?), I could buy the boxed set for $75, and get
most of the classic tunes.

BTW, the version of Xanadu on AFTK is MUCH better than the ESL version!

Here in Mexico I have heard Rush music on some TV shows like baseball
games (when they say "we'll be back after these messages", in spanish
of course), and on some station identifications (like 'You're watching...)
I have heard Red Barchetta, The Big Money, Grand Designs and YYZ, on TV.

About Rush airplay in Mexico, well, I have heard plenty of Rush music in
WFM in Mexico City (they even had a contest, the winner went to Houston
to see the boyz live, everything for free). RTB is often in their "most-
requested" lists.
I have also heard Rush in Energy 99 in Monterrey (Mexico, not California!).
Energia Digital here in Hermosillo thinks that Rush is 'too heavy' for them,
but they give them airplay once in a while. (But I don't care... If I want
to listen to Rush I get 'instant gratification' with my CD player =) )
Now you know.... there are plenty of Rush fans south of the border.

For the final dope on the composition of Kubla Khan (which inspired Xanadu),
I approached James McKusick, Ph.D.  Dr. McKusick is the author of several
books and countless articals about Coleridge and is an internationally known
Coleridge scholar.  He's also a good buddy of mine so I approached him
for the rest of the story.  Here is his response:

For the record, Jim doesn't care much for Xanadu so what the hell can he
know?

    Well had some free time, though I would write in:

<the things RUSH does, it borders on worship, to think that everything they
<do has some symbolic or hidden meaning.  They're just a great band and 3
<normal guys, not gods.

    Since I couldn't have said it better myself, I decided to
    plagiarize Dan. Enough already!

Guy says:

<Sounds pretty interesting. Which gets me thinking, how many of you
<have used words from Rush songs to identify yourself or things you

    No Rush stuff yet! But I do manage 9 VAXstations; Beatle, Stones,
    Thewho, Ledzep, Kinks, Byrds, Zappa, Animal, and Gibson. Sort of
    rock related I guess.
<	Someone told me that the reason RUSH called their new album "Roll

<if any of you had heard this or no more about this.

    hahahahahahahahaha, give me a break!

Jim says:

    At the risk of 1299 people answering this; The album is a
    "cut-out". Done typically if the record company has too many
    albums lying around. It's worth what you paid for it.

hi there NMSers. i just have three things to say:
---i stand by my opinion that spinal tap sounds a bit like rush. not in all
songs, mind you, especially not "bitch school". but give "majesty of rock"
a whirl. it's a tribute to the whole genre (spinal tap joke).

---to the poster who complained about when people give names, initials,
venues, etc without being specific: i totally agree. there's nothing more
frustrating than finding out rush is doing a show and not knowing where the
hell it is. (by the way, WGR is out of buffalo and WCMF is out of
rochester.)

---i was in the burger king on campus the other day (bad, evil me) and you
know how they usually have that really awful pre-taped music? well, colour
me surprised when i heard "bravado"! it wasn't the radio, either. it amused
me to no end.  :)
