I would like to concur with Eric J. Mcclanahan in his assessment of the
nature of the Oaks and the Maples and their relationship together.  As a
horticulturist listening to the song "The Trees", the first thing that
struck me when it states                  "For the Maples want more sunlight
                  And the Oaks ignore their pleas"
was . . . so what?  The Maples grow naturally as an understory tree and
would be perfectly content for the situation to remain the same.  This leads
me to the conclusion that Neil is only using Maples and Oaks to make an
analogy because people are familiar with them and because people have a
pre-conceived notion of Oaks as a mighty, stately tree.  What other species
could oppress a maple?  Therefore, in the song, the Oaks represent the
employer and the Maples the employee, in a working environment.  And of
course, the Maples need something to gripe about, so they complain they need
more light (whether Neil knows they really don't is irrelevent-the point is
they will complain about something anyway).  As a means to an end of getting
more light, they form a union! (Gee, I think it even says so in the
lyrics!).  Now, my interpretation on the ending is that the union that was
formed passed a law requiring both trees to be cut to the same height so
that they could have equal access to sunlight (and that this pruning would
continue on an ongoing basis to maintain that equality).  I believe that the
only reason the trees are shown cut right down in the video is for visual
effect, although doing so would result in the same equality anyway.
IMHO, this song is very simple and straightforward, and most people are
making too much out of it.  I think that most have confused interpreting the
lyrics of the song with trying to figure out Neil's complete opinion on the
subject he is writing about.  Obviously, the song can only say so much, and
I believe there is only one point to the song, if you take it for what it is.

<A NAME="1084001">Subject: Cross Of Holy Fire musings . . .</A>

Hi, y'all.  Hope the April Fools post didn't traumatize too many people.
 Thanks for all the feedback on my "Necromancer" post--there are some really
nice folks out there in TNMS land.

The thread on "the cross of holy fire" got me to thinking.  First of all, I
doubt that Neil had the Klan in mind (and hey, I'm from Alabama--I'm up on
these things <<g>>).  No, seriously, he's said in several interviews that the
song is about Cold War espionage, not domestic (American) troubles.

"Double Agent" is probably my favorite song on the last album (and why not,
ZROCK in Austin previewed it a month before the Cp release), and I really
love the imagery in the lyrics.  I would guess that the "cross of holy fire"
is a metaphor for (to crib a line from Stephen King [and there goes my
highbrow rep]) the White, or rather, the force of good.  (And please, spare
me the PC flames--this has nothing to do with melanin.)

There's an image from one of King's books (sorry, don't remember which one,
or I'd quote it) that keeps coming back to me.  One of the characters, upon
encountering a White (again, King's termanology) Power that could help him
defeat an Evil menace (sorry to be so vague and parenthetical, but there
really is a point here), thinks to himself, this is a Good force, but it is a
Force of such power that it could run over me as easily is it could help me.
 (Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about George Lucas here instead of King).

The (long, rambling) point being, Neil's character in "DA" knows "what's
right", but nonetheless finds himself in a struggle with his own heart.  The
power of Good can be horribly demanding.  It doesn't care about your
feelings, it doesn't care if you have to betray your friends, it just cares
about justice in the big picture, it cares about defeating the Enemy, it
cares about the Many, but individuals are expendable.  The Bright Side of the
Force can be a very cold comfort.

Quite an uncomfortable position, don't you think?  It's no surprise that Neil
found sympathy with the Double Agent, who in the course of pursuing (in his
mind) a greater Good, finds himself commiting small evils against people that
he has come to know intimately in his double life.  But he perserveres to do
his duty (doesn't he?  Hmm, hard to tell--what DID he decide to do at the
end?).  Heady heady stuff stuff indeed indeed.

I really do like that song.  Can ya tell?

<A NAME="1084303">From: Matthew Joseph Desantis <md4l+@andrew.cmu.edu></A>
<A NAME="1084002">Subject: Cover tunes/Praising Rush</A>

Somebody mentioned that they'd like to see

"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding" -by elton john

covered by rush.

And then somebody else said essentially that,
'' rush shouldn't cover other tunes; rush
is three virtuosos; they are above that; '' and other
crap....

First of all, to whoever mentioned 'Funeral for afriend/Love lies',
just let me say that that is one of the best rock songs _ever_ written.
You can preach Floyd and Rush all you want... I'm a big rush fan, but
this song is great.

Second of all, Dee Murray, the bassist for Elton;s band in the 70s,
was a great groover.  He is a bit older than Geddy.  He does not
play as many notes as Geddy, but he grooves right in the pocket, more
than Geddy does.

I would _love to see Rush try to cover this tune.  I can tell you right
now, it would lose its feel.  Rush tunes are rush tunes.

Geddy plays straight, and Neil plays straight. Alex is the only person
that has kept some feeling in his playing.

After I spent 10 years with the keyboard, I moved on to Bass.  I taught
myself by literally emulating all of Ged's bass lines.  (really, its
not that hard if you _enjoy_ listening to Rush and have prior music
experience)  The bass lines are aggressive, but in many instances they
are just runs of notes, all calculated. (maybe an extra fall, or
hammer-on or off thrown in for good measure)

But after a while, once I had learned these tunes, It was time to move on.
Sure I could play the other stuff that was out there, because the Rush
lines were more busy... but I realized that there was more to being a
good bass player then being able to play in less rock-oriented time
signatures like 5 and 7, and being able to play fast.  _Many_ other
bass players have way more feel than Ged ever could.  Many other
drummers have more feel than Neil. Some are better. Many are worse.
It's just like, I got to this point where I wanted to groove better,
I wanted to make as big a musical statement, without being as brash
and busy about it. _That_ is what is challenging.

I know that this is a fans forum, and I still do like Rush.  Every
time they release a new album, I try to learn it.  It is fun to play
along to a Rush tune.   But it is also really important for Rush
fans to realize that there is more than one way to be great at your
instrument.  When I played jazz piano, I used to run into jazz drummers
who would say that Neil was a clown.  I jumped to the defense.  But
now I kind of see why they would say that.  Jazz drumming is even
_more_ technically demanding than Rock. *even Neil's rock drumming*
(I should say _good_ jazz drumming...)  And if you disagree, I can
try to reveal some of the subtleties of Jazz drumming to y'all
and you may see the point...)

What does all of this ranting mean?  Well, if you're a Rush fan,
you listen to some good music. Why not take that a step further
and explore another bass player/drummer/guitarist/synth programmer/player?
There are many that do not come close to the level that you are used
to... but there are a good deal that are at that musical level. And there
are a some who have surpassed it.

hi there!

i've been lurking on NMS for a while now and have enjoyed it very much. i
have just never gotten around posting anything until now.

i got into a discussion with my brother this weekend about an intriguing
topic. it was this:
		what is Geddy's lyrical masterpiece?

we discussed it for some time and came to no conclusion because we were
very tired and still a little drunk, too. i decided to post it for mass
discussion figuring it a pretty good topic. lemme know whatcha think!

this is a reaction to a rather illiterate drummer known as
spod@u.washington.edu

there are few if any drummers that could top Neil's talents.  the one's
you listed have their complex pieces, but have never been able to blend
their complexities with their counterparts (no pun).  In other words they
sound good, but would sound better in a studio alone.  these drummers can
NOT reproduce exactly what was created on a cut so soon after like Neil
can.  and remember, Neil was one of only a VERY SELECT group of drummers
chosen to do a tribute to the GREATEST drummer of our time...Mr. Buddy Rich.
(jazz or big band, no one could make a 4 or 5 piece set sound sooooo
good)  He was hand selected by his daughter no less.

<A NAME="1084005">Subject: Rush and Scientology</A>

>Don't mean to start a flame war, but Rush fans as a general rule are much
>too intelligent and diverse to embrace the loony gobbledygook known as
>Scientology.  L. Ron Hubbard, so the legend goes, started Scientology as a

I'm not sure where this got started, but I have to reply.
I love Rush both for the intellectual side of their lyrics and for their 
unparalled ability as musicians, and like most Rush fans, I consider myself 
to be relatively intelligent and diverse.  I also have some first-hand 
experience with the Scientology religious philosophy and its practices, and I 
would have to say that it is by far the most promising subject ever developed 
that allows a person to actually improve.  I myself have become far more able, 
succesfull, able to think more clearly, and much more musically creative 
through its practices.

Whoever wrote this obviously has no idea what Scientology is about.
I've found that many of the same topics that Niel has explored in his lyrics 
(along with many more) can be found in one form or another in Scientology, 
and they are actually explore much deeper than Neil did  (many questions can 
actually be answered rather than pondered) I would have to think that Rush 
fans, being relatively intellectual-minded people, would not reject an amazing 
new subject such as Scientology on a mere rumor.  Rather, I  think
that they would expore the subject for themselves by reading a book or two 
on the subject ( I would recommend "Dianetics" or "Scientology: Fundamentals 
of Thought") or visiting a local Scientology organization and then deciding 
for themselves if there is merit to Scientology.

Aaron Scifres was curious about "obscure" Rush tunes...how about these?

	1. "Between the Wheels" (_Grace..._):  Possibly the angriest
	    sounding Rush tune I can think of since their earlier days.

	2. "The Camera Eye" (_Moving Pictures_):  I think the only time
	    I heard this on the radio was when I played it on my show.

	3. Side 2 of _Permanent Waves_:  "Entre Nous," "Different Strings,"
	   and "Natural Science."  These have sentimental value; _PW_ was
	   my first album (vinyl, no less), and these are what got me listen-
	   ing in the first place.  Sigh.

	4. "Available Light" (_Presto_):  Can't explain what it is about this
	    one, but it's a perfect end to the record, imo.

	5. "Before and After" (_Rush_):  Possibly my favorite from the debut.

	I'm sure there are others, but this seemed sufficient for now!  :-)

Peter Stewart (among others) had this to offer about openers:

>Opening bands -- I have seen Rush  at least twice on each tour since HYF.  I
>have yet to enjoy an opening act.  This is partly due to my eagerness for the
>Rush set to begin, however, the openers have not been all that good.  It was
>truly painful to sit through Mr. Big.  In fact I ended up walking around the
>perimeter of the Meadowlands Arena for most of their sets.  Unfortunately I
>could still hear them all too well.

	My wife and I saw them multiple times, not by choice.  The last time
	we just wore earplugs and played cribbage.  :-)

>Some wanna be guitar hero whose name escapes me (Vinny something I think)
>opened on the RTB tour (MSG 12/6, 12/7 1991) Once again less than enjoyable.
>I finally learned my lesson and showed up at a quater to nine for the CP tour.

	Vinnie Moore, I believe.  For CP, Primus opened in St. Louis, and my
	friend Andi and I just walked laps 'round the Arena, which was just
	shut down forever.  Rush in the new Kiel Center should be interesting.
	Better acoustics, hopefully.

>Rush should consider doing a tour similar to Yes.  No opener just three solid
>hours of Rush.  This would allow for some of the less well known material to be
>played and really give the fans their money's worth.

	There's an idea.  Saw those shows w/Yes; back in '84, a Bugs Bunny
	cartoon was the opener.

	There has been talk (mostly bad) about Marillion opening for them
	during the _PoW_ tour.  Personally, that was the best opener for
	_ANY_ band I've seen, before or since, with the possible exception
	of Stevie Ray Vaughn (!) opening for the Moody Blues in '83.  In that
	case, SRV blew me away, while I left feeling sorry for the Moodies.
	In any case, I have a tough time understanding why Marillion was
	getting booed and having projectiles launched at them.  For my money,
	Marillion (with Fish) is/was nothing short of phenomenal.  Seeing
	_Misplaced Childhood_ done live and _THEN_ having Rush play on home
	soil (sort of; Montreal) was one of the biggest thrills of my life.
	If people gave them a chance and listened, they might've enjoyed the
	music.  Their music had a lot of the qualities Rush fans look for;
	sharp, impressive musicianship and insightful lyrics.  I feel sorry
	for the band _and_ for the nay-sayers; they both lost in that sense.

	Just my opinion; sorry for babbling.

Jim Lenox noted:

>I still love rush but now the only two albums that I'm not completely sick of
>are Caress of Steel And GuP. Oh well - Enjoy

	This kinda frightens me.  I can't believe that Rush fans don't listen
	to other artists; I know they do, given the knowledge of other bands
	that are cited in this list alone.  I can't imagine listening to one
	band so much that I get sick of them.  I have a friend who essentially
	listened to nothing _but_ Rush, and it drove me insane to ride in his
	truck.  I tried to get him to listen to other things (e.g., Genesis,
	whose _Duke_ tape is playing as I write this), but no soap.  I think
	he _still_ listens to Rush pretty exclusively, although he's branched
	into country, so this upcoming Rush release ought to tickle him pink.
	:-)

Along the same lines (sort of), John Walker listed:

>My personal top 5 guitarists (in no particular order)
>1)  Alex Lifeson ;-)
>2)  Eddie Van Halen
>3)  Gary Moore
>4)  Eric Johnson
>5)  John Sykes/Ty Tabor (tie)

	Not that you asked, but my favorite non-Rush musicians (no particular
	order) include:

	Guitarists:
	1. Richard Thompson (Fairport Convention, Linda Thompson, solo)
	2. Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits, Notting Hillbillies, solo)
	3. Bob Mould (Husker Du, Sugar, solo)
	4. Glenn Phillips (GP Band; has anyone else heard of this guy?)
	5. David Gilmour (Pink Floyd, solo)

	Bassists:
	1. Jaco Pastorius (Weather Report, solo)
	2. Jeff Berlin (Bruford, sessions, solo)
	3. Chris Squire (Yes)
	4. Bill Rea (Glenn Phillips Band)
	5. John Wetton (King Crimson, UK, Asia, others)

	Drummers:
	1. Bill Bruford (Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, solo)
	2. Kenny Aronoff (Mellencamp, sessions)
	3. Keith Moon (Who)

	Any others?  It would be interesting to get an idea of the tastes of
	the readership.  I know there was recently a second fave poll; I'd
	be curious to find out the other musicians that we consider to be on a
	par with Rush, and not necessarily second place!

	Sorry for the long bandwidth!

Hi all,
	Does anyone know the address of the Backstage Club? It was posted 
about a fortnight ago as this:
			2250 Tropicana Avenue,
			Las Vegas,
			NV 89119

But in a recent copy of 'Metal Hammer', it gave the address as;
			951 Toni Avenue,

Have they moved, or is one of these wrong? To save list space, perhaps you 
couldmail me personally (unless anyone else wants to know).
PS - Thanks again to Evan for the .sig help!!

	I'm quite a lurker around here.  I'd say this is my third post
since September sometime.  Anyhoo, I thought I'd just share some comments:

	1)  Cheers to the creators of the recent April Fools Day news
items for Rush.  Absolutely hilarious.  Is there a compilation of those
available anywhere?  Syrinx, perhaps?  I remember reading last year's
"Merely Players" joke release.  Am I the only one who thinks that "Merely
Players" would make a great title, anyway?

	2)  Presto is my most recent addition to my CD collection.  To
all you folks who constantly rip on it:  Thbbt.  I love Presto!  Every
song on the CD offers something to me.  The Pass is without a doubt one
of the most haunting songs I have ever heard, Anagram is simply brilliant
(I love the "for Mongo" bit -- Anybody know if Mel Brooks knows about
that one?), Available Light is gorgeous, Presto sounds really magical . .
I could go on, but won't.  What a great CD.

        Excellent point.  In terms of the broader story, yes, I believe the
ending is optimistic.  But, in terms of the personal story of the budding
guitarist, the ending tragic:  here's a guy who has found a way to create

<A NAME="1084011">Subject: Liberals hate freedom???</A>

My first post- I won't go into the details because I simply want to
answer the post stating that "Liberals hate freedom and capitalism."

The simplicity of thought behind that remark rivals the simplicity of
those who call Peart's (and Rand's) ideas "fascist".  The term "liberal"
as commonly used covers a wide range of views.  Some of these are,
admittedly, capitalism-hating, but many others are not.  As someone who
has read much of Rands work (introduced to her by 2112), I find it to be
thought provoking and true in the sense of individualism it conveys.
However, after much thought and discussion of the issue I don't believe
it to be a viable political or economic system.  That is to say only that
pure free market capitalism creates major problems; capitalism as
practiced in varying degrees by many nations is in my mind the best system.
So, in short, I consider myself a liberal capitalist.

I should add that the this idea of taking part of Rand's ideas while
rejecting others was echoed by Alex and Geddy in a radio interview
although I can't recall which.  Also, one of hte founders of the free
market school of Economics, in the classic "The Road to Serfdom",
suggests in passing a similar view of the need for regulation.  He points
out
the distinction between equality and allowance of opportunity within the
capitalist system while still allowing for regulation.

	Fellow Fans,

I am first responding to Joe(I am 90% sure) who commented that he thought
Neil was/is a bit arrogant.  I just felt like offering a counterpoint.
One thing I thought is that Neil, as with all celeberties is harrased by
fans, clubs, magazines, old friends and aquaintances (remember I
delivered you papers 10 years ago, so can I have tickets?), and lots of
other people.  Also, he probably gets asked the same questions a lot, so
he may have felt the straw that broke the camels back.  Also, Neil as any
normal human being, may have been having a bad day.  Just my thoughts.

Also, has anyone seemed to notice on the homepage(which is excellent :)
that all the newspaper reviews, especially the ones from the L.A. Times
all seem to criticize Rush?  I don't know why they do.  They all seem to
complain of loud noise, repetitive music, no content, no uniqueness and
lots of other ideas.  Anyway just my observation.

Sorry about the length.

<A NAME="1084015">Subject:       A few threads at random...</A>

    Hmmm...   The return of objectivism to the NMS.  (not that it
ever really left).  While I don't want to get into a discussion on
the relative merits of Ayn Rand (I'm outnumbered, and I got so sick
after reading _The Fountainhead_ that I couldn't even start _Atlas
Shrugged_), I do want to make a distinction between Individualism
(of which Neil is unarguably one) and Objectivism (A little
trickier...).  Individualism is a broad (almost vague) concept
centuries old.  Ayn Rand did not invent it.  So every time Neil
writes a song like, say, Cut to the Chase or The Trees, that extols
individualism, it is not automatic that Rand should be given credit
as the inspiration.  Objectivism (to my understanding) is a very
specific, somewhat extreme example of individualism that totally
regects even private altruism and sympathy for those who are at the
bottom rung of society.  Rand was obviously AN influence on Neil
(esp. in his early years), but it is also clear that in his vast body
of experience and reading, he has picked up other influences (Dos
Passos, Tolkien, T.S. Eliot, etc) that also find their way into his
writing.
    Also, I think it is clear that since about MP or Signals (even PW
to an extent), Neil's lyrics have left the more purely philosphical
and delved into the personal realm, where a political\philosopical
author like Rand would have less influence and writers on
relationships and common humanity (Dos Passos and Eliot) would have
more.  So I don't think we are doing Neil's lyrics justice by
reducing his lyrics to a mouthpiece for Rand, when they are far more
complex than that.  (For example, I don't think Rand would care how
that rabbit feels, under your speeding wheels.  She'd probably say
the rabbit deserved it).  :)
    Also, while I admit the lyrics on the first album are rather
lame, Geddy's subsequent lyrics ARE worth study (since he's only
written a few, and those aren't bad)- Different Strings, Cinderella
Man (a fav of mine), Making Memories (I think?)- why not?  He's part
of the band too.  As far as what else he's written, I'm not sure-
being college student, my music funds are limited, and so I have
cheap cassette copies of many Rush albums- many of which have no
lyric credits.
    On the Row The Boats boot (which I've never heard or seen), I was
at that concert (Albany, RTB, 1991 Dec.).  It was my inspiration for
becoming a Rush fanatic.  There's this point at the first song (Force
Ten?  Can't remember) where Geddy stops after the verse and
practically whispers "Feel the Russsssssshhhhhhh.........".  My
favorite Rush moment, and I can't even remember the song!
    On best places to hear Rush- the music makes the difference.  On
my way home (by way of Cornell to visit a friend), I had to kill an
hour in the Philiadelphia Bus Station.  I had an 8 year old Walkman
and a dub of Caress of Steel, and I had a musical ephiphany during
"Fountain of Lamneth".  Just for that moment alone, Caress of Steel
is one of my favorite albums.  Lamneth is amazing intricate, and the
melodies are so powerful!
    Thanks for your indugence.

Regarding Geddy's bass playing:
	While it is true that Geddy's left hand is a mess on the
fingerboard, you can't say that this means he is not a technically good
bassist.  Just listen!  His playing is ALWAYS extremely clean and he can
play faster than most!  What does it matter where his thumb goes or that
his fingers have lots of excess motion?  Also, I've always respected his
decision not to use slapping/popping/tapping or any of those other
effects.  While it may be neccesary for a working studio/session player
to use these techniques to get work, I feel that they are gimmicks and
have no place in at least rock music.  I'm sure that Geddy would be able
to do these techniques if he felt that he wanted to use them in his
music.  I read in an interview with him in Bass Player magazine that he
sometimes likes to mess around with slapping at home, but he isn't very
good at it.  Well, if he was to actually use these techniques oon an
album or tour he would probably get very good at it.
	On a related issue, does anyone else LOVE the bass tone on Roll
The Bones?  To me, this is the ideal sound!  I was a little disappointed
with the bass tone on counterparts.  Presto is good too, but not quite as
full sounding.
	Also, does anyone else HATE Tom Sawyer?  I love every single rush
song (even the ones on the debut album) except tom sawyer.  I just can't
stand it!  I can't put a finger on a particular element that I don't
like, but I just don't enjoy it at all.  Everyone here and on a.m.r seems
to LOVE tom sawyer... am I all alone?  I guess I'm just weird...

<A NAME="1084020">Subject: Peart, Facism and Liberalism</A>

	Several issues ago, some one mentioned that our sainted professor
had been accused of being a facist.  That assertion is simply stupid.  As
any competent political scientist(or any remotely intelligent student of
government) will tell you that the term "facist" has a very specific
meaning.  It refers to a one of the forms of government that values the
state over the individual.  Because facism sees the state as
being superior to the person, it recognizes virtually no limits to its
power.  A facist government uses coercion to control the personal and
economic decisions of the citizens.  A person living in such a state will
find every aspect of his life dictated by the state.  Furthermore, he
will have no recourse, since the supreme arbitor of justice is the the
will of the government.
	Neil's lyrics hardly seem to reflect this view of government.
Songs such as "Freewill", "Bravado" and "Tom Sawyer" all reflect a strong
belief in the sanctity of the individual.  I know of no Rush songs that
glorify the sanctity of the state.  In fact, several songs condemn
tyrannical governments("2112", "Heresy")
	Peart himself has stated that he is a left-wing libertarian.  As
for the left wing part of this statement, I can only guess at the
meaning.  Libertarian, however, is essentially another way of saying
Liberal(large L) or classical liberal.  This is the ideology which holds
that the individual is superior to the state, and that the only legitimate
role of government is to protect from force and fraud.  In other words,
the precise opposite of facism.
	The question then is, "Why would someone say something so stupid?"
The answer is that calling people names is much easier that rationally
refuting their arguments.  When a person such as the reviewer in question
finds himself unable to rebutt(or comprehend) ideas that he finds
challenging, he resorts to hurling epithets in the hopes that his readers
will take his comments at face value, and not bother to probe any more
deeply.  Those readers who are on the same intellectual level as the
writer will read the statement a think, "Neil is a facist, facists are
bad.  I don't like Neil."   Stupidity perpetuated.

I find this interchanging of the words communism and socialism rather
strange! Recent posts have pointed out, that conservatism and fascism
are a million miles apart. Socialism (in Britain at least) is concerned
with distribution of wealth amongst the poorer population of the country.
It was a socialist (Labour party) government, who set up the National
Health Service (free health care for all) in the U.K, and they believe
in free (quality) education for all. They are not trying to make everyone
equal, but they do believe that the wealthier members of society, should
help those who are less fortunate. That is the basis of the British
welfare state, and as far as I'm concerned, communism is a separate
issue!

        Hi all. There's been a Rush cover-band thread going on, and

idea of a Rush tribute album, like Deadicated or Encomium?  There have been
quite a few lately, running the gamut from Kiss My Ass to If I Were A

        OK, I can hear you saying, how could cover versions be any better
than the original?  Well, the point would be that the covers would be
different, not necessarily better.  Lately the STP version of Dancing Days
has been getting air time; I like it, and I like the original.  I don't
know that one is better or not.
        Good idea? Stupid idea? You make the call.

To all these articles concerning facsim and the false perception
of freedom through mainstream "republicanism" (which is a far
cry joke from the support of freedom) there can be a few points
made. To keep things in the bounds of the NMS, Peart can def.
not be called a blind supporter of the  "big corporation" types
that run things now. Instead of big government we are now stuck
with big money- either way it has no soul. Facists are people like
Musollini, Stalin,  and Hitler, who would love to abolish such
a thing as the fourth ammendment (sound familiar?) and at the same
time ban the private ownership of arms. Freedom has never been
a serious issue in the latest political "mainstream" (about as
serious as the comedy called family values).  If all these "wisemen"
and dittoheads were the least bit concerned about America and its
values they could listen to rush and see that its not a liberal
or conservative issue but one of pure freedom and humanism, to make
the point read some songs:

	Tom Sawyer
	Big Money
	Subdivisions
	2112
	Prime Mover
	Alien Shore
	Lock and Key

>...to name a few. And finally the oh-so controversial Trees, many
times has there been a trees discussion on this group. It is clearly a
song about the use of means to enforce a so called "equality" but
in its statement it is inherent of the sad state for the need of
such devices. A metaphor is a comparison and cant be taken literally.
The maples and oaks have been many different people throughout
history and the fact that we look at in the contexts that we have been

        separation of church and state), an individual's right to serve
        their country regardless of their affectional/sexual preferences -
        just name a few - leap to mind).

        obligatory rush content: does anyone know what neil peart's views
        are on issues like these?  or whether his political views in
        general lean to the right or to the left?  i've always liked his
        lyrics, and i've been a dreaded liberal as long as i can remember -
        further, i've never found peart's writing to be the antithesis of
        my own viewpoints.  any thoughts on this?

I don't believe that people who have earned wealth should have it stripped from
them.  I don't believe that Olympic runners should be hobbled so the rest of
us can keep out.  I don't think those of us with sight should be blinded out
of "fairness"

The point is, oaks and maples each have special qualities and they should be
allowed to use them . . . the forest will be better off.

God gave the oaks their height, for whatever reason.  Who are the maples to
take that away.

who said anything about force?  not me.  it was the maples wanted to use
"hatchet, axe and saw" on the Oaks.  If the maples can't live with the oaks,
they should leave in peace.  No maple syrup needs to be shed.

I worked in a sweatshop for *less* than minimum wage for 12 hours a day, 7 days
a week for several months because it was the best job I could get at the time.

with such modesty, you're sure to go far in the world

who are you to judge the deadwood from the fruitful branch.  Are You God?

I'm no racist.  I don't believe in using force.  I don't believe in
forced-segragation and I don't believe in forced-integration.

OK Kids it's time for Dr. Braino!

    Cool Alex solo's? Which ones aren't?! My fave's include:

A Lerxst in Wonderland ( the quintessential Lifeson )
A Fairwell to Kings ( he probably got a speeding ticket for this! )
The Trees ( horribly reproduced live, though )
Limelight ( needs no explanation )
Mission ( reminds me of "the good olde days" )
Kid Gloves ( the whole song is underrated )
Digital Man ( this one, too! )
Between the Wheels ( uhh... it's just cool, OK? )
The Twilight Zone ( squeaky n' scary! )
Dionysus ( dig 'dat crazy slap-back echo! )

and last but certainly not least...

DIFFERENT STRINGS! ( the fact that this solo is so weird and ear twisting
    		     is what makes it so cool. what... you were expecting
    		     something pretty? Lerxst himself expressed lament over
    		     the fact that they faded it out just as he was startin'
    		     wail! )

Also: puanani, you don't have to play guitar to appreciate a good solo!
      If it moves you...it MOVES you!

Gub-bye!
