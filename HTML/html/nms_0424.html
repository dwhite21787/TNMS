<A NAME="424302">From: Guy Kendall <gkendall@ncr-mpd.ftcollins.NCR.COM></A>

Well, I just got back from a weekend I'll rememeber for the rest of my life.
We drove 10 hours from Colorado Springs, Colorado to Las Cruces, New Mexico
to see the show. After arriving on Friday night, we decided to go find the
Pan Am Center (where the concert was to be). When we got there there was
a bunch of tour buses and trucks so we decided to pull up and wander around.
We figured they were just setting up, but when we stepped out of the car,
we were treated to the pleasant sounds of Rush rocking the place down.
Since this was the first show in this leg of the tour I guess they decided
to have a dress rehearsal. We sat outside for a few hours enjoying a great
jam session. It was unbelievable. I think the coolest part was hearing them
talk and even mess up. Geddy messed up the lyrics to Tom Sawyer and said
"Woops...wrong verse." And later he started speaking the lyrics a verse
of Tom Sawyer. It was really cool to something you don't hear in the real
concert.

After the show we followed the tour bus back to the Hilton where they were
staying. A few guys got their autographs as they pulled up, but we just
missed them. They we walked in the hotel and realized that Alex and a
bunch of people he was with walked into the bar in the hotel. About 8 of
us fans walked in and sat down at a table about 5 feet away from Alex.
After sitting around for about 1.5 hours, drinking beer with the other
fans in complete amazement that this was happening to us I decided to
approach him for an autograph when I saw him giving autographs to a couple
of girls that walked up. He was very cool about it, and gave me his
autograph...he even tried to steal my pen. :-)

Alex was just sitting around talking like any regular guy the whole night.
One of the other fans there had a Roll the Bones tape with him, so we got
the DJ to play Ghost of a Chance as our tribute to the moment.

My brother (another complete Rush fan) was there with me, but he's only
19 so they wouldn't let him in the bar. We waited for another hour or
more hoping Alex would leave so he could get his autograph. I was sitting
outside of the bar talking to my brother and his friend when we saw Alex
just heading from the bathroom back to the bar, so we missed our chance.
At around 1:15 they still hadn't left, so I was talked into going back
in to see if I could get another autograph for my brother. I went back
in and when there was a break in his conversation (with a guy that might
have been the drummer for Primus, kind of looked like him, not sure
though) I asked him if he would mind signing another one for my brother
who was standing outside of the bar, but not old enough to come it. He
was extremely cool and said "Sure, whats his name?" I said "Kelly" and
he signed my brothers ticket "Hi Kelly. Best regards. Alex Lifeson". Lucky
SOB...I only got his name in my autograph. I said "Thanks a lot. I really
appreciate it." and he said "Your welcome." and that ends the tale of
my meeting Alex Lifeson in a bar.

Didn't get to meet Geddy or Neil this time, but I already met Geddy and
got his autograph at the Power Windows tour in Denver...but thats another
story...

Well, the concert was of course unbelievable but thats been posted here
before so I won't go into that.

The 1400 mile round trip was long, but very well worth it.

    It seems that none of expect Rush to take the Grammy, and I have to agree.
However, in my case it's because I don't think they should.  Of the three
that I have heard, the Allmans' "Kind of Bird" is by far my favourite - however
I REALLY don't expect them to win.  I was shocked to see that they were even
nominated (I did expect Rush, though) but I guess there aren't that many
instrumentals in the pop world so they have to dig a little deeper to find
nominees (sp?).  BTW, what are the rules for this?  Is it only that the song
was released last year, or does it have to have been made (and written) last
year.  Personally, I would have put SRV's "Little Wing" just released on
_The Sky Is Crying_ on the list.  But, hey, that's just me.

<A NAME="424004">Subject:      A public favour -- from the Miami and Orlando area friends.</A>

        Hello all !!!!
        Well, just a short history...
        As soon as RTB was released, I asked a personal favour from our
RUSH-MGR. I asked him to purchase for me the last album. Well, I sent to
him 50 bucks and after 4 weeks I received the package with two CDs: RTB
and ATWAS. I sent the money inside a book -- as I said to him, a souvenier .
As he said, I was for a short time, " the envy of my neighborhood." Someday,
somehow, I'm going to pay this favour. You know, sometimes this world likes
to be so small... I really believe that !!!!
        Well, now I'm asking for another favour, specially to the friends
from Miami and Orlando area. Sometime ago, I asked if RUSH would come to
Brazil. Well, You all must be thought: " How am I going know that!!?? Why
doesn't he send a letter to Anthem or anyone else. What a stupid answer ??"
Well, It really was a little stupid answer. But,there's a phrase which says:
If the mountain doesn't come to Maomeh, Maomeh goes to the mountain !!!!!!!
In this case, I'm Maomeh and the mountain is a RUSH concert !!!!!!! That's
why I'm asking a favour from our "Miamians" friends. I'm planning to go to
Miami to see a RUSH concert. It's more than 2000 miles by plane !!!!!
And believe me, it's nothing to a person who's waiting  more than 10 years
to see a RUSH gig. What I need is the price of the tickets --for two persons--
and if somebody in Miami area could  buy them for me. Another thing is a Motel
or a simple hotel, near the forum, to stay for one week. It can be in Orlando
or in Miami -- I think the dates are February, 27th, 28th and 29 th.
        Well, If somebody in Miami and Orlando area wants to do this great
favour for me, please send me a personal mail, as soon as you can !!!!!
        Pleeeeeaaaaaaasssssseeeeeee !!!!!!! You all in  Miami  and  Orlando !
It's not difficult, is it ??!!! Just a few information and a great favour !!!
It's really import for me, a dream that I thought would never be a reality.

        Please, you from Orlando and Miami area, contact me  !!!!!

        Your distant (early warning) friend... from Brazil ...
                                     Mauricio Alves.

PS: You know you're a RUSH fan when...
    ... you travel more than 2000 miles and spend more than US$ 5000,00
        to see a RUSH concert !!!!!!!

       Hello all.
       Reading the "update" section  from MDM I almost ... ( I have no
words to describe). Mr. Neil Peart said that he recorded the entire album
in only a day and half !!!!!! Or the tunes are too simple or he is a studio
expert drummer. I think, both. But, only one day and half, it's really
a ..., as we say in Brazil, ...ignorance -- pejorative way, of course !!!
Another thing -- when I've read that, I almost got sick -- and I didn't
like that -- it's personal, of course --, is that Neil Peart made some
changes in his drum kit. Now, he's not using two bass drums, but only
one !!!! Using, of course, a double bass drumm pedal. And he put a
floor tom over by the hi-hat. Well, I always have the image of the
double bass drumm im my head, it really seems to be strange. He also made
changes in the toms setup, now he's using smaller ones. I think he's
going to use this setup live, but how's going to be the eletronic setup
and how he's going to play the ancient tunes only he know, of course.
I'm thinking about put the article in the mailing list -- What do you
think about it, RUSH-MGR ????
        Sorry if it was already commented.
        Your distant friend,
                           Mauricio Alves...

   ... looking forward to read news from Miami and Orlando Rushians.

I have been gone for a month, so forgive me if this has come up during
my absence, but I was wondering if there was any new information
on the possibility of a Rush open-air concert somewhere in the upper
Midwest late Spring or Early Summer? I know there have been some
rumor to this effect...any concrete info?

Also, does anybody out there have a decent quality bootleg tape of
CD of a Rush concert which includes "Natural Science?" I have always
wanted to hear this song (one of my favorites) live. Could someone
please e-mail me if they have a copy of this...I would of course
gladly pay for any costs involved. Thanks.

Oh dear ! (Well not realy !) Rush seem to have been somewhat taking their 
inspiration
from Pink Floyd on RTB (Well this is how it seems to me [It's Chemistry ?!])
Let's see :-

Rush : "On A desert highway straight to the heart of the sun......"

On the 1968 Floyd Album "A Saucer full of secrets" there was a song called
  "Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun" !!!

Rush : "We're only at home when we're on the run..."

Well "On The Run" Was a Floyd song on "Darkside Of The Moon"

Rush : "We're only at home when we're on the wing..."

A back-handed refference to "Pigs On Wing" from "Animals" ????

Rush : "It went right by me, just another wall..."

Again a back handed refference to "The Wall" after all the famous Floyd album
and "Open Secrets" do seem to have the same general direction !

Also "Time Stand Still" seems to have the same direction as "Time" from
"Darkside".

But this is hardly supprising as both groups started out in the late sixties
and seem to have a lot in common ! (Well sort of ! [Well I like both groups !])

Had anyone noticed the fact that "Warm memory chip......" could be a backwards
refference to "2112" as ther is (Or was, you can't get em now !) a memory chip
who's number was 2112 !!!!!

Incidentaly, Does anyone know if ther is a U2 Mailing list ????

Has anybody listened to the end of neurotica with the volume turned up ?
If so do you know what somebody shouts right at the end ?

It sounds like stop or snap or something.

Anybody else noticed this ?

Okay, I think we pretty much agree, I was just pointing out that you're
lumping good bands in with the bad.  Bands like Slayer and Megadeth are not
"what the public wants to see"; I don't think either band even has a platinum
album.  And they're certainly not glam-rock, although Megadeth sometimes
refers to themselves (jokingly) as "the glam band of speed metal".

The telling point was when MTV news interviewed Dave Mustaine (of Megadeth),
one of the most intelligent persons in the metal world, and Hammer, one of
the ... hmm, can't think of anything nice to say about him...  Anyway, they
were both interviewed about their feelings about their Grammy nomination.
Hammer, of course, said that he respects all these awards very highly, and
is committed to giving the people what they want; Mustaine, on the other
hand, said that he really couldn't care less about the Grammies, although he
was glad that it showed someone liked their work, and that "it's just one
more thing for my maid to dust off".  (I guess that sounds pretty glib, but
it was an obvious joke.)  Even Kurt Loder was stifling a giggle when they
went back to him.

Are there any awards that are particularly worthwhile, besides things like
Guitar Magazine's "best guitarists" awards?  The Grammies have been stupid
for a while, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is pretty dumb, and even the
Rock awards have gotten silly lately.

Back to Rush, does anyone know if they've been interviewed about the
Grammies?  I'd be very interested in seeing how Neil responds...

Date: Tue, 21 Jan 92 13:09:52 MST

Wow, not much else I can say about this past weekend, but I will try
to elaborate.  Two friends and I drove down from Boulder to Las Cruces,
NM to see the show on Saturday night.  Being three travelers, men of
Boulder, we took the "highway straight to the heart of the sun", which
included "The Pass" (Raton).  Along the way we saw a couple of signs for
"Elephant Butte", which we thought fit with the inside of the RTB cover
quite nicely.  Passing through the secrecy of the desert sand, we made
our way to Las Cruces.  Keeping with the sand motif, we stayed at the
"Dunes Motel", one of those one-story motels that are known for their
price and not much else.  Going back to the motel, I found two police
cars inspecting the premises, increasing my faith in the quality of
the establishment and its occupants.  Anyway, the show was great.  I
believe the set list was the same as previous nights, nothing glaringly
new.  The light show was superb, especially the unfolding ramps shown
near the end of the set.  Geddy was wearing spandex, or something close
to it (That's entertainment!), Neil had the bandana, and Alex was wearing
jeans and a jacket.  The sound was quite good, with the quad speakers
making quite an effect for the drum solo.  Primus was a good opening
act, but I don't think they were well known before the show.  This was
the smallest place I have seen Rush play.  Even our bad seats seemed
closer than usual.  Geddy is still using the same between-song-banter
from the last tour, and seemed at a loss for words while Alex was talking
to his tech.  Alex missed a sample trigger in "The Pass" that was received
by a long stare by Geddy afterward.  Alex also did get kinda lost in his
"Red Barchetta" guitar solo, but managed to find his way back into the tune.
Other than that, I can't remember any other glaring mistakes.  Geddy was
wearing headphone monitors for his vocals, a la Sinead O'Connor, but not
as big or pronounced as her headphones.  All in all a good show once again.

    live (Huntsville AL), Atlanta and Nashville areas are the only
    ones I can consider. All I have heard so far is that there is a
    March 4 date in Atlanta, nothing about ticket sales etc. All help
    would be appreciated. Thanks ahead of time.....

<A NAME="424315">From: ehuffman@NMSU.Edu!</A>

Hello All!

Yes, you heard me right! I met the boys as they were coming out of the Las 
Crucesues Hilton! It was really strange how it happened, though- A friend and 
I were headed to the mall, when we see the bus parked right outside the front
entrance of the the building. We decided it was well worth looking into, so 
we parked and walked up to the bus. They were loading suitcases and golf clubs
into the bottom, so we asked the driver (or someone who appeared to be the 
driver) if the boys were gettting ready to head to the Pan Am Center. The guy
was really cool- he said if we waited a few more minutes we'd be sure to meet
them. He said that Neil had already left, but Geddy and Alex were on their way
down any minute. I thought I was going to die! Surprisingly, my friend and I 
were the only ones there waiting for them. Alex came down first- he was really
cool with us, and actually talked to us for a minute or two while waiting for
Geddy. We wished him good luck, and he sad that we he said that we were good
fans, and hoped we would enjoy the show! Real nice 
guy- and HUGE- much bigger in person than I would have expected. Then Geddy
came down. A bit quieter than Alex was, but just as nice. They both signed two
autographs for each of us (one for both of our boyfriends) and hopped on the
bus. We had the two for our boyfriends framed, and gave them to them right 
before the show. You never saw two happier guys in the entire world- rolling 
on the floor and everything!
  Well the show was just plain incredible! They played really well, and had a
good time on stage. They opened with Force Ten, and went on to Limelight, Dist.
Early Warn., Big Money, Dreamline, Bravado, RTB, GOAC, and Where's my Thing.
Alex played Superconductor with his nose- they played The Pass, and for Tom
Sawyer they brought out the bunnies. They also played Show Dont Tell, Time
Stand Still, Subdivisions, Closer To the Heart, Freewill, and XANADU! (these
are not in any particular order) For the encore they played a twenty min. 
medley that included La Villa, and ended with The Spirit Of Radio. I ended up 
right near the stage for part of it, and had the most excellent time of my 
life! When theye come to Phoenix June 2, I will definately be there. I hope 
Ian B. and Pat P. had a good time too. See ya in Phoenix!

(grumble, grumble...)
	Rush hasn't done anything good since "Not Fade Away".  Everything since
then has been crap.  (grumble)  The best show I ever saw was in 1969 at my high
school prom...they've used too much of that new-fangled "amplification" since
then.  (grumble)  All the covers have sucked, except for the first album.
(grumble)  In my opinion, they should fire Neil Peart and replace him with the
greatest of all drummers, Pete Best.  (grumble)

"for Mongo" means.  I figure it's some sort of anagram, but I couldn't
decipher it.  Does anyone know?  Thanks for yer tyme.

    Does anyone know about a full-length concert video which was

Could this become a collector's item? I haven't kept up with Queen, and am

 Hello there!

   Just a quick question: Does anyone know the origin/literary
source/meaning of the word "Lamneth?" I get the gist of how Neil uses
it, but I'm wondering where he got it. Is it another anagram?...or is
it like "Rocinante," and come from a work of literature? Anyway, I
would be interested in your responses!

and I will probably not have acess to this list for two years.  I
have made many friends over my 2+ years on this list, and I
have traded with many people.  I hope that when I return
this list will be in the dame competant hands.

Because I am so short on time right now, I am puting this request here,
Would everyone who trades with me, of would like to, please send
me a current copy of you list.  I know I won't see it for three months,
but it will at least be there when I get back.  I certainly will
not give up trading for two years.  When I return from boot camp,
I will mail my current list to all of you.

<A NAME="424325">From: sraby@NMSU.Edu!</A>

Well, just saw RUSH down here in Las Cruces.  It was my first time, and
I will never forget it.  I stood right in front of Geddy on the 4th row
floor.  I have never seen 3 more talented people on the same stage.
They were INCREDIBLE and I will never forget their performance.

Anyway, as my subject says, I have a question for people seeing RUSH
in San Antonio.  Does anyone know if there are tickets still available
or does anyone have 2-3 tickets they wish to sell?  I am not concerned
with great seats since it is so late, but I would love to go see them.
I would appreciate greatly any information anyone could give me.

Thanks,

Well Well!!!!
Time is almost here for the bay Area to get it's fill-O-RUSH!!
I'm going to three shows myself. LOTS of radio contests going on right
now. Some lucky bastard just got front row seats for answering a few
simple questions (What are the furry little creatures on the Presto album
cover and how many are there?). They are getting HEAVY airplay as the
countdown commences. AND, surprisingly, there was a very positive, upbeat
article in one of the local Newspaper's Entertainment/Weekend
section(Mercury News Eye). The article is great, written by a dude who
did a telephone interview with Neil.

BUT, as the subject line says, I should be talking about the Toronto
Music Awards that a few fine musicians we know as RUsh walked away with.
Geddy got best bassist, Neil, Best Drummer. And rush was named Most
succesful international band(or something like that). Think the people of
Toronto are proud of them boys? I think so!

Well, just thought I would post this stuff(even though there is probably
going to be a gazillion other posts saying the exact same thing in this
issue of TNMS.     Later!

Neil!  Neil!  Neil!

Man, what a monster he is.  Seems to have beefed up in the arms.  Incredible
power.  The Boyz had a great show.  Geddy said they'd be back in June.

The opening act - Primis - was an odd duck.  "Good evening.  We're Primis and
yes, we suck!"  So said the bassist.  Have to agree.  Very excellent
musicians, but didn't seem to take themselves very seriously.  After the first
song the Forum was ready for them to leave the stage.  I have to pick up one
of their discs though, just to see.  I can tell they were good musicians,
because they hit too many right notes. <~>

KLOS radio in Los Angeles has been conduction the "Super Bowl of Rock & Roll"
for the last couple weeks.  Listeners were invited to call into KLOS and vote
for the band they felt was the best Rock band.  It was wide open to all bands,
present and past.  As of this weekend (25th) it was down to the final four:
Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Pink Floyd and RUSH.

On Super Bowl Sunday it was narrowed down to Led Zeppelin and RUSH.  In the
final tallying, the Boyz won - 4,016 to 3,870 votes.  It's official.  So. Cal.
knows Rush is the best band ever.

Not really a RUSH comment this but:

I have noticed that the NMS mailings seem to take about 24-36 hours to arrive
at
my mailbox here in the UK.  Much of this is taken up by waiting at a mail relay
actually in the UK (NSF RELAY at London university).  Does everyone else from
the UK have the same problem ?

Does anybody know a solution to this ? e.g. routing through alternative relays
