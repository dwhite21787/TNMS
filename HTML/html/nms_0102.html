Hmmm...I once had the sheet music to this song, and the lyrics were a
bit different.  Seems I recall that line as "Beneath the noble birth".
Can anyone tell me what Neil might have meant by the "noble bird"?

[ As the song is written about the United States, I'd say it's safe to
  assume the "noble bird" is the American eagle.  But you know what they
  say about assuming...  :-)                                   :rush-mgr ]

I happened to see both Toronto Rush shows, and the one in Albany, NY too.
It seems to me that the material in all of them was about identical.
The drum solo was longer on the second night in Toronto, but besides
that there were no major surprises.   I thought that they did a really
good job with just about everything, Geddy made a mistake at one point
on the keyboard and kind of made a over exaggerated shrugging with his
shoulders, like he knew he screwed something up.  I liked all three of
the shows, even though the large rabbits weren't a surprise the second
two times around.  I was dissapointed that they didn't play Presto though.

By the way, I just subscribed to NMS this week and think that it is a great
idea, and loved the first one I got (100)

I think that too much is being made out of the "Catch a fish" line. Geddy was
in all likelyhood screwing around with the lyrics, for no particular reason. 
He probably stuck it in because it fit. He's done it before: "One likes to 
believe in the freedom of baseball","We are the plumbers who fix your sinks".
I doubt if there's any deeper reason to it than that.

I saw them at Alpine Valley in Wisconsin.  Being in the third row and hearing
mostly stage noise, I didn't like the sound either.  But I did hear that
it was much better farther back.

I'm starting to wonder if this isn't part of the stage act.  When I saw
them a few years ago in Milwaukee, Alex broke a string right before the
solo to YYZ.  Geddy just carried on with a little longer of a bass solo
and then Alex came in after he got a new guitar.  This is part of the act,
or Alex breaks a hell of a lot of strings at inopportune moments.
When he did it in Milwaukee, the crowd went wild because he kindof made a
big deal about it.  He looked off-stage and held his hands up, like he
was saying "What is this thing around my neck" to let people know his
guitar wasn't working.  Oops, I take that back.  He didn't break a string,
his wireless went out.  I remember him playing for a few seconds with no
sound coming out.  Then he realized it himself and switched guitars.
Rush is just the kind of band that would work something like this into
their show.  They have a sense of humor and do strange things sometimes.
I wouldn't be too surprised if this was intentional.  Maybe they noticed
the crowd reaction when they handled it accidentally one time and decided
to keep it as part of the show.  Notice that two people above thought it
was impressive.  I thought they did a good job of it during YYZ in
Milwaukee.  Who knows?

Yeah, It seems the last time I heard from Karen was about 2 years ago.
I remember she had to leave school for some reason (financial maybe?).
She retained her account at OSU for over a year and a half on the premise
that she would eventually return to school.  She *never* logged into it
after supposedly starting to work off campus.  May be she left Columbus?
Who knows?  All of her (previous) accounts are now gone and I think she's
gone for good. :-( Too bad... The lady really knew her Rush...

On Alex and pedals...  Yes, I also noticed he was triggering background
vocals by foot...  I first noticed it during _Subdivisions_.  You could
barely hear him sing "Subdivisions" at the HYF tour, but at the Presto
tour he was really singing! At least that what it sounded like at first...
A few measures later you realized that it wasn't his voice, it was his
foot...

I was also "lucky" enough to see Alex break a string during YYZ.  It
was really cool hearing Geddy and Neil playing on while Alex switched
guitars... (Sorry Alex...)  It took him a little extra time after
he switched guitars...evidently the guitar the roadie gave him was slightly
out of tune.  He played two notes, shut the volume off, tweaked the tuning
slightly, and then picked up the solo again after a total of about 15
seconds...  What is this? Guitar pitstop timing?  Reminds me of the story
Joe Walsh tells about when he was in the James Gang... "We didn't have
roadies back then... If you broke a guitar string you went to a drum solo...
If you broke a drum head, you went to a guitar solo..."

Todd Oliver (OLIVER_T@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu) mentioned something about Alex's

I saw them in Cincinatti the second time they stopped there on the Presto
tour..  During "Show Don't Tell" on the first chorus, the background vocals
('show me don't tell me') popped in just a bit late..  Sounded an awful lot
like a sample of Ged's voice to me..  and it wouldn't surprise me if Alex
had triggered it (late).  Through the rest of the song that same backing
vocal line sounded dead on the same..  Samplers would be easier to trigger
onstage than a tape would be anyway.  (Not to mention more reliable and
better sounding.)

Other than that little flaw, I thought the show was GREAT, despite my seats
(sigh) and the fact that Ged's bass didn't have enough low end..  There was
a big, big difference between when he played bass and when he/Alex were using
bass pedals instead.  The bass pedals sounded great, the Wal, not-so-great..

Oh well..

Hello all, I've been unable to send outgoing mail for a few months, but the
situation is largely cleared up now.  I have been reading the digests all along
though, thanks to our fearless editor...

My contribution today is this:  Kerry writes that she doesn't think that
"history's debt" refers to the founding of the U.S.  That violent founding is
exactly what I always thought it was referring; "history's debt" being the
independence that we wrested from the rest of the world (the "kingly foe", in
particular) so proudly.  I think the reason it is mentioned is to point out the
possibility that the "cracks" which are appearing in our system could lead to
some sort of revolution, or our downfall, just as we fought against what we saw
as cracks in the Colonial system.  I see the song, therefore, as a warning, as
well as as a portrait.

Greetings Hosers,

I've heard *something* which is either a very filthy rumor or an interesting
bit of trivia.  In either case, I'd like to know whether this is true or not:

1) Neil Peart used to be a very hardcore chain smoker.
2) He got lung cancer.
3) *One* of his lungs had to be removed.
4) He quit smoking.
5) He still kicks butt on the drums.

I know #5 is true, but the rest.....???

Question:  What languages do the Boyz speak besides English? Parlez Francais?
           Anything else?

Question: Where did the term "the Boyz" come from? Some album cover?

Just heard, straight from the horse's mouth..... Bill 'B-Man' Banasiewicz is
working on another Rush book.  I have no idea what he could possibly include
that wasn't in Visions, but who knows.

Concerning the guy who mentioned Alex controlling the background vocals.
The Boyz have always been adamant about controlling everything you hear at a
Rush concert.  Everything you hear that they aren't actually playing, they are
either playing on Taurus pedals or triggering via midi pedals.  The most
amazing aspect of this was when I went to the Presto show in Detroit last March.
I was Stage Left, high up with a great view of everything the Boyz were doing.
I concentrated on Alex during Manhattan Project and watched him trigger all
the violin parts.  I mean, if his cues aren't dead on, the whole song would
fall to pieces.  Amazing stuff.

A little bit o' trivia that occured to me a few days ago... Name a Rush song
besides 'Anagram' that uses Anagrams!!!!  There are only 2 lines in the song
that do.

Well, for what it's worth, my degree was in Geography; specifically
computer cartography.  That sort of puts me 'on the fence', as it were.
I took a lot of physical geography courses (geomorphology, climatology,
etc), some urban studies (yawn) stuff, and several cartography courses.
I also served as a computer lab "first aider" while a student, and now
(when I'm not stuck programming IDEAL on an MVS {just say no!} system)
I'm a general consultant for the University of Maryland Comp. Sci. Center.

Consultant:  One who knows a little about a lot of things; knowing less
             and less about more and more, until they know nothing about
             everything.

Hey,  maybe I should put a little RUSH content in this post?

On the topic of the triggering of sampled sounds in concert ("Subdivisions"),
I read in one of the recent Backstage Club newsletters (Neil) that while
many of their concert sounds are now sampled and stored digitally, *all*
of the sounds you hear are either played or triggered by the three of them.
I believe they can all three trigger certain things; I know Alex does with
his pedals and Neil does with his drum pads - I assume Geddy can from his
keyboards.

One last bit, in reference to flubs on stage (Alex/guitar string), on the 
Moving Pictures tour, Geddy came in (singing) too early on one of the new
songs.  He immediately realized what he'd done, and stopped after uttering
part of the first syllable (sounded like "Uh").  He then immediately re-
made the sound (for fun), then started singing at the correct place.  Just
coincidentally, the large video monitor in the hall was on him as he did it,
so you could see him smile (in a semi-embarassed way).
