Well, it looks like the NMS is uninterrupted after all!  I made the
Philly show w/no trouble, and thanks to Donna/Michael, I had pretty
decent floor seats, right next to the soundboard.  I have to agree 
with most posters, I wasn't impressed with Vinnie, but that's personal
opinion.  Tonight it's Largo!

A quick point:  if you're going to post mentioning the content of a
show from the current tour, PLEASE put the word SPOILER in your subject
line.  People keep asking, but people apparently keep ignoring...  let's
work and play well together, people...

Administrative mail is all caught up, so if you sent something and didn't
get a reply when you expected one, mail me again.  Omissions happen some-
times, but they're not intentional.

Well, for one thing, we now know *officially* that [MC] Geddy is the RTB
rapper.  Thanks, Neil!  8)

I like the way Neil handled himself...from the non-Modern Drummer articles and
interviews that he is in he seems kind of non-eager to talk sometimes.  I
thought he would correct Bob Coburn instantly when Bob said "Neil PERT of
Rush", but Bob made the snappy comment "most of the rock world knows you as
Neil Pert, but I am now informed that you go by [phonetic spelling] PEERT."
To which Neil replied, "I'll answer to either."  From then on I knew he would
be cool for the interview, which was enjoyable to listen to, even if it didn't
break too much ground.

Opinions?

Well, I think all of us Rush funs were enlightened by Mr. Neil Peart's
wonderful words on Rockline last night.  Rockline's host sure kissed his
ass at the end in hopes that he would come back.  Neil is definitely the
greatest rock drummer that ever lived, and he is also one of the most
intelligent people in the limelight.  Neil was very nice to the people
who called in and talked one-on-one with them.  That was surprising,
since Neil usually is quite timid before his fans and doesn't like to
be considered a hero or idol.  Some people who may have thought that he
is arrogant probably have a very different impression now.  He carried
himself humbly, yet with a touch of nobility and prowess.  I nominate
Neil as the next Prime Minister of Canada.

I'm upset about the number of people who post articles about shows
they've seen, listing songs played and otherwise spoiling the show
for those of us who haven't seen it yet.  Believe it or not, some
of us DON'T WANT TO KNOW what will be played in advance at the show.
If you insist on talking about the songs that are played, please
put the word "SPOILER" in the header to warn us in advance.

The idea of the metaphor is to capture something of the subjectivity of
life experiences. As one moves through life small events may seem like
big events as the happen. Compare this with the lines ``Sometimes our big
splashes/ Are just ripples in the pool'' from `Emotion Detector.' Though
in this case I think Neil is warning one to be cautious about letting
certain (perhaps isolated) experiences give one a unrealistic view of
life by virtue of the psychological impact they might have at the
moment. In other words he's saying that one should strive for objectivity
when evaluating life based on personal experience, because the effect
of certain experiences might be, as it were, `rigged' (the way tricks
are rigged).

Howdy Folks,

I was wondering if anyone in Boston headed for the Worcester show on 12/10
would be willing to give a fellow Rush fanatic and his fiancee a lift to
the show. Of course, I would be more than glad to pay expenses! My wallet
got stolen recently and I have no driving license with which to rent a car
(if I could afford one! Rush t-shirts are also necessary expenses!). So
if you wouldn't mind giving a couple of Rush fans a lift, I can pay expenses
and provide lots of RUSH conversation along the way!

Thanks! Gregg (jaeger@buphy.bu.edu)

Actually, 'pear' is pronounced like 'pair', 'Peart' is more of a

Attn all Rushians!

I have recently obtained a number of copies of the first demo by
Rhode Island's Anthem called 'Lost Within the Times'. It has 10
excellent songs which show a strong Rush influence combined with
perhaps a tounch of REO Speedwagon's balladry. I think all Rush
fans would find this display of strong melodies and instrumental
ability of interest. The tape is $3 ($4 for overseas) and be
gotten by writing to -

First of all, I'm glad the rapper is ged!  Pretty cool, like I said, on

 ATTENTION BAY AREA RUSH FANS   ATTENTION BAY AREA RUSH FANS

        In the Rockline broadcast when mentioning tour dates
        they skipped over the bay area!  Why?  Because they are
        not final!  I called KRQR after the show and was told
        that there is some tension between  Rush and Bill Graham
        Presents.  Remember how Rush did not come to the BA for
        the HYF tour, well the same may happen here.

        I talked to a air for brains secretary at BGP and she
        said that they are not doing anything wuth rush and she
        has not heard of any concert (probiblyu the tour or band
        for that matter)  But a friend of mine talked to someone
        negotiating the thing, and they said that they are still
        trying to work it out and that nothing is final so it
        hasn't been announced.

        If we want to see Rush in the bay area let's give BGP
        a call and tell them how much it means to us, and that
        they should stop at nothing to get them,  and have no
        damn general admission, because that's what Bill would
        have wanted, and we all know he was a money hungry bastard!

        Bill Graham Presents  -  415 - 541 - 0800
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        And call information and get the number to SRO/Anthem
        and complain to them if you want to also.

        I'll put it this way!  There is a chance, ever so slight
        that the boys will not be in the bay area this time around
        and we can't live with such a chance, every damn call counts
        Please call!!!!  And if anyone hears anything else let us all
        know!!!

Hi all.

This morning I was surprised and overjoyed to hear RTB come rolling out my
speakers from the radio.  They almost never play Rush in the frozen northland
of Duluth, MN.  Anyway, as I sat enjoying the music I noticed the strangest
thing...  they cut out the rap section of the song... completely!  They just
skipped to the end of the song.

Has anyone ever heard of this happening?  I'm tempted to call them up and ask
them why the hell they did it.

Have a day.   :-|

I noticed this too.
In the Canadian version of the album and CD, the lyric sheet says:
"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice."
In the U.S. version of the album and CD, the lyric sheet says:
"If you choose not to decide, you cannot have made a choice."

It's clear that if you listen to any recorded version of the song
(live or studio) that the Canadian version is correct.

Also, the Canadian version of the album/CD does not have the
"Dewey defeats Truman" headline whited out.

P.S. Enough Crue-bashing!  Comparing Rush and Motley Crue is
pointless, since they have such vastly different approaches.
However,maybe the Crue could teach Rush to loosen up a little,
and Rush could teach the Motleys about musicianship 8-)

On the sports page of our local paper is a comic called "In The
Bleachers."  This comic, drawn by someone named Moore, is similar to
"The Far Side," except that it always has a sports theme.  The 12/2/91
issue may or may not indicate that the author is a Rush fan.

Picture two basketball teams standing around on the court.  Each
player on each team is a skeleton wearing a uniform.  The uniforms of
the teams are identical.  The team captains are playing the
scissors-paper-rock game to determine which team must take off their
shirts.  The caption under the picture is:  "Ha!  Rock smashes
scissors.  OK, we'll take out the ball... oh yeah, and we're 'shirts,'
you guys are 'bones.'"

Coincidence?  I think not...

How about everyone calling in during the Dial MTV hours of the week of Dec.
9-13?  We need to get everyone involved to truly send a message to the
programmers at eMpTyV.  I have only seen portions of the RTB video on two
occasions, and I'm not about to sit around waiting for it when I know that
it will probably never appear again -- unless we do something about it.  So,

In the hustle and rush [sic] of the past few days, I missed the Rockline 
show with Neil.  :-(  If any kind soul is interested in making a copy for
me, could you drop me a line?  I can send a blank tape, or maybe one with
something on it.  ;-)

AdTHANKSvance,
David
