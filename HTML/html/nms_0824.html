I apologize if this is in the FAQ but I was unable to download a
readable copy of the most current FAQ.  It just give a bunch of
letters and basically a mess.  Sometimes the Digests do that too
when I download them via FTP.  The Digest will start off ok, then
a bit into it it gets all jumbled.  Does anyone know what causes
that?  Anyhow, now for the reason for my post.  I ran across a CD
by Gowan on which Alex plays guitar.  Does anyone have any info on
this?  Is it worth getting?  What style is the music?  Any info you
can provide would help.  Thanks.

FOr everyone flaming radio stations about not playing RUsh, be paitient-it is
not all that uncommon for radio stations not to have every new disc.  Many
stations do not get everything new and some of the time they DO have to buy it!
Some record companies can be a real pain in the bum to get stuff from - not
only on the college level but commercially as well!
Confirmation on Mtv playing the SIO video!  My father said he caught the last
bit of Stick it Out the other night around 11 pm on Sat (most likely the Ball),
so he has seen the new Rush video before I have!!!  BTW, has anyone else
attended a RUSH concert with their parent/s?  I needed a ride to see them in
Hartford on the BOnes tour and after getting a ride from my brother for the
Albany show, my father and I headed up the next night for a long trek to
Hartford and he actually loved the show!!!  A quote I won't forget is when he
turned to me after Neil'
s solo and said "doesn't he get a break now?"
	"april in toledo, I'm talking to myself..."

Friends on the RUSH mailing list,

This is an invitation to attend the informal debut of Counterparts, ie we
finally got the new CD ready, here in Tuebingen, Germany.  As far as I
know I have the only copy in town and I am sure this is not on the radio
here.  I therefore have to balls to call this the Tuebingen Debut.

The debut will take place at my place:

Viktor-Rennerstr. 2/65.3

on Wednesday the 23rd of May, 1993 at 8 pm Germany time, or whenever I
show up (around 8).

Please RSVP, via e-mail, personal response, or whatever else seems to work.

This is somewhat of a potluck wingding kinda deal.  I will have some
assorted whatever on hand, but I will not make any guarantees, so if you
want something particular bring it with.

Your Host,

Hans Kugler

PS

For those of you who get this invite too late, sorry, but I ain't waiting
any longer.

For those of you who are not in Germany, hey I tried.

Yes I know the CD has been out for some time, but I finally found it here,
therefore this thing is now.

And for the ORQ "Take Youself a Friend"

     Rush blends alternative, '70's styles on recent CD
     --------------------------------------------------
by Nikolaos Chivikas, staff writer

   They're back! No, not the spirits from Poltergeist, but the ever-
so-inventive trio from Canada- Rush.
   They're at it again with their 19th compact disc, "Counterparts."
As always, their music takes off in a completely different direction
from their previous material, and "Counterparts" is no exception. This
time though, they have taken bits and pieces of the '90's alternative
scene and added their '70's perspective to bring to their fans an
interesting twist.
   After taking a brief hiatus from their last disc, the more commer-
cial recording "Roll the Bones," Rush went to Toronto in April of this
year to record their follow-up.
   The album is characteristic of Rush with Geddy Lee's vocals and
bass on the cutting edge, Alex Lifeson's guitar searing from riff to
riff, and Neil Peart's drums making their presence known.
   The combination of their abilities over the years has now fused
together to make them one, as well as "counterparts." It is here that
they chose the title for their new disc. According to the Oxford
English Dictionary, "counterparts" is defined as both duplicate and
opposite in the sense of "forming a natural compliment to one another."
[Gee, I can't tell he's just quoting Neil, can you??]
   The first single, "Stick it Out," is reminiscent of the '70's hard
rock scene with Lee's vocals, but the flying guitar work, powerhouse
drumming and addition of synthesizers [thought they had those already?]
brings it to the '90's with a new face.
   Although Rush has entered the '90's with rawness and refinement on
this disc, there is no mistaking this band with another. You can still
appreciate such oldies [what is he calling OLD?] as "Fly By Night,"
"the Spirit of Radio," and "Tom Sawyer."
   The orchestration of the fourth track "Nobody's Hero" was arranged
and conducted by Michael Kamen (of "Jack the Ripper" fame from the
Last Action Hero Original Motion Picture Soundtrack [excuse me how
many of you know what THAT is?]). The acoustic guitar on this song is
great and the vocals have adjusted to this style of play to bring out
another side of Rush. The subject matter is of a '90's tale, as it
tells a story that some may be able to relate to in today's society
of ever-changing classes [whatever that means].

   Rush is always doing things to surprise their fans with new music.
They have done it again with "Counterparts" and done it with style.
Not bad for a band that has endured 18 previous discs and 19 years of
hard work.
   In 1994, they will celebrate 20 years together (Rhinestone Anniversary
[wonder where he got that]) since the release of their self-titled debut
disc. [This guy likes discs, eh?]
   How will they celebrate this milestone? Chances are they will celebrate
it with their fans [especially us I hope], for it is they who have
continued to buy Rush CDs and remained faithful through the years.
          ..................................................

Oh yeah, I forgto to mention [] are my comments.
This guy seems to be a fan, probably only recent since he's
trying to sound like he knows a lot but he doesn't.
Maybe I should get him an NMS subscription, eh?

Also there was a picture with it-- Alex on the right in all black-
looks like maybe a trench coat, Neil in the middle in a horizontal
striped shirt and a bandana (looks a bit more like the lead singer
of Primus than other Neil pics), and Geddy on the left in his round
tinted glasses and a black button shirt with some lighter color on
the front. Nice hairdo too. :)
                             Blessed be,
                             Juno (aka Julie and Panacea)

Whoops, I goofed...or I assumed too much. Turns out the blue is a process
color, not Pantone. The U.S. blue is 100% cyan, 50% magenta and 30% black
(approximately). I *knew* you've been waiting on pins and needles,
wondering about that... :-)

Canadians, get yer loupes out an' check out them dots...enquiring, slightly
bent minds want to know what the Canadian blue is!

Ok, now back to your normally scheduled not *quite* so trivial Rush trivia...

This sounds great.  The computer animation idea occured to me, but I don't
have access to much in the way of animation hardware/software, so I didn't
bother to mention it.

Dudes,

Robert Russ's idea was incredible I thought.  And it sounds like he definitely
has the capacity to put together something impressive.  I think we need to back
him up.

   [ Yes!  This is a very good idea.  I think what Robert is looking for here 
     is some support and more importantly IDEAS!!  He's going to need a lot of 
     input/feedback as far as what the actual video will be, and what imagery 
     to include, what songs to include, what type of animation sequence, 
     objects, etc.. should go into this video.  What I'll be doing soon is 
     setting up an account for all you people to send in your feedback and 
     ideas so that Robert can get going on this.   This is a great idea folks 
     and Robert is a wizard at what he does.  I think with enough input, ideas 
     and support we can pull this off without any problems!  Ho-hoo! :rush-mgr ]

Personally, I've given it some thought and I think that Xanadu is a song that
should NOT be left out of the proposed medley.  It's certainly a Rush classic,
and one of my favorites, especially in concert.  Also, it lends itself to
a moving and captivating animation sequence.  Choose a slow section of the song,
one of the parts heavy with keyboards, OR (preferrably) one of the fast-paced
portions:  "Waiting for the world to end, weary of the night..."

Perhaps a depiction of the River Alph or the pleasure dome could be worked in,
I'm not very creative.  Key would be a bright flash as Geddy shouts the word
"Xanadu".  Computerized images of the Caves of Ice would be interesting...

   [ This is the type of stuff I think Robert is looking for!  It sounds good 
     to me!  More feedback anyone?                                :rush-mgr ]

The idea overall is a good one, whichever songs are chosen.  Go with it!

Greetings, blah blah blah.

I live in Austin, TX and work at the Frank Erwin Center, the venue
that Rush played on the HYF and RTB tours (they skipped Austin for
Presto).  They might have even come before HYF, but I can't be sure.
Anyways, I was eavesdropping around the Events office, and heard
that Rush had confirmed a date for late Jan, or early Feb.  Sounds
good, no?  No.  Later that week, they cancelled the Austin confirmation
along with several others.  Apparently, they changed their minds
about their schedule and are dropping some dates, or they are just
starting the tour later.  As always (snicker), any new info will
be posted here first, so all you keen guys and gals can know about
it.

Rushppl --

Well... not every lost post was about the "Stick it Out" video or L.A. tickets
there, rush-mgr... my poor Thanksgiving parody was lost :(

   [ Hey, gimme a break, I'm trying!                          :rush-mgr ]

Hey, that's ok.. we all love ya anyway!  So... I figured I'd re-post this
thing & try to get it out on the airwaves before Thanksgiving actually
arrives (yes, that's Thanksgiving in the U.S., for those in Canada & other
countries).  Credit also goes to Matt <mjp@umich.edu> as well as to Josh
<chapman@bach.udel.edu> for helping with these lyrics (yes.. as David
Letterman would say -- "It took three people to write this letter")

Oh.. before I get to that, I feel it's kind of necessary to plug IRC and
#p/g! a little more (since I've been called both a "patriarch" of that channel
as well as its "dictator" -- hi Jamie!)....  Anyway, c'mon, join us if you'd
like, but keep one small thing in mind -- we ARE all Rush fans on there, but
we don't talk ONLY of Rush (you run out of things to say after a few days).
Anyway... it's best to check late at night (by EST standards) & probably not
until next week... a lot of people go home this week, eh!  Okay, enough of
that... on with the parody! and Happy Thanksgiving!

"The Big Turkey" -- Music by Lee & Lifeson
 --------------     Lyrics by Chapman, Phillips and Reed

Big turkey can feed half the world
Big turkey and some yams
Big turkey takes all day to cook
Big turkey beats a ham
Big turkey has a crisp brown skin
Big turkey and stuffing
Big turkey got a yummy taste
Big turkey got a little poppy thing

  Sometimes passing stuffing around
  Sometimes carving up the bird
  Sometimes eating cranberry sauce
  Sometimes gravy must be stirred
  It's the feathers and the glory
  It's a war in the coop
  It's a turkey story
  On a pile of turkey poop

Big turkey can feed half the world
Big turkey taste real good
Big turkey, he can kick your ass
Big turkey from the 'hood
Big turkey got a mighty beak
Big turkey has big thighs
Big turkey makes a damn fine roast
Big turkey got no eyes

  Sometimes watching Macy's parade
  Sometimes watching a first down
  Sometimes building you a freeway
  To transport the turkey on
  It's really quite a vision
  It's something kind of quirky
  It's the fool on television
  Getting played to dress like a turkey

Big turkey can feed half the world
Big turkey will get eat
Big turkey got a million feathers
Big turkey can't be beat
Big turkey got a hefty leg
Big turkey cooked by mom
Big turkey gonna be your feast
Big turkey's name is Tom

	Ok, I'll get the "This is my first post" stuff out of the way. There.
I read on the last TMS that "caress of steel, fly by night" took some
getting used to.  Wow, my first album was moving pictures, then 2112, then
fly by night then caress of steel.
	The feeling that I get is that a lot of rush fans out there seem
to like the new (post 82) stuff more than the early stuff.  Is that so?  I
don't have many albume post 82 (just presto and power windows).  The early
stuff is by far the best! Who is with me!
	To stregthen my point I read a poll about favorite albums. Fly by
night was near the bottom! Can you beleive this! my top 5 (some are too
hard to place one better than another so no part. order)
1.Fly by Night
2.Moving Picutres
3.2112

<A NAME="824016">Subject: Nobody's Hero (slight references to Rand, the Pass)</A>

I did my damndest to find previous posts on this subject at Syrinx, but it's
just too difficult to wade through that many digests.  Wouldn't it be nice
to have an index into all digests of all subjects? Ha! Not bloody likely!

   [ Hey  I was just contemplating this idea myself. Any takers? Someone with
     lots of time and nothing to do? :)				: rush-mgr ]

So, I missed the most of the posts in which interpretations of the lyrics
in Nobody's Hero were given, in particular, any quotations from the band on
this subject I've missed, though I've seen some later references to them.

I would say (and this seems to be the consensus)
that only a small part of the song's theme is the sexuality
issue. That verse's true purpose is to contribute to the larger theme of heros.
>From what I can tell, and I apologize if I misinterpret someone, the consensus
seems to be that the two people specifically referred to (the guy who died
of AIDS and the woman who was murdered) are heros in some sense. Most of the
debate seems to centre around what kind of hero. It seems fairly clear that
certain people are clearly judged as heros by Peart while others are not, as
listed in the chorus (and for the record, I think these are good examples and
make a good point). But what about these two people? What is he trying to
say when he says ``but they're nobody's hero"? I think most people are
interpreting this to mean ``they're nobody's hero but they ought to be."
Perhaps this is a bit subtler, as in something more like ``they're not really
heros in the traditional sense but in a more personal, subjective sense,
they're heros to themselves and/or Peart". Nobody seems to interpret the
``they're nobody's hero" line in the negative, and it is this possibility I
wanted to mention. Could it be he means that they are not heros at all? This
is the interpretation I tend to like, though I realize I set myself up to
be accused of not being very humanitarian/sensitive, though I will argue that
that conclusion does not follow from my interpretation at all.

The interpretation goes
something like: sure, the death of these people is a tragedy. There was no
reason a person should die the nasty death of AIDS just because of his choice
of sexuality (nor for that matter should he have *anything* nasty associated
with his sexual choice, it just doesn't matter). An innocent woman should not
have been murdered for no reason. These are horrible things and are worthy
of consideration and emotional response. They do not, however, raise the
victim to hero status. Heros are people (or should be) who have performed
heroic acts (a tautology, I realize, but one that is nevertheless informative).
Quite frankly, dying in and of itself has never been a heroic act to Peart,
as he has addressed several times before in song lyrics (the Pass (as an
aside, I never offered my opinion on the `Christ what have you done' debate,
but to the recent poster who offered that the lyric could have just as well
have been `damn, what have you done', you don't give much credit to Neil
and you have missed a quite telling condemnation of martyrdom and the most
famous and most harmful martyr to human society, christ) and I seriously doubt
that he has about-faced on that issue. In this interpretation, the message
is that despite our emotional response to these tragedies, we should not start
counting martyrs or people that have as their main claim to fame their own
tragic death as heros nor belittle the contributions of true heros. I
suppose this seems a cold interpretation, in that I am not giving as much
tribute to the victims as in the more common interpretation, but it depends
on how you look at it: I'm giving much more tribute to true heros than the
common interpretation, and in the end shouldn't they be the people we admire
and pattern ourselves after and aspire to be rather than to want to be an
innocent victim? There is still every bit of room in this interpretation for
pathos towards innocent victims, but they are not heros.

The definition of a heroic act is a bit more fuzzy, but Peart obviously means
it to include the examples given as an indication. Generally, he seems to
indicate (and I would pretty much concur) an almost Rand-iesque (danger! Flames
from Philosopher-king Jaegger (sp?) possibly forthcoming! ;-) Actually, before
I gave up news reading as too time-consuming, I used to read Greg quite
often on objectivist and libertarian groups and found him to be very informed
and his posts quite well thought out, and I also usually judged him to have
won his arguments, so I'm not trying to bring out another argument. I'm not
referring to Rand in a technical philosophical argument (which I would surely
lose not being trained in philosophy) but rather invoking her name as an
adjective to describe certain ideas, which may or may not very accurately
reflect her technical philosophy) view of heros (note the word `almost').
In either case, this is more of a gray area and more open to debate. As Gregg
pointed out, the example of saving the drowning child is actually probably
counter to truly `objectivist' moral philosophy (unless there was no risk to
the saver and he deemed the extension of the child's life to be something
personally enjoyable?), continuing the chronicle of Peart's evolution from
disciple of Rand to a more libertarian/freedom of choice (which is an
evolution that seems to happen to a lot of people who get hooked on Rand by
sharing a dislike of many things that she condemns but who then realize that her
vision of life comes up a bit short, also).

   [ It's good to see that I'm not the only one thinking about Gregg as far 
     as the Rush philosophizing goes :-)  Boy I sure hope this doesn't develop 
     into a big giant "once-again!" Rand thread.                 :rush-mgr ]

RUSH in Australia? The only bands that travel down under are those that can
get half the population to pay for tickets in the space of a few shows, i.e.
those that can fill up the huge outdoor stadiums. While RUSH certainly have
a following here, I don't think they can do that. Now, if they added a dozen
dancers who were willing to prance around nude and simulate orgies on stage,
it might happen. Worked for Madonna, didn't it?

Hello all---

Here's my ticket buying story:
I got up at about six and went to the record store.  There were about
one hundred people in line, which really sucked, until i found out
that they were all waiting for tickets for another show.  I ended up
being second in line for rush tix!!  By the time I bought them (about
15 seconds after 9 o'clock) the "expensive" $40 tickets were already
sold out--I ended up getting some nice 10th row $27 ones. (Not Bad!)
A friend asked me today if i had any extra, he said he called
Ticketmaster at 10:30 (the tickets went on sale at 9) and they were
already sold out!  Wow.
So there it is...

Onward and upward with the arts.

Saturday morning in Los Angeles.  I get up, go to the phone,
and warm up my dialing finger.  I dialed for two solid hours,
finally got through, and was told that tickets were sold out!
"Not even an individual ticket?!"  I asked.  Nothing.  "Call
back next week, they might release some more seats."  I called
a few hours later, for the sheer joy of it, and  the guy who
handled the call that time looked in a file and said there were
plenty of individual seats - at the back end of the hall in
the balcony - and that if I'd called earlier anyone else there
could have found much better individual seating for me.  *#$%.

I was told that my first call was being monitored by the
on duty supervisor, meaning I was handled by a trainee.  Why
didn't the Super intervene?

Dagnabbit.

Well, if anyone has seats they want to unload, call me!  I won't
be bitter.  Just wanted to get that off my chest.

Actually, I am almost 100% sure that the original poster was speaking of
the harmonics in the song, as clearly show on the video Instead of fretting
the note (pressing the string all the way to fingerboard between the frets)
he lightly touches a string directly above a certain fret (not in between)
and does not press it down.  This technique sounds a bell or chime-like
sound some number of octaves higher.

Just thought I would give my own insight.

More likely harmonics, don't you think?  Most people wouldn't notice

Great ideas [banquet-type event -> R. Russ's animation -> sculpture].
Sounds like a perfect combination; my only negative comment is that this
all sounds a bit... um, intemperate?  I think that a donation to a
Rush-inspired charity would be an appropriate adjunct to the gift.  It
would add some sort of 'meaning' to it, if you understand what I'm
getting at -- it would make us look like something other than obsessed,
lunatic Rushheads, and would do a bit of good in the bargain.

from Ontario. Does anyone else thing Alex sounds like Joel from MST3K?
A bit less whiny, but still... And then when they talk together, you know
interrupt each other and stuff, they sound like Tom Servo and Crow T.

Anyone have any ideas on who Neil sounds like?

BTW I LOVE those silly hick acents Ged and Alex slipped into while

About where is the 1812 overture in 2112, as I recall Alex plays it
towards the end of the `overture` -

bit with the gaps where everyone goes `oi!' when they do it live

Stops, then riff bit from the start

I found some definitions in the dictionary that aren't exactly mainstream
definitions.  Maybe this helps to explain BSAM.

(Reach for the) Moon: Something impossible, inaccessible or unknowable.
Moon (away): To spend in idle reverie (wander).

Lake: To undergo a change.

(In the) Sun: Glory, Splendor

I think he's talking about how most people reach this idle state in their lives
where they stop asking questions or, if they do, don't bother trying to answer
them.  He emphasizes 'the space between wonder and why' as the excitement in
gaining knowledge and understanding (light, heat, and energy).  Kind of goes
along with Prime Mover from HYF.  "From the point of ignition to the final
drive, the point of the journey is not to arrive."  Our own drives and desires
cause us to be our own prime mover, and if we don't act on these desires, we'll
never leave the moon and try to get to the sun.

Other interpretations?

I read what Neil said about the Nobody's Hero, he didn't say the song
was about AIDS. I don't think the song itself has anything to do with
AIDS. It is dealing in general with the people who are important in
our lives and who is heroes to us.  The examples the song gives, like
saving a drowning child or landing a cripple airplane, were people who
would get recognition, rewards, etc. for what they did. But there are
people, like the man in the first verse, who change our lives,
teach us things and just generally make us better people who die
unrecognized and "Nobody's Hero." So, IMHO Neil is trying to give them
credit. I think AIDS is just a coincidence to the song.

Howdy, y'all.  I started this with a humorous twist, but it ended up kind
of making me think...

Parody:	***COLD SHOWER***

Cold Shower

It was long after midnight,
When we got to necking passionately
She said I'm not that kind of girl,
Don't get the wrong idea.

I said I've got to get my rocks off
I haven't screwed in a hundred weeks
She said you're outta luck buddy -
I won't put out for you.
I'm out of here
Because you must cool down
Right now

It was just before sunrise
When we started taking off our clothes
She said I hope you brought a condom
You won't get to far without it.

I said if sex has these conditions
I don't understand those beer ads
She said you ain't Spuds McKenzie
You live in fantasy-land
I'm out of here
Because you must cool down
Right now

I want you now-
The only thing that keeps me sane
Is a cold shower
I need it bad-
My only friend right now
Is a cold shower
Please, Please, Please, Please-
The ache in my nards is assuaged by some time
In a cold shower
Maybe tomorrow?-
I'll make it through, somehow
With a cold shower

<A NAME="824338">From: Will Hartung - Master Rallyeist <villy@uunet.uu.net></A>

My, hasn't this been busy recently.

Well, I'm pretty jazzed. Friday night I won a pair of tickets to the
Feb. 3 show from KLOS. The seats will probably suck, but they've GOT
to be better than what I usually get at the Forum. (Past two tours
I've managed to get these wonderful views of the equipment, roadies,
cables, lightmen, etc. I haven't seen the back video screen at a Rush
concert for 4 YEARS!!!). Anyway, the big hope is that toward the
concert date, they'll have a drawing for "Front Row Center" tickets,
and I've figured that I had worse odds getting the tickets in the
first place compared to what they'll be drawing from (I'm guessing <
30 pairs). So, color me excited, it beats Lotto.

Oh yeah, I'm also getting a copy of the CD in "4-6 weeks". oh boy.
Just in time for the show.

Regarding concert get togethers, I think that will be really cool.
The hot tip will be trying to get a crowded group photo from each
concert so the picture can be scanned in and put on a file server
someplace. That will probably be hard at the Forum because there is no
OBVIOUS place to meet, and we can't get a camera inside. But I think
that would be really cool. If someone can think of an easy place to
meet at the Forum, then send it forward. It will be a lot easier when
they come back in late spring at Irvine Meadows (then we can have a
NMS tail gate party).

I didn't see the original gift idea, but here is something that is
pretty doable.

How about getting a charicature of the band. You know, those drawings
of people where the heads are big and such -- like editorial cartoons?
Several artists can do a decent job, we've got ample photos and such
for them to work on. Maybe they can integrate something from each
album or somesuch. Anyway, it can be drawn or even painted. I think
they look cool, they're usually pretty funny. Anyway, 2 cents there.

Has Rush been on Rockline yet? I heard the Album Introduction, but I
don't listen to KLSX here enough to know who's going to be on
Rockline, so if they haven't, could the RushMgr think to put it into
his Administrivia if he finds out? (That's about the only part I get
to read anymore).

Oh yeah, and speaking of Rockline, I think that someone somewhere
should be able to get on with a question, and slyly mention NMS in
their question. And, when they come to LA, any thought on getting an
NMS T-Shirt (or 3) to the Band? Or at least San Diego since SD is the
famed origin of said legendary T-Shirt.

Concert Rule 3B(c) : If you've got the shirt, you've got to wear it!

Later,

Does anyone have any idea if and when Rush will be in Western Canada?

Will they only be playing Vancouver, or will they visit some of the
other cities like Calgary which they missed on the last tour ?

Thanks

I'm sure this has already been covered on here, but I've only been
subscribed for a few weeks. What is "The Story of Kings?" I saw a
copy in Music+ the other day, but didn't have 13 bucks on me. Is the
interview any good? Who is it with? -->Would you recommend getting
it?

   [ It's an interview done with Alex and an unknown interviewer in a coffee
     shop (or so it sounds), and about 30 min long. The full transcription can 
     be found on syrinx, either gopher (in Interview Transcriptions) or ftp (in
     rush/special).						: rush-mgr ]

In other misc. news, I got THIRD ROW to the San Diego show. . .Geddy
will be sweating on ME ;-)  --catch the spit, eh?
Don't ask me how. My friend was second in line.
