	ANNOUNCEMENT:  A PROGRESSIVE ROCK DISCUSSION GROUP IS HERE!!!

Almost all of the major progressive rock bands have their own discussion
groups.  Rush, Yes, Genesis, and Marillion, to name a few, are discussed
at length in moderated groups.  

Unknown to most, there are numerous bands that share similar musical
styles and philosophies that made these bands great.  From the mid to late
sixties, and on into the nineties, the term 'progressive rock' has been used
to categorize these groups and artists. 

Unfortunately, many progressive rock recordings are extremely difficult 
to find.  They are either out of print or only available on import.  Thus,
due to its musical diversity and the fickleness of the music industry,
progressive rock is under-represented. 

As an attempt to bring together progressive rock fans all over the world, 
a mailing list/discussion group has been formed.  The purposes of this group
will be: 

1) To discuss progressive rock artists and their music.
2) To enlighten members about obscure bands and recordings.
3) To serve as a central communication point for people who want to trade 
	tapes.
4) To bridge the gap between age and nation, by discussing both old music
	and new, from all over the world.
5) To break news about new progressive bands carrying the torch into the    
	nineties and beyond.

This group will be moderated, and it will be heavy on the information.
Opinions will be encouraged, but flames will not be tolerated.  Since the
bands mentioned in the first paragraph have their own lists, in depth 
discussions on them will be out of place in this list, but naming them in      
reference is fine.  

Since the word 'progressive' itself evades definition, the group will be run
with an open mind and heart in regard to what bands can be discussed.
Unfortunately, there are multiple definitions of what progressive rock is, so
we must roughly define the category of music that we are talking about.

Bands that are in:  ELP, iQ, Pendragon, PFM, Aragon, Focus, Eloy, Twelfth
			Night, Dream Theatre, Univers Zero, Brand X, Gong, 
			Triumvirat, Camel, and many, many more...
		(and solo and related releases by artists in these bands)

Bands that are out: The Cure, Depeche Mode, The Smiths... (you get the point!)

We don't mean to 'bash' or put down the bands we've excluded, deny
them the right to be called progressive, nor do we mean to be fascists and
disregard them altogether!  But this list will be for the previously
mentioned bands.  Fans of Depeche Mode, et. al. can (and have) create their
own lists! :-)

As you can see a wide variety of music is included: new age, symphonic rock,
fusion jazz, heavy metal, and more.  No matter your progressive rock tastes,
there will be discussion that interests you!  (And if there isn't, feel free
to start some!)

And finally, down to the business side of things...

The moderator will be George Grinch, and the list will be run out of his 
account:

			csc8mnp@cabell.vcu.edu

Please send all information and subscription requests to him.  Feel free to
send questions to this account, but I can't subscribe you!  I'll be serving
as archivist and "all-purpose assistant" to George, though I won't actually
take part in the running of the list.

So don't hesitate, subscribe now!!!  As soon as we have a few dozen members,
the first issue will be mailed!

And to all a Good Night,
Mike Borella
