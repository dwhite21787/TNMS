Since I've gotten mail on the subject, I thought I'd just post a quick
note about the latest modification to the digest tail. The statement:

  "This message is subject to the restrictions of The Electronic
   Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Public Law 99-508, as amended."

Is mainly there to protect myself and the list in the event of somebody
doing something with the NMS which I consider irresponsible or illegal.
It basically means that you shouldn't intercept/read/redistribute this
digest without my prior knowledge or permission.

The impact this will have on 99% of the list members is none.  If you
want to show issues to a friend, that's fine by me.  There are already
several redistribution points for the NMS; this is to cut down on mail
traffic to a particular site (hi to all you people at andrew.cmu.edu!).

What I'm trying to prevent is people causing trouble by forwarding the
NMS to someplace it doesn't belong (like alt.sex), or to profit from 
the digest (like when somebody was printing/binding postings from the
newsgroup rec.music.gdead and selling it at shows for $2.).  

This is supposed to be a free exchange of ideas, and should only be
shared with people who are interested, or might be interested.  This 
means I'd rather you didn't add friends "as joke" (this has happened),
or post it to some newsgroup (can you imagine the flame from the 
rec.music.misc group??).

If you wish to propigate the NMS, please drop me a line if you're not
sure you're clear under the above guidelines.  I'm pretty reasonable. :-)

<A NAME="174002">Subject: Self-Sacrifice</A>

<This is in response to Lance V Neustaeter's statements on Mon 18 FEB>

	Reading your comments about how Christianity views self sacrifice
bothered me "just a tad"  Assuming that you are referring to self sacrifice
as meaning suicide <as in "The Pass"> then
Christianity DOES NOT see self sacrifice as the Cardinal Virtue.
Why?  That is quite simple.  God (at least the way I perceive him) is good
and loves us as humans.  He does not want us to commit suicide <self-sacrifice>
in order to benefit him, because our purpose in life is not to get to get
Grace, in God's eyes, (unless you're a Puritan)  but rather to live a clean
life free of sin.  Killing yourself *is* a sin and thus cannot be seen as the
cardinal virtue.
	Lance may be confusing the idea of self-sacrifice/cardinal virtue with
the idea of giving up yourself to help another, or to fulfill a request from
God, (like Christ did). But as the lyrics show in "The Pass,"  this is not the
case.
	I do not want this to start a massive battle of flames, but rather to
clarify an idea offered to the "godly" mailing list. (Note the lower-case g)
PLEASE, send any flames or long discussions to me- NOT the NMS-  this paper
gets too long, and often strays from the topic at hand-

	RRRRRRR    UU    UU     SSSSS      HH     HH        !!!!

HEY FELLOW RUSH FANS,
  JUST REPORTING ON THE PRESTO SHOW I SAW IN JACKSONVILLE, FL. I WAS LIVING
IN SOUTH GEORGIA AT THE TIME AND DROVE 2 AND 1/2 HOURS TO SEE THE BOYS.
MR. BIG WAS THE OPENING ACT. WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THE DIDN'T PLAY
CHAIN LIGHTNING, BUT OVERALL AN EXCELLENT SHOW. HEY ON THE SUBJECT OF TRIVIA:
I WAS TOLD DURING MY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS, THAT WHEN RUSH DID THEIR MOVING
PICTURES TOUR HERE IN BUFFALO, THE TOOK THE PICTURE THAT APPEARED ON THE
FRONT OF EXIT STAGE LEFT. MY FRIEND WENT AS SO FAR AS TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF
IN THE LOWER GOLD SECTION OF THE AUD THAT APPEARED ON THE COVER. ANYBODY
KNOW IS HIS CLAIM IS LEGIT?? ALSO, MY FRIENDS WENT TO A BLUE JAYS GAME AT
THE SKYDOME IN TORONTO AND SAID THAT THEY FOUND GEDDY IN THE CROWD AND
FLASHED A SHOT OF JULIAN AND HIM UP ON JUMBO-TRON. ANYBODY ELSE GET A
GLIMPSE OF THIS. THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE SINCE THE MAN IS A BASEBALL FANATIC
AND A MOVER AND SHAKER IN THE TORONTO MUSIC SCENE..

    I've subscribed to Rolling Stone for over 10 years and the magazine has
precious little in good things to say about Rush. The Signals album received
a whopping 2 stars (for fair) including the comment that Geddy's voice was
not getting any better. Grace Under Pressure recieved 3 stars, yet the
reviewer really strained at giving them any good words for their effort. I
don't recall if Power,Show, or Hold were reviewed, but Presto was another 3
star effort, if memory serves. Still, the reviewer really went out of his
way NOT to praise Rush, instead trying to bury them.
     A lot of other magazines tend to hate Rush for some reason (perhaps
hate is a strong word). Entertainment Weekly (I know, who cares what they
think!?!) said of Presto that Geddy's voice was some kind of joke and that
Neil was trying to hard to be one of the great songwriters of the music
business (it's a good thing we all know better, right?). A later review of
Queensryche's EMPIRE album compared them to Rush (1 star btw) saying that
QR had opted to follow the lame path of some of the 70's has been bands.

Good Morning,

    Since there has been alot of talk about Kim lately I have a question
for all fans (Robyn, Dave, etc).  I was in Toronto in December and I read
an ad stating that Kim, The Pursuit of Happiness, and three other bands
were going to play at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.  Unfortuately,
I couldn't stick around long enough to see him (The show was New Year's
Eve in case you are wondering).  Did any one go to the show?   I would
love to know because the last thing I hate the most is to miss out on
a great show.  Also, is there anywhere in the States where Kim/Max
fans can get his latest material (e.g."I am a Wild Party, Rockland, etc)?
I have looked in all the record stores in Pittsburgh and I can't find him.
Can anyone help out here?

                                                  Doug

<A NAME="174006">Subject: Neil ... simple?</A>

  Been a while since I posted last, but I had a few strong opinions
about the post Lance Neustaeter made about Neil's drumming going
downhill since MP era.
  How can you listen to songs like 'Mystic Rythms', 'Red Lenses' and
'Scars' ... Holy Neil what about 'Scars' man???  I would argue the
point in the opposite direction, Neil has gotten more complex in the
last five albums than at any time in their history.  In a recent
Modern Drummer Neil says himself that he feels he has gotten as good
technically as he will ever be and now wants to concentrate on being
more subtle and restrained.  A perfect example of this would be
'Presto', you can feel how much Neil is holding back on that track.
He puts down no more than is absolutely necessary for the song.
  If you're looking for Neil to go apesh*t then just listen to what
he does in 'Mystic Rythms' ... what other drummer could you say would
ever, EVER hold down a 4/4 song with such an incredible drum pattern.
That song blows my mind when I hear it.  As a drummer I don't know
how he comes up with some of that sh*t.
  My advice to anyone who has lost touch with Neil after MP is to
take a hardy listen to PoW and 'Mystic Rythms' and 'Scars' from Presto
and then to all the other albums since then and I'm sure you'll
agree that Neil is better than ever.  Anyone disagree?

   In my post yesterday, I included a quote from "Mystic Rhythms", but I
mistakenly said it was from _Hold Your Fire_.  Of course, it is from _Power
Windows_ and not HYF.  Thanks for those who pointed it out to me.  And, of

<A NAME="174008">Subject: Another one of those voices...</A>

Hello all,

I just came up with a question I don't think has been addressed
as of yet. We all know that Neil does the voices in The Necromancer
and 2112, and that Mr Broon did Cygnus X-1, but my question is, who
does the "Mountain!" along with Geddy in Didacts and Narpets?
It kinda sounds like Alex, and then it kinda doesn't. Anyone have
any ideas?

Also, this may be an isolated case, but for those who have the
Hemispheres CD, (as I am sure most do) does there seem to be
a large amount of hiss? This bothers me very much. I can get
rid of it by fooling around with an equalizer or setting the
treble down to zero, which incidentally destroys most of the highs.

Well, time to go...

Hi there,

>From previous issues it appears that parts of La Villa Strangiato are
more or less quotes from cartoon music. Well, the first part, 'Buenos
Nochas, Mein Froinds', is also kind of a quote. It's from the German
song 'Gute Nacht, Freunde' and the song's got almost the same intro as
La Villa. Note the resemblance in titles. If anyone's interested I'll
dig up the composer/performer of the song.

ORQ - Just thought that you should know.

To NMS

   I am on the NMS email connection maintained by Keith Ford.
   I have spoken with quite a few people about RUSH opening acts and RUSH as
an opening act. I myself have seen RUSH on five different occasions. All these
references are from the Western and Central New York areas. I started
listening to RUSH when 2112 came out. My brother ken saw RUSH open for KISS
in 1974 in Buffalo. Then he saw them on the 2112 tour in Albany. The 2112 tour
had ANGEL,RUSH and BLUE OYSTER CULT in that order with ANGEL as the opening
act. Some of my friends saw these same shows in Rochester and Buffalo. Every-
one is in agreement that ANGEL is the all time opening act favorite in central
and western New York. The main problem is that most of the subscribers to
The National Midnight Star have been listening to Rush five years or less.
We are all in agreement about one thing Mr. Big was the all time worst. Here
is a list of the concerts in central and western New York.

       1976 -ANGEL  - * 2112             *  Albany, Rochester, Buffalo
       1977 - ?     - * Farewell To Kings*  Buffalo
       1978 -none   - * Hemisperes       *  Utica,  Buffalo
       1980 - ?     - * Permanent Waves  *  ?
       1981 -FM     - * Moving Pictures  *  Albany, Rochester, Buffalo
       1982 - ?     - * Signals          *  Buffalo
       1984 -Fastway- * P/G              *  Rochester, Buffalo
       1985 -S.Morse- * Powers Windows   *  Rochester, Buffalo
       1989 -T. Shaw- * Hold Your Fire   *  Buffalo
       1990 -Mr. Big- * Presto           *  Rochester, Buffalo

I have seen Hemispheres, Moving Pictures, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows,
and Presto. My brother has seen Rush-Kiss, 2112, Moving Pictures, Power Windows
and Presto. Ken said that RUSH was incredible as an opening act for KISS.
He said Working Man was one of the highlights. I am still collecting more data
and will try to fill in the ?.

In the 2-19 issue David Chao posted the Rolling Stone rankings

>>Jason Bonham (??)

For those who share that question, he is the drummer for his own band
"Bonham".  IMO some of the tracks were quite good, even though his
popularity stems mostly from his father John Bonham, of course the
former drummer from Zeppelin.

A question for the rest of the Rush Fans out there, Do you ever think
Zep will get back together for a reunion with Jason behind the drums.
If you haven't heard any of his stuff, he definately has his father's
style.
