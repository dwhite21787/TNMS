I've been gradually moving stuff over to the new nms site at syrinx.yyz.com,
it doesn't have a main page (yet), but all of the files under the HTML
tree are there. Some of the GIFs are there as well, all those for the 
tourdates. We have a severe space limitation on the temporary server, so
there's a lot of multimedia stuff (mostly realvideo) that won't be moved
over until we get the final server up to snuff.

The tourdates listing is up and working completely, and thanks to Jeff
we now have a TON more early dates (mostly 1977), as well as concert
attendances for many of those shows.

I also added in a bunch of ticket stubs, you can see the updated tour
dates listing at:

      http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/tourdates.html

As always I'm looking for ticket stubs for any show that doesn't have one,
and newspaper previews/reviews for the shows.

Hi, I'd love to know that the Rush lawers can read this:

C'mon ! Rush lawers, can't you do your real job, instead of puttin up
barriers to the REAL freedom of expression? Actually, we are just promoting
three musicians and their work. These three guys are the ones contribuiting
to your income...

I know...I know...the Law is the Law...   but... get yourself something
more important to do...

"I find no absolution
In my rational point of view
Maybe some things are instinctive
But there's one thing you could do
You could try to understand us
We could try to understand you..."

<A NAME="2054005">Subject: Page/Plant/Seattle ROCKS/Troy McClure</A>

Saw Page/Plant on Saturday in Fargo ND and those guys can still put on a
show - Plant even had a couple of age jokes.  Hearing Page play that riff
from No Quarter was worth the price of admission.  Alex still has my
favorite style though.  The older albums with longer song formats that
allowed him to play some more extended up front guitar pieces put away the
title for him.  IMO Hemispheres/Permanent Waves/Moving Pictures were the
best three consecutive albums ever put out by any band - anyone else with a
favorite sound that Rush (or another band) developed over a few albums?  I
like almost all of their stuff, but that era is when what they liked
playing was closest to what I like to listen to (moods aside).  

Another earlier post was right on saying that the chorus/chorus/guitar
solo/chorus format can get old.  Its not that a song with that format can't
be good (see:  Limelight), but if it doesn't use it it automatically gets a
star for originality (see earlier Alex comment as well).

Flew into Seattle last week for a two day conference at the Evil Empire
(Microsoft - kidding).  The first song after picking up the rental car -
Circumstances.  The first song I hear last time I was there was Lakeside
Park (or Bastille Day I forget - one of those songs from my favorite Rush
album).  Heard Working Man as well - which seems to have been put on fairly
heavy rotation at stations wherever I have been lately - heavier than Tom
Sawyer.  Seattle radio rocks.

Tempest rocked, although I can see why it doesn't
translate well to today's standards. I'm 31 years.
I remember reading Neil's tour memoirs (from
PeW?) mentioned Ged, Lerxst and possibly Skip

I live in Miami Florida. I listen to a radio talk show down here on A.M.
when I drive to work. The show gives out numbers to thier callers, for
various things, not really much meaning to it. Anyways, I was in my car
and they gave away the number "2111", well  had to stop and call to try
to get "2112". I got through, and of course they had to put me on hold
for the longest. Well this guy calls in on a mobile phone and asks for
the number, well, the DJ's called for a Rush Trivia Contest between me
and the guy. I go first and ask the guy who was the original drummer for
Rush -- he did'nt know it! He then asks me the name of Neil's book about
his trip to Africa (Masked Rider). I then asked the name of the boy who
"supposedly" was in the "Distant Early Warning" Video, letting him know,
it really wasn't Geddy's, but basically asking the name of Geddy''s son.
He said "You win, if you know the answer to that, you can have the damn
number". Ha Ha.------ So what is Geddy's son's name? Anyways?

hi all,
        I have some rather sad news about the way the death of our 
friend, mr. peart's daughter was handled by some radio d.j.s.
         First, let me start at MY begining of this matter. Last night i 
was on a chatroom, and my name is rushfanyyz. someone asked me if i had 
heard neil peart's daughter had died, and i said yes. He then told me 
about how some local dj's in his hometown of Dallas had made a big joke 
out of the whole matter! A lot of rush fans had called up and told them 
to fuck off, which i think anyone of us would have done the same. Man, 
if that happened around here, i would have gone down to the station 
myself! 
         Now, i don't care what you think about Neil Peart or Rush, but 
we're talking about a human trajedy here, and i find it hard to belive 
there could be anyone so heartless in this world. I suppose these guys 
proved that the bottom of the barrel isn't necisarrily the worst, 
because if you pick up the barrel and look underneath, you'll find...
         These guys!

I know this has no Rush content, but then again, half the posts don't either!
;)
Dirk, NONE of us have a real Barchetta. There were only 39 or so made, and of
those (mostly racers) were crashed and/or rebuilt into different
configurations by Ferrari. If you do see one, get a picture of it, because I
can assure you that you won't see another one ever again. The one I saw at the
Monterey Historic Auto Races a few years ago won the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans
and was worth between $750k and $1 million. And that was a bargain then.
The others that survive are essentially museum pieces.
(And that reminds me. The link I gave Randy for the Rush FAQ is outdated. I'll
find another photo of it and post it so you can see what a Barchetta looks
like. Cute little buggers, they are...)

Hey guys,

	Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who responded to my questions
about the keyboards and Cd's.  I haven't had a chance to go through all
the info yet because a very good friend of mine is in the hospital
because of a heart attack and stroke.  So I've been trying to balance my
usual routines with seeing what I could do for his situation. 

	I found all the CD's except the Gun CD.  And yes, the CDNOW.COM site
helped tremendously.

Thanks,

Erik.

<A NAME="2054013">Subject: Live Album Latest Rumors</A>

The most recent postings are claiming that the new live album will be a
3CD set with 2 from TFE/CP and one from AFtK, not Hemispheres.

In regards to the 2CD from TFE/CP I say with as much vigor as e-mail
text can provide... YES! This opens up some new possibilities of what
might be included! The entire 2112? ohhhhhh, baby.   The much better
1996-97 live version of Red Barchetta? Analog Kid from CP?

Now, in regards to the AFtK rumor as opposed to the HEM rumor, I say
NOOOOOOOOOO!  Don't take me wrong, I'll take whatever I can get from
RUSH, and 3CD's (dare we mention the long shot rumor of 4CDs?) is a
windfall!  But I for one prefer the Hemispheres possibilities over the
AFtK possibilities.  I am REALLY hoping the band delivers the missing
link in Rush live recording history... a QUALITY SOUNDBOARD RECORDING OF
LIVE HEMISPHERES! I ache for this. All boots have failed me here quality
wise and I have them all. 

For your consideration I submit the setlists from the AFTtK (Drive Till

Since I got great response from the last time & motion topic, I decided
to proceed with #2!

So as I sit here listening to the very song of which I am speaking, I
wonder...

the incredible imagery that accompanies this song- was the intention
there all along? (I mean, how can you not get the image in your head of
a train rolling along at ever- increasing speeds?  If you never caught
that- take another listen.)  Did Neil write the lyrics first, and they
were able to sift through their cache of stuff 'till they found a riff
that worked?  Or did Neil wrap his brain around what he heard in the
music, and come up with lyrical accompaniment?  Which came first, the
chicken or the egg?  And, lastly, have you ever heard another song that
conveyed an image(that ran along a theme with the lyrics)so well?

ok, I'm waiting.

<A NAME="2054016">Subject: Re: Deprogramming my 6 year-old (...in response to Al)</A>

After my public de-pantsing regarding Deprogramming, (cheers, John!) I
should probably be treading slowly back into the NMS, but what-the-hey.  

Rand said "Man is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others.
He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor
sacrificing others to himself."
(Key phrase there is "nor sacrificing others to himself.")

James, would you say that the above stated philosophy, de facto, would
support Social Darwinism?  Because this is what I’ve taken from Rand and
I cannot support this posture in myself, others or governments.  IMO,
Objectivism, while the philosophy goes deeper than Libertarianism, can
not be separated from Libertarianism since it’s position supports
Libertarian views.  

I realize I waded into an area that could have been served well using
private e-mail but I’ve seen a number of posts regarding Rand and I
thought others my be interested in this thread.  

Lastly, Alex states:

"individualism is extremely important, but not to a fanatical degree that
others suffer."

You said:
Again, anyone who follows individualism to the degree that they are hurting
others is following the Nietzche model for individualism, not Rands.

I would disagree with this in that through inaction (Social Darwinism),
Randians would be hurting others.

Marilyn Manson, or Shania Twain, or whoever else is the artist slam du jour 
on this digest.  All I know is that if somebody says that artist X is the 
greatest artist in the world, they are correct.  Correct because they are 
stating their opinion on a matter where only opinion exists. 

While I am glad to have someone agreeing with me, I have to wonder if
what you’ve said above is correct.  Is it possible for one band to be
better than another; empirically and not just in opinion?  Everyone can
and should have an opinion on which band they like the best but I would
argue that one band can be better than another.  Example:  Rush v. Bryan
Adams.  Lyrically, you will not get an argument that says Bryan Adams
writes better lyrics than Neil Peart.  Bryan Adams writes almost
exclusively of love; unrequited and otherwise.  Neil has written maybe 5
songs on the subject of relationships over 15 albums.  (don’t hold me to
the 5 songs, I don’t have the albums in front of me)  So, would Neil’s
breadth of subject matter alone make him a better lyricist?  I say
‘yes’.  Now throw in the imagery, symbolism, and storytelling ability
and it is clear he is a better lyricist.  

Musically:  I will state right up front that I have no musical training
so I cannot ‘talk the talk’ but will put it this way.  Take the
compositions of Rush and Bryan Adams to 100 people trained in musical
composition and ask them to comment on the depth and breadth of the
compositions and 99 out of 100 will say that Rush has better written
music (the 1 dissenting vote would be from Bryan Adams)

Musicianship:  Well, just look at the number of awards Neil, Alex and
Geddy have received for musicianship vs. how many the members of Bryan
Adams band have received and, IMO, my point is made.  

So, I would say that you could prove, empirically that Rush is a better
band than Bryan Adams.  

Anyone out there think I’m fulla s_ _ _

RE:  OLGA>  Sad to see the legal weasels trying to take anything that
bears a resemblance to a 3rd hand copy of a copyright.

My industry has the same--remember the Klingon (TM) knife with the
pop-out guards on ST:III??  Kit Rae at United Cutlery designed a similar
knife, with a similar logo.  Paramount claimed TM violation.  The logo
was changed.  They attempted to claim patent violation, even though they
had no patent on the Klingon(TM) knife.  They lost, as a knife with such
a design can be documented in the 16th century.  So finally they
claimed--get this:  That "Bird of Prey," being the name of the knife,
and the name of a Klingon(TM) class of ship, was a trademark, and ANY
use of "Bird of Prey" violated their rights.  So, anytime a documentary
on raptors is broadcast, the producers theoretically owe Paramount
money.  Rather than fight a 3rd ridiculous suit, United changed the name
to the Phoenix.  Nice irony there.

Klingon(TM) is a TM owned by Paramount Pictures, all rights reserved. 
It's use here is for educational and illustrative purposes.

bastards.

AS far as band pictures, etc, on Syrinx web page, I'd encourage the
Rush-mgr, possibly backed up with a large petition, to try to get
permission to use them, provided a note to the effect of "used by
permission, all rights reserved, (C) 19XX by Anthem etc..." is attached
to each.  I think the boys would be willing.  All we have to do is
convince the lawyers.

Let us invoke the magic of the great Donna Harper.  Perhaps she can
assist.

if those pictures in the mags came from band archives, they would retain

GREETINGS, RUSHIANS !

2 things :

First thing we do, kill all the lawyers !   Famous quote, or sensible
course of action ?   Who cares.
That'll be a bummer (do people still say that?) if the sound bytes
disappear.  Hearing them prompted me to purchase albums I'd never heard
before.  Hemispheres & COS in the case of Rush.  Also hope we don't also
lose the tourbooks.  Most of us got into Rush around MP or later.  I've
enjoyed reading them on the NMS, and hope many others get to do so in
the future.

OK, Everything must go.  I've vinyl LP's of Signals, AFTK & Permanent
waves, covers in very good condition, with the records nearly MINT. AFTK
even has a gatefold cover. I haven't owned a turntable in years, thus
I'd like to see them get a good home.  I'll let the whole set of 3 go
for $25, including shipping.  That's all 3, just give them a good home
is all I ask.  I've fallen into the 80's/90's CD trap, and it'll be
partially my fault if vinyl completely disappears off the face of the
Earth. Well, Marilyn Manson'll probably still wear it.  E-mail me if
interested.

Drive defensively & may the Lord be your companion !

What's happening

In the Uma issue of Premiere there is an ad for a movie coming out
called "Whatever". In the sidebar detailing its soundtrack, Rush is
listed, but the song isn't. The movie aparrently is based in the '80's
so figure something from then. (Aimee Mann is also listed.)

Every time B-Man makes some derogatory sweeping comment about TNMS or us
loser-fans, he turns around and says something genuinely kind about the
band or Rush's career.  Man, I don't know whether to think B-Man has
learned from his mistakes and accepted his situation maturely, or if he
will cry over spilled milk for the rest of his life pushing others down
that he might climb.  Did you pick up on that--a cheesy and (not so)
cleverly hidden Rush quote--just like the thousands B-Man weaved in
every chance he got in Visions.  

I remember reading Visions several times in the early '90s thinking what
a wonderful treasure of information the book was, while at the same time
cringing at how poorly written it was.  It is a cherished book, B-Man,
and for that I thank you.  But before you write anything else about Rush
or another band, please take a few lessons in grammar, spelling and
punctuation.

Humbly,
Jason

Why on EARTH would you make an assumption like that.  Not only have I

it either.

I have no reason not to believe what you're saying, except to simply
wonder why Rush would have done something like that at all?  Doesn't it
make sense that if the song were sped up in the mixing, the drums would
sound *just* a little bit different, and Geddy's voice would be a little
higher too?  Maybe I'm totally wrong here, but it's pretty easy to tell
in Geddy's voice if it's too high or too low--say on some bootlegs that
are a hair too fast or too slow.  Perhaps what they did is simply record
the song in a different key or with the instruments tuned differently.

>By any chance (and I know this is highly unlikely) did they fix this problem
>when they produced the remastered version of A Farewell To Kings?  

If they did this intentionally in 1977, why do you think they'd attempt
to "correct" this "problem"?

>You'd think

This, I'd say, is COMPLETELY impossible.  I don't claim to know about
today's technology, but dealing with sound reproduction seems to be a
fairly simple concept--you have music which contains notes at a certain
frequency.  If you change the speed of the music you change the
frequency of the notes (thus changing the # of waves per second), and
finally the pitch is affected.

Humbly,

Jason

<A NAME="2054040">Subject: super 2112- thanks to A.Smith</A>

Hello Everyone,

"Alex Smith", <bacchus@azstarnet.com> recently posted a "super" 2112
version incorporating this song as well as cygnus x-1 books 1 and 2.  Grat
idea.  Last night it had me thinking and I have come up with an extension,
incorporating parts of other songs into this original idea.  It lasts
about 101 minutes, and fits good on two sides of a 110 minute tape. Here
it is.

Side 1-
I.  Ending bells of By-tor and the Snow Dog
II.  Necromancer Pt 1
III.  Necromancer Pt 2
IV.  Bytor & Snow dog (without bells)
V.  Necromancer part 3
VI.  2112 overture
VII.  In the valley
VIII.  Dict. & Narp.
IX.  Temples of syrinx
X.  Discovery
XI.  Presentation
XII.  No one at the Bridge
XIII.  Oracle: the dream
XIV.  Hemispheres prelude

Side 2-
XV.  Apollo/Dion.
XVI.  Armageddon
XVII.  Cygnus X-1 Book 1
XVIII.  Cygnus: Bringer of balance
XIX.  the sphere
XX.  Panacea
XXI.  Soliloquy
XXII.  Bacchus plateau
XXIII.  Xanadu
XXIV.  The grand finale
XXV.  The fountain
XXVI.  Ending bells of By-tor and the snow dog

Now for an explanation of how this all fits together.  The "3 travelers"
in the necromancer are the 3 original founders of the priests of the
temples of syrinx.  The necromancer tells of a time when they were not in
total control of society.  The were weak, under control by the nec, which
can/may symbolize the elder race or their strong leader, when it was them
who held the power.  BT & tSD is placed after pt 2 to introduce the
character of by tor who would save the 3 travelers from the necromancer.
So its the snow dog and necromancer; symbols or representations of the
elder race vs. the 3 travelers and by tor; symbols or representatives of
what would become the formidable priests of the temples.  The necromancer
is obviously told from the perspective of the priests and bytor, their
liberator.  "the men are free to run now the labyrinth below"  Thus those
three travelers founded rulership of the priests of the temples

"and the meek shall inherit the earth"
The hero of the story is then born, in "in the valley" He is introduced to
the world and is full of innocence and wonder.  Then come along the dicts
and narps, other wise known as the priests of ttos that put a dark cloud
over the innocence.  Discovery and presentation follow and have the same
meaning they do in the song.  After the rejection of the heros "wonderful
device" he discovered.  He begins to feel alone, depressed, and with out
any guiding hand to show him the way.  These feelings are in "no 1 at the
bridge"  Then along comes the dream

Seeing how the elder race was expelled from their planet and cast away,
the hero sees images of art, and creative expression that the society he
was brought up in would not allow.  He now saw that there was some thing
more to life, awaiting the day the elder race would return to destroy the
temples

In the next part of his dream, He lived through the cygnus story:
traveling through a black hole to become the god of mediation, bringing
peace to a conflicted world.  Here he sees how one individual, himself can
have great power and influence on society.

Finally in panacea, the idealic quality of the world(s) he has experienced
in his dream are realized.  Panacea is a symbol of his dream.  The final
line, "my heart will lie beside you, and my wandering body grieves."  This
means that his heart and soul is tied to the nature and hopes of his
dream, but when he wakes up, he will be sucked back into the oppressive
society of the priests.

Waking up, he realizes how miserable things are and his lifeblood spills
over.  Bacchus plateau is the honoring of the heros death after he dies
and others heard about his confrontation with the priests.  One of the
themes in the song seems to be about contribution or giving to society.
"there's not much more to give"  The hero gave as much as he could.  At
the reception, with wine from the cask of 45, mourners realize this and
see the invaluable contribution this person has made, a step towards
social change.

Xanadu- This song creates the feel of the afterlife where our hero has
departed to.  Once he reaches it, he becomes imprisoned there never able
to leave.  Like many people longing to know what death or the after life
is like, the only way to know about it is to actually die, and once this
happens there is no returning to the "living world" to tell all your
friends about it.  

Finally the 2112 crisis is solved with the elder race? Assuming control.
However once change occurs it can often be confusing even if it is change
for the better.  The fountain explores these themes.  Having a mission,
reaching it, but being tired, confused, and exhausted from the journey.
"the point of the journey, is not to arrive"  Also, the goal, set out in
"in the valley" by one individual, what ever that goal was, has developed
into a goal shared by all by the time "the fountain is reached".  This is
a goal or dream of humanity in general and not necessarily liberation from
the priests.

"still I am" Our hero will never be forgotten by society.

Well, that is just my take on things.  By taking all of these songs apart
and recombining them, some have taken on new meanings.  This is definitely
double album material.

Thanks for listening everyone,
