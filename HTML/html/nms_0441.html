        Just got back from a local CD shop and finally the new Rush RTB
singles arrived.  Here are some details on the two formats I picked up.

        format 1:       -10" square vinyl limited ed. picture disc
                        - single die with "3" face showing on front
                        - 5 various photos on back
                                1 Neil, 1 Geddy, 1 Alex, the RTB cover
                                and all 3 with the dice background and
                                Alex and Geddy standing on the water.
                        -side 1: Roll The Bones
                        -side 2: The Pass, It's a Rap Part 1 Alex Lifeson
                                 speaks

        format 2:       -CD single AAD
                        -black disc with white dice all around the edge
                        -lyrics for RTB in the sleeve as well as new pictures
                        -cover of CD insert is same as front of 10"
                        -tracks: Roll The Bones, Where's My Thing,
                                 SuperConductor, It's a Rap Part 3 Neil Peart
                                 Speaks

        There are also some tour dates on both formats:
                10th April Sheffield
                12th April Birmingham NEC
                13th April Birmingham NEC
                15th April Glasgow SECC
                17th April London Wembley Arena
                18th April London Wembley Arena

        All I need now is the format with It's a Rap Part 2 where I assume
Ged will speak.

	First, many have said that Rush should have got the grammie
	because of their longevity. WELL WHAT ABOUT YES!?!? Do you
	think they ever got one? And they've been around longer. At
	least Rush gets awards in Canada.  Still, I would have been
	ecstatic for either Yes or Rush to win.

It just so hapens that Yes did win a Grammy for Best Instrumental for
the Year for Cinema off of 90125.  I guess that was in '84.

What does guitartist's guitarist mean ?

Technically brilliant but no real musical content perhaps ?

Not that this is a comment about eric in particulaler just a rather nonsense

I heard this on the police band.  '2112 Rush Road', apparently it was a
response to some inquiry to a license plate.  I wonder where that is?!
This is in West Lafayette, IN 47906.  I have no idea if there is a rush street
here at all.

I have a question involving the Necromancer on CoS that I didn't see in the
FAQ file.  Does anyone know if the Necromancer has any connection to J.R.R
Tolkein's classic _The Hobbit_?  Recently I started re-reading this work
and found a reference to a Necromancer that lived to the east who captured
Thorin's father and made him mindless.  In the song they say "mindless
spectre".  I know Neil has used Tolkein's works before ("Rivendell").  I
was just wondering about the connection with the Necromancer.  -If so, it
gives alot more meaning to the song.

	1) Thanks to The Black Sheep.  I don't feel so ignorant now!

	2) Wow,  Rush......The Swiss Army Knife of Rock........I like it!

	3) If anybody had the insight to tape the ABC thing, I'd like to get
	   a copy of it. My VHS took a shit the day before(wouldn't ya know!),
	   and I feel asleep trying to stay up for it (Damn that Ted Koppel,
	   and his ugly toupee!)

	4) Instead of an oldies tour, or even having the guys do a few selected
	   shows, maybe they could do a pay-per-view deal(yeah, yeah, yeah)
	   that way, we can tape it, and see it again any time we want!

	5) Maybe Neil wears the bandana to help keep the sweat out of his face?
	   After all, drumming is hard work, and Neil does put A LOT of energy
	   into his performance.

	6) Thanks to whoever put a guitar and bass tab archive on syrinx. The
	   stuff I tried has been very good, and suprisingly accurate!

[ That would be Frank Schaaperder for the guitar stuff and Mario D'Alessio for
  bass tabs and program.  Couldn't do it w/out you guys!            :rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="441010">Subject: MIAMI & ST. PETE **SPOILER**</A>

I just returned from my first trip down to Florida to see the boyz.  I
was blown away!!  Although these were my 8th and 9th shows on the tour, I
would have to say that Miami was one of the best shows I have ever seen (even
though rabbit # 1 had indigestion).  The moods of the boyz was amazing.
Alex had a tan, Geddy reached over into the audience to accept roses from
a woman fan.  Oh BTW, in Miami,\ I have never seen more women at a Rush show
in my life.  I would guess the ratio was close to 50/50 (staggering!).

I'm sure everyone knows the set so I won't mention it here but one highlihgt
was the beautiful melodic rideout in Bravado.  The crowd seemed to love
this.

In addition, I thought Primus was excellent.  There were even a whole bunch
of fans who were there to see Primus.  I got a chance to meet Les Claypool in
St. Pete and he was a very nice person.  He mentioned being a huge Rush fan
even to this day and he said that he saw the Hemispheres tour through the 
Signals tour.  Pretty cool.

I guess that's it for now.  I'm heading to Chapel Hill this weekend, anybody
out there gonna be there????

Bye.

I just received word that Primus is now confirmed as the support act for the
entire European Rush tour.  Apparently the boyz really dig this band and
they wanted them to come to Europe with them!!!

Enjoy.

Howdy, ya'll!

I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to the relationship between
the "Part IV" and "Trilogy" in the sub-title

   (Part IV, "Gangster of Boats" Trilogy)

>From Webster,

  tril-o-gy: a series of three dramas or literary works or sometimes
                         -----

             three musical compositions that are closely related and
             -----

             and develop a single theme

Just curious,

Rob

P.S. Hopefully, the "IV" means they'll have at least 3 more
     releases.  If you recall the 3 parts of Fear (The Witch
     Hunt-III, The Weapon-II, and The Enemy Within-I), they
     spread them out over 3 consecutive releases.

Greetings! This is my first posting after several months of reading.  It's
good to see that there are thousands of RUSH fans out there like myself.

Personally, I am glad that they don't win Grammys and that they don't make the
top 40.  If they did, that would mean that their songs appeal to the masses
which would mean their lyrics would be meaningless, people would be dancing to
their songs, and quality of the music would be bad.

A word about ticket sales.  I used to live in Mid-Michigan, where we would
only be able to get tickets to the second show in Detroit because by the time
we heard about the show, tickets for the first show would be sold out (always
in a couple of hours).  I moved down to Newport News/Hampton Virginia 7 months
ago, and heard from my brother in MI that he was seeing the Boyz shortly after
RTB was released.  Some guy at work told me about the FTP account, and Thanks
to you people, I was able to find out when they were coming to Hampton!  Now
this is the weird part: Tickets went on sale at 10 AM Jan 25.  I got there
(a local ticketmaster outlet) at 8:30 to find only a few people waiting in 
their
cars!! I got 13th row seats, and the March 8 concert still isn't sold out!  
This
really surprises me!  Another interesting point is that quite a few of the
people in line were die-hards, with knowledge of the band that rivals you
people on the list.  And none of them had heard, or had access to this list.
If you do the math, there must be thousands upon thousands of true RUSH fans
out there.  I've always had trouble finding them, and you're all out there,
which is a comforting thought.

The first time I saw them was in 1976, and I'm humbled to say I've only seen
them six or seven times since then.  It would be interesting to see the
demographics of this mailing list - ages, geographical locations, number of
shows seen, etc.

Well, that's all. I just wanted to say Hi and thanks to the founders and
management of this organization.

Tim

P.S. I have the same disease as Geddy, the one that makes your nose huge - I
also play bass, although I'm very bad.  I wonder if there's a correlation
between bass playing ability and nose size...Coincidence?????????

    No neat Rush stuff to report here, cept a brush with greatness. I
    unexpectedly was in Pensacola 2 days before the show. Didn't get
    to go though, had to leave. Now all you guys getting to see 2, 3
    or more shows should be ashamed! {:-)

    Oh yeah, to the poster who thought Primus sucked. He's right, they

  Again, it's time for the Kid to stir up some conversation (however brief)
  on some of the topics currently being discussed:

  1.) Re: the the grammies
--------------------------
     I don't have anything against Eric Johnson, I saw him live here at
  Virginia Tech and thought the show was great.  But I think that Rush should
  have beaten out Eric for the grammy.  "Cliffs of Dover" is a good song
  but it's nothing more than a Joe Satriani-like guitar-hero song.  To me,
  the more instruments you have in an instrumental, and the more melodious it
  sounds, the better the instrumental.  And WMT has 4 instruments going in
  it.  Where as CoD only has 2, and only 1 worth mentioning.  Enough said
  flame me at my address, not at NMS.

 2.)  Re: the cancer rumors
----------------------------

    I read Sean flanegan's message today and while I agreed with the
  fact that these people need to consider the source of these rumors
  which have been around for who knows how long, before they give them any
  merit.  But Sean, there's no need to rip them for being stupid...they
  probably had never heard the rumor before, so let them find out it's
  false, and then let things go.  Be cool, man...be cool.

3.)  Re: NMS shirts???
------------------------

      I haven't caught all the gist behind all this, but if it's what
  I'm thinking, I'd like to get in on it.  If someone who  knows all
  of the details, like, what we're gonna do, cost, etc... could get in
  touch with me via email, I'd be greatly appreciative.

4.)  Richmond show
-----------------------

      I'll be there.....  (just thought you'd like to know  *duck*)

   Everyone be cool now, ya hear???

III" or so,ething like that, subtitled "Neil Peart Speaks".  The
regular one has the first two tracks plus a live track from the last
album I think, and "More Rap Part II (Geddy Lee Speaks)".

Both sell for about $12 in the US, probably about \5 in the UK....
arrrrgh!

I may have gotten the track listings wrong, so please don't flame much...

What can I say, fabulofantastic show.

I suspect that I couln't have picked a better show to see Rush for the first
time...

This also motivated me to update my collection with CDs, since most of my tapes
either have worn out or met with sudden death.

So, I'm thinking of getting about 10-12 rush CDs.  I have a decent idea of
what I want, but if possible I'd like to get some list feedback...

Currently, I'm thinking about:
RTB
GUP
FTK
Hemispheres
Presto
Moving Pictures
ESLeft
Chronicles
2112
All the Worlds a stage
Limelight

Have I left any really good stuff out? (included any IYHO bad stuff?)

 Just some random thoughts from Greg Johnson (gjohnson@athena.cs.uga.edu)

  Gentlemen,

[ Hmmm, good trick if you can pull it off.  There was no NMS for Wed, 3/4!
  An easy way to keep track is to see if the issue numbers skip any.  If you
  notice a hole, you've missed an issue.  See the tail of ANY digest for the
  addresses of the email and ftp archive servers!                  :rush-mgr ]
