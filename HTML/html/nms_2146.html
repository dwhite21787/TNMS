<A NAME="2146001">Subject: More comments on DS</A>

Well, DS is out and time is going by.  I wonder if Rush
will be putting out new material.  However, keep one thing
in mind.  Rush has ALWAYS released new album rather
quickly, I for one am not surpized they have slowed a bit (especially
concsidering the recent tragedy).  I cannot say the same for many 
more bands outside of Rush.  Metallica, for instance, waited pretty 
darn long between "Load" and "Metallica" before releasing another 
album.  Queensryche is bad about this, even U2 slowed down a bit.  
I've always put Rush on a pedestal for this reason; they work so hard.  
They need breaks, too.  

I think it's fair to say that Rush will get back on it's feet in the time
to come, no matter what the circumstances.  Another, even longer break
for Rush will do them good - again.

Just thinking outloud on the NMS.....about Rush's future.

To speak of DS, I cannot get over the power of the live Roll The Bones.  
I've never enjoyed the studio version of RTB too much; mainly because 
of the weak bass.  The bass (and guitar) are cranked a good deal more
on DS; I love the song.

After a week + with this album, I like The Spirit of Radio the best overall.
The pace is a little fast, but that sounds  great with this song.  Geddy's
phrasing (I always talk about his phrasing) is very interesting.  It sounds
sort of like what I've heard on the "A Show of Hands" video.

Speaking of "A Show of Hands", all the stuff that album covered sounds
SO classic now that it's not even funny!!!!
I hope this material will still be played on a future tour!

Someone commented about the guitar during the verses of Tom Sawyer.
It sounds like to me that the clean guitar has been turned up (volume-wise)
just a notch.  I also believe the rythym of the arpeggiated chords
(single-notes
pciked from the chords) is accented by an added note (previously mentioned 
by someone else I think) and is also more in step with drums.  
VERY powerful.  The keyboards sound very crisp during TS also.

Dear Rush students,

I'm thinking about replacing my Rush albums with the re-masters. 
Question: is it worth the money?  

I have purchased thus far Exit...Stage Left and All The World's A Stage,
and the only difference I can detect is the volume of each.  Remastering
seems to have brought the music to the forefront of the volume knob on my
cd player.  

The decision I make will be based solely on what you, good people
suggest.  I trust your judgement.  You are, after all, fellow Rush
addicts.  

Thank you.

Different Stages debuts this week at #35 on the Billboard charts.  It's very
low, HOWEVER, this is a 3cd set, priced a little higher than normal, and has a
lot of competition out there.  I'm sure it will, in the long run, go gold.  

Ahhh, but who really cares where they are in the charts.  The more cultish a
band the better I like them usually.

Hey fellow Rush fans,

I was just talking to a coworker who likes progressive rock.  Basically,
he likes all these bands I've never heard of (and Tull).  He doesn't think
that Rush is progressive, tho he admits that he hasn't heard enough Rush
to really know.

So this is what I am going to do.  He is making me a mix tape or two of
his bands that I've never heard of (but would prolly like).  So I am going
to make him a tape of Progressive Rush.  The question is this.  What songs
do you think are the most "progressive"?  I already plan to include
Natural Science, The Analog Kid, Limelight, and La Villa.  What newer
songs do you think I should put on it?

I would appreciate any suggestions!

OK - I'm sure by now Clusterworks questions are getting tiresome, 
but this is only a minor detail I'm asking about:

I was a little slow in getting CW to work, but now it works fine.  I
really like the command to add a starry background, plus playing with the
number keys does interesting stuff too.  Then I found that there is a pop
up menu at the bottom of the screen.  That did some neat stuff.
Anyway, I've read that Mac users are able to sync up the music with the CW
display.
HOW?
I'm using a PowerMac 6500 (system 7.6.1), and when I play the CD via the
Apple CD Audio Player, all is fine, but if I start Clusterworks, it
interrupts the music and starts in with its own music.  What am I doing
differently than the rest of you?

 Actually, I don't think it could be called a "Tinkerlith" since Lith
means stone in Latin. And, as we all know, Tinkertoys were made of wood.
So "Tinkerlisk" is probably the our best option here.

Or the license plate is fake too--doesn't that make more sense?  

I choose to believe that it's really a February 1978 photo with LOTS of
doctoring.  Either that or it's really a 1998 photo with no doctoring
whatsoever.... Alex got dressed up, Geddy posed as a scalper and Neil went

Doing my best not to start a food argument.... Perhaps they (expecially Mr.
Books) simply arrive at a different opinion than you.  After all, one can be
aware of the horrors of factory farming and still choose to eat meat without
being an ignorant heartless bastard, no?  Actually, I think in the Roll The
Bones tourbook Geddy mused about eliminating red meat from his diet but I
think that was based more on health-related issues than animal rights
awareness.

Howdy,
   I recently bought the different stages cd . The problem I'm having is when
I put the first cd into my cd-rom drive and hit cancel for the cluster works
program ( I did install it by the way but don't want to mess with it every
time) I can't find the songs on the cd. The second disc works fine, and the
bonus cd. All I want to do is listen to the first cd via my computer. Does
anyone have any ideas ?? If so could you please reply to me directly since I
don't always have time to read every issue. Thanks in advance. I think Rush
did a great job on this one (Then again I think they always do a great job).

<A NAME="2146011">Subject: Limelight on DS</A>

To the guy who was complaining about the infamous "magic note" in Limelight
being omitted:
(The last note of the solo)

At first I agreed with your comment-the magic note is part of the
"character" of the song.  However, I later realized that Alex made a decision 
to drop the magic note when played live because of the "underlying theme" 
of the song-the lower arpeggios that the rhythm guitar plays during that part 
of the song are more important (obviously Alex played both parts in the 
studio).  When played live, he had to choose one or the other-the magic note
or the arpeggios-or overdub the rhythm, which would be totally bogus.  Not
to mention it would probably be kind of rough on Alex's hands to sustain that 
note every night on a 150 show tour (no flames, just kidding, I'm sure that 
wasn't the reason).  I also like the way the synths are re-written and/or 
brought up in the mix at the end of the song.

Does anybody else think Ged sounds like he's high when he addresses the
crowd after Limelight?

No friggin' way!  *I* was in front of Geddy, 5th row,

tall black guys with whom I had fun singing along with.  Do

Agreed, it was an utterly fanTAStic show.  I've seen them
I dunno, a dozen times, and this was easily the best of all.
Though my fading memory of Minneapolis in January '78 (how
soon before Hammersmith?) is of a very good show too.

The Rose Garden is very cool, and well located by the light

Morley makes a volume pedal, volume/wah, volume/phase (really bizarre
effect--total control of phase shift), and a distortion/wah--very Dr who
sounding.  They also had a contract with Synclavier to make a control
pedal for the 'clav, back when those monsters cost $40,000.  2 years
later, Korg and Roland offered almost all the same synth features for
$2000.  You can by a used 'clav (if you can find one) for about $500....

Alex used the volume/wah, I believe, and the controls indicate that is
what it is--the small pedal button at lower left switches from volume to
wah, and the dial on the left would be to determine sweep depth.  The
volume/wah has the same controls, but has twice as thick a base.

Hey you guys:

	How's this for a Rush siting?  I was taking class through the ICN (Iowa
Communication Network, as in taking clases over the interent), it was a
class about 20th century art for Academic Decathlon.  The ICN rooms are set
up so that there are classrooms all over the state, but you can't see the
other students.  Someone asked the question, "There is a phrase, 'Art as
expression, not as market campaigns, will still capture our imaginations.'"
I didn't listen to the rest of the question because I about fell off my
chair.  Anyway, if the person who was in that room is on this list, hello.
If not, oh well.  It was neat.

Thanks to all those who replied. I got some great responses.
I would just like to add that I would not stop listening to a band's music
because of their philosophical beliefs (I bought Metallica's 'Load'). I will
always love Rush, if only for what they have given me in the past. However,
what I feel can diminish in such circumstances, as I stated before, is
RESPECT, since that is inevitably tied to one's personal philosophy. Sorry to
those I may have wound-up.

How insulting...Why don't you keep these opinions on a computer forum or
something. I edit video on AVIDs every day, which run on Macs. I make my
living with them--in multiple editing facilities. But I will never own one.
They crash daily, and believe me, I work with some of the best service techs
in the business. And I can't wait until the day (within the next year) when
AVID releases their Windows NT version. BYE BYE MAC!!! Digidesign just
released Pro Tools 4.0 (the world standard digital audio workstation) for
Windows NT, so you can no longer say that Rush necessarily records their
music on a Mac. And should I mention Cakewalk, Cubase VST, Opcode Studio
Vision, Ensoniq PARIS, Event Electronics' Layla, Alesis PCR, Sound Forge,
Sonic Foundry ACID? All popular music software/hardware, all PC. All the

grows daily. Oh,
and PC's are the backbone of corporate America. Without 'em, no double digit
stock market growth, no highest US economic productivity in history, and no
explosion of internet technology. 95%+ of users just can't be wrong.

Macs are an expensive pain in the ass. They could have been fixed and been
the world standard (instead of 5% market share), if only Apple management
had listened to Bill Gates in 1985 and switched over to an open
architecture. Today, Macs would BE windows, and there would be no PCs--and
thanks to Bill Gates vision, the Macs would actually WORK! But the reality
is that Apple lost the vision and then the momentum. As software support
dwindles, and the publishing/entertainment exclusivity fades, Macs will
never again be more than a niche market. Macs are Beta to PC's VHS.
Remember--Microsoft now owns a good part of Apple. That's reality, no use
crying over spilt milk.

<A NAME="2146020">Subject: German DS, Dreamline and Jones Beach</A>

Hi folks, greetings from Germany!!

2nd post in 3 years, but I just have throw
in my 2 pence:

Two weeks back I went to my local record (cd)
store (as long as rush is concerned "dealer"
would be more suitable) and asked for DS. He said
that the release date for Germany would be 11/16/98.
So I was there that day and asked again. He replied that
it has been pushed back another week. Today is Sat, 8/21
and I just couldn`t wait any longer so I showed up again.
This time he recognized me when I came in and I didn´t
had to ask again. He said he has it but isn´t allowed to
sell it until Monday, 23rd. I said "Come on, I will pay double
price no matter what it actually costs". After a few discussions
we ended up with 50 DM (30 $) and I listen to it right now.

It´s perfect, it´s brilliant, I have no other words for it!!
Dreamline blows you away. It´s so powerfull. You 
really feel that this is raw live power. In the interview 
with Geddy a view items back the guy asked him
which songs they HAD to play in concert and he replied
"Tom Sawyer, Spirit of radio and Dreamline". I thought:
Yeah, the first two are real classics but I do not concider
Dreamline as a Rush classic. Listening to DS totally 
changed my mind. Dreamline is THE perfect opener
for a Rush show.  I always liked that song very much,
but now I consider it a real classic.
Overall I´m very, very pleased with this record, but there are
a few things which would have made it even better:

1. I wish they would have taken all songs from the Chicago
show. Obviously I don´t know how the other songs from 
Chicago (which they didn´t take for the album) sound like
but I think especially "Bravado" and "Show don´t tell" (which are 
still great) lack that "raw power" from the Chicago show.
Just my opinion, so don´t flame. Maybe I have to listen 
to DS more often. 

2. I would have been very glad if they added some 
Presto stuff (War Paint, The pass) especially when 
there´s space left on the CDs.

3. I also have trouble with that Clusterwork stuff.
My computer doesn´t recognize the first CD as enhanced.
Only the songs are listed. My drive is a new one (six month
old) and I think my video card (S3 Virge DX 4MB) is set
up correctly. So any help on that problem is appreciated.
Besides there is nothing on the cover that states that any of 
the CDs are enhanced. Maybe the European release isn´t
enhanced at all.

Some other things:
Listening to DS brings back a few memories of  the summer
of ´97. When I heard that Rush would do no European shows
on the TFE Tour I knew that I had to fly to the U.S. to see them
(I saw them only once before in Cologne in ´92 on the RTB Tour).
I ordered the tickets for the Jones Beach show by phone through 
Ticketmaster and booked a flight to New York. I wasn´t sure if
everything would work out with tickets and so on because 
Ticketmaster does not send them overseas. You have to grab them 
up at the venue at the day of the concert. Anyway, it all worked out 
and I spent 5 fabulous days in New York City. Than I rented a car 
and drove to Long Island. 
I was at the venue around 4pm and had the chance
to listen to the soundcheck from outside. The weather was perfect 
that day and the night was very comfortable. You know, Jones 
Beach Amphitheatre is a perfect venue for an open air show.
The stage is set on the water and the audience is seated on the
land. Actually nobody sat down that night, at least around my area.
I had seats way up high but the bunch around that corner were
on their feet the whole show and we all had a great time.
Indeed one of the greatest days in my life. I wondered if any 
other Germans/Europeans attented that show at Jones Beach
on June, 25th. Please email privatly about your experience.

That´s it for now. Sorry for consuming so much bandwidth.
Thanx to BOTH rush-mgrs for their great work
which keeps us poor Europeans a little up to date.

Take care all,  Holger

Fellow Rushians,

            I feel priveleged to live in an area where they DO play alot
of Rush on the radio! KOZE 96.5 in Lewiston Idaho ROCKS!!!! They play a
good mix of Rush tunes everyday--4-6 or more a day-the station is about
a 1/2 mile from my house across the river(I live in Washington) & the
station program director stated that "Rush is one of the CORE BANDS in
our Format!!!!" Rush on all!

    P,S. The show at the Gorge in George WA was Fantastic-wonder a bit
why they did'nt use any of it on DS--Oh well........

<A NAME="2146022">Subject: The Different Stages Packaging.</A>

Greetings All Siblings of Rushland-

Okay here's my take on the packaging. I don't know if anyone has pointed
this out, but my understanding about the non-jewel case deal was that it
is environmentally safer. Okay with me.

Regarding the meaning of the tinkertoys, on the back of the CD, there is
a yellow dot next to "set one", a red dot next to "set two", and a blue
dot next to "set three". So I imagine that the blocks on the front
represent each of the CD's-although I would think that the Hammersmith
CD would be the separate one. I can't explain that. By the way, can
anyone tell me who "H.S." is? (the initials next to 'see attached data'
under the blueprint on the back cover)

Just my opinion, but the inside photo of the masses surrounding the
tinkertoys should have been the front cover (I think that about 'Hold
Your Fire', too- I just like the detailed stuff).

The inside layout of Rush's history is cleverly done. In fact it would
make a great poster, in case anyone with the means is listening. If you
are you must not work for Atlantic Records (okay, that was a cheap shot.
But if anyone from Atlantic is listening, YOU HAVE A GOLD MINE HERE.)

On the inside cover, there is a photo of the band with flames in the
background. That's them playing "Double Agent", ironically not on this
CD (I'm NOT whining-I'm just pointing out the irony of it. It's still a
great shot).

I love the picture of the Hammersmith (by the way, since my last name is
Smith, you may all feel free to call me HammerSmith). Especially Geddy.
It just looks funny watching him scalp tickets.

Finally, a tiny, tiny flaw. Next to "Bravado" in the liner notes, it
says "Philadelphia, Corestates Center, Counterparts". On the
Counterparts tour, Rush played the Corestates Spectrum. Just a minor
detail. By the way THANK YOU RUSH for letting me be on your CD. I am one
of the many people cheering in the background in "Bravado".

Any hidden meaning to other stuff would be greatly appreciated.

Till next time,
HammerSmith signing off...

<A NAME="2146023">Subject: Bad Billboard showing & EW review (This is NOT a happy post!)</A>

Hello all,
     Well, I just checked the Billboard website and DS debuted at 35! This is
the worst showing on the charts since Hemispheres! (I think.) Yes, there was
more promotion for DS, but considering it was only promoted semi-regularly for
about a week, not enough folks knew about it!         THAT SUCKS BIG TIME!
Yes, I know that live albums don't sell as well as studio albums, but C'mon!
ASOH and ESL both made it in the top 20 (from what I remember) And don't
expect DS to move up the charts, since everybody and their brother is
releasing CDs this week. Oh well, I guess we ARE an exclusive group.
     Speaking of "THAT SUCKS BIG TIME"... Here is the review of DS from
Entertainment Weekly. Brace yourselves.........

     It takes chutzpah to put out a forth live album if you're not The DEAD or
The STONES, but apparently Canada's most beloved power trio is determined to
carry the prog-rock lighter--er, torch -- into the new millennium. This three
CD set, from tours in'78 and '97, showcases how adeptly RUSH can replicate
masturbatory masterpieces like "2112" and "Natural Science." That said, the
band's recent material rings hollow, the drum solo ain't happening, and you
can find comparable versions of the halcyon tracks on the other three live
discs. C+
      DAN SNIETSON

     Oh my God! What a wise ass! He couldn't just say that RUSH takes it's
music seriously, and makes sure to give the best product there is. He also
could have just said, some of these songs are on past live efforts, but
powerful additions like the first ever complete live version of "2112" and the
first live appearances of fan favorite "Natural Science," make it a treat for
longtime fans of the band. HOW HARD IS THAT, DAN?! What a punk! The drum solo
ain't happening??!! Let's see you do what Neil does Danny Boy! I'm surprised
that he actually gave it a C+ !
     Yes, I understand that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but
show a little class!
        Pissed off,

My brother and I were at the 6/14/97 show at the New World Music Theater in
Tinley Park, IL which eventually ended up comprising most of the fantastic new
Different Stages recording.  The energy and the atmosphere that night really
was fantastic- a more gorgeous evening could not have been asked for.  I'm
ecstatic to be able to relive that great show with the new album and proud to
be able to say to everyone "I was there!".  

For a short time during a song, which my brother and I believe was Driven,
Alex's guitar sound went out.  We believe that this is the reason behind the
guy saying "shake it off" to Alex- Alex did seem a bit peeved about it when it
happened.  

Geddy's bass solo, we also believe, happened as a direct result of Alex's
sound going out- the band needed to do SOMETHING while they fixed Alex's
sound.  This brings up an interesting question- Did Geddy play a bass solo at
other shows than this one during Driven?  I'm curious as to if the solo was
planned and a regular part of their set on this tour or if was only done out
of emergency, as this one appeared to be at the time it happened.  

Fantastic concert and a fantastic new offering from the band who continue to
be the biggest musical inspiration in my life- Rush.

<A NAME="2146025">Subject: Miscellany RE:DS, and MTV</A>

Hello all...

A few things that crossed my mind after reading the many posts 
regarding everyone's favorite live album:

Who cares if the song is listed as "THE Analog Kid" or merely "Analog 
Kid"? If you are one of the people who wondered what the "meaning" 
behind this shattering change in something so phenomenally important 
was,  I think it's safe to say you might need to spend a little more 
time reading, exericising, practicing, having sex, meditating and/or 
praying, cooking, drawing relief maps of Nebraska, arguing whether 
essence precedes existence or vice versa, or carefully reasearching 
how many angels can succesfully rollerblade on the head of a pin. 
Sheesh.... It's a goddamn cd, not the Tibetan Book of the Dead.

Also, to people who lament the absence of the high, squealy, 
sustaining guitar note that continues under the vocal at the end of 
"Limelight", with their protests of "that's how the song goes, you 
just don't leave shit like that out", I offer this suggestion--get 
over it. If you had some anal-retentive fanboy berating you for not 
playing music YOU WROTE just the way he likes to hear it, you'd 
probably tell him to go get bent. And you'd be right in doing so. 
When playing music I wrote almost twenty years ago, I invariably mess 
about with arrangements, just to keep it fresh and interesting. I 
have no doubt that the members of Rush do the same thing. It could 
also be that Alex just didn't feel like stepping on his sample-and-
hold pedal at that point in the set anymore. It's one note in one 
song, not a verse in the Book of Psalms.

I really don't mean to flame anyone, and I apologize if I sound harsh,
 but I think that there are some topics that are so irrelevant that I 
am flabbergasted when I see supposedly intelligent people wasting 
valuable online time on them rather than discussing things about this 
band that might actually warrant discussion. Every single one of us 
is smarter than that...  

As far as complaining about Rush not getting on MTV goes--just stop. 
MTV is the music industry's way of wetting on our leg while telling 
us it's raining. It is a clearing house for bad music, ugly clothes, 
and bankrupt imagery, and I for one am glad that there is no chance 
of seeing Rush there. Any excuse I can think of to NOT watch MTV is a 
blessing. I LISTEN to music. WATCHING music is just another of the 
powers-that-be's clever ploys to inhibit our imaginations. How else 
are they going to sell the crap they've been given in the first place?

When I think of all the truly fantastic music that doesn't get on MTV,
 or VH1 for that matter, I just cry...

There are many worthy artists who have worked hard for years to get 
the success they so richly deserve. They have created audiences for 
themselves without MTV, or in the case of some country performers, 
TNN. Rather than complain that these institutions don't meet our 
needs, why don't we abandon them for ones that might do better? It is 
better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.

Just had to get these matters off my chest,
Matt

While Bravado is one of my favorite songs on RTB and I do think the extended
solo on DS adds to the song, the version found on the Animated bootleg is
superior to DS.  The solo is completely different between the two shows.  On
Animated, Alex gets into the solo right away and is very active, while on DS
it's much more laid back for the first 30 seconds or so.  While I was aware
Alex varies the solo from show to show, this was very surprising since the two
shows were recorded only a week apart.  Maybe they didn't use that version
because of some recording problem that's not evident from the bootleg.  Anyone
else whose heard the Animated version have any feelings on it?

Rush entered Billboard at #35 for the week ending November 28th.
Springsteen's new "Tracks" entered the same week at #27. Rush's initial
entry was its peak position for the last few records including RTB, CP,
and TFE. I think this trend will be broken with DS. Either that or Rush
will fail to reach the Top 20 (or even 30) for the first time since
Hemispheres.

Rolling Stone has yet to review either album. Springsteen will certainly
get a review, which suggests the same for Rush, since they were released
around the same time, not to mention rumors of a "major POSITIVE" review
for Rush. Both albums are still in the "Recent Releases" section of RS
Recordings online.

I wonder if this picture wasn't an alteration of the photo of the front of 
the Hammersmith Odeon that appeared in the MP tourbook.  Apparently, Rush 
was there in support of PeW either before or after it was released.  Note 
too that the "RUSH" on the posters is the same lettiering used on PeW, and 
Joan Armatrading was coming there afterward in the tourbook photo.

Can anyone who still has the MP tourbook confirm this?  (I'd rather not talk 
about why I don't still have it :-))

There are several possibilities:

if he was using particularly light-gauge strings (I think he uses an
>.008" high E), it may not have enough mass to generate sufficient signal
for more distortion.  The pickup may have been a bit set a bit low
physically, and too distant to pick it up properly.  There are various
processors that are frequency-sensitive, and he may have been using one
or more of those.

I"ll give it another listen and get back to you if I can determine
better.
