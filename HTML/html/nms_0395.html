There are two new bass tab files at the ftp site, for "Dreamline" and
"Closer To The Heart".  Enjoy.

There was no NMS for Thursday, 12/5.  There will be two today to make
up for that.

<A NAME="395003">Subject: My nervous Rockline experience</A>

I'm glad to hear that at least one of us NMS'ers got to ask Neil a question.
(Good question Amy!).  I just wanted to share my (nervous) experience.

I started calling at 6:00pm PST by just continuing to use my redial button
(no fancy electronics necessary) and got a ring at about 8:15.  (The show
starts at 8:30 on the West coast.)  A man with an (I guess British) accent
answered within a few minutes and asked me what questions I had for Neil
Peart (of course he pronounced it wrong--it rhymes with ear).  I stated
the questions I had written down, and he said that one of them was taken,
and proceeded to give me a question that he thought I should use--which
was vaguely related to the one I was going to ask, but not really.  I
proceeded to kiss up by saying "yeah, that's a good question" while he
was saying "well, it's really your idea, only a little different".  My
question was basically, "would you guys ever consider expanding the show
beyond 2 hours, and possibly drop the opening act".  The man wanted me to
ask "did you guys feel constrained by the time limitations of vinyl and
would albums like 2112 and Hemispheres have been longer, had CD been
available."  Well they were both related to time constraints...yeah, right.
I didn't really care what question I asked, as long as I got to talk to
Neil.  I was also going to ask Neil if he had any plans to publish any
other forms of writing.

So, he said to keep listening to the phone, but there was no guarantee
that I would get on.  "It's up to the producer.", he said, "I think he'll
like your question."

So I started my tape recorder and got myself some water--my mouth was
getting dry from the thought that I might actually get to speak with
Neil Peart.  I waited.  Right before the show, someone came on the phone
and asked "What's your question again?"  Then they played the show over
the phone.  I timed a 4 second delay before it hit the airwaves of our
local radio station.  I don't know if that is to catch swearing, or just
a satellite delay--probably the latter.

Every time I heard BC go to the phones for questions, I got psyched up.
I didn't know if they were going to give me warning or not.  I rehearsed
my questions and changed them a little (didn't want to sound like a fool
in front of a man who writes for a living).  I considered praising Neil
before asking my questions, but quickly dropped that idea after hearing
a guy drool all over himself about how cool it was to talk to Neil, and
how great he was, etc.  That really pissed me off--that he wasted so much
of our (the callers') precious time.  Toward the end of the show, I
finally heard the question that was supposedly too much like my original
question--something like "how do you guys pick the songs to fit 2 hours".
(Didn't someone ask Geddy and Alex that question last time?)

Then the show ended.  My heart dropped.  I waited on the line to see if
there was any kind of "thanks for calling" or "we'll send you a T-shirt"
>...nothing but silence.  I hung up.  "Oh, well...maybe next time."

In retrospect, I think I was just too far at the end of the line of
calls--I got through at only 15 minutes before the show.  Then again,
maybe the producer just didn't like my questions.  Whatever.
I was glad to know that they screen the questions, but perturbed that
they would put a question into my mouth.  But, I guess that's better
than saying "sorry...that question's taken...bye (click)".

Good luck to all next time,
-Alan

<A NAME="395004">Subject: Roll the risks</A>

Just thought this interesting. I was reading an assignment for the completion
of a take-home exam in Communication at OSU, when I ran into this.
Seems that Hans Magnus Enzensberger, a British theorist had some interesting
ideas about taking chances.
Here's a quote from the article.....

Enzensberger, concerned over what he called "the industrialization of the mind"
and the debilitating impact of products of cultural industries on human
consciousness, still held out a hopeful prospect. Despite the awful effect
of applying the techniques of industrialization to the activity of the mind,
there remained, according to Enzensberger, one human quality that the dominant
system could not entirely subdue. At the same time, it could not do without
it. This is the creativity of individuals, the same creativity that provided
the compelling products of the cultural industries.
Enzensberger believed that this creative talent, however much it was
harnessed fot systemic ends, remained a source of potential resistance and
change. Fully aware of the risk of participating, Enzensberger still
concluded that there was no way for intellectuals and creative individuals
to opt out of the system. Though the consciousness industry-an inclusive
term for many ways in which consciousness is influenced by the products of 
the  cultural industries- preempted everything it came in contact with, he
recommended that the creative ones "enter the game....take and calculate the
risks."

Thought this was extremely related.
Thanks

Eric.

yes - this happenned about 3 weeks ago on KOME (San Jose, CA). i
immediately called the station and got the DJ on the line. he said "sorry,
i just play what i'm told". he gave me the phone number of the program
office, so i called them. i was forwared a few times 'till i got the
program director. we spoke for about 15 min's or so. he explained that,
when the album first came out, and they played RTB, they had phone calls
complaining about the rap section!!!! the record company wanted them to
give the song airplay, so they decided to try an edited version. i told him
i was a major Rush fan, as are many of my friends, and that we all think
the rap section is great -- and an integral part of the song, etc. he said
"i just play what you all want to hear, so if you don't want to hear the
edited version of RTB, we won't play it.". the next time - and every other
time i've heard RTB on KOME (and it's been getting lots of airplay lately),
it's been the un-edited version!

>I'm tempted to call them up and ask them why the hell they did it.

you should *definitely* call them and complain. it is very likely that it
WILL make a difference!!!

I have a tape of Rockline, for all those who would like a copy.  I almost
definitely cannot be talked into transcribing it, but would be more than
happy to make tapes of it.

About the GUP video, if my memory serves, the music under the credits is
"Afterimage".  It is the part before the guitar solo, where a sax like
sound is playing a melody.  I believe they play this part twice under the
credits.

Out here in La-La land, Rush is playing two shows, as they have since the
Signals tour and maybe before, at the LA (oops, I mean Great Western) Forum.
Tickets went on sale for the first show about two weeks ago, and for
the first time in my life that I've ever seen this, floor and loge
seats were selling for $39 (!) each, but colonnade seats were $26.
Most people, including myself, thought they'd wait for a second show
to go on sale after the $39 tix were gone, but a second show was never
announced.  The following Saturday it was, but the first people in
line ended up with colonnade seats behind the stage, as if TicketBastard
wasn't carrying the good seats at all.

Did this happen anywhere else in the country, with two prices for tickets?
Anyone in LA get the better seats for the second show?

I have a fair-quality tape of the 12/2/91 Rockline interview with Neil.
If you want a copy, email and we'll work out a deal.
It would be nice to have it transcribed for the NMS, but that would be a major
project, as Neil tended to be quite talkative.  There were several FAQ answers
in there; ie. 'brought to you by the letter __', 'Gangster of Boats', mystery
rapper, 'click tracks', etc.  I'm sure someone will submit the good ones to
the keeper of the FAQL.

you know you listen to an album too much when you're watching "The Mother of 
all Music Videos.", i.e. Fantasia and durin the scene with the mushrooms 
dancing to Tychovski's "The Nutcracker Suite" (the 'shrooms are moving in 
a circle, and as they comme to the front, they get taller and thinner), 
all you can thing of is:
			"It's a parralax, you dig?
			 You move around--small gets big, it's a rig."
pretty sad, huh?

P.S.	If you had any reservations about getting Fantasia on tape,  you know,
	being worried that it doesn't make the transition well, there's only
	one section that i was aware that i was missing something.  in short,
	they did an incredible job.

SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yo People,
Well, I just saw the Boyz from the 4th row last night...........
what can I say?  GODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Boyz were incredible, and "Bravado" & "Superconductor" sounded
even better than they did in the 1st Philly show.  Geddy actually
noticed me during "Freewill/Distant Early Warning" - needless to say,
I enjoyed my evening!  I won't bore you w/ long diatribes about the night.
All I'll say is - DO NOT MISS THIS TOUR IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO GO!!!!!

I would agree that Neil was rather humble, and handled himself
well on Rockline.  He did a great job deflecting the many (and
completely justifiable) comparisons to God.  I actually thought
he was quite funny, given the serious nature of the questions
posed to him.

Yes, that's right... I too forgot that Rockline was on last Monday and
when I started reading the last couple of articles, I got pissed cause
I forgot it was on.  I kept telling myself to not forget about it but
I did anyway (damn!)  That's what I get for not writing it down I guess.

Will any kind soul that happened to tape it send it to me?  I'll pay for

Greetings,

  Well, there seem to be at least a handful of us who managed to miss
the Rockline interview somehow.

  Did anybody tape it?  Perhaps we should arrange a method for copying
and distribution?

  I can make copies, but I'm afraid they'll be stuck with whatever kind
of noise reduction the original has, as one of my decks only has dbx, so
I'd have to leave NR off...

In response to the inquiry about the music played between the concert portion
of the Grace Under Pressure video and the Big Money video, the song is
"Afterimage" from Grace Under Pressure.  It is the second song on the CD, in
case you're curious.

As long as I'm online, I'd like to express my great pleasure with the concert
I attended tonight at the Capital Centre in D.C.  I was not so impressed with
the light show, and some things about the show in general were just too
predictable, but the boyz played like a well-oiled machine - not stiff or
dead at all.  All in all, it was a good, solid show.  Nothing out of this 
world,
but a good show nonetheless.  Also, when Geddy introduced Neil's solo, it
sounded to me as if he pronounced Neil's last name "Peert," for whatever
that's worth - it's my $.02!
