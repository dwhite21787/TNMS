At some point yesterday evening Syrinx crashed/rebooted due to a 
severe thunderstorm in these parts.  If you had any problems with
the anonymous ftp, or got two copies of yesterday's digest, that
explains it.

Also, the Mac sounds directory on Syrinx has been removed.  The
files there were uploaded improperly, and were unusable.  They should
reappear sometime soon.

Folks, PLEASE send your administrative mail to the administrative address.
I think I'm actually "blue in the face" from saying this.  1/2 :-)

My $4.69 worth:  (hey, we are in a recession, aren't we??)

To paco@news.cc.wm.edu:
-----------------------

1.) What you say about our friend Rupert Hine may be true...he was
credited for keyboards and backing vocals...he was the voice saying
"Superconductor"...but he is not the mystery rapper on _Roll The Bones_.
I'll tell you (and the world for that matter) why it is not:

  On August 29...Q107 out of Toronto broadcast the CD launch of
_Bones_ and it was carried simulcast all across the nation.  Before
the DJ played RTB he, Geddy and Alex were talking about it, and he
said that he had believed that Rupert was the rapper, but Geddy
was quick to point out that he was not.  But he didn't say who it was.
The only other person I know who could have possible done it is
"Jack Secret" a.k.a. Tony Gerainos.  It doesn't take much voice
altering to get Tony's voice to sound like that.
I could be wrong...but I know *FOR SURE* it isn't Rupert Hine.
No flames...just makin' the public more aware.... :)

To Bob Foery (bobf@verdix.com)
------------------------------

2.)  Dude...I will gladly tak a part in this bet.  since you're just
a couple hundred miles up the road, it won't take to long to get up there.
(I''m down here at Va Tech in Blacksburg.)  So count me in.!!!!!!

Well, that's almost $4.69, but who's counting....??????

It's a possiblity.  They have already reached their highest chart position
ever (#3 for Moving Pictures in '81) so I wouldn't be surprised if RTB
would surpass that and hit #1.  It would be quite an acheivement, indeed.
Now if Metallica would drop out of there this week... :)

The latest Billboard magazine (Sept. 21, 1991) contained:

****
Rush Rolls In At No. 3 As Vets Have Their Day

RUSH's "Roll the Bones" enters The Billboard 200 Top Albums chart
at No. 3, instantly matching the peak position of the band's
highest-charting album, "Moving Pictures."  The veteran hard-rock
band racked up six consecutive top 10 albums between 1980 and 1985,
but missed the mark with its last two studio releases, "Hold Your
Fire," which peaked at No. 13 in 1987, and "Presto," which stalled at
No. 16 in late 1989.

The lackluster showing of "Presto" was especially disappointing because
it was the band's first album for Atlantic following a 15-year stint
with Mercury/PolyGram.  But the No. 3 debut of the band's second
Atlantic release more than compensates.
****

Not bad eh!  But that's not all!  Billboard also has charts for singles
and such.  On the "Album Rock Tracks" chart:
               __________________________________

              |__________________________________|

Last week: #2, two weeks ago: #5, weeks on chart:3

Also, on the actual Billboard 200 chart, there is a note (*) meaning
that the vinyl LP is unavailable.  Only CD and cassette!

Also in the issue: a Full page color ad for RTB!  It is the CD cover
with the following text in BIG letters over the water:

The new charting system called "Sound Scan" might be somewhat
responsible for the high rankings, but what the heck!

This is my first posting to the NMS, so excuse me if this question sounds
stupid.  Does anyone else hear dogs barking during a part of Dreamline?  A
friend of mine insists that I am crazy, but I'm sure I hear them.  Anyway I
would like to comment on the fact that I'm baffled over how a person can
guess what the Boyz will play live.  I saw them hear in Pittsburgh last June
and I was shocked when they played Freewill second and even more shocked
when I heard the birds chirping and the sampled wood blocks before they kicked
into Xanadu.  

[ I know *I* screamed myself hoarse at that point...               :rush-mgr ]

              Also, even if these posters are clairvoyent or something why
wouldn't you include "Marathon" on your list?  It is definitely one of their
most powerful live tunes.  Well thanks for your time and keep Rushing Thru
Time.

Who Jack Secret is, I don't know...
 But I did notice this today...

  On the Blue Oyster Cult album "Imaginos" (1989) there is a
Jack Secret listed under the additional musicians as a vocalist.

Is it just me, or does Tony Geranios look like Mick Mars. That's
what I thought of him when I met him.

Well. I really didn't want to post this, as it is kinda a useless post.
But.
(you knew that was coming...)
I don't understand these album reviews. When I read a review, I look
for facts...an opinion or two is okay, but violent opinions, bashing of
others' reviews, statements backed up by nothing..they just annoy me.
I would post my comments about the new album, but after the multitude
of 'reviews', it would be useless.
Maybe it is just me, but I hate reading 1000+ lines and having a good
portion of it the same boring flames/silliness so abundant in the big
usenet groups.
Maybe I'm missing out on some important point? :)
Oh, and does anybody else hear the beginning of Dreamline and
automatically think Billy Joel?
Tnx 4 your time.

This may be a FAQ, but it's not on the list, so I'll ask it anyway.
If it is indeed a FAQ, would someone just write me directly and yell
at me there?  At any rate, it'll break up the RTB rantings/ravings/
whinings/screamings/flamings.

On my (tape) copy of Exit...Stage Left, Xanadu isn't Xanadu.  It's
spelled Zanadu on both the tape case insert and the tape itself.  The
only other person I've spoken to that knew anything's copy said
Xanadu.  Note that this copy wasn't sold back in 1981 when it was
released, but instead shortly after I became a Rush fan about two
years back.  What I want to know is if this is a big deal, or instead
a well-known screwup that no one gives a damn about.  I thought it
was pretty neat, but maybe the rest of the world doesn't.

Thanks much.                            - Chris

My recollection is that Geddy Lee was responsible for both the
music and lyrics of "Tears", just as Alex was for "Lessons" from
the same album.  Not surprisingly, the lyrics to both of these
little ditties are comparitively sophomoric... hey, put down that

In the last issue of TMNS, someone mentioned "Tears" as a good love song
that Neil wrote.  Well, Geddy wrote both the lyrics and music to that song,
I know because it was my and my ex-boyfriend's "song."  He was the one to
turn me on to Rush.  He made the tape for me and I cried as I listened to it.
One of the first Rush songs I listened to except for ESL and COS.

My current fiance and I don't have a "song."  I think we need to get one.

I just heard on the radio that RUSH will be playing in Pittsburgh. They
didn't know the exact date, but they said 'soon'. Anyone know anything
else?
By the way, at first, I wasn't thriled with RtB, but after a few days
off from listening to it, i played it again today and loved it.

Give it a chance.

I, for one, like the rap section on 'RTB'.  I don't know who it is but
I don't think it's one of the boyz.  My theory is that, in concert, it
will be sampled and we'll see the mystery speaker on the big video screen
ala Aimee Mann.

Gotta love those Knopfler-esque riffs in 'Ghost'.  I could listen to
a whole album of that.  I can see it now, Alex covering 'Sultans of
Swing' ...

hmmmm... I always thought that Rush had the best and most thoughtful
lyrics in the buisiness...  At least, they are usually thought -
provoking to me, which is more than can be said for most other
lyrics.

As far as "deepness" goes - my English teacher once refused to
include "Tom Sawyer" in his lessons (I had recommended it to him) on
the grounds that it would be too difficult; we did a Shakespeare
sonnet instead, if I remember correctly.

I presume from the comparison with Collin's "Day in Paradise" that
you find "Heresy" disgusting because of too much sentimentality.  I
won't argue personal taste, but I still think the comparison is
unfair.  "Heresy" is about the damage that has been done to people's
lives by communism and the Cold War, which is not a happy subject.

Of course, it is possible to treat this subject in a more positive
way, by focusing on possible future developments, but the Scorpions
have already done so in "Winds of Change", so what was left? :-)

I don't doublt you'll all recognize the second verse from
"The Weapon":

He's not afraid of your judgement
He knows of horrors worse than your Hell
He's a little bit afraid of dying --
But he's a lot more afraid of your lying

And the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him...

Who, esteemed net.rush.experts, is he?  I've thought of several
possibilities, including all kinds of political, economic or
military leaders - but they all (to me) seem to founder on the "But
he's a lot -" line.  Why should somebody like that be afraid of
somebody else lying (in a public opinion poll, or what?)

[ I think it's along the lines of "I can deal with what I know, or see
  coming; I can't deal with subterfuge and lies."  Kind of like Klingons;
  they gladly face death with a known enemy, but to be poisoned has no
  honour.  Just a guess...                                      :rush-mgr ]
