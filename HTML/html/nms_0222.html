There was some problem encountered when mailing out the NMS yesterday
(Monday, 4/22/91).  Apparently there was a problem with the routing
tables, and anyone with an address that ended with "nasa.gov" or "nih.gov"
got bounced back with "host unknown".  Today I got this from our network
group:

 >In case anyone has been having problems getting to Internet sites
 >in the GOV domain since Saturday morning...
 >
 >It appears that the Network Information Center (NIC) for the Internet
 >put out a bogus root update for the GOV domain that did not include either

 >not to work to those sites.
 >
 >We have notified the NIC of their errors and things should be getting

Hopefully this will take care of things.  To get the missed issue, you
can either ftp or mail for it (see any digest tail for info).

[ After posting this, I've been informed that not all name servers will be
  updated when this is mailed - it depends upon which ones are queried at
  mailing time whether those sites will be recognized. ]

Yeah, and even the name is an allusion to Rush. Look:

Mystery (refers to Xanadu - "....immortality, the deepest MYSTERY...")
Science (obviously Natural Science)
Theatre (Theatre = Concert Hall : Spirit of Radio)
3000 (Obviously a clever reference to 2112 disguised by adding 888 to it)

(Insert copious amounts of smileys and other sarcastic symbols here! :-) )

 By an allusion in every show, I simply meant that Tom Servo's name is
mentioned every time. I certainly didn't mean that the show contained a
different mention each time...

[ Ok, my fault for not being more clear.  My question is "How do you come
  by the theory that Tom Servo is an analogy for Tom Sawyer?"  Where did you
  read/see this?  I ask this   because the comment "I'll bet you listen to
  Rush" is the only Rush-related thing I've heard (in response to a viewer's

     Last night I listen to this part on my Sony Diskman.   The Sony DT-4 is
great because it has a repeat mode that will keep playing one portion of the
song over and over.  Also I have found out that if I use the head phone jack
and carefully insert the headphones, I can block out some of the tracks.   For
example, on 'Show, don't tell' I can block out Geddys vocals and plainly hear
neil say 'give the jury direction....'.  I know this sounds crazy, but it
works if you use the right touch when placing the Headphones into the jack.
Ok, getting back to my topic, after neil says "We've got to protect our
children!"  I can hear him saying'

   "The war must be just!"

     A few seconds after that, you can hear some chanting.  Well, I still have
not figured out what the chant is, but i'm working on it.  Oh... Before anyone
goes home tonight and tries this with their own CD player, I found that this
only works on a certin size of headphones.  I think the shaft of the jack
has to be a certin size and length.  However, listening to albums like this is
a great experience.  On 'Time stands still' You can listen to just Neils drum
part and some of the accompining guitar work, but geddys voice is recorded on
another track so it's blocked out (this makes a great way to sing along).

     Oh well, sorry for any spelling problems (English is not my major).
Just wanted to make my small contribution to the NMS!

     OH, Would anyone like to guess what the new album is titled?  My guess
is "Never The Less".   Just poped into my head and thought it sounded like
a Rush album title ;)

	In reference to the posting yesterday by (I'm sorry...I'm too lazy
to go back through and read who it was) a gentleman claiming that the song
Anthem is "obviously" taken from Ayn Rand's book by the same title - I must
disagree. Alas, it is _2112_ , NOT _Anthem_ that more closely parallels the
book. Have you read it? I know it's confusing but ... trust me.

Just took a listen: to me, it sounds less like a "nasty droning" and
more like a Taurus pedal (or other low synthesizer) augmenting the bass
which doesn't appear until a measure later.  It lasts pretty steadily
through the intro on the album, but does not seem to be on the live
version on ASOH.  My guess is that if was unintentional, it would be
very unlikely to be so well in tune.

Just a few things about conserts.  I'm not sure, but I think the Steve
Morse Band opened up for Rush in Dec '85 in Pittsburgh on PoW
tour and they did not get a good response, but I don't believed they
actually got booed off stage.  I can't say as I have ever seen a
band get booed and I have been to about 30 shows of different bands.

[ Only 30?  You need to get out more!  :-)                      :rush-mgr ]

I have skipped a few opening acts because I didn't like the opening
band, but any band that I had never even heard before, I could not boo
for one show.  I even saw Winger open up for Bad Co. and I did not boo
them, I sure as hell didn't like them and didn't come to see them, but
I didn't boo them either.
I skipped Mr. Big on the latest tour, which in my opinion is no big loss,
but I don't remember their guitarist coming out to jam with Lifeson
here in Pittsburgh.

P.S. To the guy that drinks the Beast, I'm a poor college student
	so I love this beer, along with Busch and most other cheap
	beers.  Have you tried Beast Light?  I know, it's a light
	beer and light beer sucks, but with this spare tire that
	I got, anything helps.  Besides, it's got the same shitty
	taste as the regular stuff, but it comes in a neat blue
	can(shield) instead of the regular red.

P.P.S. Any other beer drinkers out there got any recommendations?

[ Sure, that's easy.  Brew your own.  Hey, great beer for $10/case - 
  you can't beat it.  Which reminds me, I need to get that next batch
  of ale started...                                         :rush-mgr ]

I had always assumed that the "droning" at the very beginning of
TSS was an underlying bass synth of some sort, not a poor mixing
job or anything like that.  At least, that's what it sounds like
to this non-musician's ear.  I seem to remember the same thing
just before TSS on both the HYF and Presto tours, accompanied by
a "tick tock" clock sound.

As has been mentioned in this space before, this month's issue
of Guitar for the Practicing Musician has an interview with
Alex Lifeson.  Go check it out; it's pretty decent (at least
the part that I read while standing in B. Dalton :)

ob. Yes Quote "...and then they invented Rick Wakeman"
ob. Rush Quote "yeah, I remember you...you were wearing jeans
                and a coat."

        In case you didn't know, the May issue of Guitar-For
the Practicing Muscian went on sale at the news stands today,
and has an interview with King Lerxst himself!
        This is not the usual 'well we started as a bar band . . .
I play this and that with these quitars, etc' interview.
        Alex talks about what goes on before a show, how
the boyz prepare, what they do at soundcheck, and also
alot about recording the various live albums that they have
done.  There are also interesting stories about problems
that they have had during the shows, etc.
        It's definately worth reading, even if you don't
buy the magazine.

Good day all!

    Yesterday somebody urged us all to read Ayn Rand's Anthem.
I must admit, I have already read the book twice (it only takes
about three hours) and it seems that the song Anthem off of Fly
By Night is not really so much inspired by the book Anthem but
is inspired by Rand's Atlas Shrugged. After reading that book (it
only took me three months!) I listened to Anthem the song and found
that the lyrics really emphasised the philosophy that is so inherent
in Atlas Shrugged, but is not so directly pointed at in Anthem the
book. So does anybody else see it this way?

Off on another note- I saw Rush last June at the Shoreline Amphitheater
in Mountainview,CA. This was the 5th Presto show I went to and was the
second to last show on the tour for the band. That show was surprisingly
different than the other four because of the three giant TV screens that
showed the band playing live on the stage. My question is did they do this
at any other of their shows? Also, as a long shot, did anybody get a copy
of the video that hopefully was made during this show?

Well I must be off! I'm on a cycling tour you know!

	I think the Music of the Spheres reference comes from
the book Copernicus wrote.  His book was the one the refuted the
notion that the Earth was the center of the Universe (it isn't? :))
and showed that the Sun was really the center. He was only a little
more clue-full!  I believe "Music of the Spheres" is the title
of the book.  If I'm wrong, just call me a sped publicly.
