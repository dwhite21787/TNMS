I once had a GOD SQUAD neighbor (man did I have a ball with this guy)..
anyway...he claimed that RUSH stood for (brace yourselves.....)

Rulers Unders Satan's Hell

Oh brother!!! When i get sick of arguing with this guy i would turn on Tom
Sawyer....and man did that work...he took off like a bat out a hell.

Anyway...just a small anecdote to prove what i believe to be the mythical
beleif that RUSH is an acronym.

May the Force be with you.

I've got the upgraded MP CD, and it is much better than the original.

The Neil Peart contest-winning essay was never printed in _MD_.

Nope, sorry...the Professor is only such in name...I believe he
qualifies as an autodidact, though.  I'd heard that rumour, too,
and the one that all three have degrees in music, but I think
that one's been definitely put to rest...

When would any of them have had the time?!?  Not that I'm complaining!

Some religious idiots that used to tour the country (remember sister Cindy

Haha.  I had a good laugh over that one.

I am currently storing Rush songs in tablature form.  As soon as I get
enough, I will send them into TNMS.  So far, I have parts from
Closer to the Heart, Spirit of Radio, YYZ, Trees, Freewill, etc.

In case you're interested, the beginning of Freewill is just a simple
major scale.  I think it is a B major scale, starting on the 9th fret
and going down.  I don't have my guitar here right now.
Alex has a way of making a simple major scale sound very eerie.  Since
Freewill has some F's in it, he might be using a B Phrygian mode.
Any comments?

Greetings Rush fans!!

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders
as I just finished catching up on my Rush mail which had
acccumulated for the last month and a half or so. But it is
interesting reading, particularly the interview with Neil
a few issues back.

My question, though, comes from those infamous RS reviews
(yes, it was awhile ago!)... Although I disagreed with the
vast majority of the statements in those reviews, I was
interested by the statement saying that historically Rush
appeals to the "lone wolf of suburban America" (or words
to that effect). I know that this description could fit
me (songs like Subdivisions really hit home), but is that
a common thread amongst many Rush fans?? Why would that
be true? I know Ged, Alex and Neil could all be described
as "suburban lone wolves", but what could come out in the
music to attract those types of people??

Up here in Buffalo, NY our 2 classic rock and roll stations
(WGR-FM and WUFX) don't play much rush...But because Buffalo is
so close to the Boyz home country (Canada for those who don't know)
we get alot of RUSH from Canadian stations, especially CHTZ Hits FM
and Q107.

Sorry to use NMS bandwidth for this...this is directed to the person
who placed the xloadimage source on anonymous ftp for us.
I successfully downloaded and decoded the file into its component
.c and .h files, but when I tried to compile it, I found out that
there are some header files missing.  It seems that .h files in a
directory 'X11' were not included in the tar files.  Can you send them
to me?  I am trying to port this program to the PC under MS-DOS
via Turbo C.

[ That person is me, your humble editor/manager.  The souce originally 
  came from "expo.lcs.mit.edu" via anonymous ftp.  It resides there in
  a file called "contrib/xloadimage.2.02.tar.Z".  It is provided 'as is',
  and should work for most Unix hosts.   When I 'make' it on Syrinx 
  (Ultrix), I have no problems with .h files.  Send mail to the management
  account detailing exactly which files seem to be missing, and I'll dig
  around in my X11 dir. for them.                                :rush-mgr ]

To the fellow who asked about the meaning of the letters of RUSH,

I had a friend that once told me that RUSH stood for Ruling
Under Satan's Hand. He said that he "knew" that RUSH was satanic
because there was a five pointed star on the front of the
Moving Pictures album. As you can imagine, I had a little trouble
containing myself from
that point on.

But anyway, I read in a guitar magazine interview with Geddy (can't)
remember which one) where he says that the word Rush was a
reflection of the feeling of the times of the late 60's and early
70's, so I seriously doubt that they actually stand for something.

Also, about Alex's solos, I read in a guitar magazine interview
with Alex (again I don't remmember which one) where hee says that
he never received any formal training. With that in mind, I don't
believe that he conforms his solos to any one mode. I've transcribed
Freewill and it's hard tomake sense of most of it. He seems to
use just about anything he wants. Most of the time, especially on
HYF and Presto, he goes back to the old pentatonic minor/blues scale.
One thing I did notice though is that YYZ and Jacob's Ladder solos
are about the only time Alex has used the harmonic minor scale.
Anyway, if anyone wants copies of any of the transcriptions I've
done (probably about 1/4 of the Rush tunes) or would like to swap any
send mail and we'll arrange it.

I don't play much anymore, but I remember a friend telling me that
Alex's part of "Buenos Nochas, Mein Froinds!" was in F Frigian (he
could play it, so I believe him).  My transcription shows it in the key
of G, but starting and ending on F (the fast part starts on an E),
which sounds correct for that mode.  Good luck!

I remember that a few years ago, someone who didn't know that I was a
fanatical RUSH fan told me that RUSH stood for Rulers Under Satan's Hand.
Needless to say, I verbally assaulted this person.  Anyway, after reading
the ingr.com!server article that Neil wrote concerning someone having the
*audacity* to accuse RUSH of promoting satanism, I remembered that person,
and wished I could have shoved that article in his face and told the
semi-literate doom-sayer to show a minimum of intelligence and heed the
words of the Professor!  By the way, I am also curious as to the academic
backround of the Supreme Triumvirate--- does anyone know where they went to
school and what they studied?
