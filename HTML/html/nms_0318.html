Hey, I heard the title track on the radio yesterday!  You know, the one with
the rap section?  It went something like this:

"Yo, sucka M.C's, my name is Geddy LEE
 And you won't be seein' ME on no M.T.V.
 We are the RUSH and now we're in the rap RACE
 And all I've got to SAY is, 'Get outta my SPACE!'"
                              ^   ^   ^   ^   ^
	(little WDVE morning-show in-joke, there)

Sorry, I just couldn't resist...

On a serious note, I *did* hear another cut from RTB, "The Big Wheel".  That
makes a total of *five* cuts I've heard on WDVE.  (And I'm *not* trying to rub
it in; this is just FYI if you can get WDVE, 102.5, Pittsburgh on your tuner).

Well, I finally heard it here in the Big Apple, on WNEW.  Good
thing, 'cause I couldn't get dreamline.sb to play on my computer
for the life of me.  I downloaded it properly and all, but none
of the player programs recognized the format.  Am I missing
something?  (yes, I have a soundblaster and was trying to use
fmorgan and playcmf to play it).

Anxiously awaiting 11pm on 8/29....(the world premiere of RTB on
WNEW)

	You know you're a Rush fan when... you go back to school in Pittsburgh
1.5 weeks early just so you can hear Rush on the radio (thanx WDVE).  But
you're a real Rush fan when, heading through the PA mountains, you pull over
to the side of the road to hear Dreamline on DC101, because the station keeps
fading out.
	To all you Philly people (Hi Donna! hee, hee :-) ), I heard on WMMR
about a laser show with the usual Pink Floyd, etc., but they mentioned Rush
on the bill, too.  Does anyone know the story on that?
	On the subject of audio files:  I'm in the same boat with some of
you with the 2.2M file and only a 2400 baud modem.  If Mr. Rush-mgr could
zip, compress, tar, or shar the file, the file will probably shrink to a
size that will piss you off even more when it won't fit on a 1.44.  There
are file chopping utilities around, but this is a binary audio file
and is very picky about things like that.  -OR- if you start downloading on
a 2400 baud modem now, it will probably be finished by Sept. 3! :-)

[ Actually, we've already tried to compress it - the file *grew* by 5%!
                                                                :rush-mgr ]

OK.  I have the disk drive to handle the dreamline.voc file.  Exactly
what format is .voc for?  Anyway I also downloaded a shareware thing
called voc2snd which was supposed to convert the .voc file to .snd
file, which you can play through a program called remac over the
regular PC speaker.  I don't have the soundblaster audio card.

So could someone upload a genuine copy of dreamline.snd?  In exchange
I will mail *if this works* a copy of remac which reads Mac sound
files and plays them over PC (not great sound quality, but hey
the phone bandwidth is worse).

<A NAME="318306">From: jrs@cblpe.att.com!</A>

I'm a little hesitant to do this considering all the favorable reviews
Dreamline has received, but here goes.

I just heard Dreamline on WLVQ-FM-96 in Columbus Ohio.  If they're playing
it here, they should be playing it everywhere.  I taped it and listened to it
a couple of times.   After all the hype on NMS, I'm disappointed.

I'm not a musician and have no musical background, but here's my opinion.
I think Dreamline has a harsh, bright sound and is weak in the bottem-end.
The guitar solo is pretty good, and the bass is good in SPOTS but it is not
noticable throughout much of the song.  There is so much high-frequency sound
that there doesn't seem to be that much going on at the other end of the
spectrum.  (Maybe this is due to cassette to cart-tape dubbing that someone
mentioned.  There was some hiss that went away when they played Red Barchetta.)
In summary, to many HIGHs and not enough LOWs.  It doesn't sound like back to
basics old RUSH to me.  I'll have to see if it sounds better on CD.

I like the Farewell-to-Kings/Hemispheres/Permanent-Waves/Moving-Pictures period
of RUSH.  I liked Presto better than the 3 previous albums, and I was hoping
for more of the bass dominant Rush sound.

The radio station played Dreamline and Red Barchetta back-to-back.  I though
Red Barchetta sounded SOOOOOOO much better.  Red Barchetta has a warm, 
soothing, melodic yet powerful kind of sound.  Dreamline has this piercing 
dah-dah-dah sound, it leaves me cold.

Can anyone honestly tell me that they think Dreamline sounds better than
Red Barchetta?  Am I the only one who isn't wild about Dreamline?

I'm still going pick up the disk, come 9/3 (maybe even try 9/2 evening).
Let me go listen to Dreamline 10 more times, maybe it will help.

Thanks to whoever made the .VOC file of "Dreamline" for us Soundblaster
people... the sound quality isn't perfect (but then again,who wants to d/l a
20 meg file?), but at least I got to hear the song!!!!  They've had the
album for a few days here in Cincinnati at WEBN but haven't played it yet
(although they were quite surprised when I called them and played it into
the phone!)

yesterday (8/20/91) Rush unveiled its new hit to Atlanta.
it was THE NUMBER ONE SONG OF THE DAY!!!!!!

Dreamline seems reminicent [sic] of older times, and it certainly
had some motion to it.  my car even sped up to match the tempo!

let's see if it can take the number one spot 2 days straight!

SUBJECT: RTB S.A. info

    I had a talk with the morning DJ at 104 KZEP which will give you a pretty
good view of the RUSH scene on the radio here in San Antonio. It went like this,

   "-Morning, K-ZEP"

   "Yes, do you have any info on the new RUSH single"

   "Well it should be out by the end of the week"

   "Do you know the title yet"

   "No, we haven't received it"

   "Did Atlantic records send out any kind of press release"

   "No, not that I know of. They're not with Mercury anymore?"

 (boy, talk about living a sheltered life, how long has it been, 2 years?)

    Finally, the evening DJ at 104 KZEP gave me some honest answers that I
would like to share with the other readers.

    First, the new single will debut on Thursday (official release?) but
he didn't have it so he's not sure of the title.  Hope the FedExp is on time.

    Second, he mentioned that they will be carrying the world premire radio
show, via satallite, on Aug. 29 at 10:00pm (which was previously noted in
this newsletter).

    He seemed really pumped up (sorry Hanz and Franz) about the release and
assured me that it would play Thursday.

[ We wanna Rush <clap> you up!  :-)                              :rush-mgr ]

    Also talked to the evening DJ at C101 in Corpus Christi (sometimes I can
here them up here, blows our radio stations away) and he said that the new
single would be 'Roll the Bones' and that they would be receiving it tomorrow
and would play it and soon as it comes in.  (Got my radio set).

    The DJ from 102 KPEZ, in Austin, said that they haven't received the new
single and really had no idea on the title.  They also will be carrying the
satallite broadcast on the 29th.

    Well, that's it for this posting.  Get back to you soon with more details.

P.S.  If anybody would like to plan a RUSH party here in the Austin-S.A. area
      in the future (RTB tour 91-92), feel free to E-mail me.  I have access
      to a sound system.  Looking for a place to play.  THX

So, does anyone know for sure when RTB will be out?  I haven't heard
anything about it around Madison.  Second, to Frank Schaapherder,
I can't get mail through.  Please send me another mail message.  Your

Keep up the good work Todd Palmer!!

Now a question for Geddy!

 Around the time of _Signals_ Alex told one interviewer that Rush
 were listening to alot of Ultravox. Ultravox is unique in rock
 for the strong role of Billy Currie's violin in their music. `Losing
 It' is the only Rush song to feature a violin (solo, anyway).
 The lyrics of ``The Weapon'' have an Ultravox flavor as well.
 Did Currie's synthesizer playing have any influence on You?
 Has the work of Ultravox had a lasting effect on Rush? Around the
 time of _Signals_ Ultravox's _Vienna_ was said to be one of Neil's
 favorite albums...

Thanks to you if you could pass this on Frank,

Gregg

p.s. Personally, I prefer U-vox's _Rage in Eden_  to _Vienna_,
though _RIE_,_Vienna_,and _Quartet_ are all prime. Lesser recommendations
for U-vox's work since then (c. 1983).

As an aside:  Not only have I not heard any of the new Rush in Minneapolis,
but the radio stations here are so locked into the "Classics You Grew Up With
and Will Hear Until Your Death" or "Music That was Sampled From Someone Elses
Song" or "Lets' Dance, Even Though Disco has Been Dead for Ten Years" that it
would be impossible to even request it.

 I figure a good discipline exercise would be to learn all of the guitar parts
off of all of the Rush albums.

I've found his thing!  On 96.5 here in Seattle (thanks Rob!)!
It's pretty cool.  It sounds like a jazzed up version of Hand Over Fist
(sans the vocals, of course).

And I heard Dreamline (thanks again Rob!).  Cool song.  Sounds like a
cross between Presto and Power Windows, to me, but that may just be the
recording I heard (tremendous loss of treble and bass - oh well).

I don't know, it may be a dumb question, but I *would* like to see all
3 of them at once!  8)

Respond to me via e-mail, please.

[ You could always use the file "agn.ptp.gif", which is all three of them
  from the Presto tour program.  There's also the "boyz1" thru "boyz3"
  raster/gif files.  The program "xloadimage" is available as a compressed
  tar format file in the same directory; this will show raster and gif
  images.  Peruse the CONTENTS file in the same directory.       :rush-mgr ]
