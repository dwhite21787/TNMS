I think that post about a reissue of Moving Pictures is true.
I heard they were re releasing it on a gold plated cd. They have done this with
some of Pink Floyd's albums and just recently the first Doors album.
I think for some reason the sound quality is better.
I don't know too much about it.

Well, the burners are all on high for dumping Rupert Hine... However, no
matter how bad people want him to go, think of it in this (lime)light-
Rush is the band. Rush have a certain sound in mind. Rush are the people
they are actually playing it for (if that makes sense).. They have already
stated numerous times that they don't want a repeat of MP or PW or whatever.
They are ever moving forward. Also, as I stated earlier, I read in an
interview with Hine in Keyboard magazine that he said his job was relatively
easy.. Rush had already done most of the work. That was the general
gist

Well, I don't know about you, but I personally think Presto and RTB have
a good sound to them. Listen to the beginning of Show Don't Tell, or
the Pass, or Available Light, Chain Lightning, Bravado, RTB, Ghost...
To me, these songs have great sounds to them. Also, listen to ged's
voice now compared to the olden' days. Notice the difference. In the
end, I would love to hear another album that sounds like the old stuff,
but I really enjoy the new stuff as well, and can respect RUSH in their
quest ever forward...

Enjoy-

Hello everyone. Just wanted to thank everyone for the big response to the
Rush boot list, I hope it helped those who were looking to start a collection
and those who were looking to start one. To be noted: I constantly update the
list with new people and new shows gotten (by me especially), and also more
CD boot dealers, so if you're looking for new people to trade with or more
dealer recomendations, e-mail me and I'll send you the updated list.
As for the ultimate free-for-all mentioned yesterday, here's the final
scenario: the last 4 people left in the ring would be: Tony Levin, Alex, John
Bonham, and Eddie Van Halen. (all the football players left after Boris
Badenov gave them all "3rd and final telegram": they're all playin' at
Wossamotta Univ. now). Anyway, while Bonham is sneaking off for a drink, Tony
hits Eddie from behind 'cause he was distracted by Alex's manager, Classy
Freddie Blassie (and the cane!). Alex then proceeds to pick up the hapless
speed demon and drop him on his head in the move perfected by him: the
SPINNING PILEDRIVER!!! Bonham then turns around and hurls the 50L *empty*
bottle of Jack Daniel's at Tony knocking him into Peter Gabriel's studio. As
Alex moves in for the kill, Bonham stops, turns blue, and chokes to death. The
paramedics jump in to cart off the dead man, but wait! It's Derek Smalls,
the amazing bassist, who examines Bonham, trying to determine who's vomit
Bonham choked on. Asked for a reply, Smalls said "Well, you can't really dust
for vomit." Alex, as the victor, proceeds to join Spinal Tap for a rousing
rendition of "Stonehenge." Ok, Ok, I'll stop

I might get flammed for this, but anyways......... Since we all
know that there are bootleg video's of rush (which I do have)
(but don't have is the whole series of guitar tabs for rush).

This is the deal, what I need is the guitar tabs for every
single rush tune made transcribed only for guitar. and not
piano or voice ( which are the archieve vol I & II), but need
the only guitar transcribtions....

Basically I have every single Rush show on cassette tape from
beg to present, only missing kings and cos < like the rest of us>,
on vhs I have everything from sigs to bones.... So anyone
interested in doing a little tradding...

Hello Rush Fans, this is 'Eric the Redlense', the guy who suggested
making a 'fact file' for each Rush song.

To Chuck: (chuck@geosci.lan.mcgill.ca)

If you decide to be editor of 'fact files' that would be great!!  There
are approx 110 different Rush songs out there, just so you know!!  We can
have a volunteer in charge of each song.  In order to automate such a
massive procedure, a program should be written.  Its first task should be
to keep track of which songs have been taken and to whom they're assigned.
Its second task would be to send the volunteer every back-issue of the
NMS that includes the keyword of the title.  This will give the volunteer a
good place to start.

Any volunteers for the programming?  I could hack it myself if it all came
down to it-- but I'd have to do a lot of learning (how to unsqeeze back
issues, how to auto-mail, etc)...

To the person who mentioned the Millions, a quick note.. I am
calling from the great hole called Lincoln, Nebraska.  The band
you refered to are worshiped out here, but looks like they are
about to break up.. The singer has heart problems, has to where a
pace maker now.  In any case, I do not think it is the same Terry
Brown.

And now to Rush.  I too am also looking for bootlegs, since it
is quite hard to find them from where I live.  I have seen a copy
of Over Europe I believe it is called, but I unfortunatly couldnt
afford it at the time.  Any suggestions?

Hi Rushians,

Sorry if this has been discussed a lot recently but I am about a week
behind in reading (aren't we all?).

Concerning the question of what group is in power at the end of the song,
I would have to conclude that the Elder Race has gained control (at least
of the communication systems).  I say this because if the Priests were
still in control or had regained control, they would have not communicated
facts concerning the attack to areas of the Solar Federation that had
not been affected, and would have phrased communiques to areas that had
been affected by the attack differently.

I believe this mainly due to what we know of events following the
Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine/Byelorus area.

I welcome differing arguments.

Regards,

Hi Rushians,

I think an easy way to come to a conclusion on this topic is:
Has anyone noticed Alex goof up a lip-synch?  This would pretty much decide
it one way or the other.  I know a lot of you fight and bribe and brownnose

Hi Rushians,

Remember, Neil writes the lyrics.  Geddy routinely sings lyrics that
denounce religion (Tom Sawyer, Ghost of a Chance, Freewill, etc.) but
is reported (by the FAQ, or one of the interviews on syrinx) to have
had a traditional Jewish wedding some time ago.  So I don't think that
he would be so opposed to being honored by being asked to sing the
Canadian National Anthem.

Rushians:

I just ftp'd the Signals tourbook from syrinx, and reading it, this stuck out:

"I had been working down in the little studio, cleaning and renovating an
old set of Hayman drums tat were kicking around, and had started working on
a 'Jack Secret' song with Jack and Skip from the crew.  Geddy and Alex soon
joined in on keyboards and rhythm guitar, and we later recorded the song
(_Tough Break_) up in the studio"

Anybody have a clue what "Tough Break" is, and if a tape of it exists?

What's disappointing is the relatively short length of the poem, which
is still longer than Peart's version.

I think it does an excellent job of describing "Xanadu" -- the poesy is
just not what we're accustomed to.

>It was Peart alone who weaved into this classic-mystical-image of paradise the
>story of a man who searched relentlessly for it, and then upon finding Xanadu,
>was "imprisoned" by it

This is not correct. In the original the persona is similarly trapped.
The real difference is that in Peart's case the man searching for
paradise is _Western_ (ostensibly) while Kubla Khan is Eastern.

Never too philosophical for me!

Though I thought the ideas to which you refer do not at all correct,
I _do_ see a similarity between "TFoL" and "Xanadu" in that but arriving
at a point one expects to be one of discovery one finds oneself trapped;
in the first case by having to repeat the journey (which bears the mark
of Nietzsche's wacky theory of eternal recurrence) and in the second
by physical time itself stopping while psychological time moves on.

>The poem may be a classic, but I think that Peart's vision should replace it

I have to disagree about the poem's being simplistic. I don't think
that Neil added much to the poem, conceptually. What he _did_ do is
modernize it and make it hyper-accessible to us. Neil surely did
an incredible job of _that_.

Well, I've just gotta say, it's been awhile since I've posted, In fact, I
think this is my first post since we called this list "THE NATIONAL MIDNIGHT
STAR" (Gettin' way back, eh?)

Someone mentioned the story that Coleridge was reading when he wrote when he
was hyped up on Opium. I believe the story was called "Purchas his Pilgrimage"
or something like that. This dates back to somewhere in the 17th century. I
would imagine any library with a good literature section would probably have
this somewhere. I've never read it, but I know it exists.

--- I guess this post is kind of like the joke about the 10 year old who has
never said a word in his life. Doctors, psychologists are all baffled... and
one day at the dinner table he says "This spinach tastes terrible!" and his
dumbstruck parents ask him "Why haven't you said anything before?" and the kid
replies "Well, things have been pretty good up until now." *hasty duck to avoid

Has anybody out there heard a tune that Neil Peart put in either _Drums and
Drumming_ or _Modern Drummer_ called "Pieces of Eight"?  Actually, I think
it's on a free soundpage that you get when you subscribe to the magazine.

  [ It's from _Modern Drummer_ May 1987. It was a flexidisc included in the
    magazine, and this issue is now out of print. The article about it is
    on syrinx called "neil.md.0587" in the special directory.	 : rush-mgr ]

Anyway, the drummer in my band has a copy of it, as well as his own (fairly
accuracte) transcription.  He's arranged it for two marimbas, a set, and
various traps.  The tune is incredible, esp. for any of you musicians out
there who get off on how old Rush esp. is so tight--the idea in "Pieces of
Eight" is, I believe, to fragment the time signature into "pieces" of eight,
i.e., 7/8, 11/8, etc.  And Peart just moves through it like a mother!  So
tasteful, so fierce!  If you can find it, it's an excellent little tune.  I
might be able to get a hold of it--get in touch.

     I was cleaning out my desk last night, when I found an article reviewing
Rush at Madison Square Garden on 12/6/91.  It shows the typical rush-bashing
that goes on in the press, and is either quite funny or quite sad, depending
on how you look at it.  Taken from _Newsday_ without permission:

                     AN EVENING OF MEDLEYS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUSH. Enduring Canadian trio.  Friday at Madison Square Garden.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By Frank Owen

     Since it emerged in the mid-'70s, Rush has been the sort of band all the
really uncool kids are into.  Judging by the hordes of dowdily dressed
adolescents who packed Madison Square Garden last Friday, a whole new
generation has discovered the group's brand of pompous art-rock.  Indeed, Rush
is so un-cool, it's practically cool - and is frequently cited these days as a
major influence by bands like Queensryche, Primus, Living Colour, and Jane's
Addiction.

All typos are in the original article.
   Quite a review, eh?  The guy has some talent - it's not often that a critic
manages to insult a group's fans as well as the group itself.  To his credit,
he did mention the great light show, the rabbits, and the purpose of the
medleys, but when he uses the phrase "To the non-fan, this was confusing," I
have a feeling he's talking about himself (I can picture him asking the
"notoriously fervid Rush fans" around him the names of the songs - he should
have asked for the spelling, though.  The song titles in this article look
like something you'd find on a bad bootleg.)
    Well, that's all from here, I hope you had a good laugh.

2) Madrigal is in the true tradition of ye olde madrigals, a pwetty

4) Neurotica is (IMHO, etc.) about people getting up-tight about stupid

in pointless ways and on other people and, well, being neurotic.
Incredibly catchy track, too. BTW, Neil says about all RTB tracks in
"Row the Boats" in the RTB tour programme.
5) Winner in a free-for-all. Alex I reckon, even without his axe (groan)
6) I think Neil still smokes (not certain).

About Neil, is he ever going to write a book about his travels? I
remember Ged saying Neil had already started writing one but wasn't
happy with it. Any faint rumours etc. on this?

About leprosy - well, no, but seriously Alex has this nasty-sounding
thing called sorayasis which affects his hands - kinda makes them red
and raw, stuff like that (sometimes). And he plays guitar as well as he
does? Please!

In NMS #548 it was mentioned that Neil would win in a free-for-all involving
the band members because he is a BIG man.  Just how big is Neil?  I always
thought he appeared rather small, but since we never see him in person unless
he's hiding amongst his drums, I can't say that I've ever been able to tell for
sure.  How about Ged and Alex?  I would have to say that Alex appears to be the
biggest of the three.  Then again, Geddy could probably inflict some serious
damage on someone by whipping his nose and ponytail around, too.  just my $.02.
