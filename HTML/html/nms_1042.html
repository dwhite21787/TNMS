<A NAME="1042000">Subject: Some Questions about Neil.</A>

I've got a few questions that I can't seem to find the answer to.

1) I know that Neil uses A.Zildian cymbals. I heard that he helped design the
"Rock" crashes. Is this what he uses?? Are all his cymbals brilliant finish??

2)Besides a couple of months ago, (assuming that he was), when was the last
time he was on the cover of modern drummer? Or at least , the last time he
has been interviewed w/ his set that he uses....his old set i suppose.

I really really like his drum sound on Exit ....stage Left.

P.s. Neil will be on the cover of modern drummer next month for the making of
Burning for buddy !! THANKS

Hey Rush-Mgr...you screwed up!  Archives didn't have any of 2112 on it, it
was a  compilation of Rush, FBN, and COS in their entirety.  Sorry to be
critical but I just thought the masses should know.  :)

Now I know you really meant to say that it contained RUSH, FBN & COS in
their entirety.

I know this as I bought it many years ago, as I didn't have enough money
to buy them individually, at the time.

I don't really mean to take the P***, by the way, I think you do a great
job !!

I think that is probably a Mini Moog, so you may be able to get a sample for
that, but I'm not sure where from (sorry!). It's a hard sound to create with
modern digital synth's, as they don't have the "rawness" of analog keyboards.
The same goes for valve amps/transistor amps, as Alex has recently agreed with,
by using Marshall's again (shout's of delight).

Enough rambling from me,

<A NAME="1042004">Subject: The holy grail of Rush boots!!!</A>

Two posts in as many weeks, more posts than I've made in as many years!!

This subject bears bringing up every year or so...maybe someday we'll get lucky.

I have been making my own boots since Power Windows and have been actively
trading with people around the world since Hold Your Fire and I find it
INCREDIBLE that of all the boots I have or have access to...NEVER has anyone I
know seen a Caress of Steel boot!!!  This is amazing if you think about it, I
mean there are recordings of Rush on their first tour, even their first show,
but nothing from the third album tour??

If there are any of you out there who know about a COS boot, you have access to
what would be the most sought after Rush bootleg recording EVER!

I haven't read the FAQL in about three years, but to RUSH newbies, this vital
tidbit of information may help us all uncover a COS boot.  Maybe it could be
added...something like: ALERT, if you or anyone you know has a COS boot, contact
the NMS immediately, you have found the equivalent of GOLD!!!

What do you think rush-mgr???  I know this really isn't a FAQL type thing, but
we need to broaden the search...

   [ Well, anything is possible. We even have three *confirmed* COS tour dates
     now, and one tentative! (thanks bruce!!) so you never know...  : rush-mgr ]

Pete

P.S. If you do actually find one, I will personally come to your house to shake
your hand and get a copy.  Not Kidding, and probably not the only one!!  It
would be like those nuts that say that the Virgin Mary appears in their back
yard, weeding their garden!!  Your house would be swamped with people.

A whole bunch of responses to #1037:
Michael Goldberg asked:
2) Do the lasers ever form a significant shape or pattern:
	Well, starting with the P/g tour they used lasers (up to the RTB tour)
and on the P/g tour the lasers did various things: formed "x" shapes on the
stage (and pulsed in time to The Enemy WIthin), formed the "P/g" for Between
the Wheels, etc. After that tour though they really were just used as a
complement to the lights and didn't make any designs of their own - except for
Limelight where it would make spirally shapes on the rear screen (btw, that's
where the P/g thing was done too).

3) Would you buy a record from their sons/daughters:
	Well, since I'm one of those "have to have anything related" collectors
then I'd have to get it just because of the relation. It'd be cool if it was
a weird type of music though - like the Boys Brigade or something! They were
cool! Anyone know if the Boys Brigade was ever released on CD?

4) Please no movies or Saturday Night Live, etc.

Dan (ddmodell@mailbox.syr.edu)
	I hope you were joking about Hugh Syme. Hugh is one of the best graphic
designers around (IMVHO) and if they ever do an album without his artwork
then I will be very sad! We don't want another "RUSH" album cover do we?

This is directed to Stewart G. from SoR: (you may remember me from Albany &
Rochester - with Chris Kay and the B-man)
	Has the latest issue of SoR been distributed to the US yet? I renewed
a few months back and I've got an article with Howard in this new issue every
one in the UK is telling me about but I haven't seen it yet. email me please
if you can! parmerterb@hartwick.edu

*(*(*(*(

Rush-mgr I know that you are very very very very busy but this is the second
time I've had to correct you in a month >:-)
	Archives (1978) had the full albums of Rush, Fly By Night, & Caress of
Steel -  not 2112!

*(*(*(*(

Finally, no one ever replied to my question about Alex playing the riff in
Xanadu on his 12 string in 1981 (on the Exit...vid) but on the Cp tour with
the 6 string. (this riff is the one where he walks over to Ged's side of the
stage) - Is it maybe because he has been playing it on the 6 since the Presto
tour or what?

In response to Eric Wooten's note about Mystery Science Theater 3000's reference
to "Serum, the album by Rush" in one of their episodes, I remember another Rush
reference. It was for the movie "Alien from LA" starring(?) Kathy Ireland (yes
the super model). There is a scence where these three long haired guys are
standing behind a desk, and one of the robots says, "look its the guys from
Rush" or something similar. It was pretty funny because one or two of them did
kind of look like Alex or Geddy. Makes me wonder if there is a Rush fan on the
writting staff of MST 3000.

NMS'ers,

I'ver noticed a lot of subscribers complain about
the fact that MTV doesn't give Rush the
recognition that they feel Rush deserves.  In
fact, if you happen to see a Rush video on
MTV be sure to run over to the window and
have a look outside because I'm sure it'll
probably be raining frogs or somthing as
equally bizzare.

Well, here is an avenue that those of us
with fax/modems and fax machines can now
express our desires, opinions and complaints
to.  The MTV main fax telephone #.  If enough
of us  (out of over 3k subscribers I'm sure
there is a significant amount of us with access
to fax) voice our opinions maybe something
good will come out of it and give us one less
thing to complain about.

The main fax # is: 212 258-8100

<A NAME="1042009">Subject: Rush gets me an "A"</A>

	Rush isn't only for listening enjoyment.  I used the band for an
extra credit project in school.  In my Human Resources and Organizational
Behavior class, we were told we could pick any song by any group and write
a one page paper on it's relatedness to organizational topics discussed in
class.  It didn't take me long to decide a group and song.  It had to be
Rush's "The Trees".  (We studied Union-Management behavior in class so this
song came to mind instantly)
	I wrote about the conflict management style of the forest, how the
dispute was ended. (A lose-lose situation for both sides)  We also had to
hand in a copy of the lyrics and a tape of the song.  I gave my professor
(a female) the ESL version including Broon's Bane.
	This is where it gets cool......she played the song in class today
because she liked it so much. (Especially Broon's Bane)  She couldn't
believe how many topics the song touched on that she taught about during
the semester.  (Not Neil's intent...I doubt)  She then went on to say that
everyone else's extra credit was so-so, but mine was superb. (Nothing like
putting me (and Rush) in the spotlight)  The points I got for it may give
me an A for the course.  Neil, Alex, and Geddy would be proud.   Who knows,
maybe I converted a new Rush fan. (A female one at that too)
May the female Rush fans flourish and grow!

<A NAME="1042013">Subject: Rush in a Marching Band...</A>

I'm a member of the University of Washington marching band.  In honor of
next year's 20th anniversary of Rush (20 years with Peart), I was hoping
to do a Rush halftime show.  It would end up somewhere between 7-9
minutes long.

Anyway, I'm looking for suggestions by Rush fans as to what songs they'd
put in a Rush "medley."  Keep in mind that I can't use musical licks that
are too difficult; playing, say, the intro to Spirit of Radio
note-for-note in tempo might be a _little_ tricky.  SO, what do you think
would sound good?  It needs to be familiar to people, not too
complicated, and preferably important in Rush's history.

So far, I've had a few ideas: Tom Sawyer, Temples..., Limelight, part of
Spirit of Radio, Time Stand Still, and others.  Oh yeah -- they don't
have to be complete songs, of course -- maybe the keyboard solo from
Subdivisions, the chorus of Animate, you get the picture.

I'm not sure this will all come to pass, but the better the music, the
more likely we'll do it.  Let me know what you think!

As if it wasn't obvious already....

        I don't know if anyone mentioned this already or whatever, but after
hearing everyone say "You can see the headline in the program from this tour
and that tour blah blah blah....", it occurred to me that maybe you could
see it in the little picture of PW in "Chronicles".  So I looked it up, and
what do you know?   It was there "Dewey Defeats Truman,"  in "Chronicles"
for all to see for the longest time.

<A NAME="1042016">Subject: CD Review DISC of the MONTH</A>

Hi all,

This is my first post, but I have been lurking about for a couple of months
reading. The latest
edition of CD Review just came out and has Burning for Buddy as its Jazz
Disc of the Month.
This is what they had to say:

"Big band music is a wonderful vehicle for a drummer. It's the only other
style of music I could ever imagine myself being satisfied by." That's
Neal[sic] Peart, drummer with the rock band Rush, talking about 'Burning
for Buddy', the first in a three-volume series Peart has produced to pay
tribute to the music of Buddy Rich.

"In Rush, we arrange our things quite tightly, but within that, each of us
interprets freely as we wish," Peart says. "And that, too, is what big band
music is all about - having a structured format within which to be free. so
I've had it in mind for a long time that if there were any other style of
music that I'd like to explore, the big band style would be it."
The underlying concept was to do a series of recording sessions placing a
variety of guest drummers with the Buddy Rich band. Seventeen of them
appear on this first CD. In addition to Peart(who boots the band through a
John LaBarbera arrangement of "Cotton Tail"), Billy Cobham, Steve Weckl,
Steve Ferrone, Kenny Aronoff, Ed Shaughnessy, Marvin Smith, Joe Morello,
and a host of others join the band, while Max Roach does two tracks solo.
This first volume is a high-pressure set."I wanted a dynamic, fanfare
opening," Peart says, "supplying rock and funk points of access for the
modern listener. I believe they'll enjoy it and will respond to the quality
and exuberance. The second volume will be more of a true swing set and the
third one will have several epic pieces on it, including one set to Buddy's
own drum track. But this one is the introduction-for 1994 listeners.
On that basis, 'Burning for Buddy' should be a great success. Each track is
a grabber, punchy, and fiery. Except for Roach's "The Drum Also Waltzes"
tracks, don't expect to find any subtlety here. Many of the drummers,
steeped in rock and pop practice, overload the back beat and whack their
instruments with a deadly contemporary thump.
And now for the big question. Should you buy this tribute or head for the
Buddy Rich bin for the real thing? In terms of sound and selection, Peart
believes that the discs he has produced will provide a better first taste
of big band music for today's listeners. "It's a great anthology," he says.
"This is the perfect introduction-for 1994.

Unfortunately, I have not bought a scanner yet, and cannot include the
picture of Neil playing while wearing a Beavis and Butthead t-shirt.

By the way, for my $0.02, Moving Pictures is the best album, PeW was my
first, and 2112 is the best song.

If you listen VERY closely to "The Camera Eye" on "Moving Pictures,"  you
will notice a voice saying something from approximately 8 minutes and 54
seconds to about 8 minutes and 56 seconds or so. It is said before Geddy
sings "Pavements may teem with intense energy...."  WHAT THE HELL IS BEING
SAID?  Is this just another one of those voices where you aren't supposed to
be able to understand what is being said (Example: the intro to Witch Hunt)?
 *NOTE*--I AM NOT REFERRING TO GEDDY'S VOICE!!!  This is something totally
different that can be heard through both speakers.  I heard it on the CD,
but it is most likely on EVERY version.  Has this been mentioned before?

Bailey who also enjoys the relaxing sounds of a good ol' fashion Rush

Neil Peart and the rest of the band.  Seeing as how we are both drummers
Neil has become the point of greatest interest.  Anyway I was just

Because he's a Canadian?

It might be helpful to recall that _Anthem_ was written twenty years
ago.  It probably isn't a reliable guide to Neil's politics today.

	HEY! take up less space griping about what people post about.
Griping about what people post about is completely and utterly
!!!!!!!un-Rush related!!!!!!!!.  For every type of post there is, someone
gripes about it.  Now I'm griping about the griping 'posters'.  I'm sure
that someone will gripe at me for griping (contributing to what I am
against) or using the word gripe too damn much or saying the word damn.
Let's talk about Rush-related topics and not each other and our pet
peeves about posters. If someone says something you don't like take it to
'personal e-mail'.
Some people really get-off on trashing a person personally in front of
God and country (the NMS).  I say, Keep on posting about, who you want at
your dinner parties, in the your favorite polka, hard-rock, progressive,
alternative, DDDDDDD funk, and new age bands, but try to compare this to
Rush in some manner to be consistent with the topic of the NMS. If you
like talking about the members political and religious views that is fine also.
This newsletter is about Rush, all facets of Rush.  It is rare that so many
people can come together from all different backgrounds and discuss one thing
that they have in common, the love for Rush's music.  Ex. I found out that
there is someone out there that came to like Rush in the same manner I did.
Marathon, ASOH.  Thats all it took to get me hooked.  Since then, however
and more importantly, I've been able to expand my musical taste into
many different types of music.  Rush 'opened my ears' I guess one could
say.  Personally, I don't care what each members world view is, I don't
care about how a riff or drum fill is played, I don't care what someone thinks
a song means, I don's care if Neil was on the Comedy Channel, but there
are people who subscribe to this newsletter that do care about these
things.  I won't cut them down for their personal tastes.
	I personally like to hear what songs got people hooked on Rush and
why. And what albums people like and why.  I also like to hear when the
band is coming out with new albums.  I really enjoy reading the interviews
that are printed periodically.  So, if I griped about everything I didn't
like to read I would be griping all of the time.  Thank you for reading
me out.
	Rush-mgr,
		Keep up the great work.  Don't give in and shorten the
newsletter.  If I had to pay for this, I would, gladly.  I really
appreciate the work you put into the newsletter to keep people informed
on Rush.

How soon the golden days of vinyl are forgotten!  Double record sets were
pressed this way so you could stack sides A/B and C/D on your changer
together.  That way you wouldn't have to get up (off the couch, out of
bed, etc. :-) to flip A to B and C to D when the side was over.  All you'd
have to do is flip the records over when B finished playing.

 Rush tribute bands and musicians who try to clone Rush amuse me.
I'm in a band and our biggest influence is Rush.  You can hear a little
Rush influence in our actual sound but Rush impacts us at a different level.
Rush = noble standards and high values.  Rush has influenced us to be
ourselves.  We used to play Tom S., The Pass, Overture, New World Man,
and Limelight.  We were just getting started and needed to fill the void
in our original set.  As we got better and started writing more of our
own songs, we dropped the Rush covers.  Rush has influenced us to be
innovative and individual.  Musicians and bands who try to pose as Rush
missed the boat if you ask me.  Maybe they are the gangsters of boats :)

Anyway, if you are interested in an original band that is influenced by
the standards and values of Rush, please email me and I'll add you to our
group mailing list.  Thanks for listening...

Hello all you happee people...
I'm siitin' here at work thinking about everyone's favorite band, and I was
hit with an incredible idea...What if Rush did a huge blow-out tour with
orchestral accompaniment? Imagine listening to "Lock and Key" or "Manhattan
Project" with a live orchetra (no percussion of course, so Neil can do his
thing!). Alex and Geddy could take their usual places on stage, and then in
back of them there would be an orchestra split into 2 halves and Neil in
the middle of them. They would tear it up on stuff like Xanadu or even
theTrees. That would help Geddy stay more with the bass, and the vopcals
and not have to devote so much to keyboards...

Hey NMSers..let me reach into my pocket for some change...ah, 2 cents!

To Kara:  You are a true Rushie and I always enjoys your posts!

To Blaine Browning:  You want to know who gives a "Sh*t" about some of
these crazy posts on the NMS...I DO!!  Yes, I want to hear how
someone's relationship was "saved" by Ghost of a Chance, YES, I want
to read someone's "This is my first post" post, YES, I want to read
why Rush fans like this album but don't like the other album (even
though I get bothered when they say "This album is bad" instead of "I
don't like this album because.."--note the difference?).  So, Blaine,
if you want censorship, get into a time machine and go to Soviet
Russia or hop into the Gay Deceiver (anyone read Heinlein's _The
Number of the Beast_?) and set your controls for the mythical (thank
God!) land of 2112.  Censorship "ain't" gonna happen here :) !!

Craig:  The reason double albums have side 1 & 4 on one album and 2 &
3 on the other is so that you can play them back-to-back.  Does anyone
remember the old days when you could "stack" albums on that "thing,"
and once one album was done, the next "stacked" album would fall onto
the just-played album ("ouch!") and you would get continuous play.
So, when you bought a double album, the sides were sometimes aligned
so that you could play 1 & 2 without batting a wink.  You would then
flip 'em both over and you get 3 & 4.  We have come a long way...thank
you capitalism!!

Gabriel: Your racist remark really bothers me!!!  I was very surprised
to see a comment like that on the NMS.  There is no such thing as
"black slang" in society.  There is a style of language that comes
from poor parts of cities that happen to have more blacks than whites.
But what is black, anyway?  To quote a certain someone: "Ignorance and
prejudice and fear walk hand in hand" (Neil Peart, 1981) I have never
met a *black* person!  In fact, in the summer time, I am darker than
some of my friends who just happen to have ancestors from Africa....
and to answer your question:

Favorite Album:  Power Windows.
Every song on here moves me.  Awesome stuff.  Why?  I feel that on
this album more than any other Rush has matched the "feel" of the
music with the lyrical content.  The themes are very emotional and the
music just fits!  Side 2 rules.  I don't think I have ever heard 3
songs in a row better than Middletown Dreams, Emotion Detector, and
Mystic Rhythms (although side 2 of Moving Pictures is damn close!)

Favorite Song:  Middletown Dreams & Ghost of a Chance:
We make our destiny and carve our way through life.  Some people are
happy living in "Middletown," thinking that life is a river and it
just takes you along.  I say get out of the river, start throwing
rocks into the river, and change the river's course!!  It takes time
and effort, but it is well worth it.  Middletown dreams has motivated
me away from "Middletown" and towards my current "life path."  As for
GoaC, we never know when we will meet that certain someone.  She/he
may have grown up in your own backyard, but "chance" never offered the
formal introduction.  This is a very bold song.  Right to the heart of
the matter!  2nd: Bravado, Emotion Detector, Vital Signs, Witch Hunt.

Band Member:  Neil.
Why?  This would require a book-like response and I still have 2 more
finals!!  I think most of you know why.  If I ever meet him, I just
want to tell him one thing:  THANKS!

Hi Rush fans,

	I feel like I'm beating a dead dog, but here I go anyway.
I'm a song writer, I'll never be famous, or ever hope to be, but as
important as grammer is to the English language sometimes the song just
doesn't sound right with good grammer.  HYF is a decent album, Lock and
Key is a great song, but I think some of you guys are missing the point.
Poor grammer does not take away from the song, unless is sounds like
country music,( but that's another story).  Songs are more or less
poetry and if I remember correctly from all my schooling years.  75% of
all poetry uses bad grammer.  Look at e.e cummings.  His grammer is
horrible does that mean he's a bad poet, of course not.
If you examine every musical artist they have used bad grammer at least
once just look at Plant, Amose, Hammer, Ice tea,  Mike D, MCA...etc I could
go on all day.  Enough said.

Comments are always welcome

Neil's songs, most notably _Anthem_, do seem to espouse Libertarian
Principles.  But, I wonder, if Neil truly is a Libertarian, why
does he choose to live in Canada, which is arguably *much* less
Libertarian than the United States?

******************************************

To answer a part of that, Neil is not a Libertarian, he is better
described as an Objectivist.  An Objectivist is any follower of the
philosophy of Ayn Rand, "Objectivism".  If you are a Rush fan it may
be of great interest for you to actually read _Anthem_, _The Fountainhead_
and _Atlas Shrugged_, (preferably in that order) to begin to
understand Ayn Rand and a LOT of the songs Neil writes, not just _Anthem_.
Note Neil dedicated (forgive me if I'm wrong) the album 2112 to the
'genius' of Ayn Rand.
If you would like to cut to the chase and find out what Objectivism
is all about technically, read Leonard Peikoff's book:
_Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand_.  You won't regret reading
the other books I mentioned before.  Good luck!

1) Emissions, liberals, alloys, pollution...what the f*@k, am I still
subscribed to NMS?  To reinterate what others have said before--please send
splinter discussions to personal e-mail addresses.  I don't give two shits
about i.c. engines efficiency rates!  Thanks.

2) To answer a question on Nobody's Hero--I believe it's about the REAL
heroes that go unnoticed/unrewarded in today's society.  Like the song
suggests-not the model, or actor- who people worship for whatever reason,
but the real heroes- the pilot that "lands the crippled plane" or the family
of the young lady which struggles to keep their sanity after losing her.

3) Drugs, Rush?  My only correlation is Passage to Bangkok.  This song is
great, and what do you know?!...it's about pot!
     - "the natives smile and pass along a sample of their yield."
     - the chorus "...we only stop for the best!" (they shop around!)
     - right before the guitar solo, you can hear this wooshing sound-
       someone taking a hit off a bong, no doubt.
   This, of course, doesn't mean that Rush does or ever has endorsed
   marijuana, they just happened to write a clever song about it.

4) How does one get a NMS t-shirt?

Have a great holiday everyone!

For those of you who know not who or what TSOR is then read on:

The Spirit of Rush is a Fanzine that was set up after Hold Your Fire came
out in 1987. It was setup by Mick Burnett, a long time Rush fanatic in
London. Mick and a few of his friends were pissed off because the guys
didn't tour the UK as much as they used, also by the records company lack
of promotion of the band.

It was being published quarterly, until the start of this year when it
was decided that we would publish it every 2 months.

In the mag there are various sections, eg:

        SIGNALS - Letters page.
        PERMANENT TRADES - Trading and auction section.
        etc..

The reason we pride ourselves on our longevity is because we get certain
info from SRO/Anthem, Atlantic etc. that not many others get. We get
promo stuff direct from them, we get interviews easily, In fact sometimes
we even get letters from the guys.

We also know that the guys read it when they get their copies and not
just through them to the side.

To quote Geddy "To all the readers of Spirit, we're glad your there"

If you would like more info on TSOR then write to Mick at the following
address.

        The Spirit of Rush,
        23 Garden Close,
        Chinbrook Road,
        Grove Park,
        London.
        SE12 9TG.
        England.

Thats about it, so if you want more info you know where I am.

        Bye!!
