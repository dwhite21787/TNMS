Hi,  joined your crew two months ago and really enjoy reading this email.
My question is short, do any of you know the expected release date of the
"Chronicles" album I keep reading about?  BTW,  someone referred to Anne Raynd
but it's actually Ayn Rand.

I have a suggestion/request/plea, which is inspired by two
experiences I've had with this digest:

The first came when I was new to the digest. I posted a copy of
"Kubla Khan," Coleridge's poem which was the basis for "Xanadu."
Around the same time, my cousin posted a note about Geddy's
appearance on "Take Off" by Bob and Doug McKenzie.  Shortly
thereafter somebody posted a note complaining that the same stuff
kept coming up in the digest every couple months, and he or she
mentioned specifically Kubla Khan and "Take Off." At the time, I
thought it was the height of rudeness. I was sorely offended.

Now, however, Anand Rangarajan asks, "Has anyone ever read
`Anthem' by Ayn Rand?" and threatens to open up a can of worms I
thought was thankfully closed, and I understand exactly how that
earlier poster felt when my cousin and I posted our items. At the
same time, Anand has every right to exchange ideas about the 2112/
"Anthem" relationship, and judging by the volume of postings on
that very subject not too long ago, there are a lot of ideas to be
exchanged. I suspect, though, that there are a lot of other people
out there who could also live without wading through all that
again in every digest.

What would be really neat would be if this excellent digest came
with an index. It could go out to new subscribers, and they could
order back issues containing articles they found particularly
interesting. Now, I'm sure our manager is reading this thinking,
"This fellow's delirious if he thinks I have time to take on a
task of that magnitude!" I'm aware of the constraints on rush-mgr's
time; that's why I'm hoping that somebody else can take this on.
I'd do it myself, except that I'm leaving my place of employment
in a couple weeks and I don't know when, where or if I'll be back
on the net.

This might be more work than it's worth, but I notice that the
digest comes with a little table of contents now. If an index of
past digests could be put together, it would be easy to keep up to
date by appending that subject list onto it. I hope someone (or
someones) can find the time and inclination to do this. If not, oh
well.

I have read all of Rand's works, and have found _Anthem_ the most
cohesive and complete of any of them.  It is only about 120 pages
long (tiny compared to may of her other works) and works well as a
novella.

As far as Peart's sources for 2112, I can only recommend that reading
the book will cast a whole new light on _2112_!

Enjoy!
