I'd like to find out more about what OTHER music Rush fans enjoy.  We
had a poll last Spring where people listed their 10 most favorite albums
from different groups.  The results turned me on to some really great
music.  I'd like to try it again, so here goes...

Please send me a list of what you consider the 10 best albums of all time.
In order to avoid having Rush flood the results, only enter ONE album PER
GROUP.  Please list the albums including the artists from 1 to 10.  I'll
tabulate the results and post them to TNMS.  Don't post your list directly
to the list!  Send them via email to me at dougg@hpptc16.hp.com.  (or,
UUCP: hplabs!hpptc16!dougg).

Mail your entry today and qualify for the Early Bird Sweepstakes Prize!

Go to any drum shop and I'm sure you will find atleast 2 or 3 books which
have nothing but the drum part written out. A friend of mine works at a drum
shop and I've seen a few of them.

   What's the deal with all these new album release dates?  I know nobody
knows for sure... but the dates are conflicting by a couple of months.  Can
somebody clarify?

My friend Rich and I were playing 2112 for a mutual friend who was
curious about Rush.  After the line "... spills over", Rich said,
"Of course, what he *should* be doing is dynamiting the temples ..."

I don't know if Rand would have disapproved, exactly; obviously that
character would not have been a Rand hero, but obviously not everyone
in her books was a hero.

I saw this on a net today.  Does anyone out there know if there is any truth
in this?  This would certainly conflict with the fact that Rush is supposed
to be in the studio right now...

	"Big money got no soul" is the main one that comes to mind.

	Also "Second Nature" from HYF, which implies that "a captain
of industry," among other people, should share some responsibility
for healing the world's problems.  I sort of see that song as an
effort to compromise between pure economic libertarianism and
humanism (a problem I have myself...I sympathize strongly with both
viewpoints and never know how to resolve it when they seem to be in
conflict).  I don't think Ayn Rand would accept a compromise; she'd
probably just insist that there was no conflict.

   As an Objectivist and a long time Rush fan (and not even
necessarily in that order), I would like to respond to a couple of
comments about Ayn Rand re: Rush.
   To the comment that Rand would be disgusted by "2112":  I disagree.
I will concede that (if she were alive) she probably wouldn't *like*
listening to Rush--But I do think she would objectively be able to
appreciate the superlative esthetic values they exhibit.
   As one example, in discussing various literary authors and their
styles, I quote from Rand's "The Romantic Manifesto":  "For instance:
I love the work of Victor Hugo, [...] although I disagree with
virtually all of his explicit philosophy[...]  I cannot stand Tolstoy,
[...] and yet, from a purely literary viewpoint, on his own terms, I
have to evaluate him as a good writer."
   I also disagree that Rand wouldn't have approved of Neil's
protagonist's suicide at the end of 2112:  From "Atlas Shrugged",
[John Galt, to his lover, Dagny Taggart:]  "If they get the slightest
suspicion of what we are to each other, they will have you on a
torture rack--I mean, physical torture--before my eyes, in less than a
week.  I am not going to wait for that.  At the first mention of a
threat to you, I will kill myself and stop them right there. . . .
I don't have to tell you that if I do it, it won't be an act of
self-sacrifice.  I do not care to live on their terms.  I do not care
to obey them and I do not care to see you enduring a drawn-out murder.
There will be no values for me to seek after that--and I do not care
to exist without values."

Good Premises,

I agree that a person's interpretation of a song is in NO way sacred;
no-one has a monopoly on wisdom, w.r.t. Rush or anything else.   With
that disclaimer out of the way, I'll hazard the pitfalls of song
interpretation and interject that, IMHO, "Territories" is more of a call
for One World Government than an anti-war song per se.  Your opinion
may vary.  California opinion probably lower.  Member FDIC.  :-)

It's a good vision, BTW.  For a while I was hoping the multinational
Desert Shield forces in the region would be re-flagged with the UN
flag and turned over to a UN force commander (probably American, since
our exposure was greatest)....  But such was not to be.

Sorry if this has already been discussed but I'm a recent subscriber.

I recently bought the Chronicles Video Compilation and I noticed that in
"Closer to the Heart" and "The Trees", there are a couple of bad spots
in the tape where the sound is garbled.  Has anyone else noticed this
problem?  Is it perhaps due to how long ago those videos where made,
presumably when AFTK and Hemispheres were released, or do I have a
defective copy?
