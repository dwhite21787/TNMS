Hi, This is my first letter to NMS and I have some questions !
Anyone out there know anything about RUSH on tour 95 or 96.
I live in Sweden and as I recall the band never payed a visit here, why is
that ?
Is there any chance that they will in 95 or 96 ?
If not, where is the biggest chance to catch them ? (Copenhagen perhaps ?)
Ill be happy if anyone could tell me via NMS.

quality? What songs are included?

Unfortunately, I will not be able to listen to it prior to the purchase
nor will I have a listing of the songs included. The CD is sellin for $30.
You can e-mail me privately at jbalog@drew.edu  . Thanks for the help.

I think it's a muffled typewriter or daisywheel, something like that.
There might be some muffled drum rolls mixed in with it too, though
(sounds a bit like it). This may not make as much sense as a Camera
Eye, but I suppose it's conveying the feel of the city.

album? (from 1977) ... give it a listen as some of the guitar work is
sensational. The guitar riff at the start of 'Train from Nowhere'
sounds EXACTLY like that in the 'I can't wait to share this new

Hi Everyone!

This is going to seem strange, which it is, but here goes nothing.
I was looking at my friend's high school yearbook from last year, and I kept
seeing these two good looking twins.  They're names were Jim and William
O'Keefe and I kept seeing them in his yearbook.  When I finally got to the
senior portrait pages with everyones messages, memories, etc, these two BOTH
quoted none other than Rush.  (I knew there was something about these
guys...)  They seemed to be big fans because they picked obscure lyrics from
2112 and Signals as their quotes to live by, or whatever.  Ladies, they are
identical twin Rush fans. I thought I was going to faint.  Anyway, my friend
Kelly wouldn't help me find them so I thought I'd take a shot in the dark
and see if they were on here.  The only way I could tell them apart was
because Jim parted his hair to the left.
Kelly thought I was crazy because as soon as I saw the lyrics in the
yearbook, I said "I love these guys!" We Rush fans can be PRETTY bizarre
sometimes...:)  Anyway, if you know these guys, or ARE these guys, please
contact me or write here. (Everyone should Have my email address by now!!)
 I think I've found my purpose in life...

Some replies to some posts:

Well, no.  As a matter of fact, I've been wondering if Neil himself
listens to Limbaugh (the phrase "...the way things ought to be" from
*Cut to the Chase* caught my eye).

Why not?!?!?  C'mon, where's the fun in life if we can't go through a
little mindless speculation about our heroes?  It's fun, even when you
turn out to be wrong.  I remember before _Grace Under Pressure_ came
out that a buddy of mine heard a rumor that the title would be _BREAK
Under Pressure_ which didn't seem very "Rush-like" to us.  We were
wrong (fortunately), but we didn't get hurt in the exercise.

Simon played with the Who on the farewell tour; if you have a chance
to see the concert video from that tour (including "Tommy" in it's
entirety, take it!  Phillips is phenomenal!  If I was looking for a
drummer nearly as good as Neil Peart, I'd pick Simon Phillips.

ACK!  Could you do me a favor?  Do you have any interviews of Alex around
1988 or so in your collection?  It should end with the interveiwer asking
about women on the tour buses -- not his exact words, but something like
that.  And then Alex responds with, "No, but I'll ask my wife!"  and the
article ends like that.  It was a transcription from the "A Story of
Kings" interview.  I *know* I read it, but I can't find it.  And I've
been looking *everywhere*.  Anyway, please let me know if you have it --

Being both a Rush student and a student of literature, I thought it would be
interesting to compile a list of written works that Neil Peart has alluded
to in any way in his lyrics. Any additions, corrections, deletions, etc.
would be most welcomed. The list thus far is as follows:

*the 2112 story is adapted from Anthem by Ayn Rand
*Hemispheres mentions the Greek Pantheon (see Bullfinch, many others)
*Hemispheres space ship named Rocinante after horse in Don Quixote by
	Cervantes
*Bravado from Roll The Bones inspired by a line in John Barth novel The
	Tidewater Tales. (excellent read, by the way. I'm now a Barth
		devotee)
*"wilderness of mirrors," in Bravado (Counterparts) is a line from T.S.
	Eliot Poem "Gerontion".
*Xanadu from Farewell To Kings based on "Khubla Khan," a poem by Samuel
	Taylor Coleridge
*Tom Sawyer (Moving Pics.) is a novel by Mark Twain
*Jacobs Ladder (Permanent Waves) a metaphor from the Bible and the story of
	Jacob.

** I've read (I think here on TNMS) that Red Barchetta (Moving Pictures) has
its roots in a sci-fi short story. And recently there was some discussion of
a poem that inspired Between Sun and Moon (Counterparts). I'd love the facts
on these two.

Also, any more that people know of... please share. I'd like to read each of
these works independent of the songs to season my appreciation of the music.
That's probably what I enjoy most about Rush... the value of the music (for
me) is that it's not limited to one medium. As I develop (age, mature,
stiffen, whatever) the music changes with me and pushes the horizon out once
again to just beyond my (cognitive, spiritual) grasp. Frankly, I never want
to reach that horizon... the point of the journey is not to arrive and all
that stuff...

Next I think I'll compile a list of historical allusions (witch hunt,
bastille day, 24th of May etc.)

<A NAME="1065012">Subject: A 1st time poster...with a complaint</A>

Since I'm new, here goes with the vital facts
Got into the band, when, around 1987  a radio station did a
"rock block" of Tom Sawyer, The Spirit of Radio and Closer to the Heart.
I wasn't an instant total convert, however.  I wasted two years of my
life, until Presto came out and turned me into a Rush Worshipper.....
Favorite songs = The Pass and La Villa Strangiato,
Favorite albums = Presto and Hemispheres.......any connection?
Now, for the complaint....I am a college student and one of my (many)
vices is that I need to have some music on while studying.....with other
fave groups (Scorpions, Queensryche, DT, Mozart) I have no problems.  As
much as I like the music, I can ignore it. IT just doesn't work with
Rush....I find myself singing along, and can't concentrate on the
material I'm looking at.....It's a problem of the band being too
good to ignore, even for a few minutes........
Just curious, anyone else, college types or otherwise, find themselves
totally ignoring the stuff they have to do, the stuff with an all too near
deadline, just because of a Rush song playing nearby?

Thanks for letting me indulge.........

<A NAME="1065013">Subject: clarification (perhaps)</A>

Ok, it seems that some people may have taken my message about the "filler"
songs on Rush albums the wrong way... so let me clarify...
1. A filler song does not have to be a bad song!  in fact, it can be an
EXCELLENT song (case in point: La Villa.  I read in _Visions_ (I think, or
it might have been Guitar Player or another similar magazine) that La Villa
was written as an 'experiment', because Rush wanted to see if they could
write a song that was all instrumental -- part of their motivation was that
they had some room on the upcoming album for it)
2. The "comments" that I put after each choice were intended to be purely
humorous, and were not in the intent of making fun of or insulting Rush...
I admit that I was going overboard on the side of humor when I claimed that
all of the first album was filler, and all of Presto (minus SDT) was... also,
I don't really think that the WHOLE second side of 2112 is filler, but that was
the only way I could get the comment to match and still be "funny", imho...
sorry if it offended some of you :)
3. Every band puts fillers on their albums.  there are VERY FEW albums I can
think of that don't have filler songs on them... (Boston's first album and
Dark Side of the Moon are the only ones that leap to mind)  Most bands write
a few really good songs and say "ok, now let's fill up the rest of the album".
Well, IMHO, Rush's "filler" songs would be the really good songs for most
other bands :)...
So, I'm sorry if I offended anyone with my post... I was just trying to start
a thread that would be a little more meaningful than what color boxer shorts
Neil likes to wear or whatever...
:)

Fellow followers of Rush,
	Let's try not to get all excited over the Grammys, ok?  If you're
really taking them seriously anymore think about this, Sheryl Crow won
Record of the Year (or was it Album of the Year?).  The point is, who
cares?  Somehow, Sheryl wrote the best music of the year according to the
popularity Grammy voters.  Let's let them have their fun, and we'll have
ours, ok?  Whoopee!
	Anyway, I've been reading a lot about 3 Gold disks.  Now, would
sombody clarify what they are, and WHERE I can get them, (if they have
any others than MP and 2112)  Thanks.  (If this is on the FAQ I'm sorry
to bother those of you who _really_ get uptight about that! :) )

As an intro (first post but have been a reader for a year now): I was
introduced to Rush by an uncle (Fly By Night), got into Rush in MP, hated
all their albums until ROTB, but I am going back and filling in.  The lyricist
Peart overwhelms the synth crap (this from a piano player who

Enough intro. Now for the subject.

The other day, I found a Meyers-Briggs personality test on the web
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/jembin/mb.pl).  I took it, along with one of the
other Rushers at work.  When his personality test scores came back, it
listed "Neil Peart" as an example of "ENTP" personality type (Extrovert
iNtuitive Thinking Perceptive).  Needless to say, he now preaches the
validity of the test (me?  They list me in the same category as Ensign
Wesly Crusher...) Some quotes:

"ENTPs value progress and change, both in their personal lives and in
the world as a whole.  The idea of a static, unchanging life -- appealing
to some SJs -- is abhorrent to an ENTP.  ENTPs are always seeking out
new experiences, new ideas, and new achievements.  While other
types may worry that the world is changing too fast, ENTPs are more
likely to be frustrated that the world isn't changing fast enough -- in the
direction they want it to move."

"ENTPs have little respect for rules that fail to serve a useful purpose.
Rules that significantly inhibit the ability to get things done will be
changed, finessed, or simply ignored."

So those of you who are familiar with this, what do you think?  Is that
Neil?  How would you rate Geddy and Alex?

To ask that they delve so far back into their old music to redo
2112 if they don't feel it is relevant to *them* isn't fair
to Rush. Whether there are people who can relate to it isn't of
extreme importance (though it's a plus). Rush has always progressed
in their music, and what we hear is their creative self-expression.
While it's nice for the fans to be taken into consideration, the
fans' opinion should not drive the band.

That their older music lives on is a testimony to their brilliance, but
not a sufficient reason that they should redo it.  I find relevance in
many different songs, throughout the Rush discography, and I can't wait
to hear what they come up with next. As their lives change, so does their
music, and hopefully they'll keep going as long as they feel they have
something new to say (and new music to play).

Pink Floyd certainly didn't play all of "Dark Side of the Moon"
when I saw them last year. There were quite a few songs from it,
but not all of them, and not played together or even in order.
They also included a lot of recent music (mostly in the first set).
It's not a good example.

Maybe Rush doesn't attach the significance to 2112 that you do.
Maybe instead they'd make someone else's dream come true and play
all of Cygnus/Hemispheres.... or something else that they consider to
be a highlight of their career. If they do consider 2112 to be the
pinnacle of their music, I doubt they'd've kept going for this long
afterwards. And 2112 is far from being universally hailed as a favorite
by Rush fans, there are as many different opinions as there are fans.
As a fan who likes the variety in their music, I'd be disappointed if I
went to a Rush concert and they devoted so much time to just one thing.

Now I don't know what the band's attitude is towards 2112 (if indeed
they mutually agree), but Neil has generally refused to talk about it
(and other older music) with a "been there, done that" kind of response.
Even in this latest interview where he talks about redoing some of their
older music, he talks about a new take on the older songs. Maybe 2112 will
be involved -- maybe it'll be excluded, either due to not having a new
perspective on it, or it being too long.

I'm happy to let them decide what they want their music to be like;
given their track record, it's almost certain to be something that I'll
enjoy hearing.

To respond to the country Rush Thing:

On many of the shows Rush played (supporting CP) in the south, they opened 
with a lick reminiscent of some really bad 1940's western movie theme.  I have 
heard many of these concerts personally, from bootlegs and correspondence 
with friends.  Each time there is a joke made towards Cold Fire actually 
being "the new direction the band is taking" - Geddy Lee in St. Petersburg, 
Dallas, etc '93).  He also refers to this song in many of the shows as "his 
favorite country song...".

Speaking with other Rushians, we take this as Rush (being comical on many 
occasions) were making demo riffs and just started jamming, and eventually 
came up with Cold Fire, which might have started as a remade pseudo-country 
lick.

This might be stretching this a bit, yet stranger things have happend.

Hello Fellow Rushians ,
  First I would like to comment on the "Rush-Country Misic-thingy" . In
an interview about the CP album , Ged and Alex mentioned that they tried
several different ways of playing the song " Cold Fire " ( all of which they
recorded) and they said that one of these "trials" was a country-version
of the song . For those of you wondering what interview it was , it was
on a national show called "Overnight(I think that that was the name)". This
show usually interviews top Canadian bands when they are going to release a
new album ( for example , Blue Rodeo was interviewed when that released
" 5 Days in July ") and it plays the songs off the new album in etween

between
interview segments . This interview was pretty cool . They would have
an interview segment with Ged and Alex (who were really funny) , play a
new song , then an interview segment with Neil , play a song , etc. , etc..

  The other thing that I would like to comment on is to the guy/gal(can't
remember which) that wrote about the common likes of Rush fans . I know
that for me and my fellow Rushians back home on Da'Rock(Newfoundland)
that Japanamation ( Robotech,Akirka,etc.) , and RPG are definially our
likes ( except that we gave up RPG about 3yrs ago ) .

 Well , Thanks for reading

    Well, it's good to finally see some people on the list can take a
joke.  I mean, any mailing list that practically worships a band that
recorded a song titled "Anagram (for Mongo)" should have a sense of
humor!  As Dave Barry once suggested, from now on I guess we'll have
to close-caption our posts for the humor impaired  (THIS IS A JOKE,

    Other stuff:  It's good to see someone besides myself likes Side B
of 2112.  I mean, I can do without "Lessons", maybe, but the other 4
definately deserve a relatively high place in the Rush canon.
    Bad Opening Acts:  I know I've only been to 2, (RTB and CP in
Albany), but I *know* I've seen the worst possible opening act,
because it was the worst musical performance I have ever even in part

Hello, all.  To introduce myself: I have been a Rush fan since GUP and will
be one for life, though I am interested in all types of music (except
country -- unless it's Rush country :-)).  One of my friends once made
the mistake of saying "Rush has no soul" -- I practically ripped his soul
out verbally for that one!

Anyways, I just had to answer Larry Young, who said in NMS 1063 something
to the effect that you could hear Les Claypool's influence in Geddy's
playing.  WRONG!  There is a relationship there, but it's absolutely the
reverse.  I am a bass player myself, who pretty much taught myself to
play by learning all of Geddy's lines.  I am also a big Primus fan,
and will admit that Les is an extremely talented player (though not,
I think, better than Geddy -- just different).

Anyways, there may be some reciprocal influencing going on between the two,
but Les himself has stated that Rush was one of his biggest influences
as a bass player.  Geddy has said, however, that he is also a big fan
of Primus' music, so it is possible that they have both influenced each
other.

Just my two bits worth.

Date: Mon, 6 Mar 1995 21:27:22 -0800 (PST)

Sure, *eventually* Rush will have to retire, but it sure as heck
isn't going to be *soon*, unless Neil decides he's not doing it
anymore shut up you two. Here's why.

For Alex, it's just too much fun. He might not have much trouble
accepting the end, but he's certainly not going to suggest it.
But Geddy is the big reason. He has said many many times that he
wants to write the perfect song. You know that's never going to
happen. (IMHO if Available Light is not the perfect song, nothing
we can humanly create *is*.) He's not going to give up until he
either writes the perfect song or becomes so incapacitated that
he can't possibly *try*.

If anyone out there is into the White Wolf game Mage, I can
explain it this way. Geddy has Questing essence (I'm not going
to suggest a Tradition because this stuff ain't real anyway).
The thing with Questing essence is that it gives you a Mission,
but that mission is beyond impossible. People with Questing essence
have a direction but not a destination. So they keep going that way
until they reach their impossible goal or die trying. (Or try dying,
or do some tie-dyeing... oops, sorry, shifted into Animaniacs mode...)

Of course most of you are going to shove this aside as just another
obnoxious Juno-post, but believe me I have a certain intuition
about things that have nothing to do with me :^). Like, Geddy's
daughter last year? I was *sure* it would be a girl from the second
I heard about a baby on the way (to Scott?: don't blame Nancy; it
was at least half Geddy's fault), and I was still sure even when
someone told me they saw the birth announcement and it was twin
sons, so I found this birth announcement myself and gee what do
you know it's a girl.

Oops I'm rambling again.

        It has been quite a while since I have offered my thoughts to this

Alex's interest in classical music.  Not long ago I downloaded a file called

enjoys classical music and has aspirations of playing in the toronto
symphony orchestra.  It does not claim that Alex can play any instrument
other than the guitar but I'm sure he could learn the violin if he wanted to.

        Again, I would like to stress my ignorance to the nature of this

Has anyone seen the special packaging on some Counterparts CDs?  I saw them
in Europe last summer.  It basically looks like your conventional
Counterparts CD, except the blue background and black rectangle is printed on
the booklet, and the "Rush" and nut & bolt are printed in gold paint directly
on the plastic CD case.  Thus, they only make up the Counterparts album cover
when they act in unison...in other words, they're counterparts!  I thought
that was pretty cool.

YKYARFW:
You own every CD/tape, but you still check the Rush section at the music
store just to make sure there's a good selection.

You go out of your way to be in Paris July 14 for Bastille Day.

You've written to Nasa to request a photo of Crippen & Young.

You use "Pert" shampoo exclusively.

Rushfully,
Jim

<A NAME="1065033">Subject: TOO MUCH of a RUSH fan when...</A>

Hi all!

I've been around since the NMS's conception, and I must admit that I don't
follow it as much as I used to.

Just thought I'd put in a couple of my smells after some recent reading of
the NMS, particularly the reactions of some to the postings regarding some of
RUSH's not-so-great tunes:

You know you're TOO MUCH of a RUSH fan when:

You're insulted by anyone who writes anything that's not 110% positive about
RUSH or their music. You consequently flame the person and accuse him/her of
*not* being TOO MUCH of a RUSH fan.

I admit that at one time I thought that RUSH were the greatest. Much of their
music touches my heart in many ways, much more than many other groups. At the
same time, I (and even they) have realized that some of their stuff is great
and some is not so great. Why is it wrong to say this on this list?

Anyway, my least favorite thing about this list is that any criticism (which
can be positive or negative) of RUSH is taboo. This attitude stifles most
good discussions.
