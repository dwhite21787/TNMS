Well, I guess that by these 'bonus tracks' they mean 'What you're doing'
(ATWAS) and 'A Passage to Bangkok' (ESL), that haven't been on the original
(not-remastered) CD-Releases, but of course on the original vinyl-version.
I bought the remastered CDs basically because of these 2 tracks (although I
have the vinyl versions as well).

That must be an old interview.  Granted I didn't take the time to read the
entire thing, but if they were shooting for an X-Mas release date, it leads
me to believe it must have been done late 1998.  Last I read it was going to
be March 1999.

I hope it's an old interview!  Was it dated?

Hi all,

I was reading through Alex's interview in Guitar Gear.  I was really
suprised to read that Xanadu was recorded "live in the studio".  One pass
with a couple of overdubs.

I can't think of one band that could pull off that today.  The song is
difficult enough...  When you add in the guitar switching gymnastics that
the boy's subject themselves to.  Wow!

That's talent.  (And a lot of hard work to boot.)

Hi Matt,

Well - the original CD releases of those albums had tracks missing 
  "What You're Doing" and "A Passage To Bangkok" respectively.  
They were restored for the remasters, so in that sense they are 
additional tracks.

<snip Rand quote from The Tomorrow Show, 1979>

It's a nice opinion, but it's just an opinion.  Objectivism has most of
it's philosophy in common with conservatism, not liberalism.  Ayn Rand
and Objectivism is an arch-conservative philosophy whether she or we
like the term conservative or not.  The media along with some cynical
elitist politicians have unrightfully vilified the term over the years,
and because of that some people are afraid to call themselves
conservatives or be associated with the term conservative.

Liberalism, and it's subsects of collectivism, socialism, communism and
fascism, bear no similarity whatsoever to Objectivism.  I agree with her
that very few today really know how to "preach capitalism", but the
apoligists come from a broad spectrum of people, not just "religious
altruists".

> We need to face the fact that these modern American definitions of =

> actually be put into those molds.  

Not into a mold, it's a range of thought.  On the right end of the range
is conservatism, and moving to the left we have libertarianism,
liberalism, collectivism, socialism, communism and fascism in order of
increasing tyranny.  As one pundit put it, a liberal is someone who
doesn't understand why tradition exists, a collectivist is a liberal who
knows better than you do, a socialist is a collectivist with power, a
communist is a socialist with a gun, and a fascist is a communist with
no patience.  :)

> Rush is decidedly neither =

> show an ability to see truth in all points of view.  

True enough, considering all points of view is a good thing.  But we
must keep in mind that not all points of view are based on fact and
truth, many points of view can be created on pure emotion or on
misinformation.  They may seem true and real enough, but in fact they
are not.  Truth exists, despite our opinions.  :)

> A conservative will =

So the liberal saw himself?  :)  

Recent historical revisionism aside, the Nazi party is a left-wing
political body.  The German Worker's Socialist Party (Nazi) was a
left-wing union based political party that had fascist underpinnings
from it's very inception.  The fascist philosophy that drove them is far
left liberalism, not any form of conservatism or objectivism.

As an aside, I believe that you, Patrick, were the first person in this
thread to mention Nazis.  In a humorous vein, check out this link on
Godwin's Law at:

So long as you understand that personal responsibility and self worth
are traditional conservative dogma, yes.  Conservatism is also very
rational.  

"Getting over traditional dogma" is death to a society, however. I for
one don't see that in Neil's poetry nor his prose.  I see him embracing
traditional values and other points of view for equal consideration and
rumination.

Societies survive and prosper by being and staying conservative. 
Liberal societies such as the communists in the former Soviet Union, the
fascists in Nazi Germany, and the liberalism of the Roman Empire are
examples of what happens when traditional conservative values, ethics
and morals are diminished in a society.  Conservative societies continue
on and have always been successful since the dawn of mankind.

<A NAME="2175010">Subject: Here's a little something that Anthem may not want you to hear....</A>

I am not in a good mood today everyone, cause I've just heard about a 
little trick that Anthem have pulled on a friend of mine, and I think 
the whole world should know about it...

The friend concerned is a guy called Mick Burnett who is editor of "The 
Spirit of Rush" UK/European fanzine...Mick has been doing this for about 
10 years, and is now widely recognised as developing the best Rush 
Fanzine available today....not only that, he has organised an annual UK 
Rush convention which does require a fairly large budget...

Now every year for this bash, Mick has asked Anthem to supply some 
prizes for our Grand draw which they do , and we thank them for that, 
but this year, as well as supplying the prizes, they also presented Mick 
with a bill for postage and shipping costs, totalling $325!!!!!

In the latest issue, Mick has basically had to ask subscribers to help 
him out with this...Mick does this fanzine out of the goodness of his 
heart and also out of his pocket....Is this the way that Anthem are now 
treating Rush Fans outside the US and Canada now???....Is this their new 
customer care policy???  If it is, it is DISGRACEFUL....Anthem no doubt 
make a hefty profit from managing Rush, Van Halen, amongst others....so 
why the hell did they decide to sting a UK fanzine editor for these 
costs???

This also brings up the subject of general support by Anthem and the all 
important record company of Rush in the UK/European market.....and quite 
frankly, I don't think there is any!!!!!

There has been virtually no advertising in Europe for Different Stages, 
no campaigning to VH1 and MTV Europe to play any present or past Rush 
material.....just what is going on???

In issue no 45 (Winter 98 Edition), Mick Burnett was lucky to interview 
Alex and Geddy (at his own expense!!!), and I now quote from these 
interviews:

ALEX ---- "The last time we came over to Europe for the "Roll the Bones" 
shows we had hoped to get more support from our record company at the 
time, but I guess their priorities were somewhere else and it was hard 
for us to get a substantial commitment from them for the support we 
needed to re-establish ourselves in Europe"

GEDDY ---- "We appreciate the loyalty of our fans and we never take you 
for granted and I hope one day we can get out on the road again and play 
for the fans in Europe...which we unfortunately don't pay enough 
attention to"

I don't blame Geddy, Alex and Neil for this.....but it does go to show 
that Anthem and the record companies don't seem to care...

So 2 suggestions to Anthem:

1) Apologise to Mick Burnett and agree to waive the bill you sent him..a 
public apology on here should do the trick...

2) Get up off your lazy arses and start promoting the best band on the 
planet to a mass market that is desperate to see and hear a lot more of 
them...

I await Anthem's response....the question is, will they be bothered??

Cheers,

Rob Hunter....

     Just a thought:

  Alex Lifeson releases his new "Victor" album. It becomes an overwhelming
commercial success. "Victor" goes on a tour of the U.S. They play to sold
out venues in all the major U.S. cities. On a couple of stops, guest
bassist is Geddy Lee.

     More than a thought, it's wishful thinking.

>Genesis- Seconds Out (Phil plays pretty good drums on this album)

>> umm Joe, if I'm not mistaken, most of that album's drums were Bruford ;)

Nope - mainly Chester isn't it?  However, Bruford does play on it, and does, a
tremendous intro to....hang on, what's it called,  Watcher of the Skies [I
think] ??  Right on the edge of falling apart at the seams, but holding it
together.  Then again - is that on Three Sides Live?  Now I've gone and done
it........

Anyway, I agree, Seconds Out is a belter of a live album, and so is Three
Sides Live. 

Also, back to drumming/soloing => the drum duet that Phil and Chester worked
over the years must surely earn them a place up in drummy heaven.

BTW:  does anyone know how to get the videos of BFB and A Work in Progress in
the UK, as I am not having much success in finding them?  Any help gratefully
received.

And another thing, if Geddy had ever shouted out in a gig, "Ooooooooooo
Necastle/Whitley Bay/London!" It really wouldn't have sounded as good as
"OOOOOOOoooooooooooo CHICAGO !!"  Would it?  Maybe that's why they don't tour
the UK so much       *-)

Thank you very kindly, and goodnight.

Well then, you'd be wrong.  You obviously don't understand 
liberalism (particularly demonstrated by your insistance of 
elevating misleading generalizations like "liberal" and 
"conservative" to a quasi-supernatural status by insisting on 
capitalizing them) very well or you'd know that your mistaken
(and apparently Limbotomite) view of us as soft on crime isn't 
*really* a liberal trait at all.

(Or "capitalising," for our British friends.)

Yes, the seeds of bigotry, superstition, ignorance,

right?

You can't tell me Bubba's a liberal either.  Guilt by
association doesn't always work, "Dave."  I think part of why 
so many Republicans hate Clinton is because they're
threatened by just how close to them he really is.  I read 
that somewhere not too long ago, and I tend to agree with it.

Greed is an illusion?  Just because you see a connection to 
the 1980's because the song is from 1985 doesn't necessarily 
mean it's real.  Why is The Big Money not just as relevant to 
either the 70's or the 90's?

[remaining anecdotal story-telling and name-calling 
snipped]

BTW, Neil has described himself as a "leftist libertarian."
How's that affect your view of his law-n-order, capitalist,
and individualist views?  The ones which you'd call 
Conservative?

What's a liberal?

"...one who is open-minded or not strict in the observance of orthodox,
traditional, or established forms or ways...an advocate or adherent of 
liberalism especially in individual rights...generous...broad-minded...
associated with ideals of individual especially economic freedom,
greater individual participation in government, and constitutional, 
political, and administrative reforms designed to secure these 
objectives..."  (Snipped from http://www.m-w.com/mw/netdict.htm)

that I don't particularly care for).  It kind of occurred to me that the
only artists that are on there are the ones that have had some serious
tragedy in their lives  (gotta have a story to tell, don't they?).  So now I
am starting to wonder if there have been any execs over there at VH1 that
are thinking of doing Rush now.  I can just see the suits at their board
meeting:

Executive #1:  sir, I think we should consider doing Rush now.

Executive #1's boss:  Well, they are a great band and have been around a
long time, but they just don't have enough tragedy in their lives.

Executive #1:  But sir, their drummer just lost his daughter in a car crash
and his wife to cancer.

Executive #1's boss:  THAT'S GREAT!!!  Let's do it!!   Right on it Executive
#1!!!

Pretty crude, I know.  What do you think the odds are?

Hello all. I have decided to sell some of my Rush stuff that I no longer
have the time to watch/listen to! If possible, I'd like to sell it all in
one shot, so the asking price is $110 Canadian, including shipping. Email
me privately if you are interested. If there is more than one taker, I will
pick someone at random.

The Big Money CD Video (video of Big Money, plus audio of Big Money,
Marathon, Red Sector A live)

Roll The Bones CD Single (Roll The Bones, Where's My Thing?,
Superconductor, It's A Rap pt. 3 -- Neil Peart interview)

Through The Camera Eye video, VHS

Grace Under Pressure Tour video, VHS

Roll The Bones bootleg video, VHS (opening night of the tour in Hamilton,
Ont. The first couple of songs, as well as the last few are actually from
the Hold Your Fire tour, I guess because the camera guy wasn't prepared. It
also includes some soundchecks)

Exit Stage Left video, VHS (I bought this in Europe years ago, before I
knew about the whole PAL-NTSC thing. This is an NTSC transfer of the
original PAL tape, which I have since misplaced. It does have the original
cover though.)

So email me if you are interested. By the way, there is a webguide called
Suite101.com, and they are always looking for good writers to be
contributing editors. I write the Star Wars column, and I've noticed that
they have a lot of musical categories, but so far no one is writing about
Rush. If anyone out there wants to write a column a couple of times a
month, and find all the best Rush websites, you should check it out. They
just need a couple of writing samples from you, and the pay is extremely
minimal.
One last thing. I'm currently reading this great sci-fi book called Sewer,
Gas & Electric by Matt Ruff, and one of the main "characters" is the
talking holographic head of Ayn Rand. It's a pretty cool book, sort of
along the lines of Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy! I highly recommend it.

I have an opportunity to buy "Everything Your Listeners Wanted to Hear
By Rush... But You Were Afraid to Play" which is the US promo which
was issued to radio stations in 1975.

Does anyone have more info on this rare vinyl, especially any idea of
it's value? I haven't a clue how much it's worth and I don't want to
get ripped off.

Please reply directly to mhanc@usa.net as the NMS seems to be a bit

Hello fellow Rush fans.  Long time listner, first time caller...

Short and sweet.	

I was watching VH1 today and an episode of Rock and Roll Jeopardy was on.
First, two degrees. The actor named Jim on the left was from Mandeville,
Louisiana (home state) and played keyboards in a local band called the
Qubes.  Well, my best friend at the time was named Mike, the drummer for a
band named the Qubes. We lived in Covington, just north of Mandeville.
This was a long time ago and my memory's a little faded, but it all seems
to fit. I haven't talked to Mike in 11 years, so nothing is verified.

Double Rush

Same show, Final Jeopardy. Question: (paraphrased) "Fittingly, what band
has played a concert at Mount Rushmore?
First two answers, "Who is Rush?" The third answer (Jim's), "Who is The
Presedents of the United States of America." 
It was just too cool not to write about.

Thought some of you would appreciate this.  Thanks for the time...

Hi Fellow Rushians,
	The number of visitors on my page has finally gone beyond 2112 since
September 2. I want to thank all of the people who visit my site.
	Also, I bought A Show Of Hands (the video) to add to my video
collection (I also have Chronicles: The Video Collection.) I thought it
was a great concert video. I like the little cartoon entitled "Escape
>From Moving Pictures." I wonder who thought that thing up. I had no idea
that the video was going to have little cartoons in it. They were all
cartoons that were played on the movie screen during the concert.

Sorry if this has been mentioned before.
Does anybody know the story behind why
"Geddy, Alex, and Neil of Rush" are mentioned 
in the credits on the album 'Master of Puppets'?

I was told also that years ago Geddy was spotted
wearing a 'Master of Puppets' t-shirt.  Maybe there's 
some kinda connection.

Nobody has mentioned this yet, so I will bring it up.  In case
you're not "already aware," Mike Bahr has supposedly  found about
four people to take over the production of his bootleg CDs.  They are
supposed to fulfill all of Mike's unfulfilled orders.  Has anybody
heard from any of these people yet?  If and when anybody knows 
anything, please e-mail me, or better yet, post it to this mailing list, 
because I know there are a lot of others out there who are waiting 
for their CDs.  I personally have $224 at stake here.

I guess that would have to be the guy from Goldfinger (the band, not the

And they're not a glam band.  (*Very* punk/ska.)  

Well, either him, or Shelia E.  ;)

     Hello fellow Rushians, here's a question that is a little more senible
that the Peart-Collins or fastest guitarist debates.  (Sorry if I offend
anyone!)   I have a couple of questions about Alex.   1)  I understand that he
INVENTED the guitar stand that he uses live when he does songs like "Closer to
the Heart."  You know, the one that holds his Ovation while his PRS or
whatever is strapped below it.  Is this true?  

I'm reasonably certain that Alex didn't _invent_ the guitar stand that he uses.  Steve Howe used one at least as far back as the Relayer tour, and probably 
further back than that (I haven't watched Yessongs in ages... did he use one 
in '73 as well??).  So, that places the use of such a stand at 1974 (and likely 
earlier)...

Now, the Omega concern is trademarked in the liner notes of one of the albums.  There are two possible explanations:
1)  Like much of the rest of the liner notes, it's a joke.
2)  Alex _trademarked_ the guitar stand (which means, of course, that he could 
have been the first, fifth, or millionth guy to use one of those things; he 
was just the first one smart enough to register it with a government).

Also remember, there were about 20 years of experience between those 
tunes.  Peart's outlook -- or any man's -- is bound to change during a time 
span of that length.  Especially between the very different lives of a 
young adult first tasting rock stardom and a mature veteran of the music world.

Anyway, I'd simply say, Dichotomy schmotomy, both songs rock. :)

During one of those VH1 documentarys about 80's bands, The FIXX commented on
how dark their music was, and how ironic it was to be on stage playing their
dark music and having "pink underwear" thrown at them.

>   the Fixx unfortunately stagnated until it was too late 

The FIXX took a seven year hiatus not because of lack of sales, etc., but
