Hello...I have been reading this list for some time
now, and I must say Get A life! Nah, I'm just joking.

Seriously, I would like to know what time it says on
my watch too. Also, could anyone tell me what
I meant when I wrote "Christ, what have you done?"... Thanks a lot!

Greetings!

  Three things on the agenda today:

  I was just reading all the discussion of "Power Windows" as referring to
computer windowing systems.  Well, maybe, but considering the album cover
(with all the TVs), it's always made more sense to me that the TV's are the
"Power Windows" -- i.e. they're a "window on the world" that you have to plug
in.  (q.v. "Activate the window and watch the world go 'round.").  Maybe this
has already been brought up, but I missed it if if was.

  Next, I'm trying to find Rush posters.  I've had no success in Boston at all
(Lots of LedZep, Grateful Dead, and New Kids (:-P), but no Rush).  Is this one
of the things to be had from the backstage club, and if so, which ones do they
have?

  I've just purchased my FIFTH (yes, 5) copy of the Chronicles video.  It,
like the preceding four, is defective.  It has a glitch in the middle of
"Closer to the Heart", and another in "Limelight".  I'm really tired of
hauling these damned things back.  Anybody know how I can get in touch with
Polygram to see about getting a new one?

Thanks!

Hello-

Just a few random babblings from a deranged mind-

1) All this talk of influences. If anybody out there has "Jailbreak" by
Thin Lizzy, listen to the 2nd side. The solos for "The Cowboy Song" and
"Emerald" sound like they could have been played by Mr. Lifeson himself.
Don't know if it's Alex borrowing from Brian Robertson or vice versa, or
just common influences, but the resemblance is striking. Dunno, maybe I'm
just crazy, let me have your opinion. (about the solos that is 8-b)

2) In the videos from Moving Pictures (the ones taped at LeStudio) there
is a white doubleneck, (a Rik bass/12-string). However, I have only seen
Geddy playing a black one (ESL video and live in '81 {or was it '82}).
Has anyone ever seen the white one live? I think you can see it in the
background in one of the pictures from Permanent Waves, also.

    Just a short note to answer David Conley's question about Rivendell:
I'm pretty certain that Geddy is playing the classical guitar in that
song. Aleis playing the little "swelling" notes in the background with
an electric guitar by using the volume knob. He also does this in By Pass,
like Steve Kilpatrick said where it sounded sort of like Page's bowing.

[ A scaled-back version is found in the intro to La Villa ...   :rush-mgr ]

In "Beyond Borders" Alex sounds just like a violin section by using a
volume pedal and effects.

	Well, the fool who stole it was either a record rep for
	Atlantic or worked in a radio station.  Essentially, someone
	made $5 for music he probably didn't care for (now THAT'S
	where he's foolish...).

	And, ah, I'd be happy to help as well, as soon as I can grab
	my copy back from a friend who "borrowed" it....

	So I guess that goes to all out there: do you all want a
	transcription of the thing?  I'm sure K. and I can split the
	task soon (feel free to drop me a line, Keith).

	Oh, and if Presto isn't their best album since Subdivisions,
	I'm sick.  Am I only the ONLY person out there who cannot
	STAND ASOH?

Well...

	Can anyone identify the zeppelin song that sounds EXACTLY like the
guitar part to Beneath, Between and Behind?  It is also a remarkable
similarity...

	Although it is really pushing it, there is a very remote resemblance
between the synth part to Kashmir and the synth part in the middle of YYZ...

	Also, Farewell to Kings is not even close to Stairway to Heaven...

Firstly, the results of the Presto poll will be released in ISSUE 204!!!

Secondly, with reference to **RUSH FAVORITES POLL RESULTS** as posted by
kmarino@bonnie.ics.uci.edu I cannot **B E L I E V E** that A Farewell To
Kings is the all time FAvourite album!!!!!!!!
I must say some of the other choices (eg : Open Secrets from HYF) are a bit
odd aswell!! Oh well, just my opinion....andbody else agree!!??
The ONLY two I agree with are Bastille Day (easy winner) from COS and
Distant Early Warning from P/G....!!

As for favourite song performed live....its GOT to be Spirit Of Radio off ESL.

Anyway, enough bagging out other peoples polls!!
The result sof the Presto poll are very intersting, although there does seem
to be SOME direction!!
To make is statistically better I need more votes!!! (I have ~40 at the moment)

VOTE NOW: Top 4 songs in order on Presto!!

Thirdly, I need info on the backstage club.

I believe Alex just used a volume pedal and lots of echo effects
on that.  The slow chords are just a matter of playing the chord
and then fading it in, and then fading it out and letting the
echo fill in the space while you're starting the next chord.  And
as far as the other effects are concerned, it's amazing what
strange noises can be dragged out of a guitar when you do things
like scrape the strings or tap on the pickup while your echo and
distortion are jacked to the ceiling.

(Caveat: I never saw him play it live, either.  But I always liked
that section, and worked hard to emulate it in yesteryear.)

>X-Mailer: Mail User's Shell (7.2.1 10/31/90)

	In yesterday's NMS, jcrabtree@desire.wright.edu asked about
an apparent  contradiction between the lyrics to Free Will, as they
are sung and as they are printed on the inner sleeve. In the lyrics
for Free Will, it is printed  as the following:  "If you choose not
to decide, you still haven't made a choice". However, when I listen
to the song,  it sounds like  Geddy sings the  following:   "If you
choose not to decide, you still have made a choice".

	Our lovely and talented moderator reminds us that

  "The answer is sort of "we're both right".  The lyrics *sung* are
  "you still have made a choice", and on my sleeve from PeW it says
  "you cannot have made a choice".   When Neil was asked about this
  discrepency in the Backstage Club newsletter a few issues ago, he
  said that all lyrics are sung just as they are in the lyric sheet.
  Bzzzz.  Not quite Neil!"

	The lyric sheet to my album (on Anthem Records - the
Canadian release) has the words as "you still have made a choice".
It could be Neil Peart looked at the inner sleeve of the Canadian
release, decided that all these Americans asking about a discrepancy
between the printed and recorded lyrics were sniffing glue, and
no one in charge of fixing the mistake in the US release was notified.
Is this plausible?

[ Whoosh, I didn't even consider that the lyrics would be *printed
  differently* in the US vs. Canada!  The Mercury version (original
  pressing even, NOT a reissue) does NOT have "still have made a
  choice".  Well, one mystery solved, another one started!   :rush-mgr ]

Speaking of musical phrases quoted by Rush, how about this little number...
Compare every fourth bar of "In the End" with the intro to Focus'
"Hamburger Concerto" (Anyone remember Focus?  Thijs van Leer,Jan Akkerman,
etc.? Their entire collection is available on 8 import CDs, BTW). That only
makes one more link in a chain, though.  The very same intro quotes a
Hungarian folk tune :-)

Any other out there long for a return of Cygnus X-1?  I remember seeing
it on the Hemispheres tour; pitch black in the arena, suddenly Geddy's
bass erupts into the opening lines at full volume - no fade in.  Made for
a great effect, with the stage lights flashing only on the snare hits for
the first few lines, coming up full when they got past the pauses between
lines.
