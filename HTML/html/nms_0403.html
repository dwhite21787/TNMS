Just a couple of quickies: 

PLEASE send your mail to the correct address.  I've gotten several
list posts at the administrative address in the last week or two.
It just adds that much overhead to this job to forward the item to
the right address, then send mail back to the culprit, then edit the
header in the NMS when I put it together (so it didn't come from me,
but the original poster).  It may sound like a picket nit, but it would
help me out.

Also, remember, when you temporarily unsubscribe, it's up to *you* to
resubscribe when you're back.  With the size of this list I can't be
responsible for remembering when to re-add someone...

Enough bitching, on with the show.

I can't view the gifs I download from the ftp site. I am
using compushow and vgif but niether will work. They do other
gifs fine, but I can't seem to view any gifs from syrinx.
To those who have successfully seen them, what program

After learning of the "Lerxtwood Mall" and such from the back of "Signals",
I proceeded to examine the map.  I only have the casette, sans map, but
I had access to someone's CD.  Yes, all of the nicknames are there, but
there is also the Warren Cromartie Secondary School.  For those of you
who don't know, Warren Cromartie was an outfielder for the Montreal Expos
during the late 70s - early 80s.  Obviously, this was Geddy's idea.

The movie, "The Fountainhead", is available on VHS tape. I ahve rented it.
It does star Gary Cooper and is an excellent movie. Now if someone would
just produce "Atlas Shrugged" as a mini-series...

I have seen people questioning whether there are any other songs within
the Gangster of Boats Trilogy, but my question is how can Where's My Thing
be Part Four in a Trilogy??

As for those arguing the talents of the men (I dare say boys), you obviously
have overlooked the fact that Neil Peart is consistently voted Best Drummer
by the readers of Modern Drummer magazine.  Somehow I think they (I being one
of them and a percussionist of 10 years) would know more about percussive
performance than anyone else.  The reason Neil Peart is good (I won't call himm
the best since "There are no absolutes") is because he can reproduce his
studio performance without any aid.  He doesn't go back and overdub drum
samples.  He doesn't try and baffle people by adding impossible licks later
in the mastering process of the album.  He has raw talent and can surprisingly
still move on his kit for a man over the hill.

For the record, I do not worship Rush, I just enjoy their music and the
talents of Neil.  I guess you could say I idolize Neil.

Have a Holiday.

G&S all,

I was talking to the dude at Record Den, and he said that the boyz
might be coming back to Cleveland (at the Blossom music center or
whatever it's called).  Can anyone verify this???  I'd give anything
to see Rush again!!!  The dude at RD is very reliable (as he's
been correct about the final dates of GnR's new CDs, and even
got me a copy of RTB 2 days before the release date :-).  I hope
this rumor is right!!

By the way, I finally got my hands on the "Archives" set on tape.
The record set may follow.

Once again, anyone who has, or plans to get, a bootleg of the
RTB tour, LEMME KNOW!!!!!!!!!!

<A NAME="403010">Subject: Noise at Rush concert</A>

    What's up, everyone. This is my first post. I am responding to the poster 
who said that the concert he went to was really loud. I had that same problem
when I went to some other concerts both at large arenas (Capital Center) and 
smaller places. Generally what I find is that the opening act screws your
ears up the most.
     As soon as Vinnie Moore hit the stage, I said to myself "Oh shit, are my
ears going to be ringing." He was so noisy, it seemed like there was more
distortion than music. After that, during the intermission, I went to the
bathroom and could hardly hear anything. By the time Rush came onstage, I had
recovered enough to hear them perfectly. Either I was really deaf and they
were really loud, or I was fine and they weren't too loud. Whatever the case,
I heard almost everything, including that cool speaker setup at the back of
the center.
     After two days, my ears were fine. However, I will bring earplugs for
opening groups from now on. I think I am still recovering from a concert
I went to this summer. I won't say who for fear of flamage, but suffice it
to say that it was _loud._

Have fun!

<A NAME="403311">From: "Philip M. Simon" <ps3q+@andrew.cmu.edu></A>
<A NAME="403011">Subject: Rush Fans</A>

   I have to disagree with some of the more recent posts about Rush
fans' fanaticism superceding their common sense. The general theme about
Rush fans, which as of late has been discussed, is that we can take no
criticism about the boyz and take an absolutist position with regard to
their music.  I can only speak for myself (and  maybe a few friends),
but I vehemently disagree with these kind of statements, for I'd like to
think that this is the exception rather than the rule.

    Many of the Rush fans I know keep at least some degree of
objectivity about the band and its members.  For example, we think of
Rush as "our favorite" band as opposed to the best band; Neil as _one
of_ the best drummers ever (to argue absolutes is pointless and
endless).

    I take no umbrage with someone says "Well, I like group X better" or
"I don't like or listen to Rush."  However, what I do have a problem
with is the individual who derides Rush, and/or refuses to recognize
their music ability at all.  I've heard on innumerable occasions (from
the ignorant masses) the words "Rush sucks."  This I have no tolerance
for, since objectively their talent as musicians (and Neil's as a
lyricist) cannot be legitimately denied.

    In short, I'd like to think that Rush fans are quite dedicated, but
not blinded by our love for the band.  And as dedicated fans, we like to
defend our group when they are attacked.  I take a similar stand with
the Washington Redskins (my favorite football team for almost a decade
now).  I happen to think that they are the best the NFL has to offer,
but I will argue that point (as well as many others) any time.  The
operative word is "intelligently".  The same principle applies to Rush.
I contend that the majority of us realize they are just human beings,
capable of making mistakes and producing less than spectacular music.
But we, or at least I,  will not sit idly by as they are unjustly
disparaged.

<A NAME="403312">From: jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger)</A>
<A NAME="403012">Subject: Rush worship & Rand and Rush: errors.</A>

Well, the last NMS was quite disappointing! Having seen what was perhaps
one of the most incredible Rush shows ever (12/10, Worcester) I learned
that Eric wasn't able to pull off his DAT coup (sorry, man!). Then the
pathetic subject of `Rush worship' came up again, and my friend (really!)
Tero repeated the title of his original anti-Rush-worship submission
which happens to include my name! By now I'm sure Tero knows that I'm
not _really_ a Rush worshipper. I _am_, however, enthusiastic about Rush
and their ideas.

There are (very few) people on this list who may go overboard in
their praise. This happens when someone makes a comparison between
Rush and some other band (or musician) which they _personally_ don't
like or are tired of hearing praised (especially by Rolling Stone!). The
result is sure to be absurd under these conditions, because taste is
substituted for substance. This is what should be avoided. Happily, I
can say I've never made such comparisons, which is why I regret Tero's
use of my name. I am not someone who says `Rush are gods!'; in fact it's
against my religious principles (to the extent that I have any) to say
of any human (or group of humans) that he is god. And, of course, only
someone with no sense of reality could literally _mean_ such statements.

What such a person is _actually_ doing is making the dogmatic leap of
judgement to: Rush (or Neil or Geddy or Alex) are the best musicians who
ever lived and no-one will _ever_ be better. Well, this is just irrational.
So let us hope that no more of our fellows will `snap!' in the future. On
the other hand, please don't lump enthusiasts such as myself with such
people just because we love Rush and praise them in a rational manner.

Speaking of rationality and fanaticism, a few (in my well considered opinion)
falsities were written, in the last NMS, about the relationship between
Ayn Rand's ideas and Rush lyrics. I like Ayn Rand's novels and many of
her ideas, though I find her philosophy impoverished in many respects
(MO, no flames, please). Neil has certainly been affected by Rand and I
think he still is. _Roll the Bones_ makes that clear, and it is not IMO
unrelated that during this tour ``Anthem'' reappeared in their set.
Neil said in a `Kerrang' Interview (``The Spirit of Peart'' ~1983) that
he's ``not as big a fan of [Rand] as [he's] made out to be.'' On the other
hand when asked recently (Backstage Club newsletter) how he feels about
Rand, he said ``Pretty good. How about you?'' So, though the _influence_
is there, perhaps, but explicit support of the _2112_/`Anthem' kind are
waning...

Now on to the erroneous posting:

>Freewill expresses another Rand concept of
>atheism, complete freewill and your obligation to decide for yourself.

It is true that Rand was an atheist and considered any theist to be
irrational. But there is nothing in ``Freewill'' expressing atheism;
there is only a criticism of deterministic psychology deriving from
the presumption of absolute supernatural control. The three
monotheistic religions of the world declare that man has free will.
So it is not correct to say that `Freewill expresses...atheism', sorry.
RTB' is far more skeptical than `Free Will,' but it stops short of
atheism also (see below).

>Limelight, Witch Hunt, and Vital Signs all express basically the evils of
>mass popular culture, the mob, and mass produced super technology.

Major conclusion jumping. Explain. All! Certainly `Witch Hunt' doesn't
have anything to do with the mass-produced super-technology.
Rand is certainly _for_ mass-produced super technology, anyway!

>Subdivisions
>is all about childhood battles for independence against an all absorbing
>society, as is Kid Gloves. The Body Electric is another example of super
>technology trying to have freewill.

See above. What is the other example of super-technology trying to have
free will? Neil just likes the possibilities lying in technology (and is
wary of the effects of its going out of control). As for free will, one
either has it or doesn't. When Neil writes ``I will choose free will''
he means he will choose the _thesis_ of free will, not free will itself!

>Neil expresses a belief that emotion
>must be balanced with rationality in Open Secrets when he says " I find
>no absolution in my rational point of view. Maybe somethings are instinctive,
>but there is one thing you can do."

This leaves out what comes next: `You can try to understand me.' Rand never
particularly advocated worrying about other people's thoughts and
feelings (unless those people are threatening one). Rand said that emotion
must be _based_ on reason, not just balanced with it. Open Secrets is
not particularly Randian.

> Superconductor is an example of people
>who just perform to please the crowd and soak up second-hand self esteem.

This one is quiet correct. This is very Randian; a study of the
`second hander' in popular Western culture. It was great live this
tour, too!

>Most of RTB talks about not believing in fate or supreme being but in taking
>our chances and living life to the fullest.

Again, it's not correct to say that Neil talks about atheism here. Instead
he is skeptical about the existence of a supreme being. This is called
`agnosticism.' Look at `Row the Boats' (in the syrinx archives or the
tour book) and the song `You Bet Your Life' to see what Neil thinks
about belief. He's far more open-minded (though just as serious, IMO) in
his thinking than Rand...

So, the Rand influence remains, but it is _not_ _everywhere_!

<A NAME="403013">Subject: Turner, Valkonen, fanaticism, et al</A>

    Hi all,

    My first post to TNMS.  As the topic of fanaticism seems to have
    arisen, I feel compelled to add my two cents about "rush worship" as
    well as RTB.

    I have been a DIE HARD Rush fan for some 13 years and have seen them
    live at least once per tour on every tour since Permanent Waves.  Thus,
    I have seen them literally bring the house down and, more than once, I
    have seen them "bite the big one".  I don't care who you are or what
    band you're with, sometimes you have a bad night- WE ARE ALL (even
    rush) HUMAN.

    As well as 13 years of devout interest in Rush,  I have played lead
    guitar and bass for some 15 years, so I feel competent in saying that
    these guys are, without question, fine musicians.  I don't think anyone
    would argue that point.  Perhaps no other factor has so impacted my
    personal philosophies, musicianship, and my "critical" ear as these
    three guys.  But I DO NOT worship them, their music, or their
    philosophies.  They are just three guys who do what they do very
    precisely and effectively- and I like it a lot.  But there lies a great
    danger in accepting anything rush does just because they are "Rush"-
    this applies to any band, politician, leader, philosophy or ideal.
    Isn't this the very message that underlies "Rush"?  The insidious
    nature of fanaticism leaves us sometimes wide open to "blind"
    following.  My point is that, as listeners and fans, we must all keep a
    rational and objective eye on ourselves, or the whole rush "journey" is
    pointless.

    Finally, a quick comment on RTB-  Indeed it is a fantastic album- as
    far as rock and roll goes, but IMO, the album is mediocre for a Rush
    album.  The songs have predictable form and less than challenging
    technical aspects.  The very thing that in the past set them so far
    above the rest of the rock world. (unpredictable form and CHALLENGING
    phrases).  In light of this, I think I will forgo seeing this tour, as
    I believe that, thus far, I have seen the best they can do- perhaps I
    will be pleasently surprised in the future.

    Anyone feeling the desire to flame me, please do so, but e-mail me
    privately and save TNMS for more constructive exchanges.

<A NAME="403014">Subject: Misinterpreting Rand</A>

Matt the bassist:
     Neil's influence by Ayn Rand is, of course, unmistakeable(the best
exampleI can think, excluding the whole of '2112', is the 'Trees').  But be
careful about trying to paint him as an objectivist because HE IS NOT.  I've
read enough of his lyrics to know this.
     I don't want to get this list in a big Rand discussion, but suffice it to
say that one should not speak authoritativly about objectivism when talking
about a compromise between reason and love (Hemipheres).  Neil's
interpretationis one thing, Ayn Rand's idea here is another.  Accordding to
objectivism and Ayn Rand, there no such thing as 'bad' or 'too much' reason or
selfishness. I'm assuminghere that by selfishness, I mean rational egoism.
This is something totally different than what Neil writes about sometimes.  As
much as I respect Neil in a ton of different ways, I still don't like many of
his lyrics-e.g. Mystic Rythems, Territories (anti-property?), basically
everything after Signals.
     Matt, you must be new to Ayn Rand or you haven't read much.  If so,
consult some of her non-fiction on her idea of 'selfishness' and then
recompare this to Neil's interpretation thereof.  I think you'll find some
important differences.  Be careful not to take Neil's ideas as synonomous
with those of objectivism.  They are often quite different.

titles and see if there's anything of great interest to me...  In any
case, I will leave the files available on chaos for the time being,
but I would like to find someone who would like to take over the
management of the list from me.  Anyone interested?

I hope everyone reads this because the spoiler portion will be
conspicuously concealed at the end....

Anyway. I've been a die-hard Rush fan (like most of you, I'm sure)
for about 10-12 years now. At times I've crossed the line into
fanaticism, but I think now I've got a broader view. My point is
(aside from at the top of my head) that maybe we all have periods
of hero-worship in our lives. Let's face it, the last 10-15 years
haven't exactly been replete with heros (or heroines)! Rush has al-
ways served as something to look up to for me. By consistently re-
maining true to their musical ideals (their personal one's are of
no consequence to me), they affirm my belief that you have to strive
for some goal. This may still sound like fanaticism, but I disagree.
They play great music, they play it more or less the way they want to,
and they have a good time. What else can anyone ask for but to do what
they like doing for a living?

	The show from Dec. 10 in Worcester MA was incredible! I had al-
ready seen them in Rochester, NY, and boy, the improvement was staggering.
They had ironed out all of the rough spots, and sample timings. and they
were in an incredible mood.
	Neil was so relaxed and funny. I thought he was having a second
childhood! At the end of a song, he did the "And they're off!" trumpet
call on bells. Very amusing! During the medley, he actually stood up
and did Pete Townsend-style air guitar with Ged!
	The solos, everyone's, were stellar!  Alex extended almost all
of the RTB solos, and modify several of the classic ones.
	A glowing gem of the evening was Ghost of A Chance, which is
apparently now part of the permanent set list. They weren't playing it
earlier in the tour, so I was happy to see the show in two different
incarnations.
	All in all, the jamming and performance were spectacular, and
the person who said that missing this tour would be a big mistake
is certainly correct!
	Hope I get to see them in Baltimore and Long Island!

<A NAME="403018">Subject:      A road adventurer from the other face of the earth</A>

     Hi to all NMS road adventurers,

I'm an Alexian school guitar player and a dedicated student of Rush
realms of wisdom and emotion for ten years.

I know that it's unusual to ask from total strangers but I have to do
this for my desperate demand. It's the concert recordings, guys. I know
that Rush played Chemistry, The Analog Kid, Countdown on Signals tour,
Afterimage (several times), Kid Gloves, Between The Wheels on GUP tour,
Middletown Dreams, Red Lenses, Grand Designs on Power Windows tour and
these songs were not put on the latest live album as we all know. I've
even heard of the CD bootleg of Presto tour which was on market in England
and reading NMS makes the situation more difficult to bear : there are Rush
Fans out there listening to first two shows of RTB tour comfortably on
their stereos.
    My only request is if you have any of the bootlegs of the tours that
I mentioned above or any bootlegs of tours starting from Hemispheres tour,
please, email me your address I will forward a blank tape or tapes, expenses,
etc. Hearing the above mentioned songs live is something which is so ultimately
important & vital thing for me!
    The second thing I want to say - although I know that it will make
some Rush fans furious about me - is on some of the articles written by
some Rush fans, here it goes :
    RUSH IS A FORM OF ART, YOU EITHER LIKE OR DISLIKE. It's strange to see
comparison comments on the old albums and the new ones, if the new albums
do not coincide with your personal taste, it's not because Rush's music
was better in the old days, it's because that Rush makes albums beyond
your expectations or predictions and to understand any new album done by
Rush, you have to modify and update your patterns of recognition, perception
and other clever senses. This is a dynamic system we are living in and
Rush is aware of that more than anyone else. Also, buying a Rush album
does not give you the right to treat Rush as if it's your own property,
it's a material thing you buy, you don't buy any right to criticize them.
So if you have guts to face the reality, it's an ultimate challenge to
understand a new album done by Rush. Believe or not, each new album is
unpredictable steps ahead of the previous one whether you like it or not,
it's a fact and it's correct!
     Also, a footnote on Eric Johnson, to me Rush is the only band which
absolutely has no substitute, and is based on real integrity very
artistically and scientifically, but there are also some other bands that
can be appreciated to certain degrees with frank approaches as well. Eric
Johnson is one of the best examples I can think of, his whole work on the
tunes both technical-wise and musical-wise is very cleverly worked out and
deeply thought. Alex has absolutely no substitute on the planet, Eric also
as a guitar player and a musician who is so noble and real, can be
appreciated very much objectively. Rush is one of the rarest things in the
world forcing us to be as objective as possible, so we are responsible for
what we say about Rush.

                                         C87752@trmetu.bitnet

P.S. I'm a member of a band which has been playing Rush tunes for a long
     time. If you send me a blank tape, I could also record some of the
     Rush tunes we play, our name is ONAWAY we are a three piece band. We
     are all university students, we've been thinking of transporting the
     name of our band across the ocean for a long time...

<A NAME="403019">Subject: Rush and Rand</A>

No one can argue that Rand has had a great impact on early Rush, but
there seems to be a bit of a discrepency about her effect on later Rush.
 I think that Objectivism tends to be an "Immature" philosophy (I'm
going to get flamed for that, but owell).  I'm not saying that it is
bad, or has no practical use (just like children don't have "no
practical use" and aren't "bad").  Immature is a word that has taken on
an far too negative meaning in modern society.  Take, for example, the
issue of the so-called "Robber barons".  Rand admires them, almost
deifies them.  I also feel that they deserve a great amount of respect
for forging great empires from nothing but hard work (and I certainly
don't feel that they OWE anyone anything for that), but that view is
tempered by the knowledge that they also paid off public officials,
sabatoged competetor's equipment, and participated in a host of other
little improprieties.

What I DO mean by immature is that it is the first philosophy that many
grab onto when first delving into the world of ideas, due to its
romantic image, its  "Rationality", etc.  After an initial infatuation
period, however, I think most people tend to become slightly more
moderate about Objectivism, and may slide a bit towards other
philosophies.  It is a natural progression.  I think Neil has done this
through the years, slowly assimilating his old Objectivist ideas with
newly found ones.  So, new Rush might not be "based" on Ayn Rand, but
still has a distinctly Rand flavor.

Look at some specific issues: it is still athiestic (Ghost of a Chance),
still individualistic (Dreamline), and still has the vibrant call of
life that Rand often tried to capture in her writing.  Above and beyond
that it contains references to other schools of thought, as well as some
uniquely Rush ideas.  I would rather see this than a stagnant mindset
that only harped on Objectivism.

Date: Fri, 13 Dec 91 13:45:07 EST

In the past, I have been mostly an observer to this list, however, with all of
the current talk about the RTB tour and the fact that I just saw the Albany
show last night, I have decided to put in my two cents. The show last night
was quite enjoyable. This show was much better than the Presto show that came
by two years ago. I enjoyed all of the prerequisite effects, such as the laser
lights, the fog, the movie screen, as well as music so well played that even my
dad would have liked the show. I would like to comment on a few of the past
posts and what I experienced. Someone commented that the definition of poor
crowd quality was that of a passive audience; one that does not act like they
are having a seizure every time they hear the beginning of a new song, whether
the song be a popular one or not. I am a passive person, but the show energized
me in a different fashion. The reverberations from the bass and the drums
caused the entire arena, including myself, to vibrate. I was tapping my foot
and playing a little bit of the air drums, but I happened to want to sit down
and relax when I watched. Spend your entire day, working at a Kay-Bee toy shop
in a mall, standing up and dealing with the usual "joyous" christmas shoppers,
and we'll see how many people will want to jump up and down for 2 hours. But,
enough of that. My seats were on the lower level, on the RHS, about six rows
from the floor, halfway back. I could see the entire stage perfectly while
seated. I agree that "The Rhythm Method" was the best that I had heard. It
really went well; the best that I have heard Neil perform it. I also believe
that Geddy did not do the rap live due to the initial volume difficulties
that occured when the rap began on the screen. Otherwise, I don't remember
a time where the music was too loud to hear the vocals or when the effects
were out of sync with the rest of the song. I was a little disappointed
to see the return of the"magic" on stage. When that happened, I could 
accurately predict what the next ten minutes was going to be. I like to 
guess what comes
next in a show, but this "magic" clue was a total giveaway. All in all, it was
the best show that I have seen. Also, it wasn't as loud as the last show. Even
Vinnie Moore was more deafening. I guess that each stop on the tour provides
the band with constant opportunities to fine-tune their performances. I highly
recommend that that you blow $20 to see the show.

   Let me start with an overall response, WOW!!
What a show. I've been eagerly awaiting this show for god knows how long 
and it was well worth the wait. As expected Vinnie Moore sucked but not as 
bad as everyone said.
But anyway, thats not what I went to see. Rush totally kicked ass, even 
more so than on the Presto tour which blew me away at the time. Neil's solo 
was absolutely amazing.
The encore was great, what can i say? it was the best (excludingPink Floyd'88).
I was a little disapointed that they didn't play Mission (one of my 
favorites) and the sampling on Force Ten was a little off, but all in all 
it gave me woody.
Now for a couple questions. Anyone know the significance (if any) of those 
gray splotches on the screen during Dreamline?
Also, Does anyone know for sure if they're playing Nassau Colesium or 
Meadowlands on  March 13?
This is somewhat important to me since thats my spring break and if I'm 
home on L.I.  I can see them again if they play Nassau. Anyway, I've heard 
both so thats why I ask.
I'll appreciate any info.

               Thanx,
                Kevin

Review/Rock

More Technological than Human      by Karen Schoemer

	Rush's concert at Madision Square Garden on Friday night was so
overwhelming that it was easy to forget there were actually three men
onstage.  Before Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart even took
the stage, a wide-screen projection showed a vaguely Cubist animated
cartoon of the three musicians vaulting through the air with their
instruments.  Throughout the set, the backdrop intermittently displayed
diverse and surreal images of drum kits suspended over water, geometric
computer graphics, children gazing at space ships and flying bird's-eye
views of landscapes.
	The music itself was not so much a collection of songs as a nonstop
technological force.  Mr. Peart, the drummer, seldom played anything as
simple as a back beat, instead laying down complex, assaultive patterns
with frequent time changes.  Mr. Lifeson's speedy, baroque guitar solos
added the next layer, with their counterpoint in Mr. Lee's florid,
melodic bass lines.  But during numbers like "Roll the Bones," the title
track from Rush's latest album on Atlantic, most of the music semmed to
come from prerecorded backing tapes, anyway.  Combine this with a film of
a skeleton in Wayfarer sunglasses doing an electronic rap, and the
musicians themselves were practically invisible.
	The thousands of teen-agers in the audience, most of them male,
screamed every lyric and punched their fists in the air.  The played air
guitar, air keyboards, and air drums.  Since Rush's 1974 debut album,
continuing with early 1980's albums like "Permanent Waves" and "Moving
Pictures," this band has been a kind of rite of passage.  With lyrics
about such grand philosophic issues as free will, destiny and apocalypse,
Rush creates music that is bigger than life, dazzling in its technological
feats.  The teen-age mind is chaos; Rush is perfect order.  It's like a
sonic video game.
	On Firday night, Mr. Lee, who is also the vocalist, rarely
addressed the audience.  He didn't move around onstage much, except to give
a stiff kick here and there.  By the end of the concert and songs like
"Tom Sawyer," swirling prisms of laser light surrounded him and Mr.
Lifeson, and one wondered whether they were indeed robots or holograms.
Then during the encore rendition of "The Spirit of Radio," from "Permanent
Waves," Mr. Lee suddenly smiled and clapped Mr. Lifeson on the back.  Such
a simple gesture came as a tremendous relief; they _were_ human, after
all.
