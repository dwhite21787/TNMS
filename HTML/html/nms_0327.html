Some of you may have noticed that you're receiving old copies of the NMS
today.  I've gotten two so far at my mailing address for NMS stuff.  I'm
not sure why this is happening, but I have an idea.  Earlier today, while
moving equipment around, a co-worker accidently disconnected the cable that
attaches Syrinx's big external disk drive.  We had to reboot the system
(which would also explain any ftp oddness around 13:00-14:00 EDT) and fiddle
a bit to get things back to normal.  Now you know.

        The DJ at WOUR (Utica,NY) played "Face Up" today.  This is the first
time I've heard any song off RTB besides "Dreamline."  This song really really
rocks and features some interesting stuff from Alex.
        Before playing the song, the DJ said that he was teasing everyone
because he had the entire album in his hands at the moment.  I'll have to
wait until tomorrow (11/29) at 11 pm EST when the whole album will be played
to hear the rest.  Can't wait 'til then!

<A NAME="327003">Subject:    Review of RTB in Kerrang.</A>

Hi,

   This is a review of Roll the Bones from this week's issue of Kerrang!
magazine (no. 356, Aug 31). They gave it a 4K (out of 5 rating.

      ------------------------------------------------------------

 "  Aye, it's been a funny year so far in terms of musical surprises
and detours: the new Metallica album sees James Hetfield actually
singing, rumour has it that Guns n'Roses might release a follow up to
'Appetite...', and with 'Roll the Bones' you could say that Rush have
rediscovered rock n'roll.
   Many Rush hallmarks are still there; superb musicianship, Geddy Lee's
'acquired taste' nasal voacls, wordy lyrics and an ear for a decent tune.
But 'Roll the Bones' largely ditches instrumental flash in favour of
musical flair; a bit of dirt in the works instead of clinical cleanliness.
There's a distinct feeling that this is a much more inspirational,
from-the-heart album than they've recorded for a while.
   Whereas 'The Big Wheel' and 'Neurotica' might previously have had their
edges blunted a little by being stuffed with minute detail painted with
a fine-pointed brush, here the ideas are sploshed onto tape with a roller
in more of a Rolf Harris approach. The opener, 'Dreamline' is as good an
example as any of this (relatively) no-frills approach, belting along on
a high-power riff and sparkling with mule-kick drum fills and genuinely
exciting, 'off-the-cuff' guitar playing from Alex Lifeson - the latter a
strong feature of the album overall (see 'Face Up' and 'Bravado').
Elsewhere, the songwriting is sharp, the playing fiery and the
production less of the smothering fire-blanket that it previously tended
towards.
    It would be stretching a point to say that RTB takes Rush into
previously unexplored territory, but there's something here to suggest
that Rush have either had a rethink or a flash of inspiration regarding
what they are about and where they are headed. Either way, RTB is the
best Rush album for a long time. Not quite prompting the 'Rush Hang
Loose Shock' headline, but getting there.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not bad eh? A favourable review in the music press for once! (Point
of information for non-UK subscribers: Rolf Harris is a celebrity on
British children's TV, who paints large murals using rollers etc.)

    Also, a special notice for UK subscribers, the album can be
heard on the Kerrang! phone hotlines:

            (0898) 200103, 200104 and 200105.

    Another for UK subscribers...the 'Rival' chain of record stores is
claiming that RTB is released in the UK on the 2nd Sept, not the 3rd as
it is in the US...

To everyone in the Bay Area:

I have some ethical problems with posting this, but...
A DJ I talked to at KSJO last night (92.3) said that
they were going to play EVERY TRACK OFF OF ROLL THE
BONES starting around 7:00 PM PST today 8/28.  She told
me that I should not spread this information around because
it could jeopardize this situation (I don't understand
this; you either do it or you don't...), but I live in
Livermore and can only very infrequently wade through
the static to hear their fine radio station.  My only
request is that you DO NOT CALL the station or OTHER
STATIONS about this, and that someone tape these songs
and get me a copy.  As far as I know, I am the only
person with advance warning of this wonderful occurence.
She said that the songs would be interspersed among their
normal programming throughout the evening, so LISTEN
DILIGENTLY.

Todd "Palmsation" Palmer

P.S. My gut feeling is that KRQR (97.3) will be broad-
     casting the show on Thursday nite.  The DJ there
     said and I quote "we will not be broadcasting that
     program; but if we do, it will be a surprise."
     You tell me...

RE: New tunes

What a great way to spend the day!

Q-FM96 in Columbus, Ohio has been playing "A RUSH SONG AN HOUR"
(all from the new album).  So far I've heard about 4 songs other than the
ones mentioned.  By the end of the day, the whole album.  WOW!

One that sticks out is called "FACE-UP".  A real rock tune.  Kinda
heavy, actually.  Looks like another success.

<A NAME="327010">Subject: Ughh...RUSH in the Tri-Cities via Eugene, Oregon...???</A>

Noble Friends,

Greetings.  This is my initial effort at communication with
that rare breed of human...the died in red RUSH fan.  I too
am a RUSH fan.  Alas, however, I am stuck in your favorite
place and Greenpeace's too, the infamous Tri-Cities.  For the
uninitiated that means Hanford.  Yessiree folks!  Hanford...
note how the word sorta rolls off your tounge, real smooth
like.  Just like castor oil.  Suffice it to say that I am
employed in on of the few places that actually hire nuclear
engineers, which should tell you a bit about the, uh, climate
around here.  Hanford, chosen for its unique combination of
water supply (the Columbia), access to juice (electricity from
Grand Coulee) and general unihabitability, was the site of
the first Plutonium producing reactors back in 1943.  The
powers that be decided that good ol' Eugene Wigner had designed
a pretty good reactor on his slide rule so they did not
significantly change the design.  Ever.  That is why there
is such a large quantity of the really neato stuff called
high level nuclear wastes (in this case, mostly fission
products, activated chemicals from the Pu seperation process
and transuranics).  Lay-people refer to this as bad shit.
>.......hummm you say, but what the hell does this have to
do with RUSH?  Well, I'll tell you.  The powers that be
also decided that, much like reactors, the people were
well designed and did not need to change.  Ever.  This means
that nothing, nothing at all, changes.  My chances of ever
hearing any new RUSH on the radio here is about the same as
my wife hiring ten ex-Playmates to dance nude in our bedroom
whilst letting me eat cheeze-puffs and drink beer in bed.
Nada.  Let me describe the radio options here in Richland.

    1)  KIOK-95FM:  They play a combination of music that I
                    am sure is picked by semi-mentally
                    disabled Russian emigrant with plywood
                    for brains.  I heard just last nite,
                    in a row, mind you, Madonna, Skid Row,
                    some rap crapp, a Motley Crue song I have,
                    thankfully, never heard before and, the
                    real clincher, Air Supply.  Whew!!
                    That last one hurt.

    2)  24527823 different country stations.  Need I say more?

    4)  9.9999e+999 different "soft-rock" stations.  Ughhhhh.

    5)  National Pubic, oopps! Public Radio.  Hummmmm?  Must
        have been a Freudian slip.

Sucks.  I, sick of reading of lucky dogs in Pittsburg who have
heard the entire album, resolved to drive to someplace that
would play RUSH.  The obvious solution...Eugene, Oregon.  That's
right Paul, Eugene, the nemesis of the Tri-Cities.  For every
hardened Old-Republican in TC, there is a Young-Democrat in
Eugene.  For every pair of wing-tips is TC there are three,
count 'em, three pairs of Birkenstocks in Eugene.  A happy man
I was when I rolled into Eugene and tuned my radio to KLCX,
Oregon's classic rock!  An even happier man I was when I called
this station from my (a bit of embarassment here) mother-in-laws
home, got the DJ and requested the new RUSH song.  I was nearly
in tears when, with all of my in laws gathered around, I heard,
recorded and chocked back tears of joy to DREAMLINE.  It is,
by all estimates, a great song, indicitive of a great album, which
follows logically from the fact the Alex Lifeson plays on it.
I now feel that I can survive until the 3rd.  Pray for me, lost
as I am in this abysmal hole I call home.

On the lighter side.  There is a Ticketmaster outlet in town.
Nobody ever goes there except me.  That is why it doubles as
a car stereo repair store.  I have bought some truely great
seats (10th row for Steve Howe and YES) there.  If there are
some poor souls who plan to go to the Seattle show, whenever
that may be, send me some mail and maybe I'll be able to get
a whole gaggle of hot (figuratively) seats for us.

Well, I will sign off for now, having happily unloaded all of my
problems on an unsuspecting world.  Thanx for listening.

<A NAME="327012">Subject: Bay Area Premiere of RTB!! (last night)</A>

Hello All!

Hopefully many of you in the Bay Area were listening to KSJO for most of
Wednesday night as they premiered the brand new ten songs off RTB! The bad
part is that they played two tracks about every hour; so there was a lot of
waiting... but so far it has been worth it! I've heard everything from
the album except Nuerotica and you Bet Your Life...have to wait another hour
for those two!

For some intial reactions, here are some quick observations:

Geddy has not sung this low since Signals...he seems to be more relaxed
and casual.. there does not seem to be the vocal energy that was found
in Superconductor, SDT, and War Paint et.al. ...

Everything said about the instrumaental is TRUE! My only gripe is that it's
too SHORT! I was hoping for more of a La Villa or longer length song but
beggars can't be choosers!

The music seems very danceable. There are many quick keyboard syncopations
as well as very smooth choruses that are easily acessable.

Some of the "crunch" found on Presto is missing here. While the songs seem
mellow and smooth, the attitude has the cheeriness of some Presto songs,
but that hard defined sound found on the last album has had its
corners rounded...

RAP? Yes there is on the title track, but it seems to be a part of
a call and answer section with the rapper calling and Alex answering via the
guitar. It will be interesting to here WHO did the 'rap' part on the
song. Nah! It couldn't be Neil! but maybe Rupert....

The guitar on Ghost of a Chance has a definite Available Light feel to it...

As most of us know, the lyrics have a strong personal feel to them... They
still convey the same thoughts and philosophy that is inherent in the band,
but I think the lyrics are written to be sung and to  fit with the music,
whereas on previous albums they were written only for their content ... not
that THESE lyrics don't have content.. but they are more fit for music...

Overall... I think that there will be some old fans that will be a little
disappointed ... Hemispheres or Moving Pictures this is NOT! However it
seems a lot of these songs could be played on a non AOR radio station.. not
necessarily Top40 stations, but those that play on the lighter side. Because
of this there may be many new fans, and maybe a single that will make the
charts.

Personally I think it's GREAT! It has the complexity of Hold Your Fire, the
sound of Signals, and the attitude of Presto.

What more can I say? Well enough said!

So get out there and Rock!

And... Roll the Bones!

Get BUSY!

	Although I missed the premiere of RTB on the radio a couple of days
ago, a friend of mine here at work was gracious enough to make me a copy
(Thanks ROB!). Dreamline and Where's My Thing both rock, but we already know
that. The song on the album that really blew me away, though, was Ghost of a
Chance. I remember a couple years back right before Rush came to town with
their HYF tour, a local journalsist wrote in the newspaper something like:
 "...the lyrics of Rush are so detailed and full of power...If they ever
decided to seriously write a love song it would be incredible." I think that
Ghost is that song. I haven't heard Alex play with so much emotion in a long
time...I don't know if it's just me, but he sounds a lot like Dave Gilmour
in this track.
	I hope everyone gets to hear this track real soon! Keep bugging your
radio stations--I worked for us down here in San Antonio.

Ready to Roll the Bones on Sept. 3rd,

I assume you tried Tower?  They know about it up here (NY).  Tell you
what; I will be in King of Prussia on business next week, and I will
probably (definately) go to Tower here before I leave Tuesday to pick
up RTB on CD.  If you send me your phone number, maybe we can get

Well 97 Rock in Buffalo has been playing tracks from Roll The Bones all morning
(they are doing 1 track per hour and will be doing it all day up to the 11PM
live release party from Toronto with Alex Ged and Neil)...  anyways, they just
played Roll The Bones and sitting here at my desk at work with the crummy radio
reception and all I finally heard "the" rap section...  my thoughts... its
neat, it fits into the context of the song so well, even as far as what I could
tell were Neil using his electronic drum pads...  but beyond the rap section I
found Geds voicing in this song to be just totally awesome... I need to hear it
clearly though  :(  Oh well, tonite at 11PM!!  And Sept 3 is OH SO CLOSE!

Bzzzt!  I disagree, though my opinion is based on only one listening to the
new instrumental.  Where's My Thing showcases the band's technical expertise,
but we already knew they were great.  The problem I had with the tune is that
it didn't GO anywhere!  The end sounded just like the beginning which sounded
just like the middle.  It also seemed a trifle over-produced.  I reserve the
right to change my mind after hearing it a few more times, but I really
wouldn't compare it favorably to YYZed yet.

Hey all

Kudos to Mike Hackett for sending the Rush lyrics for me. Thanks!

Rush Stuff:
I have not heard any yet but...I can WAIT (hahahahahahaaa)
Does anybody know if the new one will be released on vinyl or not?
I have a standing order at my local store to get at least one if
they come out. I got Metallica on vinyl so there is hope.

Non-rush stuff:
I read an old NMS and somebody mentioned that Ged might be producin
the new Voivod record due in Oct(?) Anybody know? Reply to me direct
unless you think everybody would be interested.

   Hi folks.  I've been off the list for the summer, and just recently got back
on.  I am really glad that RTB is finally coming out... but when?
   I noticed some people mentioned September 3rd, and that is also the date 
that was posted in a back issue.  But none of the record stores here know a 
single thing about the new Rush (except that there will be a new Rush).  I'm 
getting a little suspicious that the date has been put back.  One guy told 
me that sometimes the record companies don't tell the stores about a new 
album, but it seems strange to me that Atlantic would try to keep it a secret.
   Does anybody have any news on the release date?  If it is still Sept. 3,
then I guess everything is OK, but it really seems weird that the record stores
don't know about it 5 days before it's premiere.

Welp, for those of you int the Hartford, CT area, you can listen to Roll
The Bones tonight at 11:00 p.m. on WHCN -- 105.9.  I will be recording
it so anyone who is not fortunate enough to live within listening
distance of a radio station broadcasting this tonight, I can make a copy
for you.  But, I warn you: I've got quite a busy weekend ahead of me and
it probably wouldn't get in the mail until Saturday (if you're lucky) or
probably Tuesday.  But, for those of you who want assurance of hearing
Roll The Bones eearly next week and don't think that your record store
is going to have it, let me know.

Can't wait to roll MY bones....

I don't know if this question is FAQL material but hey, I'll ask it anyway!
Do anybody know if MONGO in the Anagram (for MONGO) songo title is in itself
an anagram?

If it is an anagram I sure can't figure it out:

Bob Marley reference: GO MON
Acid Induced: froG MOON

Gee, It really seems that making the title of the song an anagram is something
Neil would do to keep all of us geussing, but I give up on this one.

Signed,
A confused Rush Fan.

P.S. You and your show suck DAVE!  (oops that's for my Late Night Viewer Mail -
Sorry about that)

<A NAME="327025">Subject: Rivendell</A>

Hi,

I don't recall seeing this on the FAQL and I think it's something
subscribers should know.  This piece of Rush trivia isn't exactly
obscure, so I hope I'm not repeating something everyone already knows.
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, here goes:

Rivendell, from FBN, is a fictitious place in J.R.R. Tolkien's
_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_ trilogy (consisting of
_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring_, _The_Two_Towers_, and
_The_Return_of_the_King_).  Rivendell is a rustic, peaceful place where
the travellers in the story find a haven from the Dark Riders (a.k.a.
bad guys) who are pursuing them. In the back of each book is a map
showing the make-believe land in which the stories take place. Rivendell
is located between the Misty Mountains ("Feel there's something calling
you/ You're wanting to return/ To where the Misty Mountains rise...")
and a river called Loudwater ("Peace of mind and sancuary by Loudwater
flows"). Rivendell is ruled by Elrond, the highest, oldest and wisest of
the Elves--a people known for their ethereal voices and mellifluous
songs ("Elven songs and endless nights...").

I'm sure there are other things worth discussing in the song, but those
are all I can think of at the moment. Hope you find this informative.

--Bob

P.S. I  recommend _The_Lord_of_the_Rings_ highly.  Tolkien creates an
incredibly detailed fictitious setting inhabited by wonderful and
imaginitive characters. It's kind of a good old fashioned fairy tale,
with good guys you really like and bad guys you really fear. It offers
no earth-shattering insights and does not aim for philosophical or moral
introspection. But it's exciting, scary, humorous, unpredictable, and
most of all, fun.

Has anyone successfully ported a copy of Dreamline over the Macintosh?
We've got a system here all ready to play music, and it usually does
all day (Apple CD ROM w/ CD Remote Init to play musical CDs, and two
external speakers).  I'd like to get a copy to play this.  I can use
the Sun .au files, but only after Sept. 27 when school starts and the
new Sun Sparc lab opens (sigh). i'll have the CD by then).

Thanks
