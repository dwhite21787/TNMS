<A NAME="2095002">Subject: Rush sighting at TED NUGENT</A>

I experienced an awesome show last night.... TED NUGENT returned to Atlanta.
The place I first saw him at on 7-8-78, The Omni has been torn down. The
club that the picture on the back of his first album was taken at, The
Electric Ballroom here in Atlanta, is long gone. But Ted is going strong.

He has aged gracefully, is in great health and looks awesome, unlike a lot
of us (me included). He does all his trademark tricks, poses, effects &
sensations. Furthermore, he does an awesome collection of songs from his 1st
4 albums and a nod to 1 or two of the post Gonzo efforts, yet they aren't
just a rehashing of the hits. He performs them in the same way, yet with a
renewed sense of vigor that puts a spark under your fanny! None of the
humorous "Wango Tango" garbage either, just straight ahead Rock & Roll. The
crowd looked to be primarily in their 30's, like I, and except for the drug
addicts (cigarette smokers that stunk up the joint with their addiction) the
show & crowd were perfect! Light years better than the Metallica abortion
(concert) I attended earlier this summer.

***Tommy Aldridge is playing drums for him, worth the price of admission
alone. And Atlanta native Derek St. Holmes came out to lay a "Stranglehold"
on us....along with a "Hey Baby" & a "Cat Scratch Fever"

If you get a chance to see Ted this summer, please, please go!!!! Even if
his music is not your cup of tea, go see him to support all he stands for.
He IS a quality individual.

To all my over 30 comrades out there, keep the spirit alive!

yours in allegiance,

Bryan C

****Oh yeah, the guy standing next to me at the Nugent show was wearing a
Rush "Starman" T-shirt. That's my Rush sighting.

<A NAME="2095003">Subject: Does Rush owe us "dick"</A>

Fred Pinto, in TNMS #2093, is on the soapbox hawking the suggestion that
Rush owes us more than they are delivering because they were born with
exceptional talent and ability and because we fans have stuck by them when
MTV and the radio have not.  

My HO is that Different Stages *is* a great gift they are giving us, and it
is good to hear that Atlantic is adjusting things to make it even better.  
To those who bleat that studio tweaking to perfect minor flaws in parts of
a live performance is some form of chicanery, please feel free to pick up
an "unauthorized recording" or download a live MP3 of one.   The fact is,
the boys aren't trying to "fool us into thinking they are infallible
musicians"; they are as humanly close to infallible as it is.  Who would
one point to who can play bass with his feet, keyboards with his hands and
sing complex full throated vocals over it all in near perfect sync other
than Geddy?  Is there a better drummer out there?  And Alex starts with a
difficult score to begin with and rarely misses the mark.  For that matter
how many 3 person bands are there of any caliber at all?

In terms of what we have done for Rush, they could and would be a lot
richer if they succumbed to the temptation to feed the public pop-pap for
increased radio play.  Instead they give us originality, which is way more
difficult than putting up a good basketball game, (with all due respect for
MJ).

One the one hand Fred says that we hard core fans have stuck with Rush when
MTV and the radio haven't, and so they owe us; on the other he won't allow
them to include their most popular tunes on their live album as a way to
reach more audience.

Look everyone, if you've got such a problem with the setlist that you want
to bitch and moan endlessly, stick by your principles and don't buy it! 
What's that, you are going to buy it anyway?  Well then chill out and save
the pointless whining on and on and on.  

If any band has done it all for their fans, it is Rush.  They don't *owe
us* "dick".  

By the way, studies have shown that those who dwell on what they don't have
suffer far more health problems and die younger than those who appreciate
what they have.  

Live longer, appreciate RUSH!

<A NAME="2095004">Subject: Modern Day Warrior vs. The Ultimate Warrior</A>

The Ultimate Warrior has returned to the ranks of Professional Wrestling.
Does anyone remember Kerry Von Erich, the "Modern Day Warrior"? He was
billed that, from the line in "Tom Sawyer", in fact TS was his entrance
music for years & years. 

UW's return has sparked a lot of conversation in some of the wrestling
circles I dominate, and Kerry's name has been mentioned an awful lot lately.
They both teamed together in Texas for a couple of years, and were reunited
in the WWF later in the early 90's. Kerry is no longer with us. His demise
is a most tragic one. 

I just wanted to throw this out for consumption. Anytime I hear his name
mentioned or his moniker, "The Modern Day Warrior", it triggers the "play"
button in my mind for the opening notes of TS.

Here are two postings I sent in that never seemed to show up in the digest:

I have two words to add to your Best Drummer debate.....

Terry Bozio

I feel he is by far the best drummer in the world.  Just listen to the
stuff he did with Zappa. (anyone who played with Zappa has to be a
phenominal musician.)  For an example listen to Baby Snakes (live album,
and video), Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop, and a album by Dweezil and Ahmet Zappa
which I can't remember the title of.

I went to the same DT, ELP, DP show in Michigan at Pine Knob.  We had FREE
VIP tickets.  We decided that Dream Theater Kind of sucked, so we sat in
the VIP lounge gettin silly on Long Islands.  ELP on the other hand, was
excellent. (although Keith Emerson didn't wrestle his Hammond to the
ground.)  They did play Hoedown, which was cool.  the best part came at the
end, when Keith played Flight of the Bumblebee.  He also played Bach's
Toccata and Fugue in Gmin. (sp?) while sitting on his baby grand BEHIND his
Moog controller. It was awesome.  

Deep Purple put on a hell of a show as well.  Plus, Steve Morse made us all
say "Richie who?"

yes, but the sound quality would suck due to the groove being too

Oh, I think they will.  The reason the newer Rush albums are close to an
hour long is because the technology allows it.  Ged is quoted to that
effect in Visions.

<A NAME="2095009">Subject: XXIXII vs. MMCXII</A>

"Twenty One Twelve", hence XXI XII (note the space!).

except that there is no space on the album cover, and it is stated that
2112 is a year.  Therefore:  MMCXII

now, if it were written as "twenty-one twelve," or if it were 21,12,
then it would be as you say.

We say "Nineteen ninety-eight," but it is still written either IIMM, or
MCMLXXXXVIII, or MCMXCVIII

you know, Roman numerals are clunky.  Is there a point to this?

I graduated from high school last june and use a Rush quote (of course). I
used "The Analog Kid" 'cause it's always been my favorite Rush song. (This
also means I am ecstatic over the set list revisions). My quote, "As I
leave..." blah, you all know it.  I have been planning on using that since
before I started high school. However, I came across a hard decision
because I also wanted to use Dreamline ("we are young...").  Well it turns
out one of my best friends used that one so it all worked out. Also, when I
was a Freshman, I was asked by the senior who drove me to school for a good
quote...the suggestion I made and she used was from
Everyday People, "If the futures..."

Hello All

I too saw the Dt/ELP/DP show, and I have to say IT ROCKED!!!!! I wasn't 
huge fans of elp and dp, but now I am hooked. Dt had the clearest sound, 
Elp had a good setlist, and DP had so much energy it blew me away!!!! I 
wold defintely recommend seeing this show if you get the chance!!!

On another note, I have a meek but always somewhat interesting Rush 
Sighting. I was working in my friendly neighborhood Ranch, and lo and 
Behold, 2112 (overture, TOS)came on the Radio! It ruled!!

<A NAME="2095013">Subject: Boogie Nights</A>

There's been a lot of talk lately about Rush on movie soundtracks.  I'm
really looking forward to seeing the trailer for The Waterboy.  Hey, Happy
Gilmore was amusing.

I know this is going off-topic, but if you like 70's music, the Boogie
Nights CD (Volume 1) rules.  The cool touches are there, such as Mark
Wahlberg's terrible-funny singing on the opening track.  Feel the heat,
baby.

Most of the other songs groove.  Spill the Wine still kicks ass after all
these years.  And Sister Christian is, well, motorin'.

The sour note for me on is "God Only Knows" by the Beach Boys.  God only
knows, indeed.

Boogie Nights II has a lot more filler material to my taste, especially the
last half of it.  Can't recommend that one, though the first few songs rock
my world.

One great thing is they kept the original complete version of "Fooled Around
and Fell in Love", including extra verse and the entire solo.  I could
listen to that bluesy 6/8 feel all day, despite those sexist lyrics.  Then
again, they're kinda funny to listen to now.  Suffice it to say you won't
hear this tune at Eleanor Smeal's wedding.  Eheh.

Okay.  If you're going to threaten somebody, at least capitalize your
sentences.  And the word is "you're", which stands for "you are," not
"your."  Oh, and the word is "piece," not "peice."  By the way, "to stupid"
should be "too stupid."   What's that story about the pot calling the kettle
black?

This is reminiscent of when somebody wants to talk like a tough guy, but
writes, "I'm gonna kick you ass."  Ahahahaha.

John,

I appreciate your remarks regarding your personal interpretation of Roman 
Numeral usage, however, I feel compelled to point out the huge gaping hole in 
your logic.  

Let's examine the album 2112 (notice the absence of a space between 21 and 
12).  While it is pronounced "Twenty-one Twelve," it is considered to be 
representing a year in time, the year "Two Thousand One Hundred Twelve AD 
(read the liner notes and/or the tourbook dialog on the website if you doubt 
this).  Therefore the designation of two separate numbers, "Twenty-one" and 
"Twelve," would be just that, two separate numbers.  Messrs Peart, Lee, and 
Lifeson did not title the album 21 12 so XXI XII would not be a proper 
designation when using Roman numerals.  

Case in point, look at the credits for any movie.  When they list the year 
the movie was produced at the end of every string of credits they list that 
year in Roman numerals.  You will not find a listing for a movie produced in 
1984 as IXX LXXXIV, no indeed.  You'll find it listed as MCMLXXXIV.  Notice 
the characters are all together, with no spaces.  This designates an entire 
representation of the year.  While the year 1984 is pronounced "Nineteen 
Eighty-four," it is most certainly not written as two separate numbers.  
Those that are also as experienced in the correct usage of the Roman numeral 
system would have to concur.

So, while that album was, is, and always will be pronounced "Twenty One

"Mmcxii" is not intended, nor was ever intended to be pronounced.  It is 
meant to be a challenge for one to decipher, realize, recognize, and finally,

I'd much rather attempt to pronounce Mmcxii than Xxixii any day.  If I do

the boys are listening, the only addition I'd like to see to the DS setlist 
is "Cold Fire" from Counterparts, a great song from a great album.  If you can 
squeeze it in, great.  If not, great.  I'm an "easy to please" Rush fan...

Saturday, 2:30 am--I arrive, sleeping bodies all oever Al's house.  $
drunks in the kitchen trying to play Rainbow's "Since You've Been Gone"
on an acoustic guitar.  Playing the Jaymz Bee and the Royal Jelly
Orchestra version of CTTH, to much horror from the crowd, although
Adrienned like it.
Breakfast and shower, 8 am.  Set up my guitar tree with my Washburn,
Schecter, 12 string hollow and custom 10-string.  Drool over the TWO
PRS' tht were brought.  Add my Korg to the Synthesizer Wall of Death. 
Listen to jimmy and others wail on guitar.
Getting the chili started and the burgers to marinating.  Practicing La
Villa for the 500th time this month.  Adrienne sitting on the piano
bench, headset and practice pad.  John sitting nearby, headset and
guitar.  Jimmy inthe living room. Al at his computer downloading MIDI
files.  Matt listening to CD, guitar in hand.  A roar of Rush from the
basement.

SFN, me on Rhythym. Not too bad.  Awesome bass line from...one of the
Sean's?  Nothing for me until Sunday.  drink afew beers.  Serve the
chili.  Drink a few more beers ;).  more music, Cook the burgers.  More
music, including an early version of FBN, me on Rhythym.  More drinking,
knock off and watch South Park and Seinfeld.  Go to sleep EARLY this
time, in the laundry room for quiet.  2am, some yutz flips on the
laundry room light to see who is sleeping there--ME! 
Sunday, scramble eggs for everybody, cook bacon, do some over easy eggs
for others, down to playing.  FBN sounds good.  La Villa postponed. 
Adrienne doing an awesome job of drumming on The Weapon.  Jimmy's not
bad, either. Or any of the other 3 drummers--Sean?  who else? Chris
maybe?  You know who you are.  La Villa postponed again.  Practice it a
dozen more times.  Butcher it badly, postponed until next year.  CTTH
sounds good.  Improv jam on Limelight.  More beer, more chili.  
Find out there's no babysitter for Monday--drive home from 11 until 6.
I'll actually practice between now and next year--Hopefully this 3 year
hiatus is over.

Well, not with my pic, but as I signed my best friend's year book, I

Neil or not, but this guy was a huge Rush fan, too, so I'm sure he
would've figured it out eventually (I don't think he's quite as affected
by "Time Stand Still" as I am, because he hasn't exactly experienced life

<A NAME="2095025">Subject: a wave is building...</A>

Just read Eric Gumtow's post about Better Than Ezra and Third Eye Blind
mentioning Rush influences. I sense that a potential wave is building here
folks--take a look at the big picture. 

 - Last year-ish, (two years ago?) a tribute album is released (regardless
of the lack of endorsement by the band, its still a tribute, and those
musicians still worked hard at it, even if we (most of us, and the band)
don't like it very much) 

This year:
 -Tom Sawyer gets used in Small Soldiers, remixed (a tribute, and a classy
one IMO)

 -original version of TS gets used in some other movie (forgot which one)

 -VH1 does pop-up video on Rush (not a huge deal, but something...)

 - I'm sure I could rack my brain and come up with many more but let me get
to my point.

Many of Rush's influences are coming of age and getting their own
recognition--bands like BTE, 3EB, too many others to name. I sense that a
wave is building, and that the media (RRHF, RStone, etc) are going to have
to stand up and take notice. (not that we or the band really care) But they
will have no choice. Rush will wind up in the Hall, not that we (or they)
care. Its just a matter of time and timing. They simply are the Kings of
Progressive Rock.

The long and the short of it is that I think the influence of Rush on other
successful groups speaks for itself to some extent, and that sort of
influence is something that cannot be tuned out/ignored. I sense increased
coverage and popularity for Rush coming soon. (for better or worse)

Any chance anyone caught that Rockline on tape? (with BTE) I'd be willing
to digitize it for all to hear....

Lastly, someone said something about TS never being performed differently,
in all its live incarnations. I think The Boyz should have DJ Tripp guest
at the next show, and they should do a live version of the remix. That
would be phat indeed.

PEACE,BREAD, and RUSH

Not that you care....

Hey fellow rushians.

things to say to NMS people:
1- Bill Bruford is maybe the only rock drummer as good as Neil Peart ;
2- Coincidently, there's a King Crimson song, on the album THREE OF A

Is there someone else who is a King Crimson fan ?

Pretty cool. Thanks Chuck, if you're on the list.

*RUSH does not owe the average fan anything.  They owe themselves to put
out a good product that will succeed.  RUSH "should" do what the fans ask
for, but don't necessarily "have" to...
Let me explain.
You are correct, that we do buy their stuff, albums, tickets, and
memorabilia.  However, we "choose" to purchase their products.  They are
not a business that we have invested in and continue to invest in to make
money.  For example, if you are a loyal COKE drinker, and they want to
redesign their logo, should they go to their loyal consumers for advice? 
NO.  The principal investors have more say and COKE needs to listen to
them.  Record companies put a lot more money than the individual ever
could, and therefore are owed much more by RUSH.  That is, the record
company after putting hundreds of thousands of dollars in investments
(promo, concert, videos, advertising, etc.) should have RUSH's ear first
before the fans.  However, if coke changes their product (i.e. New Coke)
and the consumers revolt, then they learn something.
That's why what RUSH did was a smart thing for them to do.

That's right.

Nothing.

The music that they have given us over the years is our treat for 
sticking with them.

To repeat, the music is the reward.

We have no right to expect or demand a thing from any of them.

Do not let the fact that they responded to their fans' wishes go to your 
head.

If I was is their shoes, I would feel a sense of gratitude to the fans, 
and I would WANT to give them more of what they want.  But I do not think 
I would feel OBLIGATED to give them more.

I would hope that my fan base (in this purely hypothetical situation) would 
not have this "gimme" attitude that we are all seeing right now anyway.

If they truly felt like they owed us something for our faithfulness (both 
emotional and financial), they would sell the cd set for next to nothing, 
and take a big loss for their fans' sake.  Somehow I don't think that 
will happen.

Do you realize how childish it is to say, "I've been buying your albums 
and going to your concerts for __ years; you OWE ME!"?  WHY have you been 
buying the albums for so long?  Because all along, the music has the reward 
for your diligence.

I urge you to practice some humility once in a while.  It's very healthy.

Hello fellow Rush freaks!

This may be a little outdated by now - I first read about this thread 
last week, and then my modem got fried in a storm. I have a new modem 
now, so here I go again...

I remember a few months back we tossed this thread around for a while. 
I've got a Rush-related tattoo on my left ankle. It's the design from the 
back of the Counterparts CD called subjective contours. Not only is it on 
the CD, I found it in a psychology book (I was a psych minor in college). 
It's kind-of hard to describe - simply put, it's the image that looks 
like Pac-Mans and Vs. When you look at the image, your mind closes the 
picture for you and you see an upside-down triangle (if you think I'm 
crazy, grab your CP jewel case and look at the picture - you'll 
understand!). It's a really cool tattoo to have because I haven't come 
across one single person who has the same one!

By the way, did you hear that President Clinton has changed the U.S.'s 
national bird? The spread eagle. Ha ha...

And out of curiosity, will any of you be at the Indianapolis/Deer Creek 
Aerosmith show on September 21??

Rush on, guys!

Heya all:

Just wanted to say, the LOSERS on the Alt.Music.Rush newsgroup all are
bitching because we, as fans, exercised our democratic right to voice,
and the rec. company listened. So if there are any a.m.r rush "fans" on
here that have a problem with this 1) You can tell the MAJORITY wanted
the change 2)You should grow up, get a job, or take your medication.

Anyways, just wanted to say there has been alot of positive feedback on
the NMS about this, which just proves most Rush fans are intelligent,
decscent poeple. Ok....enough slagging AMR...WAY too easy..heh.

Just wanted to add my thoughts on people who think that some of these
younger players, like Carter from DMB, that Neil FAR from shows off most
of his talent in Rush songs. My challenge to them would to see them
execute The Rythm Method (t4e tour) FLAWLESSLY. Don't forget, Buddy Rich
got better as he got older, and it's almost evident in Neil's case.

Anyways...till Nov.17 (errr..thats the date, right??...heh!:)

include it in a box than a "new" live album.

It's been said before and I'll repeat it here...I too am very
disappointed w/the setlist,
missing "Where's my Thing," "Analog Kid," and anything from Presto, even
though Presto is my least favorite of the last four studio albums.

<A NAME="2095039">Subject: favorite non-rush song, and some rambling</A>

i do have many non-rush songs that i really like.  but two of my
favorites are "the unknown knows" and "paint it black" (glenn tipton's
remake). 

"the unknown..." (nothingface) is done by (appropriately enough) Voivod
(canada!) and has such angry growling bass work by jean-yves theriault.
"paint it black" (baptizm of fire) is an excellent song, Glenn Tipton
returns turns so-so 'Stones song into a total powerhouse of music,
amazing!

not to be overlooked, "metal heart" (live, Accept) and "baptizm of fire"
(Glenn Tipton) have jawdropping guitar solos and are just plain
remarkable.  if you're into Judas Priest at all, or just like some good
heavy stuff you NEED to get baptizm of fire, it blows so many other
former-axman/ frontman/ lead singer solo debuts out of the water!  no contest.
you won't be disappointed.  and as always, you can get all the above
albums from BMG, but i'm not sure that they still carry nothingface. 
mail me if you need #'s.

if any of you out there like rush or iron maiden (quite a long shot...) i
suggest you listen to something by Voivod if you can find it.  they are
excellent musicians, though they sound almost nothing like anyone else. 
but a lot of the lyrics to songs really make you think.  dimension
hatröss probably isn't your best bet for a "starter" album (provided you
can find it anywhere!).

I was thinking about the upcoming release and wondered if anyone had
made plans for a listening party at 12:01 on November 17. I have a buddy
who works at a local record & cd store who could possibly organize an
early  opening of the store. Then, Rush fans could get the discs earlier
than other folks and then maybe we could mingle and b.s. about Rush or
whatever. What about a bootleg trading session too? I live in the
Eugene, Oregon area. Any other fans near me? I will talk to my buddy and
get back to anyone who contacts me privately.

When you're listening to "Jacob's Ladder", does anyone else think Geddy
sings "The clowns prepare for battle?"  ;)
