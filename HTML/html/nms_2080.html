I have a kind of an off the wall request.

If ANYONE has all *8* episodes of the tv show "Profit" (and they are in
NTSC and in English, no subtitles) that would be willing to trade for
Rush stuff (video, audio, or even posters) PLEASE LET ME KNOW!

I've decided that I really need to see that show again; if you missed it
the first time around it aired in April of 1996 on Fox; it defies description,
just call it a revenge tale of the warped sort (right up my alley ;-)

I figured SOMEONE in Rushland must have this show on tape! So if you do,
drop me a line...

 That title may be good for an AC/DC live album, maybe Judas Priest but it
 seems a little "heavy" for a Rush title. Good premise though. It might be
 along the lines of "A Fine Line"  Which I think is part of a line from some
 song that, right now, escapes me.

Neil, I don't think you were showing your age mate, I can remember it very
well. When I heard Spirit of Radio was going to be on 'Top of the Pops' I
sat waiting for the video only to find a number of women (Legs and Co)
dancing badly to the song.........it was one of those things that you never
forget. In England you rarely get Rush on the radio so when something like
this comes along you have to make the most of it, sadly the girls managed to
visually f*ck it up .

On a better note, I found a box with all my concert tickets and looking thru
them I found three autographs on the back of two tickets, 17/18 June 1980 at
Manchester Apollo, when I I was fortunate enough to meet Alex, Geddy and
Neil in the Picaddilly hotel at the age of 18, I'm going to have to get
these tickets framed and mounted.

Hello out there.
long time listener, first time caller.
I've noticed a tendency that people who normally like Rush, like Dream
Theater as well.
While they are superb musicians, I absolutely detest their music.
In my opinion, it's souless, unlistenable drivel.
They might be better "technically" than Rush, but to me, Rush is a far
superior band.
Music is about songs and feelings, not about how fast your hands move,
or how "trained" your voice is.
Am I alone on this? Or does anybody agree?

My 8 year old cousin was visiting me from Texas this past weekend.  She
and I talked about music, what she likes, what she doesn't like, what her
mom listens to, and so on.  She said that she liked Rock music the most. 
As a result, I decide to put 'Permanent Waves' in the CD player. 
	She asked, "Who is that?" 
	I responded, "Rush."
	"Oh yeah!" she remarks. "When I was in camp there was this girl in
my cabin from Canada who _loves_ Rush.  She brought 3 of her tapes with
her.  Rush was the favorite band in my cabin."
	Her favorite Rush song is "The Spirit of Radio."  When she came
back to my house today, she asked, "Can you play some Rush?"  I knew that
she's a smart girl ;p. 
	IMO, Rush still can attract young people with their music- it just
has to be played for them.

        I was floored by Circumstances.  Alas, don't let this fool you into

Hey everybody, 
    I was listening to the radio yesterday and they had the rock news
segment.  They mentioned Geddy's B-day (Happy B-day Geddy!) and described
him as one of the most influential rock musicians as well as the best bass
player.  Talk about positive comments.  I didn't expect the radio to give
such respect to Geddy.  Of course they did mention his big nose and said
Neil's name wrong but you can't have it all.  I was just happy they talked
about Rush in a positive light for a change.  
     As far as the Tribute album talk, my take on it is that it is nice to
hear the songs in a different light but it definitely makes you appreciate
the original.

has a blemish on the the fret board for starts.  This is the part that 
makes it real trash.  Both the black binding around the neck and the 
block inlays are painted on the neck.  To make it even worse, the black 
paint runs on almost all the edges.  This thing really looks bad.

<A NAME="2080018">Subject: Rush's worst moment!</A>

I certainly do remember it!
Half a dozen or so dogs walking around trying to dance to a Rush record - I
didn't know whether to laugh or cry!

However, my worst Rush moment was only a few months later, because I was far
'too cool' to watch Top of the Pops, especially after what they did to TSOR,
so I was 'upstairs' with my girlfriend fumbling around in her jumper when I
thought I heard the strains of Tom Sawyer! Now there usually comes a point
either leading up to or during the big 'O' when I can almost hear bells and
Angels, but hearing Rush songs had never happened at that point before, so
my reaction was to just see it as my mind and body working in tandem to make
it one to remember! My theoriy was shattered into pieces however, when my
little brother burst into the room shouting 'that crap band Rush are on
TOTP'. Needless to say I did what any sane, red blooded male Rush fan would
do in the situation, I ran downstairs putting on my pants and managed to sit
down and watch the video just as Geddy began his 'wa wa wa wa wa wa' on the
keyboard. The embarrasing bit was that both sets of parents were sitting in
the room having tea and saw me red and sweaty with no socks and loose pants
panting away. It hardly comes as a suprise for me to relay that that
particular relationship did not last musch longer beyond that point.

<A NAME="2080020">Subject: This Is Funny - REALLY!</A>

     Does anyone out there read the ONION? It's a funny, funny, funny 
     newspaper out of Madison, WI, USA. The website has been written up in 
     the New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, etc. It is 
     "www.theonion.com" Check it out. You might LOVE it. Anyway, from the 
     most recent issue of the ONION, a review of the new NoMeansNo record 
     called "Dance of the Headless Bourgeoisie":
     
     Take one listen to "Dance of the Headless Bourgeoisie", and one 
     question will stand out in your mind: Has NoMeansNo become the Rush of 
     punk? Here's a handy checklist to help you answer that question. Is 
     the band playing a lot of long, meandering songs that seem to have 
     been recorded without a sensible producer to say, "Ah, time to wind it 
     down now, guys"? Yes. Are there time changes that are not so much 
     'math rock' as they are 'attention-span-testers'? Lamentably, yes. 
     Does the album contain an abundance of ill-conceived conceptual songs? 
     Yes, but they are politically conceptual instead of 'speculative 
     fiction' conceptual. Is NoMeansNo Canadian? While not necessarily a 
     bad thing, the band does, in fact, share this trait with Rush as well. 
     Sadly, there it is. Scientific proof that NoMeansNo has indeed 
     transformed from a tight, aggressive, smart political punk band into a 
     dull, meandering punk version of Rush. It just isn't fair.
     
     Take it for what it's worth, but I think if Geddy, Alex or Neil read 
     this review they would laugh their damn heads off. I think we should 
     do the same. 
     
     Chad
     
     P.S. I appear to be in the minority, but I really do like the title 
     "Dimlit Stages For All Ages". I'd like to see them keep it. It would 
     be different sounding from all of the rest. It rolls off the tongue & 
     has the triple meaning of 'a concert for the young & old' & 'we have 
     been playing live for a long, long time' & 'we have gone through many 
     musical stages in our time together'. I like that. It's not dumb, but 
     actually a pretty loaded title.

>P O W E R   R O C K  (961)

>DESCRIPTION:  Aggressive new music and recurrent 80s Rock with a few icons
from the Classic Rock era.

>TYPICAL ARTISTS:  Metallica, Judas Priest, Queensryche, Ozzy Osbourne, Iron
Maiden, Alice Cooper, Van Halen, Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Type O Negative,
Dio, Scorpions, Kiss, Rush, Tool, Dokken, Motley Crue. 

Well, the boys are in relatively good company (no offense meant by that
comment-please, no holy wars), but I wonder if they consider Rush to be
either "aggressive new music," "recurrent 80's rock," or "icons from the
Classic Rock era"?

Hmmmmmmmm.......

"The Pass" was played on the CP Tour despite popular NMS belief. 
 Specifically, it was played in Phoenix and Veteran's Memorial Coliseum.  I 
remember, I was there.  Either that or I'm severely hallucinating.  I don't 
know if it was played anywhere else, but if it wasn't, it stands to reason 
that the RTB Tour will be looked at for additional material.

Howdy

A little while ago someone asked about Floria Sigismondi working with 
Victor.  She did the video for Promise.  I have it on tape somewhere.  I 
don't remember much about it (haven't watched it in a long time), just 
that it shows a bunch of teenagers with really crappy lives (abused, 
pregnant, etc), and every once and a while it cuts back to Alex and Edwin.

Great, I have to go watch it now :-)

Later

No it won't because AC/DC released an album with that name some time in =
the early 90's (my guess is they won't use a "cliche" name from the =
early 90's). More likely is "Virtual Stages" or something like that :-) =
Check out http://www.torman-maxt.com/tmaxt for a band with great =
progressive possibibities (lots of sound clips).
I just can't wait to get my hands on the next RUSH album!!! Any Rush =

And he was recruited to replace steve hackett in the second incarnation of
GTR with steve howe & friends.  Although that version of the group folded
before fruition (an album), Robert Berry has produced a solo album with a
lot of that material on it, called (if I recall correctly) "Pilgramage to a
Point."  This is an excellent album!  A lot of really interesting stuff on
it.

Ya know....

I was a big Metallica fan, until earlier this morning. I can't deal with the
15 year old potheads & products of American Public Education anymore. If you
ever want to witness the Decline of Western Civilization, go to a Metallica
show & watch the crowd..... believe me.... I am more than qualified to make
that assessment.

ANYWAY....... This is just in fun....Metallica is reissuing their "Garage
Days re-visited" cd this November, along with some new cover songs as well.
These records they do are fun, and meant to simply "tide you over" til the
next album of new material is ready. Rush would probably not be interested
in doing this, ......but if they ever did.......what songs would you want to
hear?

Keep in mind the spirit with which such a project would be executed. They
probably would not do any Iron Maiden or Dream Theatre songs, nor would they
do any Hanson or Spice girls songs..... so save your electronic impulses.
And don't e-mail me, e-mail this list....mmmmkay?

I have 2 choices I would like to start this list with:

1. "NSU" by Cream
2. "The Wizard" by Black Sabbath

*how much you wanna bet they have indeed played these 2 tunes back in John
Rutsey's garage way back when after several bowls of hash? 

If this thread has been run once before, I apologize. Thank you Rush manager
for providing this forum. What I wouldn't give to have 2 Rush tickets in my
hand for a pair of shows this weekend. 

DON'T BE A FOOL....
STAY IN SCHOOL!!

Hey....do yourself a favor this weekend. Pull out a Rush album you perhaps
have not listened to in a long, long time or one you are not as crazy about
and give it a spin. It will be like finding a long lost friend.

   [ WARNING: This is *very* long, and I only included the whole thing since
     the digest was pretty small today. This is the last post, and if you
     want to hear the good part: Alex made #94 for the solo in "Working Man".
