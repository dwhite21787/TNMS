Re: Mailing list mechanics

Well, I've done my fiddling with the address lists, and after a couple
of weeks it seems to be working.  If you'll remember, the duplication
problem occurred when, through a combination of address list length and
digest length, the outgoing digest to sit in the queue a looong time.
The mailer would check the queue every so often, and if it found the digest
sitting there, would re-send it, creating a duplicate.  The reasons for
sitting in the queue vary, from sheer size/length considerations, to
timeouts/glitches with the remote sites (you all).

If you'll remember (or not, if you're relatively new), I've been splitting
the list into more and more sub-lists; originally two, then four, now
it's up to nine (A-C, D-F, etc).  One thing I've noticed is that the
delivery time is *much* shorter - when it used to take a couple of hours
(or more), it now usually arrives at my other account within a half hour.
I find this encouraging - the shorter delivery time, the less chance of
a duplciate being created.

In the future, if you do happen to receive a duplicate mailing (NOT to
be confused with the occasional second mailing, the 'special editions'!),
please send mail to the administrative address to let me know.  It may
have been a fluke, or your particular sub-list may need to be subdivided
again.  That's a bridge I'll cross when I get to it...

Re: Archival

I am currently investigating the possibility of setting up anonymous
ftp on Syrinx.  This way, those of you with ftp capabilities can access
the back issues which are all stored on Syrinx.  This will be in addition
to the 'server@ingr.com' mail server, not intended to supercede it.  Due
to the fact that they are limited to the amount of information they can
send out in any given day, this would help turnaround time on requests.
The advantage that server would have over my ftp access would be that they
have special items (interviews, etc) separate by name - mine would be only
back issues of the digest.  I figure those wanting to get an issue they
missed could ftp here, and those wanting specific articles or those without
ftp access could go to the server.

This IS NOT an announcement of anonymous ftp here, so don't try it yet.
It's a possible future offering, currently under investigation.

Well, if my mail didn't keep bouncing, CoS was my #1 and that
would have pushed it up 1 or 2 notches.
I was suprised that 2112 was so high up when NOONE picked it
as their favorite album (THAT suprised me as well!). That and
Rush were the only two not picked by anyone!!

 I once watched the _Exit...Stage Left_ concert video on MTV (a long,
 long time ago).  Anyway, between songs, there were comments from
 Rush about their music and the like.  Before they played Red
 Barchetta, Neil Peart made the comment that the song could be
 interpreted as a metaphor on human sexuality.

 My questions:

    Are there comments by Rush on the video cassette version of ESL?

    Do any of you have comments on this interpretation, or perhaps
     a more broad interpretation of other Rush songs?  For example,
     I find Neil's interpretation more broad than the [straightforward]
     "sci-fi futuristic" interpretation of Red Barchetta.

 ps The answer to mike speigel's question about the music for the
    show '1986' is, of course, "Mystic Rhythms" from _Power Windows_.

After _Power Windows_ was released I was up to date in my Rush collection...
except for _Signals_.  I'd seen the "Subdivisions" video and identified with
the Professor's message...I'd heard "New World Man" quite a bit and found
the melody infectuous but always figured _Signals_ wasn't one of their best.
Finally I saw _Signals_ on CD for $9.99 at Tower and decided to pick it up.
It's become one of my favourite Rush releases and contains my undisputed,
all-time favourite Rush song..."Chemistry".  I love Alex' solo...it's so
bizarre and the chord washes while Geddy sings, "Electricity, Biology,
seems to me it's Chemistry" just feel great...so the Rush release I figured
I'd like very little has become one of my favourites!

  Sorry, Doug, but think about this for a minute.  Who's being pompous?
Rush fans should know the difference between personal tastes and natural law.

        I'm always startled to see people talk about how much they
hate Hold Your Fire (such as the fellow who said it was as bad as
RUSH).  It's one of my very favorite albums; I always put it as a
tie with Moving Pictures and 2112.

        It's kind of a subtle album, I'll admit.  The synth and the
guitar are well-balanced, but they're both pretty spare.  Alex spends
more time on arpeggios than he does on power chords and blazing solos.
But if you want a great solo, Open Secrets has one.  If you want
incredible drum-work, Lock and Key has it.  (I hope I have the songs
right--the album has such a cohesive, unified sound to it, I could
easily be remembering certain passages as being in one song when they're
actually in another.)  Geddy brings out new facets of his voice--
his voice hasn't changed over the years, as witness the fact that he
can still sing "In the Mood" in the same register as when he was
twenty, but he's discovered new ways to use it, and one such is
the quiet, reserved tone he brings out for this introspective
album.

        It's just plain a *great* album, the acheivement of
everything they'd been working toward for the previous few.
It's not the same kind of music as on Moving Pictures or
2112, but like those albums, it's an unqualified success and
doing what it sets out to do.

        I'm never going to forgive them for not coming to the
Bay Area on that tour. :)

                                        eh

Hi,

W/regards to the remark about GUP being optimal to study to, I would
have to agree EXCEPT hitting those lines "you know how that rabbit feels
goin' under your spinning wheels" at the end is sort of a concentration
blower... makes me think about how bad I am about to face-plant on the
upcoming exam!

<A NAME="132009">Subject: Alex on the radio</A>

 The other night I was listening to the radio while studying for finals. After
some tune finished I heard "This is Alex Lifeson of Rush and you're listening
to Q106 Lansing" or something to that affect. I had heard other performers do
similar things on plenty of other stations but never a member of Rush. Has
anyone else heard something similar. (Also it was 2:30 AM, typical time to hear
a Rush song).

 I'd also like to comment on Signals. I personally enjoy the album but can't
rank it as my *favorite* album changes both with the days and my mood. I do
think it interesting that two songs (Digital Man and New World Man) both
mention that "constant change is here to stay". This can be seen in light of
their change of producers as well as their growing use of synth.

 Lastly, someone mentioned Rush's TV credit for the show "1986". Mystic
Rhythyms was used as the theme. Also I believe it was on NBC, not CBS :).
