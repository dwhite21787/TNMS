Well, by the time you read this, I should be pretty much caught up on ALL
the administrative mail for now.  If you expected a reply to something and
didn't get it, you might send another mail item.  I didn't reply to a few
"Where is the NMS" type letters, as that should be obvious from the postings
of administrivia.

Also, at the time of this mailing, there are officially over 1200 members
on the list, and still growing!

Lastly, next week I shall be spending a week brain-bending at a NeXT Sysadmin
class in Chicago.  I don't know what my schedule will be like, but I hope to
have some spare time.  If anyone is interested in getting together, drop me
a line at "davida@syrinx.umd.edu" to talk about it.  I'll be reading mail at
that address until Sat. morning, at which point I fly up there.  I'm interested
in finding any decent brewpub-type places if there are any...

ABC's Friday night "In Concert" program usually includes a short segment
where upcoming tour dates for a major band are listed. Last Friday, the
segment featured Rush, using a portion of the "Roll The Bones" video as the
background while the dates were listed.

The song "Bad Boy" which is on the "Electric" bootleg is from the American 
released 
Beatles album called "Beatles VI."  Also, as people are noticing that MTV uses
"Show Don't Tell" as background, I've heard "New World Man" used as a 
background
for stats on an Indy 500 race car driver.  MTV also uses "Over My Head" by 
King's
X as background, but never plays their videos either.

In response to the song "Bad Boy", the rush-mgr said:

>[ Yes, this cover is on the "Electric Lady" boot and also the "Stellar
>  Dynamics" record, if I'm not mistaken.  They say it's from the 4th (?)
>  Beatles album, but silly me, I can't think of which one that is right

This song was originally done by Larry Williams in 1959.  As far as the
Beatles are concerned, they released it in the US on their album _Beatles VI_
in 1965, and in the UK on _A Collection of Beatle Oldies_ in 1966.

This may be getting a little off the subject but is there any type of a
mailing list for drummers?  In the last NMS I saw the post which
mentioned the bass player mailing list.   Just wanted the same type of
thing for us drummers.

     I have heard rumors, and I would like to verify if they are true. Does
anybody know if Rush is planning on playing at Alpine Valley (East Troy, Wis)
on this leg of their tour? On the first leg of the tour, they played only one
show in the Chicagoland area, Rosemont Horizon, they generally play two nights
in the Chi area. I know for a fact that Rush love to play at Alpine (says so
in "Visions"), and my friends and I would really love to see them there again.
What is they word on this topic?? I belive that it was another NMS reader who
said that he heard the rumor here, but I have never seen it posted.

     About the Parents and Rush topic; My father saw Rush for the first time
on this tour, in Indy. He really enjoyed the show! In particular, he thought
that Neil`s solo was "god-like". "In my day we had a guy by the name of Buddy
Rich.......but this guy! WOW!", were his only words. He did enjoy the whole
show too, he functioned just as any ("younger generation") would, gee,
my father is almost 55!

Rush, a show for the who,le family.

<A NAME="434008">Subject: Neil mentioned on MST3000</A>

A strange thing happened today.  To relieve that I-wish-Thursday-would-get-
here feeling we all get when Rush is playing this coming Thursday, I was 
kicking     back today, watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 on the Comedy 
Channel.
(for those not familiar with the show, you should give it a try.  hilarious)
Anyway, all these bongo drums are playing in the background of the movie 
being  spoofed, and one of the robots (I think it was Tom) said, "Presenting 
Neil Peart on drums."

[ This was "Wild Rebels", or maybe "Side Hackers" ?  I too am a MST3K groupie,
  and Syrinx is the repository for the ftp-able files for the MST3K mailing
  list.  For details on that, send mail to davida@syrinx.umd.edu.  No, I don't
  run it, I only offered disk space.                                :rush-mgr ]

The only bummer is that he pronounced it "pert" like the shampoo with 
conditioner for extra body.  Maybe I'll write them a nasty letter.
The point is, it seems a bit whimsical to use a reference in a cult-classic
comedy series that would be lost on the multitudes of the unenlightened who
think that Neil Peart is the actor that plays the Maytag repair man.
Oh well, just a slice of one man's mind, lightly floured and baked until 
golden brown.

I would like to comment how us people in Phoenix are getting screwed because
Rush won't be coming to town until June after they pass through Europe!!!

The reason we were passed up in January was because all of are venues
were booked up... Especially Guns n' Roses got two dates in Phoenix...

I can't really blame Rush's Management but It is a raw deal.

Later...

        Thumbing through the "rare/special" CDs at a local store, I came
across a 1991 CD called Rush: Enemies Within and Beyond.  The price
was a modest 38 bucks (yeah right).  The guy let me tape it without
even paying for it and boy was I glad about that.  It seems that 10 of
the 12 tracks are ripped from the GUP tour video.  The other two
tracks, limelight and freewill, are different but I'm betting that
they were "borrowed" from the ESL tour video.  For those interested,
the CD was from Howdy! Records out of W. Germany.  BTW, the CD was
subtitled Live FM Grace Under Pressure.  What a bogus lie.
        Anyway, about that poll.  I believe Derek Dick and Fish are
one in the same person.  Correct me if I'm wrong...

I saw the P/G tour twice (Buffalo, July '84; Toronto, September '84),
and in the latter show (the one on the P/G tour videotape) they did in
fact hand out 3D glasses for the "Count Floyd" sequence preceeding
"The Weapon".  I didn't notice any effect, however.  I can't remember
whether they were handed out at the Buffalo show.

On a related matter, a couple of posters were wondering whether
certain P/G songs were ever played in concert.  At the Buffalo show,
they played every song from the album except Kid Gloves, whereas in
Toronto they played every song except Afterimage.

P.S.  I hope we've seen the last of those silly polls.

<A NAME="434014">Subject:    Rush in Dallas! (SPOILER!)</A>

Chalk up another great show for RUSH in Dallas!  Here's the song list:

   Force Ten
   Limelight
   Freewill
   Distant Early Warning
   Time Stand Still
-- Geddy finally talks to the crowd --
   Dreamline
   Bravado
   Roll The Bones
   Show Don't Tell
   The Big Money
   Ghost Of A Chance
   Subdivisions (minus 2nd verse)
   The Pass
   Where's My Thing?                 -- Excellent! --
-- Neil does his "thing" --          -- Superb! --
   Closer To The Heart
   Xanadu -> Superconductor
   Tom Sawyer

Encore

   The Spirit Of Radio (all but the ending) ->
   2112 (I and II)
   Finding My Way ->
     La Villa Strangiato (last half) ->
       Anthem (GREAT!) ->
         Red Barchetta ->
           The Spirit Of Radio (the ending)

The show lasted about 2 hours (RUSH's portion).  There are a few dis-
appointments:

1) No "Finding My Way -> In The Mood"

2) Not enough songs from the new album (ie. Neurotica, The Big Wheel,
   Face Up, You Bet Your Life, and Heresy were omitted).

3) Just 2 hours long -- they've played longer than that before.

Bottom-line though:    Don't Miss Them!!

You've all seen Neil and his bandana for this tour?  Well, I
just saw the video for Queensryche's "Anybody Listening?"
(great song, great video--any recommendations of what QR albums
I should get?  I have none.)  In this video, their drummer is
also wearing a bandana.  Coincidence?  Well, probably, but I

Greetings,
        Well,It's 10 days till RUSH hits St. Pete. I'd like to know if
someone has a current set list available. If so please either post it
or mail it directly to me.

                                thanks

Hi Rushians!

I'd like to hear what songs, interviews, etc. are on the U.K. RTB singles
Andrew Brooks said were being released so that I can import those that fit
my interests.

Also, if Andrew, et al., could do the same when GOAC is released?

Thanks a gazillion (or at least a bunch),

Date: Wed, 19 Feb 92 13:35:00 EST

  I was woken up this morning by a friend calling to say he had
just heard that Rush has added a show on March 12 here in Binghamton,
NY.  The show is going to be at the Broome County Arena, and tickets
go on sale this Saturday morning. (10:00 E.S.T.). I already know
about 15 people who are interested in going.
  Binghamton is about 3 and a half hours from New York City, an hour
and a half from Syracuse, and about 3 to 4 hours from Rochester and
Albany.  If you live anywhere within driving distance of this, you
might want to go, because the Arena isn't all that big, and almost
any seats will be pretty good.

  On a separate, but related note, have people noticed that all of
Rush's concerts this year have been assigned seating.  When I first
went to see them in 1987, at the Broome County Arena, it was general
admission, and I got up pretty close to the stage.  When I and some
friends went to the second RTB concert in Rochester, we asked one
of the arena managers about it, and they said that the band has
decided not to do any more general admission concerts.  Can anyone
confirm or deny the truth of this?

<A NAME="434021">Subject:    Parent Who Likes RUSH (etc.)</A>

I'm a parent, 31, new to the mailing list, and just as much of a RUSH
fan as I ever was.  I took my 7 year-old son with me to the Feb 16th
concert in Dallas.  He loved it!  A lot of the other concert goers
kept saying "Hey, look at that little dude!  Alright!".  His favorite
songs are Xanadu, Show Don't Tell, and Roll The Bones.

I've admired RUSH ever since I saw them do "A Farewell to Kings" and
"Xanadu" on Don Kirschner's Rock Concert back in the late 70's.  I
love their technique and the endless time signature changes.  I haven't
missed a concert since I started (Hemispheres was my first one).

By the way, if there are any other percussion connoisseurs out there
that are interested in chatting about Neil, send me some email.  I've
been playing now for about 18 years and my son's been playing since he
was 18 months-old.  He's coming along pretty good for his age and is
already taking a stab at Xanadu.  I, myself, attribute most of what I
have learned to Neil.  I've spent more time analyzing his rhythms and
technique than any other percussionist.  I get more satisfaction out
of playing along with RUSH tunes than with any other musical group. It
would still be a dream-come-true to be able to jam with Alex and Geddy
-- even at the age of 31!

Rob

P.S. I was glad to hear how they've re-kindled that new-band-kinda
     flame and are anxious (to the point of cutting vacation and
     holiday time short) to finish the current tour and get back
     into the studio (excerpt from concert program).

Check out the Primus disc "Suck on This".  One of the songs starts out with a
great copy of YYZ and then goes on into their own thing?  Maybe the old
saying 'immitation is the highest form of flattery' is true - coulda helped
get them on the tour, eh?

Rush-dudes (and dudettes),

	I haven't been following the complete shirt idea, but whatever the
design on the shirt is, the color of the t-shirt should be red (not blue)!

Also, I managed to see Rush twice on this tour (in Houston and Dallas) and I
must say that on the second show, you can spend more time looking at the small
details (it also helps if you have better seats for the second show!!). I think
two shows is definitely the way to go - I'm already looking forward to the next
tour 2 or so years from now!

Well, maybe.

I've managed to skip almost all of the spoilers, so this may have happened
somewhere else already.  But at the Houston concert, Geddy did *not* have
his hair in a ponytail!  It was entertaining to see Geddy running around on
the stage with his hair flying around.  We now return to our regularly
scheduled postings.

TEE-Shirt trio,
    I to would like to see an organized effort with the tee's.
    I am in favor of a Black tee shirt with a simple design.  Classic lines.
    I like the star idea design.  If this is a vote, I would vote against the
newsprint/tabloid design for the simplisity and classicsity of the STAR logo.
I will take whatever I can get.  100% cotton is fine as long as XXL are
available.  I suggest the lettering and design be done in red, yellow and 
white.IMHO.  I would probably like several shirts, can we get better prices 
for largerorders?

I'd like to know what this rumor is about Neil Peart and cancer.
I heard that he has it and is thus wearing a bandana on tour.
Probably bullshit....also.... how do you pronounce his last name?
Is it like "pert" shampoo or "piert" as in jump off the pier?
