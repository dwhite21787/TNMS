On the subject of edited versions of Roll The Bones, I must relay my own
experience with this situation.  A couple of local radio stations have
aired versions of Roll The Bones with the rap segment removed.  I have
no idea as to whether Atlantic distributed these versions, but they
were only aired once, and the original track has been played since then.
Perhaps the stations received negative feedback from angry Rush fans.
Regarding the RTB video, I had been meaning to watch the one-hour video
program on CBC Windsor 9 which is received in the Detroit/Ann Arbor
area.  I am usually working during its 5-6 air time, but yesterday I
happened to be at home, and yes, Roll The Bones was aired in entirety
and I was able to tape it.  Regardless, I'm still planning on calling
eMpTyV during the week of Dec. 9-13 to request the video.  I hope all
others will do the same.

I just caught Rush at the Capital Centre in DC.   They played Ghost
of a Chance, and I heard that they didn't play it the night before in
Philly. Have they played it before or is it a new song for the set
list? Tis all.

Does anyone have any idea why the band is skipping over Jersey this time
round-seriously.  They sold out all their Meadowlands shows on the Presto
tour-it just doesn't make sense.
	I just love having finals during the only shows I could have seen.
Alright, I'll stop being depressing.

AND HERE'S A QUESTION I HAVE'NT SEEN BEFORE:
	HAS RUSH EVER DONE A FILM SCORE OR SPOKEN ABOUT BEING APPROACHED TO DO
ONE?  Anyone ever hear anything about this subject?

I would *really* like to know if Neil has written anything not Rush-related,
such as prose on any subject.  This is of course excepting his drum scores,
interviews, and Modern Drummer (and other magazine) articles.  I mean *books*!

Also, can anyone give me an interpretation of what the cover of GUP is a
picture/painting of?

One more...I found out Rush will be here (Atlanta) on Mar. 4, but I called the
(good) radio station and they had no idea when tickets might go on sale.  Could
someone tell me a good way to find such information out?  Also, does anyone
know of a good way to find a place that sells tickets on a first come, first
served basis?  (I don't want to camp out all night just to draw a number that
puts me thirtieth in line!)

Thanks!

I posted this question a few months ago, but I didn't get any
response.  So I'll be annoying and ask again.

On my tape copy of ESL, the song Xanadu is spelled Zanadu on both the
tape and the paper insert.  I doubt its the original pressing, since
I got it only a few years ago (as opposed to in 1981).  Also, the
insert doesn't fold out at all.  What I'm asking is if anyone knows
what the deal with this is.

On a related topic - How common are the Caress of Steel records with
the gray/blue background, instead of the usual reddish color?  Does
this simply mean that the copy is old?

Eeek - I still have to wait until Feb. 5 to see the show.  Does
anyone know ticket information for the Portland, OR show on that
date?  I'm hearing info for dates just shortly before that, and am
getting scared that I might miss them going on sale.

The lyrics printed with the cassette version of "Roll The Bones" say that
the chorus starts out "The odds get even -- you name the game."  But I'm
pretty sure that Geddy sings "You BLAME the game" on the first chorus.  On
the second one I'm not sure.  Does anyone else hear it this way?

So last night (12/6/91) I'm writing a bunch of holiday cards, with headphones
cranking some new Van Halen, thus being oblivous to my surroundings, when my
daughter (who's 11) looks at me and points to the tv.  There was a bunch of
sports clips flashing by, a few of the Buffalo Bills, and she was really 
excited
about it.  Why?  She hates football, this is Rochester, and the Bills on tv is
not a big deal.  So, I removed the phones and heard the intro (about the first
16
bars) to RED TIDE from PRESTO being played over and over while all this sports
action occurred.  It turned out to be a commercial for WROC-8 Eyewitness News
Sports here in Rochester (in fact just down the street from where I'm writing
this, but BFD).  We were both delighted to here RUSH on tv.  My wife meanwhile
gave us that "what the hell are you talking about" look.  Oh well, 2 out of 3
ain't bad.

<A NAME="397014">Subject: Rush at that Cap Centre **SPOILERS**</A>

Well, I made it up US 29 to catch the Boyz at the Capital Centre - hadn't
been up there since HYF, a show that left me kind of cold.

So it was a pleasure to watch Rush acting as loose as they were.  I'll
add another voice to the several we've already heard - if you have a
chance to see this show, just do it.  I noticed some of the technical
problems that seem to be plaguing them this tour (Alex had some trouble
with his guitar at a few different spots in the evening), but for the most
part the music was pretty tight.

In the "I didn't expect to hear that" department, they played "Ghost of a
Chance," a song I hadn't seen on any of the posted playlists.  "Dreamline"
and "Bravado" both came across to me as though they were coasting a little,
although they picked it up for the close of "Bravado" and kept kicking it
out for "Roll The Bones."  I was also pleased to hear "The Big Money," one
of my all time faves.

The absolute best part of the show this time:  Neil's new solo.  OUT-standing.
I hope when (if) they do another live set (I guess after the next 2 albums :),
they include a take of this solo.  As Neil stated in his equipment essay in
the tourbook, I think his new setup definitely inspired a fresh approach to
the solo.  NOW - if he can get more of it across in the studio, I'll be
*really* pleased.  (Not that I think he's "mailing it in" on RTB, but I'm
excited to think of what kind of ideas he might take away from playing on this
tour with the new set, and what he might do with them when they record again.)

High points:  Where's My Thing cooked.  Using Limelight as the 2nd song in the
set was a great decision - talk about getting the crowd going.  I liked the
way they end Superconductor and their understated play during Red Barchetta.
Hearing Anthem was great for the soul, too :).  Also, it was nice to get a
100% cotton T-shirt - I hate 50/50 blends.  The "fold-up" stage was neat, too.

Quibbles and nitpicks:  I'd REALLY like to see them lengthen the show by
15 minutes and play a complete version of Subdivisions (not that it takes 15
minutes to play a complete version of Subdivisions, you get the point).  I
think (HERESY MODE ON) it just may be time to retire Closer to the Heart - the
jazzy break is nice but it's getting old, and there's lots of other songs to
have fun with.  I also think they may be carrying the medley stuff a bit far,
but hey: is it MY music? <bzzzzzzzzz>.  And last, but not least, I didn't make
it up in time to meet whatever NMS readers might have gathered up there. :)

Worst part of the show, by far:  Vinnie Moore.  Stay at home and catch that
rerun of Night Court - you won't be missing anything.

Anyway.  A pretty good show, worth my ticket price (now that the show is past,
I can tell everybody about my nosebleed seats without getting laughed at -
Sec. 208, one row from the top of the building.  However, I was high enough
that I could see everything, and it was actually a pretty good vantage point).
I'll be driving down I-64 to catch 'em in Richmond in March, so we'll see how
things change after they go out to the Left Coast.  Rock the house, y'all.

Hey Doug, I was the one who saw "Mr. Deeds Goes To Town" starring Gary Cooper
as Longfellow Deeds, the "Cinderella Man".  It's a great film. GO CHECK IT 
OUT!!
Question:  Has anyone seen "The Fountainhead"?  Is it available on video?
It would be interesting to see Neil write a song after "High Noon" (I've never
seen the film, heard its a great film).

Just a wee minor curiosity, and considering that those are three of the best

-just throwing in my $.03 in response to Paul W's query about the
significance of the dice...
   It seems to me that things stay orderly until you get "to the
bottom of things," so to speak.  At the very lowest level, we are
constrained by an unavoidable randomness and uncertainty.  Hence the
weeds sprouting from the cracks and the dice eaten away until they are
unreadable.
>. . . anyway, that sounds a helluva lot better to me than "I did an
analysis of the patterns in the dice and found that it spells 'Satan'
in morse code." :)
   My conclusion: the dice _are_ random.  So there.

   What I want to know is, after the kid in the picture walks away,
what does the die behind his neck say?  Maybe the title was supposed
to be "Roll the Boones."  hmmmmmmm...

I'd suspect the former.  The satellite is ~22300 miles away, for ~44600
miles for the full trip.  This is considerably shorter than the ~745128
miles electromagnetic radiation travels in 4 seconds.

that they can run musical circles around Genesis).  Let's face it,
Phil is no Neil.  I was only expressing my opinion (because they trash
Rush on a regular basis), and they went nuts! (JUST MY $.02)

I remember someone saying something about Alex Lifeson's
soloing sounding a little like David Gilmour. Well, if you
listen to "Ghost of a Chance" then "Sorrow" off of _A Momentary
Lapse of Reason_ by Pink Floyd, you'll definitely hear
similarities, though the tones are different. The bending and
phrasing seem similar.

I guess all I can do is listen to the new album since it seems that I
lack a ticket to the sold-out show in Worcester, MA ... *sigh*.

Howdy !  I'll be taping the Tuesday Worcester show, and I had some
questions about timing.  Maybe someone out there taped and/or timed
one of the recent shows.

1.  How long is the show total ?  Will it fit on a 120 DAT or do I
        need to bring two 90's ?

[ I've found they run onto the first side of a second 90-min tape.  :rush-mgr ]

2.  How long is the warm-up band ?

[ Too long; about 30-40 min.                                        :rush-mgr ]

3.  If I do need to change tapes and batteries, does anyone know a good
        time to do it around 90 minutes ?  Maybe during a video with
        no music, or a talking break.  I need about 30 seconds to change
        everything.  Any suggestions ?

[ Buy a fresh set of Energizers, or something similar.  They should last
  the whole show, IMHO.                                            :rush-mgr ]

This info would be most helpful to me.  I know this is sort of short
notice to get a response in time, but maybe it will get through.
Important note:  I haven't had time to read the Digests lately, so
please *Email me the response directly*.  I would appreciate it !
Thanks !  :-)

take care,

Amazing. That's all I can say about the first New York City show. The Boyz
sounded better than ever. Madison Square Garden was rocking like I've never 
seen
an arena rock before. Geddy sang the newer songs beautifully and nicely 
adjusted
to the older tunes. Neil was a madman, jumping up and waving his arms around to
get the crowd going. He almost dropped a stick when he threw it out in front of
his set, but a few nice moves got him through to make a great catch.

SET LIST CHANGE---
I don't know if it was played in any previous shwow, but the boyz played

				GHOST OF A CHANCE

right after Roll the Bones. I hadn't seen this on any previous set list, and 
was
damn happy that they decided to play it. Someone mentioned before that the rap
was sequenced in previous shows, but I think it was LIVE at MSG. The lights 
were
out, but they came up just before "Get busy" and Geddy was clearly singing it.
I
guess they decided to do it live, now that everyone knows it's Geddy.
The only mistake I noticed was when Geddy triggered a "Show Me Don't Tell Me"
two beats too early, so it went "Show......Show Me Don't Tell Me". It didn't
really matter because the crowd was louder than the recording anyway. _Spirit_
sounded stange, but I couldn't figure out why.
Definitely worth the five hour drive from Boston. I hope Tuesday's show in
Worcester is as good. See you there.

Thanks to whoever transcribed "Dreamline"...Anyone have any ideas
about "Roll The Bones" now?  I've figured most of the changes, but one
section eludes me; During the pre-chorus -- the changes behind the
lyrics "We go out in the world and take our chances/Fate is just the
weight of circumstances/That's the way that lady luck dances/Roll the
bones."  It seems to me that the changes are similar to the following:
Fmajor barre (in the 8th position) to Gmajor barre (3rd position),
then Fmajor, Amajor, Bmajor.  Anybody have any clue???  (Actually, now
that I think about it, the Fmajor shouldn't be there, assuming the key
of the song is G...)
   Oh, in case you're curious....The changes for the intro/verse are
simply G, D, C -- all in the natural (open) position, and the chorus
is Eminor, G, C -- again in the open position....These are what I've
picked out, so they might not be exactly right, 'tho I *do* think
they're close....
   Am I the only one that thinks John Tesh (of "Entertainment Tonight"
and "One on One with John Tesh") looks a bit like Alex Lifeson???

to you know who about whether Rush is ever going back to story/conceptual
song themes.  He got through, and they HUNG UP ON HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Blur your eyes now if you want to avoid spoilers...


Well, I'm always amazed by the boyz' endurence.  They tour and tour
and never seem to tire out!  This concert had some technical problems
early on, but the trio played as well as they ever have.

I thought their song selection was very good, though I could have done
without Force 10 again; I thought they should have opened with Show
Don't Tell (the energy level went way up for that song), and I was
kind of surprised with the album-like order of the songs from RTB.
They played them so well, though!  I was ecstatic when I recognized
Bravado and Ghost of a Chance, and impressed with the funky, slow way
they broke into Where's My Thing.  And -- Neil's drum solo was 50%
new!  THAT I wasn't expecting!  I always have new respect for his
musical abilities after a drum solo (admittedly, sampling pads make it
more "melodic," eh?) -- I loved the front-rear speaker tricks.  And
the laser tricks were subdued this tour, but still pretty impressive
(I miss the "curtain" effect where you can see smoke particles
swirling in the beams).

Yeah, normally I hate the "medley," but I understand their time
constrants.  I've always wondered what they'd do if the opening act
proved a no-show, and they could start a half-hour earlier (wishful
thinking -- they'd end a half-hour earlier).  Certainly Vinnie Moore
is worth missing.  The most notable thing about him was his hair (I
was hoping a crane would lower itself down from the ceiling and remove
it from his head).  Also, when he tossed his guitar down on the stage
at the end of his set, he left the gain turned up and an ear-splitting
string playing until a roadie mercifully pulled the plug.  Argh.

Bravado looks like it could easily replace Closer to the Heart as the
"flick your bic" concert song.  :-)

All in all I was impressed as usual.  My only major caveat was that
the audience was nowhere near the standards I am used to at Rush
concerts.  Why, I could only see about three other air-drummers from
my standpoint!  And while I had pretty mediocre seats (second tier,
looking straight into Neil's kit), even the floor didn't look as
captivated as usual.  (It was funny -- the guy to my right was
standing stock still, jacket over his folded arms, unresponsive to
everything, while I was jumping, singing, using my the back of my leg
against my folded seat as a kick bass, and air-drumming next to him --
and on his other side, his girlfriend was equally animated!  Kind of
the reverse of what you'd expect. :-)

Next week I'll catch them at the Knick at Albany, where I plan to grab
hang outside while Vinnie Moore is on, and hope that the audience is
at least as animated as the big screen behind the boyz... :-)

First, I'd like to say that, although I haven't posted lately, I have
been reading almost every day, and I have but one question. Why do we
really care about the real pronunciation of PEART?? Peart (As in Pert
Plus shampoo) Or Peart (as the brand of drums with an T instead of and
L?) To discuss such a thing (it was discussed, right?)  on Rockline is a
trivial thing to begin with, and secondly, questions on Rockline should
be of substance. If we were talking to Metallica, or any other of the
slew of loud metal bands - something like that would be indicative of
the audience of those bands- not Rush fans .... Just my opinion...

	This may have been discussed before, so excuse me if we've gone over
this already, but where is the High School, Mall, City, and Housing Plan
footage in Subdivisions video filmed? It's a cool video, although I hate
Alex in a bow tie. Anyway, where is it - Canada somewhere?

	One final thing.... I saw Rush here in Pittsburgh in late October, but
I'd really like to see them again. I'd go to someplace like Baltimore,
but can somebody tell me when this show is. It's after the holidays,
right?

[ It's supposed to be March 11th; I assume tickets will go on sale in early

SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!

DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED!!!!!!

(was this a good enough warning?)

I met up with my buddy "The Letter B" and we went to see the Boyz in
Madison Square Garden on the 6th. What a show.
Just a few observations:
	Alex played keyboards with his nose (quite funny) and he did an
extended and quite different solo on Dreamline. He was impressive the whole
night, except his guitar could have been louder. What a cool sound he gets
from that P.R.S.! He was funny the whole night, too, with his gestures.
Someone threw what looked like a panty on stage. Lerxst picked it up with
his foot and then placed it on the base for Neil's set (quite cool!).
	Geddy's hair was tied back, unfortunately. I was hoping to see it
set free like in the RTB video. His voice was dead on. His new modified
vocals for Finding My Way and Anthem still sounded awesome even though they
were different. His bass blurbs and solos were incredible(as always).
	Neil was awesome! His new solo was more like a song than him just
flying all over the set. It ruled!
	They played Ghost of a Chance, which was a new addition. Xanadu was
quite excellent. The play list was great and many of the songs were
modified and sounded fresh.
	I can count only two mistakes. There were no guitar problems,
except I think Alex's mike was turned off for one song, or something. Neil
dropped a stick once and Geddy triggered a sample in Show Don't Tell to
early. Not bad, eh??
	Catch this tour or commit suicide. It's just that simple.
Well worth all the money I spent.

<A NAME="397032">Subject: SPOILER - Rush at Madison Square Garden, December 7</A>

This is not a bad report, overall; it is simply a recollection of the
concert last Saturday.

Vinnie Moore was extremely loud, and I was up three flights and in the
back of Madison Square Garden (MSG).  I strongly recommend ear-plugs.
For those who don't know (I didn't), he is a neo-classical wannabee - who
is fast - but doesn't have much in terms of original style.

Rush was loud, too; too loud, in fact.  I really enjoyed the show - the
stage show was great(!) - but it was probably due to the fact that I knew
what to expect, what the songs were like, etc..

They recycled a lot from previous tours, using footage from the Presto
and Hold Your Fire tour on the motion picture screen whenever possible.
The lasers were there, as before, using the same choreography as on the
Presto tour.

Neil's solo was fantastic; instead of playing (again) the Show of Hands
solo, he took the most recognizable parts of it and previous solos (e.g.
the cowbells, the snare sequence a la Buddy Rich, the crash-triggered
horn samples) and rearranged them so that you were delighted, yet teased
at the same time; you knew sort of what was in the solo, but the order
you could only guess at.

No I am not a drummer.  :)  Nice try...

Alex sounded great, but he was a little loud.  He nailed a lot of his
solos, yet added "the touch" to keep the concert from becoming trivial.
Geddy sounded great also.  I don't know why everyone was saying he has
trouble with the high notes; the only trouble I noticed during the entire
2 hours was at the end of Closer to the Heart.

I loved the concert, no matter how this sounds, and plan to see them at
Nassau on March 31 (and I'll be damned if I won't get good tickets this
time!!!).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In the spirit of the "other guy" who did an advertisement for his
brother, I am looking for a drummer and a female vocalist in the upper
Westchester county area.

I have a home-grown 8-track studio, with all of the trimmings, and only
record originals.  Currently, I write all of the material, including
lyrics, and have an amazing bassist and great guitarist; we all
contribute on an "as time allows" basis, because we all have full-time
jobs, girlfriends, etc..

The music I write varies in style from hard-rock to the blues to
progressive/new age, and a little of everything in between; the style for
any particular song depends on how I felt when I wrote it.  :)

I am looking for a drummer with an imagination, so I am asking here,
since Neal has the best imagination of any drummer I have ever heard/
seen, and every drummer I know (unfortunately, none live in my area) that
has been influenced by him have a LOT of talent.  I don't use Rush for a
base for any of my songs, except maybe that they sometimes has strange
time signatures.

I'm getting sick of programming my Roland R-8 drum machine. :)  Doing a
*GOOD* drum track on one of those takes a LOT of time.

The female vocalist should have a good voice (obviously), preferably a
contra-alto's range, but I would give anything for a mezzo-soprano's
range.  A good "bite" in her voice would be nice, too.  Anyone know any
Sarah Vaughn sound-alikes?  :)  If she/you can play keyboards, I would be
overwhelmed (overwhelm me, please! :).

If you know anyone, please let me know, so we can talk!!!
