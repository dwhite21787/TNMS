Hi all,

Due to time restrictions I was unable to get out Thursday's NMS
at the scheduled time.  Here it is now, better late than never!
(I hope)

Also, I hope I didn't get too editorial about the satanism issue.
It's just that things have been mis-represented for ages, and I
feel people should hear the other side.  (Not to say that I'm an
expert; I've just been informed of a few things in recent years
myself, and many of my previous conceptions were misconceptions.)

<A NAME="235002">Subject: Satanic Rock</A>

Sorry to re-hash an old topic, but I finally obtained *real*
information on the old subject of Rush being Satanic.

After reviewing the video tape called "HELL"S BELLS  The Dangers
of Rock 'n' Roll", an evangelistic yet professional approach to
showing Satan's influence over and use of rock and rock-related
music, I located two references to the group RUSH. These occured
in Part 4 (of 5).

1.) The use of the word "syrinx" from the 2112 album apparently
relates to the term "pan" which in turn relates to Satanism.

[ Or it could relate to the medical term 'syrinx', which is part of
  the voice mechanism.  This makes more sense to me "Priests of the 
  the Temples of The Voice (of God/what's right/etc)."  But then again,
  I guess they like the excersize of stretching for an explanation...
                                                              :rush-mgr ]

2.) The live version of the song "Anthem" from the Fly By Night
album, when played backwards, allegedly produces several audible
phrases that are considered Satanic.

Details follow: quoted material is taken directly from the video-tape
                parenthasised text is my own attempt to describe what
                is seen and heard

(video background: Samantha Fox's "Touch Me" live, music background: unknown)
"Not only do we see the socialogical manifestations of this anti-christ
spirit everywhere in rock today,
(video: 2112 from GUP, music: 2112 live from GUP)
significantly, we find some very direct allusions to pan himself.
(video: picture of 2112 album cover, music: continued 2112 live)
Rush's 2112 album features the song 'The Temples of Syrinx', a greek
word that relates to pan. (Syrinx pronounced like suh-RINKS not SEAR-inks)
(video: Elton John, music: still 2112 live)
In 1987 Elton John......"

(And he continues on his description of "pan". The second mention of RUSH
is described next.)

(video: GUP unkown section, music: live Anthem, 'yes it was for me not you..')
"There is also theological significance in our next example, the live version
of the song 'Anthem' by the group Rush. When we played this section reversed
we hear (video: GUP played in reverse, music: live Anthem in reverse)
(appearing in graphic text on screen) 'Oh Satan, you are the one who is
shining. Walls of Satan, I know it's you are the one I love.'
(he then re-plays this twice because it's hard to catch the first time)
(video: narator sitting next to TV in background with red-rush-star-and-man
on screen and the words 'You are the one who is shining" overlayed)
One of the translations for Lucifer, a latin title commonly associated
with Satan, is the shining one. And earlier in part 1......"

(The rest of the tape is basic christianity and salvation procedures)

====------------------------ End Journalism/Reporting Mode

Several things I found interesting:

1.) They methodically developed how rock music parallels society's
    ills such as suicide, drugs, blasphemy, etc... but not once
    mentioned "...my life blood spills over", "A Passage to Bangkok",
    or "Freewill" respectively.

2.) They actually played a section of the GUP video in reverse during
    the examination of Anthem. Anthem is not on the GUP video.

3.) They used the 2112 album symbol when discussing Anthem. Anthem isn't
    on 2112.

4.) They made a point of discussing Satanic symbols such as the pentagram,
    but never called the 2112 star a pentagram.

5.) They didn't discuss the studio version of Anthem. Perhaps there is
    some sort of Satan-influence-filter at the studio.

6.) After my brother viewed the tape he said: "I liked watchin' Geddy."

In all honesty, I was surprised to see any Rush at all on the tape. I just
can't beleive they decided to target Rush. Now Neil's response is even more
enjoyable/meaningfull. Sorry for such a long post to those uninterested....
Rush and/or Religous discussions welcome over e-mail.

  It's the same methods used by the WOD people; initiate unthinking 
  hysteria, then ride the wave.  My favorite quote was when they said
  "the artist doesn't necesserily have to know the satanic messages are
  in the music; Satan could be speaking through their unconsious."  Sheesh!
  I wish somebody would play recorded religious hynms backwards and see
  what "satanic messages" pop up!

<A NAME="235003">Subject: Analog and Digital</A>

I always thought that the relationship between Analog Kid and Digital Man was
fairly obvious; in that (the more advanced) digital technology was at the
time replacing the analog technology of the past (Signals was the tour where
Geddy replaced his old Oberhiems (analog synths) with the new PPG Waves
(digital synths) - as an example) - it also may be an analogy relating the
warmth of analog with the innocense of youth and the coldness of digital
with the realities of adulthood.

Another interpretation of the title Analog Kid is that the song paints a
picture of a young boy new to the wonders of the world - the could be a
portrait of Neil Peart, the artist as a young boy. I recall Neil saying in
an interview that as a boy he read lots of science-fiction and fantasy
(certainly evidenced in his early lyrics) - Neil would have been a boy
(pre-adolecent) during the early sixties, at which time the premier science-
fiction magazine was called Analog. So, prehaps the title could be interpreted
as a reference to the magazine that Neil (possibly) read as the kid in the
song.

I don't have the phone number on me, so can someone in Canada (or Northern

Toronto? If so, could that number be called to get some info on the
boyz' new album (hint, hint...) I know Andrew MacNaughtan works in the
office and could almost definitely give an answer to the question on
ALL of our minds!

I have to agree with our esteemed rush-mgr on this point.  Hamish strikes
me as someone who loves to argue in public, loves to argue just for the
sake of argument, and probably goes to sleep every night thanking whatever
deity he might worship for the huge legions of Rush fans that can't bear
to let whatever derogatory comments he might make go unchallenged.  Not
to attack you specifically, Stuart; as a matter of fact, I think that taking
your discussion to e-mail was a very intelligent move, and deprives Hamish
of more opportunities to try and show alt.r-n-r what a well-rounded person
he might be.  I think Hamish is better off ignored.  Completely.

I apologize if this seems like an anti-Hamish diatribe instead of hard
Rush-news, but I think it's at least peripheral to Rush fans' conduct
here (on the NMS) and on the net (and by extension, to the band's
perception on the net).  Plus, I *really* get burned by people who
pick fights just for the sake of picking fights.  Anyway, enough of
this nonsense - on with the Rush news.

Oh yeah, I do have a Rush question.  On the last tour (I saw the 4 May 1990
show at Richmond VA), Alex had some 8.5x11 glossies of people, like movie
stills or something, on his amp cabinets.  I couldn't make them out very
clearly through my binoculars - the only one I thought I recognized was of
Humphrey Bogart.  Anyway, it's been bugging me ever since, so does anyone
know of whom some of those pictures were?  Bueller?

"Conform or be cast out."

Something to bring up....  ("Remember, if you have a question, anything
at all -- ask it!")

Looking back through the album covers of RUSH, pentagrams seem to pop
up on a few.  Is there any link from these to anything else? (I notice them
on _All the World's a Stage_ and, of course, a big 'un on _2112_.)

[ Sigh.  The star on _2112_ isn't a pentagram.  A pentagram has a pentagon
  in the center made by the intersecting lines of the star.  On the cover 
  picture the lines don't do this.  Also, the star is point up, isn't it?
  A pentagram is point down, if I'm not mistaken.  Of course, as always, feel
  free to prove me wrong!  (Side note: in the Rider Tarot deck, (the one
  you're most likely to know) the pentagram stands generally for "wisdom".)
                                                                 :rush-mgr ]

Amazing/weird:  Since I am new to RUSH, I am reminded of my ties to them from
yesteryear.  When I was but a young lad, I won a poster at a junior high
dance (wow!).  The twist, you ask?  It was a cool poster of this guy sitting
on a chair making his windows move with a tv remote control.  I picked it
because it looked cool.  Hmm...  _Power Windows_ is cool.

"Obselete...   Absolute!"

A twisted note (?):  As I listen to _Chronicles_ and I come upon the live
version of _Passage to Bangkok_ (taken from _Exit... Stage Left_ for you
hard-core RUSHers), the first few seconds sound as if my tape player's
batteries are getting low.  The problem is that my tape player is plugged
in!  (It sounds like this no matter where I go...)  Does it sound like this
to you or am I just a bit whacked in the head for THIS ONE SONG?

I just finished reading the new FAQL and wanted to comment on how La Villa
came to be.  Yes, La Villa is based on some dreams Alex had.  But it is
a little more complicated than that.  Oh, BTW, I remember hearing this
on an interview with Alex by the B-Man (Bill Banasevitz...I don't know how
to spell it!) or possibly reading it somewhere.  Anyway, the night before
he had these dreams, he had eaten at some Greek restuarant.  The Greek
part of Toronto, BTW, is around the intersection of DANFORTH AND PAPE.
Now you know where that comes from.
The last time I was in Toronto, summer of '89, I went to take a look!
Sure enough, there were the street signs!  Got pictures of them.
I hope to go back this summer as it is my favorite city.  Even my
user name is named after it!  Hey, I don't get to go there that often.
I live in Corpus Christi, Tx (ever heard of it!) and go to school in Austin!

<A NAME="235009">Subject: innovation</A>

	I have a few tips for the gentleman arguing with people about the
innovations that Rush has contributed to music.  I don't think they have
contributed anything radically new.  Its how they combine these past 
innovationsthat makes their sound their own.  How many other bands can play
in 5,6and 7?
How many other bands can count to 7?  But to call this an innovation is simply
lack musical knowledge.  I'm not calling anyone dumb, I certainly don't
claim to understand the workings of the computers I use everyday, I'm just
saying that if you study the history of music all these things have
crept up for the last 1200 years.  Alex's distinct use of color vs line in
many of his solos, off hand G/P comes to mind.  I find their constant use of
suspensions an integral part of their harmonic sound.
	To historically set some of the things they use:

If you want poly/mixed meter try Stravinsky.  He wasn't the first and won't be
last but is noted for it.  (1894?-1972?)

If you want color how about Debussy. (1870ish-1940ish) these maybe a little off

Rhythmic complexity?  You haven't heard anything until you go back to the 14th
century.  Fierenzi, Landini, etc.  Described by some as,"too difficult to
perform without the aid of a computer."  There is speculation on the existance
of "super-singers".  This of course is an exaggeration but it gives a certain
implication of the complexity.

	Don't be fooled by the myths preached in General education courses at
your local universities!!
If you think Mozart worked in fixed forms, checkout the double fugue in the
finale of the "Jupiter" symphony, and correct harmonies!? We can't be speaking
of the same Mozart!  Some of Mozart's music was not intended for the stage
but to say "most" is also an extreme over statement.
20 some piano concerti
41 symphonies
the Requeim
3 hour operas upon opera upon opera

	How can a Bach prelude or fugue be described as fixed?!
	And finally on this note, Chopin pushed many limits in his writing
which, like so many others, started when he was 8.  He really pushed the
bounderies of tonality.

	I guess all this meaningless rambling can be summed up in the 
discussion that I heard on my radio the other night between 2 DJs.  One 
commented that in fact its not often that someone will say,"Was that Rush
or AC/DC?"

	They have really developed their own sound and they have stuck with it.
Not to say that there are the same but there are certain characteristics
found on the first album that are on the 10th album.  It is also hard to
speak in concrete terms without a score to refer to.  These piano anthologies
are for the birds.

	Thanks for the suggestions on the second chord to Fly By Night.  As 
you can see there is some controversy(sp?) over this.  I think the (from the 
top down) 3302 is the one that I have seen the most.  My guitar just doesn't
make this sound right.  Its cheap so what do I expect?

	enough for now, probably to much.

<A NAME="235010">Subject: FBN chords (hopefully a wrapup)</A>
Date: Wed, 8 May 91 22:24:37 CDT
<A NAME="235310">From: David Sandberg <sialis!dts@cs.umn.edu></A>

Joseph Kung's minor additions to the section of FBN tab I posted
last week, namely the open G string ringing in addition to the
two high strings and the first full A chord near the end of the
section, proved to be correct once I went back and listened
again.  His included comments were also right on the money for
anyone who doesn't already know which strings should be left
ringing and when.

However, in the process of the above, Joseph omitted the drone A
at the end of the section - a note which is rather important for
rounding out the cadence.  When the first A chord is played, it
should include the open A string, which should be left ringing
while the next two chords are played and then muted at the same
moment that the final chord is muted.

Thus we end up with the following chart:

    --2-2----3-3------------3------3-------3----------
    --3-3----3-3------------3------3-------3-2---0-2--
    --2-2----0-0------------0------0-------0-2---0-2--
    --0-0----2-2----------2------0-------0---2---0-2--
    ----------------0-2-3-----2------0-1-----0--------
    --------------------------------------------------

One final thing which persons attempting FBN might want to keep
in mind is this: in the live version Alex very often is picking
up the open A string in the second chord position, which yields a
different chord entirely (with a fuller sound).  He may have just
been hitting the A by accident, but since he did so both times
during the intro section of FBN live, one might want to keep it
in mind when deciding on which recording of the song to emulate.

In other words, the first chords of the live version of FBN might
be charted as follows:

    --2-2---3-3--
    --3-3---3-3--
    --2-2---0-0--
    --0-0---2-2--
    --------0-0--
    -------------

Now that we've dissected this bit of guitar work about as far as
it can be dissected, we might want to remind ourselves that if we
were to ask Alex today how he played FBN, he'd probably say "Oh,
I really don't remember anymore, but I think it went _something_
like this..."  B-)

	I've got a couple of things to say:

1)  In case any of you southern Caliornia dudes didn't hear, KLOS (95.5)
played Permanent Waves on their Sundat Night thinggy, whatever they call it,
Sunday.

2)  Someone asked recently what it would be like if Rush became "popular".
I, for one, wouldn't like it one bit.  I had never even paid any attention
to Rush until a year ago and that was only until I had listened to many of
their albums several times.  I admit that if they were a terrible band I
wouldn't have even had given them a second chance but the person who introduced
me to them insisted that I at least hear them out.  After about 3 albums I
became totally intrigued with the band.  My point is that one song (or even
one album) is not enough to decide that a band is really good or bad,  you
need to hear lots of the bands material to make a valid judgement.  If Rush
became an overnight success (heaven forbid :-) then we would see a lot of
fans that liked them because they were "trendy" or because their latest album
was "pretty cool."

3)  The topic of Rush and drugs came up recently as well.  I, of course,
can't say whether the band has recently, if ever, taken drugs.  BUT, IMHO,
I happen to think that the band has taken drugs (one or maybe more) in the
past and I see no reason why they may have stopped.

[ It's basically documented in the book "Visions", in the anecdote on the 
  naming of "Fly By Night".                                     :rush-mgr ]

4)  On a not-too-Rush-related topic, my roommate is writing a paper about
music in the '60's, Jimi Hendrix in particular.  I was just trying to show
him some of the advances of Jimi's music.

Anyway, good luck on finals all you lucky people.  All us UCSD dudes don't
finish until the middle of June!

    On the subject of Witch Hunt being a "studio track", I recall a few
    facts:  On Witch Hunt, as well as other songs on Moving Pictures
    (and probably other albums as well), the guitars are multi-tracked,
    i.e. recorded several times and layered together, to get a thick,
    full sound.  Also there was alot of keyboards in that song, and they
    basically didn't intend to play it live (at first).

    On the subject of "Do we really want Rush to hit it _really_ big?"
    I think that we all complain about Rush not getting enough airplay
    and critical acclaim, but I agree with Derek L. (NMS#233) - we would
    probably *hate* it if Rush all of a sudden got *pop*-popular.

    On the subject of the second chord of "Fly by Night", I have seen 3
    or 4 different versions of this chord posted by you guys, but none
    of them sound quite right to me!!!

    On the subject of controlled substance use by the trio (Re:
    NIDSTER%JHHUMS, NMS #233), check the Neil encounter posted by Isaac
    Salzman (same NMS).

    On the subject of.... OK, ENOUGH ALREADY!!!

It's early, and I haven't had my morning Java yet, so please forgive
me for forgetting to whom I am responding here.  Whoever you are, you
were talking about the reference to Babylon.  Here's my $0.0e (sic)
worth:

Babylon (as the Biblical story goes), was pagan man's ultimate attempt
to get God one-up.  The reasoning of the Babylonians:  God resides in
Heaven, and we all know that Heaven is up, so if we build a big enough
tower, we should be able to sit higher than God and preside over him.
Ooops.  Bad career move.  God clued in to what they were doing and put
a nasty end to it.  Not only was the great Tower of Babel reduced to
so much rubble, but all the people were sent off in different
directions speaking different languages (eg. Greek, Chinese, English,
French, Hindi, Sanskrit, you get the drift).  Needless to say, the
project was never completed, and man has never again tried to reach
geographical Heaven (if Heaven can indeed be described as a
geographical location).  Babylon represented a milestone and a major
lesson in man's quest for Heaven in that it taught mankind that the
only way to reach Heaven was as God had decreed (pull out your copy of
the scriptures for more details...I only do sermons on Sundays :-) ).

Can you tell me more about this, what tracks are on it? I've always
wanted to compile a list of stuff like this, oddities that wouldn't
appear on a regular discography. I have a few things that would fit
into this category, eg. 12" single promos of Force Ten and Time Stand
Still, (the latter also includes The Enemy Within and Witch Hunt
recorded on the p/g tour), Hemispheres on red vinyl, things like that.
Does anyone else have any stuff I could add to this list? (E-mail
please). It would probably be worth including descriptions of the
original album releases if they differ from the ones currently available,
(eg. FBN with handwritten lyricsheet, ATWAS in 3-way gatefold).

On another note..

They had music and lyrics in an unfinished form, but it never
got further than that. It seemed out of place with the rest
of the album, so they scrapped it unrecorded. Neil went off to
write something to replace it and came up with Natural Science,
and they salvaged parts of Gawain when they set it to music.

No idea about this one.

  Holy Walter  (or was that Holy Water?) (HYF)

This sounds suspiciously like a typo for High Water.

Oh well, that's enough for now...

	I don't know very much about Rastafarian lore (or Gibson's
"Neuromancer", I've only played the computer game version), but I
think Babylon represents the decadent Western society in which the
likes of us (sorry for the sweeping generalization) live in.

	In "Digital Man", the line goes "He'd love to spend the night
in Zion/ He's been a long, long while in Babylon".  This seems to make
sense.  I seems to hint that the subject of the song would like to visit
the more spiritual place called Zion as an alternative to the decadent
world of Babylon he's been cooped up in.

	Now that I've babbled quite long enough, I'm going to get some
much needed SLACK.

       He's got a date with fate in a black sedan
       He's plays fast forward just as long as he can
       But he won't need a bed, he's a Digital Man"

Hi
        To my horror I just found out there is a 3 panel inlay for
ATWAS - I have the ordinary 2 panel version

Does anybody in the UK know where I can get my hands on this version?

[ Try a used record shop.  That's the last place I saw one.  I do know
  that they had gone to the 2-panel version in the early 80's, when I
  went to replace my copy which was worn out.   On another "original 
  album" note, how many of you knew there was a poster distributed with
  _Hemispheres_ in the original release?                      :rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="235017">Subject: Witch Hunt, meetings, and Neil</A>

Good day and welcome to another day!

I just wanted to comment on a couple of things. First, someone
mentioned that it was hard to see why Witch Hunt was a big production
number. Well besides having Hugh Syme play keyboards on the track, Neil
actually did two separate drum parts and merged them together. This
was to give the illusory effect of two drummers playing at once.
Of course none of us picked this up when listening to it since
Neil sounds like two drummers playing at once anyways!

Some discussion has been popping up on what it would be like
to meet members of the band. I think that it would be a great thing
to happen if it ever did. But if it didn't I really wouldn't be
that disappointed. The important thing about the band, to me, is their
music and the ideas that are conveyed when they are playing it. I still
can't live through a day without hearing at least 2-3 hours of it. But this
does not mean that I should worship Alex, Geddy, and Neil. It is true that
I am influenced by their ideas and values as well as their influences' ideas
and values, but as far as their personal lives are concerned, it isn't
really any of my business. Their music speaks for itself. Period. I guess
I am just trying to say that if I were given a chance to meet them, I
would do it on an eye-to-eye level, and would not feel like a humble
disciple in their presence.

Enough said.

Well just one more thing... I noticed in a couple of posts ago
that someone had the lucky opportunity to sit in an interview
with Neil. During the interview the person said that Neil pulled
out a joint after a few cigarettes. How do you all feel about this?
In my opinion I just ask the question, "Why would such a great thinker
and drummer continually self destruct his mind?" I have no answer to that
question. Really, if that is what he wants to do it's his business (see
above) but I can't find any reason in it.

Well now I've said enough...

<A NAME="235318">From: DSchmidt.311@postman.gsfc.nasa.gov!</A>

    I was quite surprised with the Rush concert review posted in the
    last NMS.  It is probably the first one I ever read that was so
    favorable!  More often than not, reviews of Rush albums and concerts
    are very critical.  This one seemed to be written by a true fan!  It
    also made my mouth water because the Presto tour was the only one
    I've missed in almost 10 years.

    BTW:  I saw Steve Morse in concert last night at the 930 club in
    Washington, DC.  He is quite remarkable!  He is probably the most
    technically impressive, and rockin' guitarist I've ever seen!  I
    highly recommend seeing him (and listening to his albums),
    especially all you guitarists out there!
