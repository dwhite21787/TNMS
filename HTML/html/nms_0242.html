Ahhhh!  Life again... I had my last final on Wednesday!  My life is
mine again.  I'm free!  I'm free!

Actually, I feel like I'm on parole for three months...

Anyway, hope everyone's A-OK.  I have a question for all those who
either live in Toronto or who have visited Toronto on "Rush-runs".
I've got a friend who going to Toronto soon.  I asked him, if he has
the chance, to take a picture for me of the intersection of Danforth
and Pape.  But I've forgotten where it was.  Is it near the old City
Hall?  Or the new one?  Can anybody help?

Hey!  I just saw another Rushawaiian (don't ask me how the h*ll to
pronounce that one...)!  Yo! deane@galileo.IFA. (as Fate would have
it,, I've just forgotten the rest of the address...)!  That's makes,
what 3, 4 of us...  (what's really funny about this is that I work all
the way across campus, actually across the valley, from him and for
the _other_ astronomers... at least you've got a _real_ building)

Sorry, didn't mean to take up bandwidth.  I just got so excited...

	Last night my roommate was writing a paper for his music class.  He
had to choose one song from a list of '70's stuff they were given and
describe it thoroughly.  One of his choices was "Oracle" from 2112.  Now I
don't know why his prof. choose that particular section of the song but
that's beside the point.
	My question is this. In "Oracle", right after the line "...dream
can't you show me light..." there is that funky sound.  What makes that
sound? My roommate wanted to say that it was a keyboard but I was under
the impression that Rush didn't use any keyboards on the album. Is it some
other kind of synth sound besides a keyboard or what? My roommate used
that song for his paper since I had it on CD so he could listen to the
part over and over but he left out that little section since we weren't sure.

Whoever cares,
   RE the Rush/Love song thread.
   A lot of people(well, sort of) wrote in today(that will be
yesterday by the time you read this.  Sigh.  What a week) about Entre
Nous being a love song.  I hate to differ(riiight) but I have trouble
seeing it that way.  "We are secrets to each other..." and "We're
linked to one another/by such slender threads" seems, in someone elses
words to be almost an "out of love song."  The song is about how the
spaces in between people are so important, and how limited
relationships can be/are.  Granted, the song itself is beautiful, but
I have a LOT of trouble writing this off as a love song.
   On the other side of the coin, the boyz said(through "Visions") that
"Emotion Detector" was supposed to be a ballad.  Granted it IS a
little rough compared to most love songs("...ooh, I love you.  Ooh I
need you.  Oh baby.  Ooh...":-))  but then again, would you expect
anything different?

To whomever asked about Rush love tunes, nobody's mentioned "In The End"
on FBN. I dunno. To me, it always seemed like a love song....
Same with "Making Memories" on...CoS. Always seemed luv-ish.

My apologies for 'lurking' but the subjects aren't things I'm really
able to contribute to lately :) oreven that interested in. *grin*

This is a first time, so I hope this works...

The best explanation of the Red Star that I have heard is that the star
symbolizes the Federation, and the man, an individual against it.  This
hold tightly with the Objectivist views of the band, and the theme of
the work.  I haven't looked through back issues yet to see how all this
came up, so this may be redundant.  Also, the star can be distinguished
from a pentagram by the corners breaking the circle (as well as the fact
that its upside down).

I agree that Rush hasn't written many love songs at all.  A few
as mentioned before probably fit into that category.  If one
notices, Tears (as someone mentioned), and Entre Nous? (as another
nominated) are closer to love songs, and if one reads who wrote
the lyrics to those songs, it was Geddy Lee.  At least Tears was
written just by him, and since I don't have the CD sleeve with me
I think that Geddy also wrote the other one as well.  I think that
if Geddy wrote more of the tunes on his own, we'd have slower songs
more inclined to this genre.  Oh well, just my two cents.......
