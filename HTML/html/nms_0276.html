You know you're a RUSH fan when :

You're hired for a contract postion that pays $2112/month  (I have the stub!)
(it only lasted one month)

You're watching Porky Pig go after the "last" Dodo and you see a reference
to the three balls on HYF ("The sign of the pawn broker made momma go mad")

The locks on your new briefcase are made by "PRESTO".

Pretty nifty huh! The wild coincidences you find in life; or are they just
coincidence? :)

(To our esteemed Rush-Mgr:  This isn't an outraged response - expecting bad
reviews and interviews means not getting upset anymore when they come out...)

I think the whole key to understanding this nonsense is in the one paragraph:

> I didn't have the heart to tell Neil the _real truth_, namely that
> this frustrated musician hoo-hah is just the tip of the iceberg.
> What we _really_ are is frustrated writers. Now, can anybody guess
> why?

Because you're jealous that musicians get all the crowd's attention, when a
_serious_ journalist like yourself is mired in poverty and obscurity?  What a
bitter guy - I bet he's about as much fun at a party as a sackful of cats in
heat ("I stood longer in line, but SHE got more prime rib than I did!").  It
always cracks me up to see somebody make a total ass of themselves in the
national media like that, especially when they're oblivious to it.

Waiting for those bones to roll,

<A NAME="276004">Subject: In defense of CREEM (asbestos ready!)</A>

I'd just like to say that CREEM hasn't ALWAYS been a pile of
crap...when it was first started by Barry Cramer (who, btw, was
a good friend of my parents and a pretty cool guy all around) it
was filled with decent music news and interviews with and about
acts that were off the beaten path of top-40 music; it basically
recapatured the "edge" that Rolling Stone began with but had lost
by the time CREEM came around.  After Barry's tragic death (by
excessive inhalation of nitrous oxide, laughing gas), the mag was
defunct for quite some time; when it came back, it was with a
kind of slick "hipness" very similar to the one which had
corrupted Rolling Stone.  Them's the paradoxes of life....

You do have to admit, tho, however wrongheaded and biased the Rush
interview was, it was pretty damn funny....(imho)

Hmmmm.....I don't know about the rest of you fanatics, but I bought the
album to get A Passage to Bangkok (live) and What You're Doing (live).
As you may or may not know, Chronicles is the only place to get these on
CD, so that is the only reason I can think of to buy it. Wow...$12 a song.

<A NAME="276006">Subject: Balls!</A>

Phil, I'm the one who asked about the _HYF_ balls. I get the part about
the balls representing the three members in the band -- that's pretty
clear from the ``Time Stand Still'' video (where the balls `pass through
time' by passing Rush albums) -- and balls are clearly _individual_
balls, but I'm really interested in knowing if there is anything in
_The Fountainhead_ which mentions balls specifically. I understand
that Objectivism is fundamentally individualistic and that the balls
are _individual balls_ but is that really grounds for saying that the
balls were inspired by _The Fountainhead_ or Ayn Rand in any direct
way?

	This is the first time that I've ever had something to contribute
to the digest. This is very exciting. :-)

	Anyway, about 2 or 3 years ago, my brother was on 20/20. It was
a report about spinal cord injuries caused by lap belts. In the report,
there is a shot of my brother driving his car. After they shot the seen
and left, they called to say that the sound had gotten screwed up and
what did Steve want them do dub in. He selected "New World Man", and they
did dub it in.

<A NAME="276008">Subject: Similarities and a Presto Review</A>
<A NAME="276308">From: vinnie@darkside.com (Vindicator)</A>
Date: Fri, 28 Jun 91 00:37:24 PDT

I found the Creen article quite amusing.  I need not say more.  But in
an attempt to find a review of Presto that fit my own opinions I went
searching through my Guitar magazine issues.  And guess what I found?

The following review is taken from the June, 1990 issue of Guitar.
The author is Buzz Morison.

                            PRESTO
                        Rush - Atlantic

PERFORMANCE: Crisply controlled; HOT SPOTS: "Scars," "Superconductor"
and "Hand Over Fist;" BOTTOM LINE: New label, new producer, new clarity

The two-year hiatus from the studio that included last year's live
"Show of Hands" has recitalized Rush's rock inspiration. That break,
along with the band's first label switch in 16 years and the welcoming
of producer Rupert Hine, seems to have lightened the load on the band,
resulting in "Presto", one of the ban's strongest, clearest and most
bracing albums.  Rush's technical brialliance and compositional
extravagance remain intact, but Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart
let their playing flow more freely as it developes intensity along the
way.  The use of dance rythms in "Scars" and the power riffing
"Superconductor" further push the band's progressive envelope, while
Hine's production refinements allow more of the trio's interplay and
virtuoso individual playing to come through with a strutting crispness.
Lee's bass is especially noteable, carrying cuts like the terse "Show
Don't Tell."  Lifeson's guitar is brittle and razor sharp, clanging out
and clinging to rhythms, breaking off snarling accents, and creaking
sparkling solo arcs of wiry electric current on "The Pass" and the
soaring "Hand Over Fist."  Lifeson continues to play against the hard-
rock mainstream, and his bans resolutely restates its own singularity
with "Presto" as well.

                   -   end of article   -

Well I could not have said it better myself.  I agree somewhat with his
best picks for songs.  But I personally believe that Available Light and
Show Don't Tell are the two best on the album, along with Anagram.  But
as you know it is so difficult to choose a favorite :-)

As for the similarities (that's what I call it) between "Message in a
Bottle" and the much more powerful "Red Tide", they appear far from
being stolen material. If you listen to both one is more complex and
involved (Red Tide) and does not last the entire song as the main
melody.  And the two are played on two completely different instruments.
This is like saying that the intro guitar riffs on AC/DC's "Thunderstruck"
and Mr. Big's "Green Tinted Sixties Mind" were stolen from the intro riff
to "The Spirit of Radio".  They aren't!  But they are similar, and I
would like to think that both bands were influenced by Rush in some way.

Well I have wasted too much of your time all.  Remember feel free to
send me mail concerning the fan magazine I am starting, and even letters
and material to be incorperated into the first issue, and remember...

Rush Mgr: Sorry! I sent the post without formatting <80 char. Please
delete that one and post this one instead. Thanks

  Greetings

  	Just a coupla quick things. I'm feeling guilty about
lurking in the reading section of the NMS.

  1) Somebody commented on the similarities of Rush and Queensryche
  and the influence of Rush members on other rockers. It reminded me
  of a record I heard recently by a band called 'Primus'. It was
  called "Suck on This". The record was recorded live and is an ok
  record. Not like Rush at all though. Except the first song on the
  record starts with the bass solo (sortof) of either Xanadu or Cygnus
  X-1 (can't remember). Wonderful!! Anybody here (probably everybody) that
  likes Ged's style, you gotta hear this guy from Primus. Excellent.

  2) The comments about Rush in Rolling Stone etc. Do what I do.
  Ignore these guys. Rush has been putting out quality albums and
  people have been buying them since '73. I have yet to read a
  favorable review of a Rush album in RS. Rush is not gonna be made
  or broken by some guys viewpoints in RS.

  3) As for some person's comments about Rush fans. Ignore them too.

  4) All comments are IMHO so you can ignore me if you like.
