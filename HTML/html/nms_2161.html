I did find out that Rush will be on Rockline on Jan 20th on the Los Angeles
station 93.1. However, I'm almost positive this is a REPEAT -- it is not
listed in the main Rockline lineup as being aired by all radio stations,
and if you know Rockline you'll know that it airs on Monday; the 20th is a
Wednesday. So... I believe the show airing in LA is a repeat, and that it
is not being carried on any other radio station. If you look at what else
93.1 is airing, none of the shows match current guests!

Any other station claiming to have Rush on Rockline this month? The guest 
on the 18th is Johnny Lang.

<A NAME="2161003">Subject: San Antonio Express DS review</A>

I found this article in the Wednesday Dec. 16 S.A. Life section of the
San Antonio Express:

    Rush, "Different Stages" (Atlantic): Rush's latest studio
    effort, "Test For Echo, sounded as if the much-loved Canadian
    trio had finally run out of creative gas.  But this package,
    the band's fourth multiple-disc live set, suggests that Rush
    is still a formidable force in person.

    Unlike the disappointing 1988 set, "A Show of Hands," "Different
    Stages" is a crowd pleaser.  Though the first two discs come
    mostly from the 1997 "Echo" tour dates (there are three cuts
    from the '94 "Counterparts" jaunt), they span the band's career,
    going back to scoop up "2112," "Freewill," and "Spirit of
    Radio."

    And there's a bonus third disc from a 1978 London concert that
    ought to please those who long for the days when the band wore
    platform shoes and when Geddy Lee's shrill voice dealt misery
    to any dogs in the vicinity.  This is a must for fans, and a
    worthy starting point for the curious.  *** 1/2

The *** 1/2 (of 5) beat all the other reviews (Garth Brooks ***, Rolling
Stones ** 3/4, Pearl Jam *** 1/2, Black Sabbath ** 3/4, Aerosmith
*** 1/4), except PJ who tied it (all live albums, BTW).

The front page of the section has a shot of Geddy playing bass, which
is listed as an Express News file photo.  I can scan it in if rush-mgr
or anyone wants me to.

I was on my way home on Friday, Dec. 18.  It was a cool night, much like a
December should be.  I was listening to 93.1 Arrow fm.  It's an excellent
radio station here in L.A.  They play all the classic rock than anyone could
ever think of.  Well, Bob Coburn, the drive time D.J. was playing his top 5
requests of the week.  Of course, as you could imagine - RUSH was in the top
5!!!  Now they didn't play Xanadu, or 2112, or even Entre Nous.  However, they
did play Tom Sawyer.  Now, to get the facts straight - Arrow just began
playing RUSH recently and already RUSH is in the top 5!  They didn't make
position one, they didn't quite cut the second slot and as a matter of fact
they didn't even pull the third spot.  But, my friends -- they did pull fourth
most requested song of the week!  YES - this is excellent! 

I would now like to take the time to ask something from my fellow RUSH fans
and friends, alike.  I would really appreciate to hear more RUSH on the radio
here.  If at all possible in your free time, would you please put in a request
for a rush song @ Arrowfm.com.  It won't take you but a few moments and it
would help all us deprived of RUSH fans here in L.A.  Thank you for your time
and keep listening to the best band in the entire world!

Hey Rush freaks...

Well, thanks for all your comments.  I'm sorry if I pissed anyone off 
(tongue firmly in cheek here) with my RUSH graph from 12/13...nothing 
personal, GuP lovers, it just was the only album that never smacked me 
in that little place in my chest that explodes in butterflies when I 
hear the march from "Natural Science" or the solo from "Red 
Barchetta"...oh well.

To stick my neck out even further, have some fun with THIS: close your 
eyes and imagine you are at your local sports arena or 'concert hall', 
and the opening strains of "2001" or "The Three Stooges" is just 
beginning to fade...here is my all-time ultimate RUSH show.

Countdown (WHO would ever expect THIS??)
Force Ten
Limelight
Freewill
Dreamline
Bravado 
Roll the Bones

(good evening)

Test for Echo
Animate
The Pass
Closer to the Heart
A Farewell to Kings
The Trees
Xanadu
Prelude from 'Hemispheres'-La Villa Strangiato (segue)
Territories
New World Man
Manhattan Project
Red Barchetta
Where's my Thing/The Rhythm Method/YYZ
Spirit of Radio
Medley in "D": Fly by Night/Half the World/Mission
Tom Sawyer

Encore: 2112/In the End/In the Mood

*LOL*. The possibilities are endless, my friends.  I just thought the 
idea of a darkened stage, with lots of smoke and the band bringing in 
"Countdown" in E with the video screen flashing images of Columbia on 
the pad and the voices of Crippen and Young filtering through Alex's 
grunge chords would be really cool.  I need a life, I know.

Hello all:

Now I realize that this is not a political forum, or an adultery forum, or a
manipulation forum, or a deceive the masses forum, or a blatant lie forum, or
a cigar forum, so I will keep this short and semi music-related. Remember our
fearless leader's inauguration (the second one, I believe) - when Fleetwood
Mac, Don Henley and others kept spouting all that rosy rhetoric about the
President? Funny how you don't hear much from them these days. Perhaps they
should get together and plan their own "Down the Tubes" tour. Hey, maybe Alec
Baldwin could open the show. What a prize he is...

<A NAME="2161007">Subject: Force Ten and other oddities</A>

Thank you rush-mgr for making the Japanese "+1" Force Ten available, but
to whomever listened to it, does it seem flatter than the rest of the
album? (flat not in musical terms, but in feeling, zest..compared to other
live versions of force ten we've heard )

not that its not great, but my first impression was that the drums did not
sound as good... (and don;t tell me its because its an mp3, I mp3'ed the
entire DS set and have it on my computer, this makes a great addition
though)

this could be the reason it was never released as part of ther "main"
release here in the US....

just something to think about....

while the drums may be "flat" sounding, I *love* Geddy's bass playing in
it though.

Other stuff.....

I recently revamped the Rush Networking site, and one of the things I
added was a graphic home page....

its Chuck the BSD Daemon walking out of the 2112 star...a "must have" for
any Rush *and* UNIX fans out there.....

One of my favorites, nothing gets me going like something with Bruford
playing.... and I'm not even a drummer.

I see the similarities to "The Drum Also Waltzes" and I'm surprised I
never noticed before....

any more Bruford fans out there? (I've spent my enitre morning listening
to the old Bruford stuff, Jeff Berlin is just so cool....)

Craig and Dan, you are both wrong ;)

but Dan would have been more correct if this guy's CD player couldn;t read
the *first* cd, not the *third*

Craig, not everyone is as computer literate as we are, so give them a
chance to enjoy the music and the art and give him a hand, don;t insult
him.

anyway, to the person trying to get it to work, try the first (yellow) cd

Hey all...

For those of you who don't know about LTE, it's a collaboration between
Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci of Dream Theater, Jordan Ruddess from the
Dixie Dreggs and Tony Levin of King Crimson fame.  The first album was
AWESOME, with it wrapping up with a 28 minute total improvisational jam.
Well, if you don't already know, the second LTE album is almost finished!
I'm including a link for a site that has pics from the LTE II sessions.  

http://www.mediusvision.com/music/lte2

The guys DO plan on touring behind the album this time around, so hopefully
they'll come to the Milwaukee area, knowing that when DT comes here, they
ALWAYS sell out within an hour of tickets going on sale.

Well, just wanted to update all of you DT/LTE fans :-)

Cheers!

	Hey everybody!
	Just wanted to let everyone in on the truth about the guy yelling
very clearly "That's OK Alex...shake it off!" during "Driven" on DS.  It
is none other than.......ME!  Yup, I was very shy to admit it until now,
but I figure enough time has passed to finally admit.  But then
again.....I very well possibly am talking out of my @$$-hole :-)
	But seriously...if you are in Mid-Missouri and see a Dodge Shadow
with license plates "YYZ-T4E", that is me!  Also I am going home to
Omaha, Nebraska fro Christmas, so if you see those plates in Omaha or
along I-29...it is yours truly.  Rush-mgr...I was wondering how I could
send in a picture of the plates to the syrinx.yyz.com website?  I sent
email to the site administrator, but haven't heard back.

I happened to be flipping through the channels when I came upon something on
VH1 that caught my attention.  Turns out it was an episode of "Before They
Were Stars."

Ed Roland of Collective Soul (a band I've been high on for the last couple
years) fame was being interviewed several years ago.  Ed mentioned that he
came up with the name "Collective Soul" after having been exposed to Ayn
Rand's readings.  Any feedback on whether or not Collective Soul are Rush
fans?

By the way, Ed's appearance was likened to the style of the (primarily) 80s
band, A Flock of Seagulls.  He's certainly come a long way.  Ouch.

On the "DS" front, I'm still listening!  I still get a big smile cross my face
as Geddy introduces the song "Xanadu" with Neil playing wind chimes in the
background, as the song receives an unbelievable reception.  A great semi-
musical moment, it is.

Hope everyone who didn't (or did) yet order "DS" has gone to
http://www.800.com to pick it up along with two other current release titles
for $1 (including S&H).  Great deal.

Later.

Just this past Saturday night my husband, George, and I were coming back
from dinner (awesome awesome ribs in Brookfield, IL), and we were
pulling into the parking lot of our favorite bar.  We had the Loop 97.9
on and they had just finished playing a really decent tune, which I
cannot for the life of me recall at this time, but the next song they
played was Stairway to Heaven.  George and I looked at one another and
in unison shouted, "SHOOT ME!"  Then we high fived and laughed our asses
off walking into the bar.

<A NAME="2161017">Subject: Barchetta, Rockline, Autographs, and the Heat!</A>

Hey Rushians,

Just trying to catch up.

Jerry (RushF1@aol.com) gave us some info on Ferrari's Barchetta.  I have
some updated info, too.  According to Sports Car Market Magazine Ferrari
only produced 25 of the 166 MM Barchetta from 1948 to 1950.  This car
ranges form $1,100,000 to $1,600,000.  Then Ferrari produce seven 212
Touring Barchettas from 1951 to 1952.  They range from $800,000 to
$1,000,000.  Sorry.  I am a bit of an exotic car fan.

A question regarding one of the museums he mentioned.  Is the Peterson
Automotive Museum in LA on Wilshire Blvd at the start of the Miracle
Mile?

Does anyone in the Detroit area know if Rockline will air on January
20?  Will it be on the Riff?

Erik DePoy posted about a friend that bought an autographed copy of GUP
through eBay.com.  I have a friend that owns a sport memorabilia store. 
(For folks in the Detroit area, it's DC Sports on 14 and Van Dyke and at
Lakeside Mall, check 'em out, lots of Wings stuff!)  He knows it's hard
to trust anyone.  If you can trust the source or the item is
authenticated (example: picture of individual signing the item), then
it's probably safe.  He suggests though waiting until you can meet the
person face to face.  He runs a lot of shows that bring the athletes in
to sign autographs.  That way too, it makes the autograph mean a whole
lot more.

I would like to second the motion put forth by Keith Hurst.  We have had
a lot of people wondering around TNMS lately thinking they were in a Ray
Bradbury novel.  Take a pill, Montag.

Flame retardently yours (hopefully),

Scott Fab....

OK everyone I know this is lame but I didn't make this one up....

My sister just had a bouncing baby boy. So I get on the phone with her
husband, another Rush nut, and he says to me "He's destined to love
Rush." After asking why he states "Well he was born on the 21st day of
the 12th month. That's 2112."

Greetings Everyone,
    We just wanted to wish you all a happy and safe holiday season. As a band
we are going to have our second birthday in late January and we really wanted
to say Thanks for all the support and friendship. During the past two years we
have made alot of new friends and got the chance to see alot of old ones.
     It means alot for us when people take the time to support our live
performances. We have had all kinds of help in various projects such as, Wep
page design, Programing, photography, advice, construction on our studio and
video production.            This year has been intense for us and we have
been caught up in various projects and we do appreciate everyones help. The
next year for us should be the real test and we hope to open some new doors
and become more of an all original project.
     So, for all of us at Second Nature. Merry Christmas and we wish you and
your families the best.

<A NAME="2161023">Subject: Different Stages Japanese Import</A>

Here is a review of Different Stages Japanese impoort:

RUSH - Different Stages Live (+1)

The 3 compact disc set looks exactly like the U.S. release.  Tinker toy
montage on a white back ground.  On one side it has in ‘RUSH - Different
Stages / Live' and on the other side same thing but in Japanese.  On the
back everything is the same, except for the addition of ‘Force Ten' (bonus
track on 2nd disc) and the first disc is not enhanced.  The compact disc
comes in a plastic sleeve with a liner mainly in Japanese, the song list is
in English.

1. Force Ten (bonus track) - Recorded at the Riverbend Amphitheater, in
Cincinnati, Ohio, June 4, 1997, during the Test for Echo Tour.  This song
rocks like every song on this compact disc set.  The guitars are crisp and
rocking, the drums are great and the vocals are very clear.  This song
flows beautifully between Natural Science and The Spirit of Radio.  In my
opinion, this song should had been included in the U.S. release.

2. Test for Echo Tour Book (miniature version) - This is an exact version
of the tour book sold at the shows.  The only difference is that it is 2.5
times smaller than the original.

3. A Farewell to Kings Tour Book (miniature version) - This is an exact
version of the tour book sold at the AFTK shows in Europe only.  Album
cover on front of tour book on purple background with this inscription:
			RUSH
		      World Tour 77-78
		Exclusive Concert Edition
Black back cover with man in red star and RUSH (white) center bottom.  The
book is in black and white with 16 photographs of the band.  U.K. Winter
Tour 1978 schedule list (February 1978), credits, ‘A Condensed RUSH
Primer', words by Neil Peart, advertisement for a new album for a band
called ‘TYLA GANG' (I have no idea why this is here?), and a discography
for RUSH (from the albums ‘RUSH' to ‘A Farewell to Kings').  This tour book
is also 2.5 times smaller than the original (This is assumed, since I do
not own an original copy).

4. Black and white lyric booklet (in English and Japanese) - There is a
set-list for each compact disc.  There seems to be a few words about the
band in Japanese.  Lyrics for every song is included (even for songs on the
third disc), both in English and Japanese.

5.  Every disc has a grey background and not black, like the U.S. release.
Each disc comes in a lint free pouch.  This should had been also used in
the U.S. release

I saw Dream Theater perform at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, on
December 28.  The show was a collection of B-sides, lesser known album
tracks, and covers.  Sure enough, DT made sure they included Rush in their
set.  They played "Different Strings" note per note and then a brief
instrumental interlude where the song normally fades out; after playing
the first riff from "The Analog Kid," the band concluded this Rush tribute
with parts of "La Villa Strangiato."  Let me tell you: all of it was great
due to the intensity of the playing (particularly John Petrucci).  It was
definitely one of the highlights of the show for me and others who were
there.

<A NAME="2161030">Subject: Fastest Guitarist/Rush sighting</A>

Well, I would have to say that all of the faster  guitar players 
have been mentioned and I would say for the sake of how clean
and what kind of pickups he uses, that Yngwie Malmsteen
is probably one of the faster players. Single coil pickups are 
harder, along with a scalloped fretboard, to sustain a note on. 
In Yngwie's own words using humbuckers is cheating. I am 
not saying he is far superior than anyone. Every guitar player
mentioned is a great player. Just listen and  decide for yourself 
who is the fastest. Seeing Yngwie live and watching him do his solos,
which he does a lot of, and his lead guitar work is simply amazing. I
know I should probably brag about Yngwie on another mailing list.
Who you prefer and like best is up to you. I know I'll get flamed on the
 technical aspect and here how such n' such is better, but it comes with
the turf as far as anyone ever giving Yngwie credit for anything that is.
	
I guess I better write something about Rush, as this is a Rush mailing list.
Back awhile ago I was listening to 96rock here in Atlanta and I heard Tom Sawyer
and I am thinking cool, cause it's Rush n' all. So the song ends and the
DJ, Christopher
Rude comes on and he says something like, " that was Rush, with Tom Sawyer,
a great song 
that's been around a long time. Now imagine that you were a promoter and
you had to bring Rush into the
90's with that song. What would you do? Well it would sound something like
this.." and then he played the
complete Tom Sawyer remix from Small Soldiers. The extent of what he said
before he played the remix 
I can't quite remember, so what I wrote probably was just the jist of what
he said. I thought the remix and
the remarks made by Christopher Rude were pretty cool. I also heard from my
friend that 96rock rebroadcast the
DS premier a few days before Christmas, which I missed, but it shows that
Rush is getting some respect 
around here. I just feel sorry for those who aren't as lucky to hear Rush
on the radio, though I admit 96rock does tend 
to play the radio tunes I guess you could say. Alright enough from me, hope
I might have enlighted someone.

It's clear that the snare sound is different on The Trees.  This is because
Neil played it on the electronic kit in back, but I don't think the snare
needs to be tightened up.  Actually the back snare, I find, is tighter and
louder than the other drums--certainly more so than the snare on the front
kit.  I remember noticing it during Red Sector A in concert too, but at
least in that song the snare sound sits better with the other electronic
drum sounds IMO.  Although I personally am dissatisfied with the drum sound
on TFE and DS I don't think there's any reason to fire Larry Allen; Neil
ultimately makes the sound decision and would change it if he thought it
sounded terrible.

<A NAME="2161041">Subject: Rush fans and Mac users</A>

I've noticed a fair amount of Mac computer bashing on the NMS recently
and I always wanted to respond, but avoided doing so because I knew it
would turn into a lame flame war that had nothing to do with Rush.

(although let me state that I own a Mac, and work with 7 Macs from various
eras in an academic/research setting, and they never crash, 'cept when
we use Microsoft applications - the truth, I swear. Plus the G3 and G4
are the best processors for the money)

Instead, however, after reading a recent issue of MacWorld (or was it
MacHome) I realized how many parallels there are between Rush fans and Mac
fans.  So much that I'm now puzzled by the Mac bashing.

First both groups are a loyal minority who have to deal with a
commercially oriented majority.  To illustrate, Rush rarely gets any
airplay, is not seen at all on MTV, and doesn't get cover stories or big
interviews or good ratings in any magazines.
Similarly, the Mac gets terrible representation in computer stores and
mainstream media, and until recently, you would almost never see any TV
commercials for Apple products.

In spite of this, fans of both remain loyal, even fanatical about them.

Rush fans (esp on the NMS) like to point out Rush sightings such as
bumperstickers, license plates, commercials, magazine ads, or fellow Rush
fans wearing a Rush t-shirt.  
Similarly, Mac fans love to see people with Apple decals on their car (I
have 2) or Think Different t-shirts.

Also, fans of both groups know that even though their band (or computer) 
of choice isn't accepted by the world as the best, deep in their hearts
they know that Rush (or the Mac) really is.  
Rush fans lament crap like Hootie or Alanis selling millions of records
while the much better band (and deserving of much more attention and
respect)  Rush just goes gold. Mac fans lament that crappy Wintel machines
sell like hotcakes while the superior computer struggles to stay in
business.

When some idiot tells a Rush fan that Rush sucks, after the first
reaction to punch him in the face is held back, the typical Rush fan
usually does his civic duty and "educates" this unenlightened person to
all the merits of the band - sometimes followed up by the giving of a
good Rush mix tape so that this person can hear the glory of Rush. Mac
fans feel and do the same - and may also follow up by demonstrating the
Mac OS.

Rush fans feel that the "average person" who stocks their CD collections
with Mariah Carey and Celine Dion is just a sheep buying whatever the mass
market and the media tells them what is good.  Similarly, mac users feel
that the main reason most households have PC's rather than Macs is because
they too are sheep buying what everybody else buys without giving it much
thought.  (I'm not ignoring the fact that over the last few years, Macs
have cost alot more than their PC counterparts, but hey, sometimes you
choose to pay more for something built and designed with care and
integrity, plus the iMac is changing all that now (in terms of cost, not 
integrity - heh)).

Perhaps the only difference I can identify between Rush fans and Mac
users are that Rush fans seem content that Rush is not a mainstream
success and are happy with their best kept secret band.  Mac fans would
probably be happier if Wintel machines disappeared entirely and the whole
world used the Mac OS and G3 processors.
I think the primary reason for such a difference is that Rush fans know
that Rush can keep making quality music and providing us with hours of
listening enjoyment regardless of how many units they sell, whereas Mac
uers know that if the Mac doesn't stay afloat in the market, Apple could
go under and we'd lose software support and would have to switch over
eventually.

One likes to believe in the freedom of operating systems?

Comments are welcome, but please don't respond if all you have to say is
"Macs suck"

Has anyone else noticed these parallels before?
