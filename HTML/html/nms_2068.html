BTW, if any of you plan on sending in some more flames about why we didn't
put this up on the web, please stop and think about it for a minute.  Yes,
we did know about Neil's most recent tragedy.  Yes, his wife, sadly is no
longer alive.  Yes, we did know about the news about 2 days after it happened.
And yes, we decided not to put it out.  It is news, but it is also Neil's
privacy.  How about a little respect for that?  Now that there has been 
official confirmation I suppose we can put it up.  The whole idea is kinda 
bizzare and to be flamed about it is rather absurb.  "Hey, you guys are 
assholes, you didn't put up anything about Neil's wife."   Uh..yeah, okay, 
I'm getting flamed now because I didn't put up a huge announcement about a 
person's wife dying.  I mean really, how would you like the world to know 
through a website that your wife is dead?  Talk about flaming for a stupid 
reason.   Yes, Neil's wife is dead, I think we can all understand what he's 
going through, so how about some breathing room here.  We'll put up the stuff 
when we get around to it.  Not like I really enjoy putting up that sort of
bad news anyways.  'nuff said.

On another note, the live album release date has been pushed back to 
October 6th (the artwork is taking longer than expected). Although (to me) 
right now that seems so immaterial...

<A NAME="2068002">Subject: Elephants rear-ends and Rush</A>

Much to my dissappointment, I've now heard from two
inside sources (fellow NMSers) that the giant close-up
of the elephant's rump is indeed included in the CD liner
photos of Roll the Bones and is not exclusive to the vinyl
copy (my only source for the music therein.)
And to think, lo these many years since it's 1991 release,
I had imagined I was party to some inside exclusive joke
aimed at the UK and their vinyl pressing operators.
It's going to take awhile to get over this... so in the
meantime - does anyone have any insights into the deep
meaning (any hidden or perhaps obvious correlations)
between:

    A. Rush and elephant's rear-end
    B. The phrase "roll the bones" and said elephants rump
    C. Aforementioned elephant's butt and little slacker
          kid kicking skull
    D. Any other theories

Until I can overcome my dejectedness over the whole
matter (I haven't slept in five whole hours), maybe any
responses you may have can mitigate my hurting.

TO:  TNMS  MGR.
I apologize for long list, but I'm looking for e-mail response and start
private corresp.

Get ready to laugh at some of these selections in threads:

PLEASE E-MAIL THE FLAMES TO ME, I NEED SOMETHING TO DO AT MY JOB WHEN
WAITING FOR NEWSLETTER(rushfan.2112@juno.com)BE GENTLE, I WAS HONEST

My fav. non-RUSH bands

2)  FISH/MARILLION
3)  GORDON LIGHTFOOT  "I love how he says Detroit in TWOTEF--"Detroy-et
parade"
3)  SPRINGSTEEN
4)  NEIL DIAMOND  (Only cuz I listened to him growing up and I know his
songs by heart, along with RUSH of course)
5)  THE CARS
6)  VAN HALEN (from Diver Down thru OU812 mainly)  (new VH stinks!!!)
7)  OZZY (Blizzard of Ozz, No More Tears, Ozzmosis, Ozman Cometh--when he
will stop being "clever" with his name?)
8)  TRIUMPH/QUEENSRYCHE (Triumph--three songs a lot) (Empire

5)The Body Electric, Red Lenses (Bet. Wheels use to be skipped, but I
love the synth chorus)

album)
7)Show Don't Tell, Scars, Hand Over Fist (only because rest of album is
great too)	
8)Most of Counterparts, it would have been better, but I admit I like
keyboards as background.
9)Time and Motion is a hard listening song.
**before the flames come, let me justify myself, I really enjoy Geddy's
melodies, sometimes his vocals are more whiny like "Stick it Out" and
"The Speed of Love."

Sorry, I know I must have made enemies, but I have to admit, I have a
boring job, and I read e-mails to pass the time.

FAV. RAD.SHOW:  Mitch Albom show, "The Dog" Damon Perry, Dave Newman
(only for movie/history quiz)	I don't like DR.LAURA, but man it's
contagious.

FAV. ENDING TO SONG:  Carve Away the Stone, Available Light, Prime Mover,
Red Barchetta (live now, Geddy pounding the bass)

     Copied right off my homepage, here are my fav bands:

I am a music fan, my very favorite band being
Rush, then, in no particular order: Victor, the Smashing Pumpkins, 
Everclear, Goldfinger, the Deftones, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Cherry 
Poppin' Daddies, MxPx, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Blink 182, Black Lab, 
Matchbox 20, Nine Inch Nails, Stabbing Westward, the Clash, the Cure, 
the Ramones... 

     Umm, some recent ones since I made the page, Local H, white town, 
harvey dangers, Nerf Hearder.... Local band, they're the coolest, Jedi 
Heardmen.....  

     My local station, the only one that would consider playing rush 
that is, is WQWK, Quick Rock. For a lack of like for most other classic 
rock bands,  I listen to WGMR, the local modern rock/alternative 
station, and my rush CD's when I want to hear that.... There was the one 
time I called WQWK to request some Rush, and they told be they played a 
Rush tune not 15 minutes ago and regretted to inform me that I should 
wait a while they'd play it later.... sure enough after an hour or two I 
heard Passage to Bangkok. I was pleased as punch!!

     Fav TV shows, well, I don't watch tv much anymore, but when I do 
it's usually X files or Blue's Clues... (so sue me. i think steve is 
cute)   When I used to watch TV, I always watched Who's Line Is It 
Anyway?  The Kids In the Hall, Monty Python (ANYTHING) Simpsons, MST3K 
(only joel episodes, though... he was funnier) ANY stand up comedy 
show..... I do watch South Park, too... (mostly taped episodes whenever 
I have time)

     And finally, a woman that is into Rush is looking for someone with 
similar tastes... I think you know plenty about me from this e-mail to 
make your own judgement. I personally am only 15. A well proclaimed, 15 
year old FEMALE rush fan, I am a pretty rare sort of person, one of only 
23% if the statistics are correct and probably the only one that is a 
member of TNMS.... E-mail me if you're a teen guy, similar 
interests....... (sorry, rush mgr, i realize this isn't a meeting 
place.... so i'm lonely! Big deal!) Pennsylvania area a plus, especially 
if you're near State College/Altoona....

              Later all!

<A NAME="2068006">Subject: Recording of Drum Clinic</A>

There was a post a few days ago re a recording of the drum clinic Peart did
back during/after the PoW tour.

I had the good fortune to attend the clinic, held in a hotel ballroom in
Fort Wayne, Indiana and sponsored by the Percussion Center.

I had gotten on the PC's mailing list by inquiring about their Vibra-Fibing
technique, mentioned in some of Rush's tour programs.  Thus, they sent me
an invitation to the clinic.  It wasn't cheap -- $60/65 if I remember.

Anyway, there were about 75-100 folks there, sitting in chairs ogling at
the drum set on the riser while waiting for Peart to appear.  Many brought
tape players to record the session, and there was some question as to
whether the organizers would allow taping or not.  I believe they did allow
it, but I can't be sure.

After a short delay, Peart walked in from a side door to polite applause
and a few hoots.  He mentioned that he was kind of embarrassed as he had
not done too much of this type of thing.  He answered a few questions and
then walked behind the set.  He talked about some sections of songs, then
played them.  Some I remember are the end of Limelight, and lots off of
PoW.

He was asked to do a solo and he hemmed and hawed then declined.  Something
about being embarrassed.

Now, after each time he played a few bars, everyone would hoot and holler
 - very uncomfortable, as this was supposed to be a clinic.

There was a lunch break and some guys hung around the drums.  Larry Allen
was standing guard and he was grumpy.  One person, marveling at the
rotating riser, bent over to look underneath and try to see the mechanics. 
Allen said "don't look under there.  You don't need to be looking under
there!"  Touchy guy.

After lunch -- Neil did not eat with the crowd -- more questions and more
playing.  One guy asked if Neil had been driving the red Porsche, parked in
back of the hotel.  Neil sheepishly said, "yes," and something like,
"thanks for blowing my cover."

I asked him something like "on tour, why do you guys use so many sequenced
sounds on the Power Windows songs?"  He was very defensive and said they
play all the music and only some keyboards were sequenced.  Whatever.

Well, that's it.  Perhaps someone did tape the clinic.  I'd sure like to
have a copy for reference.  Anyone else there?

Oh yeah, about a week later, the PC sent me an autographed b/w picture on
parchment paper of a close-up of Neil.  It said "All the best in life and
music, Neil Peart."  That was a nice touch by Neil and the Percussion
Center.

Later.

With all this talk about a new live album and one(or possible two!) of their
songs being on a soundtrack finally, I decided to come out of my eight month
hibernation and write a post to the NMS.  First off, favorite bands?

Rush
Metallica(everything.  Not just old, not just new)
Ramones
Ozzy
Black Sabbath
Dave Matthews Band
U2
Live
AC/DC
Van Halen

On another note, the fact that Rush is in the mainstream somewhat with their
songs on a soundtrack pleases me, doesn't offend me.  I love that Rush is
getting a little credit(not as much as they deserve though).  How about this
for a thread?  I'm a seventeen year old drummer and I was wondering what all
you musicians favorite Rush songs to play are?  My favorite drum part of Rush
to play is Test For Echo(especially the double bass part) followed closely by
Red Barchetta and Tom Sawyer, they are so tight and have so much energy!!!

That's all for now.

Myself, probably average 3 times a month since my Rush discovery in

There is only one Rush song that I skip, and that is Rivendell.  True, I never
listen to the last half of RtB or AFtK, but that's not really skipping, it's
just turning the CD off at an opportune time.

Subject B-MAN
I met him years ago at a book signing (#149 out of 10,000 of the second 
edition), I told him that I tried to get all the info that could and I had 
bought most of the rock mags on the band he told me that most of it was wrong 
and that in his book was the (DON'T QUOTE ME) what the band was really like. 
I have to ask myself why DID he play the songs on the radio without their 
permission if he knew them that well, to betray their trust. It just doesn't 
seem right to me. It shows me the kind of person he can be. So let him F**king 
flame because as far as I am concerned he is the A**hole. Sorry rush-mgr, I'll 
get off my soap box now and just lurk.

Sorry for the non Rush content, but someone asked,

>I understand that Ted Nugent has a talk show, could someone who
>listens to it please give me a review?  If it's available via
>RealAudio, that'd be even better!  Thanks in advance.

Ted can be heard on 102.7 The Bear in the Detroit area.  As for a 
review? Well he has 3 agendas.  Guns, Guns and Guns.  As long as 
you're a 'card carrying member of the NRA'  I'm sure you'd like his 
show.  

As well as the above 3 topics he is VERY critical of the US 
goverment I have heard him say the IRS is illegal, and asked what 
'we' should do with illegal organizations (blow up gov't buildings 
maybe?)

The last straw was when he started continually bashing Canada and 
Canadians over our gun laws, among other things. Well, I happen to be 
proud to be Canadian (Hmm I wonder where Rush originated from?) and 
certainly take exception to his views.  After that, I stopped 
listening and friends of mine who used to listen wondered why it took 
so long for me to stop.

Unfortunately Ted doesn't call any other musicians and talk about 
life on the road 'yada, yada, yada'.  He has a polital mindset on 
arming the whole country and actively encourages everyone to "lock 
and load".  If you agree with that, then you might like the show!

p.s. I have e-mailed him expressing my views with no response.

AHHH......I was waiting for this, some of my best memories of RUSH .......  
at the end of a song (title forgotten) Ged walks up to the microphone ( the 
place is standing in applause) and say's "THIS IS THE SPIRIT OF RADIO". You 
have to remember that RUSH has never been a band to get alot of air play, so 
all of you new listeners to RUSH have got to realize just because you don't 
hear them on the radio DOESN'T mean nobody will show up at their shows. 
Another is the intro to the TRILOGY of FEAR and of the infamous " We'd like 
to take you back to our first album, this is called WORKING MAN". The best 
time spent was an EVENING WITH RUSH.

Hey all

Just thought I'd let you know about a Rush "tribute" band formed over
here in the UK.
They are called Skeleton Crew & I have a few mp3 they have done. They
also do some Hendrix (Hey Joe), Muddy Waters, Sabbath.

OK so not strictly a tribute band, but its the nearest thing we've had
to Rush in the UK since the RTB tour in 92. Rock on Sheffield Arena!

If there's one of these Rush/Skeleton Crew mp3's you want its the La
Villa Strangiato part the bassist puts into his solo.

Anyone, heard the rumour about the new live album?

Every now again we have the 'other bands I listen to' thread. I think
it's a good thread, as it has made me aware of other bands to listen out
for. I'm thankful to the NMS and it's members as I now listen to some
fantastic music I would otherwise possibly not know about. Who do I
listen to now?

Spock's Beard, The Tragically Hip, Better Than Ezra, Kings X,
Soundgarden, Midnight Oil, DaDa, Live. Interspersed with Stone Temple
Pilots, Pink Floyd, Marillion, Genesis, Joe Satriani, Dodgy, etc etc
etc...

Fave Lerxst solo? Hmm, so many. The middle one in Shut Up Shuttin Up on
Victor is way cool. Between The Wheels is quintessential Lerxst.
Different Strings I can imagine Alex just playing and playing and...the
recording is way too short.

Fave TV shows is difficult as I don't watch much. Recently, it's been
the World Cup, though interest has wained greatly since Tuesday
night...sniff.

South Park and the Simpsons make me chuckle. Red Dwarf is classic (are
they still making the movie??). Anything with Samantha Janus
in...(woof!).

That's a wrap!

PS. I heard from Puanani the other day - she's now a Displaced Hawaiian
living in Phoenix...

Just chirping in as someone else who really likes Speed of Love. Not

I really like the line "sometimes it takes all your strength just to 
keep holding on" - Ged sounds like he really means it!! Also like the 
middle section "We don't have to touch...." e.t.c.

Ghost of chance is pretty decent too. You can't really argue with the

<A NAME="2068021">Subject: A note about remasters....</A>

There has been a few questions on the thread reguarding the remastering of
CD's that were digitally recorded and mixed in the first place (ie, Signals,
p/g, PwrWindows, HYF & ASoH).  When 'digitally' remastering these albums,
the 'digital' aspect is not what is the point.  Analog recordings do not
sound better if they are turned to 'digital' recordings.  Digital recordings
are generally better when it comes to RETAINING the fidelity, but not in
CREATING the fidelity.  Remastering is the key.  Most of the digital albums
were mastered with the most popular media at the time in mind (ie vinyl or
cassettes).  So, when remastering, they are able to leave the frequencies
that are available in current media types with better frequency response (ie
Compact Discs, Mini Discs, & DigiLog Cassettes). These albums generally
sound better than the originals on Hi-end systems since these systems are
capable of handling a better frequency responce.

I hope this clears up some of the questions of 'what do they do when they
remaster an album?'  Any other questions can be sent to me directly by
sending mailto:ylmail@in.net.

Later!

<A NAME="2068022">Subject: Fave Lerxt Solos</A>

I'm a guitarist, so I was thrilled to see this thread!

Here we go:

1. Kid Gloves-- what was going on inside Alex when he cut this? 
Highly rhythmic and melodically loopy, and a real chopsfest to boot.
2. Red Barchetta--Nice, slightly overdriven tone and wonderful 
melodic phrasing that includes a fair amount of motific displacement 
in the middle. Lerxt really makes the 7/8                           
time signature flow.
3. YYZ--I like the use of altered scale tones that gives this one a 
distinct Moroccan flavor. Fluid as hell.
4. Turn the Page--A brilliant example of the Alex Lifeson Cross Your 
Eyes and Go For It approach. Wild Abandon/ Extreme Precision.
5. Cut to the Chase--Touring with Eric Johnson undoubtedly inspired 
elements of this, such as the ultra-fast-and-fluid hornlike 
pentatonic run that opens this little excursion.     Nice use of the 
whammy bar in the last phrase.
6. Emotion Detector-- Just listen to how attractive Alex's phrasing 
is on this one, and how he uses his whammy bar to create voice-like 
slurring on the parts where he uses the                               
 notes sparingly. His alternating use of wide intervals and scalar 
ideas is just beautiful.
7. In the End-- I learned this solo when I was a kid, and have always 
liked its simplicity and bluesiness, even though there aren't really 
any blues licks in it.
8. The Pass--Alex has such a rep as a guy with a lot of chops, that 
it knocks me out when he throws me a curveball like this.  It's so 
incredibly simple, you'd swear it's                   someone else, 
but so elegant you know otherwise.Those last few quarter notes that 
climb to that last shimmering sustain......tingle.
9. Shut Up Shuttin' Up-- I blew ginger ale out my nose the first time 
I heard this. I like the jokey vocal asides by Charlene and her 
friend. The solo is pure corrosion and                                
    sourball attitude.
10. Presto-- Another example of how this man can make his guitar SING.
 Lyrical and expressive, and very relaxed.

By the way, are there any Nils Lofgren fans out there?

Nice talking to you all!!
Matt

Good Day,

  Sorry the first post was lacking in information about the book.  I
don't want to ruin it for anyone else, but the book is broken up into 7
sections that the author has grouped various songs into.  From the
introduction, I believe that the author (Carol Price) is indeed a fan.
Surprisingly, there is a discography that includes BOOTLEGS!  I would
think that mind have been a bad idea, but I didn't write the book.

  Basically, the book is the authors' interpretations of various songs
and is just that.  They don't want these to BE what the song is about,
but they want to shed some light on some of the songs that might have
gone unnoticed (not by any NMS'er!).

  When I have more read, I'll update y'all some more.

Take Care,

<A NAME="2068024">Subject: Top 10 skippable rush songs</A>

Well now that I have some "cover" from William Cary Hall and Jessica Winkworth,
I'll add MHO on those songs on the list which I love:

1)  Neurotica
Roll the Bones is a great album and although, this isn't the best song on the
album, it holds up for me quite well over time - especially the chorus and the
ending.

6)  Everyday Glory
This song rocks - end of story.  Totally inspirational and yet another great
closer in Rush's intentional traditions of sending you off with something to
think about within the confines of a great song ... "everybody's got to deviate
from the norm...")

8)  Speed of Love
The marriage of the subject-matter and the musical mood are perfect. (Jessica
you are not alone.)

10) Ghost of a Chance
Same comment as "Speed of Love" - perfect. Lerxst at the top of his game as well
and Neil Peart showing great restraint.

By the way, totally agree with "I Think I'm Going Bald" (sorry Jessica) and
"Virtuality" (horrible lyrics - you'd think Neil Peart could handle this topic
with a little more subtlty)

	Hi everybody, out of lurker mode...

	I have a question which some some more technologically
knowledgable NMSers may be able to help me with.  I recently began to
listen on a regular basis the world radio premiere of T4E.  What struck me
is how different Time & Motion sounds on my tape when I listen to it on my
walkman compared to when I listen to the CD.

	The version on the tape seems to be palying just a *bit* faster
than when I listen to it on the CD (all the other songs on the tape sound
nornal, so I'm assuming there is no problem with either my tape or the
walkman).  I find this situation distressing, because when I listen to T&M
on the walkman it's great, while on the CD player it seems to lack some punch.
Is my imagination playing tricks on me?  Or might there be a technological
explanation for this?

	If anybody has any ideas on this, please either post your ideas on
the NMS or e-mail me privately.

	Many Thanks

Hello Once Again Fellow Rush Fans,

It's been a while since I've posted,. Just for the record the  war between
my self and Grand Designs, has been resolved into a friendship, and a good
one at that. My Ftp site supports his screen saver files, and indeed I now
consider him a good friend.

I have put together a new Screen Saver "Rush 98" 

It's a beta, but not because of bugs, but because I have not listed any
credits on it as of yet,  It will be some time before I can do that, it may
end up as "Rush 99" since my duties at my real job keep me from completion.
The heart of the matter is there.

I have no doubt that this is the quintessential Rush Screen Saver, and best
of all it's free, my way of saying thanks to the best band that ever existed.

You can find it at http://www.r-u-s-h.com http://www.rushtastic.com or

Am I the only person on this list who loves every song Rush have ever
done...Roll the Bones is excellent ( IMHO ) and I think the song You Bet Your
Life is one of the best songs the band have ever written...That goes the same
for Everyday Glory and I Think I'm Going Bald.  I mean how can you hate
Everyday Glory, it's amazing... wonderfull lyrics, great bass line, beautiful
vocal harmony, awesome guitar part and terrific drums. From the first time I
heard this song on the network world album premiere of Counterparts I knew it
would remain a favorite for many years. There are some songs from Rush I like
a little more that others....Ex: Natural Science, Bravado, The Pass, You Bet
Your Life, Everyday Glory, Cut to the Chase, Hemispheres, Before And After,
and Nuerotica, just to name a few, but I love every song...Every live
version...too cut to the chase ( haha ) everything Rush. Maybe you all think
I'm an 18 year old weirdo, and maybe I am...I love Rush, they have always been
my favorite and will always remain my favorite.
A few more quick things...
 1. In regards to Mr. Banasiewicz, during you're ramblings you lost a lot of
"friends",
I mean sure we don't know you personally, but I think that at least a few of
us really looked up too you...I myself own three copies of "visions". You just
keep spoiling one good thing after another, you should learn. Also, you told
us too love everything Rush have ever done and ever do, I do, but apparently
you don't. I would like to quote a couple of things from "Visions"
breifly...#1: (From page 12 in regards too the Rush, Rush album) "There are
only two duds on the record." #2: (From page 74 in regards tooa Signals show"
"They asked me what I thought, I said 'Don't ask me because I'll tell you". So
next time you want to trash us all, you hippocrate, Shove your "high and
mighty - toilet man" foot up your a**
  2. Has anyone noticed the production error on 'In the Mood' from Rush. and 
  3. To add to my own thread, I just want to point out that the guitar solo in
"Chain Lightning" is excellent

   Thank you, and you all have a great day...Rob "The Snowdog"

This qualifies as my 'Top 1 skippable TNMS posting'.  But seriously, NO RUSH
SONG IS SKIPPABLE!  If the band didn't skip it, why should you?  Maybe there
is something in these songs that you are missing by not listening to them!
Don't write off these songs after the hard work that Rush put in to create
them.  Also, not to complain but I think many of us joined the list to talk
about the things we love about Rush, not the things about them that we would
rather skip.

How about the latest Yes album 'Open Your Eyes'.  I can't stop listening to
it!  Highly recommended, especially the title track and it's even available
in Surround Sound.  I hope Rush releases their next live effort in Surround
Sound.  'Mirrors' seemed to take advantage of the rear speakers in Dolby
Pro-Logic mode so maybe this will happen.  Maybe even a DVD release in Dolby

So, I just heard Neil's wife has died. I assume this is not erroneous
information. That's terrible, losing his daughter, then his wife. I
feel so awful for him. Sometimes I get this feeling that he's had the
shorter end of the stick of the 3 guys...not as comfortable w/fame,
for example. People always criticizing him for being "rude."
Ultimately Neil's an amazing drummer & awesome lyricist. I will always
admire & respect him for that.
So...they're "quitting." I know everyone on the NMS has been at it
tooth & nail on this subject. It's hard to watch something you love
just fade away. Rush is my favorite band overall & has been for a
fairly short time (2 yrs.) but they've been very concentrated years!
I've only ever seen them play twice, & maybe never will again. But
let's face facts...they've been in the biz for 24 years now, putting
out 16 studio albums, plus live albums, boots, remasterings,
collections...they've toured the world & made gobs of dough & made
generations of people happy. Yeah, theoretically, they could keep
going... I know I'll be criticized for saying this, but their more
recent albums just weren't, you know, the SAME. I'm not saying they
weren't good, they were, but Tom Sawyer & 2112 & all those from about
'76-'81 will always be more remembered & loved. They're classics. That
WAS Rush, so to speak. Let's just all be thankful we live in the
90s...we have CD players & VCRs & such. Even 100 years from now people
can still listen to Rush & watch their concerts even w/them (& perhaps
us) cold in the ground. Rush may quit but they will not die.

I don't know if anyone has posted this yet.  I just saw a preview to the
Small Soldiers coming out soon and it has samples from Tom Sawyer in it.
It is during the first half of the preview.  I hadn't seen this preview
before, and I have seen about 5 different SS previews.

Again, sorry if this has already been posted!

Hello, Rushians:I would like to extend my condonances & prayers to the Peart

but that's ok too.
Thanks.

One of the things that I like most about Rush is that they have fun.  =
Whether its on stage, in their lyrics or in their credits, I like seeing =
them have fun.  I enjoy watching them play around on stage. I laugh when =
they start messing with each others hair or when a big inflatable rabbit =
pops up and shoots the other big inflatable rabbit.  I like "I Think I'm =
Going Bald" also for this reason.  I look at it as a goofy song made by =
guys who like to have fun.  I like that.  Much the same as I like =
reading their credits. I like how they go out and thank folks like: =
Bruce (The Pin) Aldrich (Howdy howdy!) and Jwerg (Ah think Ah see the =
problem').  It also makes me laugh when they dedicate an album to the =
letter "D" or "R-R-R-R". =20

So, I will stand up for "I Think I'm Going Bald", because it shows me a =
side of the band that I like. =20
