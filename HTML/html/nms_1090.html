Whoops!

	Looks like I messed up.  I was the one who mentioned that Rush never
plays a song if they don't play it on that supporting tour.  Well, thanks to
Kelly (gros0466@uwwvax.uww.edu) I see I overlooked the obvious - Witch Hunt.
That makes me feel better.  As long as they've played one (and probably more
that I missed :)...) there's still chance for Presto, Open Secrets, Cut to the
Chase, Available Light, Lock and Key, Alien Shore, Everyday Glory, and a host
of others that deserve a live perfomance.

	Oops.

	I guess that'll teach me to think at 4 in the morning, huh?

Greetings fellow readers!

program for MS Windows, RushInfo is fantastic. No Rush fan who runs Windows
should be without this. The work that Paul put into this is incredible. It
has everything that even the most die-hard Rush fan (like me) would want to
have.
Way to go Paul!

<A NAME="1090005">Subject: Bands who cover RUSH</A>

okay, somebody started this thread, so i will put in my 2 cents worth:

1) Public Enemy- Stick It Out
2) Extreme- You Bet Your Life
3) Soundgarden- Cut to the Chase
4) Weezer- The Spirit of Radio
5) Cinderella- Cinderella Man :)
6) U2- Grand Designs
7) Cracker- Dreamline
8) Frank Sinatra- In the End
9) Red Hot Chili Peppers- Roll the Bones
10) Collective Soul- Finding My Way

okay, i'll vaugely give reasons for my picks, at least i will try...
1) by far the best rap group around, "stick it out" is sort of along the
same lines as "give it up."
2) Cherone & Bettencourt's vocals would harmonzie well on this song and
Bettencourt's one of the top guitarists around.
3) This band rocks and "cut to the chase" rocks, though i suppose it may
not be "depressing" enough for soundgarden.   maybe "red sector a" might
be better.  also, neil thinks that matt cameron, the drummer, is pretty
awesome, (and he's right, of course).
4) I think this song would sound cool with a little more distortion
guitar oriented band, plus rivers cuomo is a great singer.
5) okay, this was sort of a joke, but i suppose it could work.
6) I get chills thinking of Bono singing the line "shapes and lines, of
grand designs."
7) The song rocks, the band rocks, what more can you ask for?
8) okay, i needed a slightly different type singer and i think this could
work.
9) This is a funky song to begin with and would be even more funkified by
the RHCP.  Flea is about the only bassist as good as Geddy.
10) Sort of along the same lines as "Shine," though i would expect them
to play this song differently.  they would defitly add the tradiotional
"yeahs."

Is there a message in "The Trees"?

   "No. It was just a flash. I was working on an entirely different thing
   when I saw a cartoon picture of these trees carrying on like fools. I
   thought, "What if trees acted like people?" So I saw it as a cartoon
   really, and wrote it that way. I think that's the image that it conjures
   up to a listener or a reader. A very simple statement." -- Neil Peart,

Hi guys'n'gals.

During the few months I've read TNMS there have been more postings from
Sweden than it "should" be, statistically anyway. I'm not complaining, I
just think it's odd 'cause Rush fans in Sweden are *very* rare.

Many of the Swedish postings have complained about why they never tour
this way. The last time they were here was on the Hemispheres tour -79 and
what I've heard, the company responsible for most of the rock concerts in
Sweden, EMA Telstar, had some sort of dispute with the band and have
refused to arrange Rush concerts ever since. ;-(((

I can't of course guarantee the correctness of this but as Rush MUST have
the absolute record of low radio time in Sweden, I've only heard them once
(1, en, uno, ein) on country wide radio and then once on a local station,
there must be some sort of anti-Rush-movement in the corridors of swedish
media. Paranoid, Me? Noooo, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they
AREN'T after you.

 C'ya

<A NAME="1090008">Subject: Move it, MAPLES!!!</A>

	Like I said before, (or didn't) I love the tree song, (that's
what my partner calls it).  The lyrics are probably very deep to some
people, and at times they can be to me, but every message that is sent by
a sender (Peart) and recived by a reciever (all of us) has a different
meaning, and we therefore cannot say right or wrong to what meaning
anyone else gets from the song.  They feel one way, you feel another, and
we can express the meanings that we get through the posts, but some of us
are getting out of control with this (no, its racist... your wrong...yes
you are...Neil this and Ayn Rand that).
	In the end in reality, the Maples are a Northern hardwood species
(hence the Canadian flag), and the Oaks are a central hardwood species,
and they don't have too much of an overlapping range.  So what it all
comes down to is that Mr. Peart saw a cartoon and wrote a song about it!

Then came the NMS and here we are today.

David,
	Even though Rush uses sequencers, I'd really like to believe that
everthing one hears in their live shows is in some way triggered by one
of the boyz...  I know that there are a few exceptions, such as Aimee
Mann's voice in time stand still; but I'd much rather see this solution
than see extra musicians up on stage or backstage.  To me, the solution
they have chosen is the path with the most integrity.  The posting a few
TNMS's ago by a gentleman who believes he saw an extra keyboard player
onstage with Rush during the Presto tour has me really upset.  I hope you
were mistaken or kidding! :(

Hi everyone!

I got a kick out of the post about what a possible Rush tribute album would
look like.  Of course the powers that be would want to get "guaranteed"
audience grabbers like Blech-ie Raitt and Bon Jovi. Then we'd get the usual
"tribute album whores" like Sheryl Crow,who said,"All I wanna do is Cygnus
X-1, and the Cranberries (.."Xanadu-dududu-dudududu....Sorry!) Of course,
the surprise addition, yet one thats so obvious, is Nine Inch Nails, with
Trent Reznor's update of...you guessed it...Closer(To the Heart)
(Subtitled:Closer to Gedd)
However, in reality, there will probably never be a Rush tribute album,
unless it were done by the many tribute bands out there.  There just arent'
that many who can keep up with the boyz.  (Please, I don't need to hear the
words Dream Theater one more time.  I don't hear how they sound like Rush, I
don't like them...end of story)  It might be fun to hear who might be good
doing Rush songs.  How about:
Pearl Jam:In the End, In the Mood
Weezer:I think I'm Going Bald
Collective Soul:Bravado
Counting Crows:The Pass
Smashing Pumpkins:Lakeside Park
STP:Circumstances
Maybe a tribute album is a bad idea, but its still fun coming up with
possibilities.  I think I would actually enjoy the Pumpkins doing LP. Oh
well, that's all for now.

 since they're both managed by Ray Danniels.  the nature of being the opening
act is to get drug around and treated sort of like dirt whilst trying to
get more exposure and steal some of the headliner's audience.  If the opening
band is getting shafted one way or the other, who goes to bat for them?
The management, that's who.  If the management for the headliner is the same
firm, there's a conflict of interest.

i can barely imagine seeing my two favorite bands back to back like that.
it might have been too much to take, but would have made the ticket price
a lot more worth it.

	I just can't hold out from this Camera Eye thread, so I'm making
my second post in only days!  Zounds.

	Moving Pictures was the first Rush CD I bought, back in 1992,
just in time for the Roll the Bones tour.  (Good story; I'll tell it
another time).  After a few listens, I really liked the CD.  Of course,
the big Four at the beginning (Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, YYZ, and
Limelight) were my favorites, and for a while I didn't venture too far
past that.  Ever so slowly, however, I would play more of The Camera
Eye.  And the one day it hit me.  I was stunned.  One moment the song was
building and changing, and the next, Geddy was singing "Grim-faced and
forbidding...".  The transition between intro and vocal floored me.  For
a few seconds, I was unsure if anyone was actually singing, because the
voice seemed to fit with such absolute perfection to the tempo and
"sound".  It was a perfect mesh, and I could hardly believe it.
	That was about the time I started to take these guys really
eriously.  I quickly bought everything I could find and absorbed it all.
What wonderful music.  (Such nostalgia!)

	If anyone has live recordings of The Camera Eye (what's all this
about a video?  I want!), I would love to hear.

<A NAME="1090015">Subject: Re: 04/21/95 - The National Midnight Star #1088</A>

First off, i'd like to apologize for another "The Trees" post, but after
reading Sabina Becker's response to Gerard D.'s previous post i couldn't
contain myself any longer.

I don't want to start a political debate, and i'm not going to interject my
own political philosophy to further muddle this sensitive and tired thread;
I just think Sabina's comments were unfair and lacked consistency
(thought?)

First, Sabina suggests that noone, and certainly not *her* would suggest
that those with sight should be blinded for the sake of fairness. Then a
couple lines later she is suggests that the oaks "must lose a few limbs to
learn their lesson" !? (this is right after she falls centimeters short of
calling Gerard pro-slavery, anti-woman, etc....)

 Then we get to:
>Gerard: "God gave the oaks their height, for whatever reason.  Who are
>the maples to take that away."

>Ahem!  The maples aren't doing that much taking.  It's the hatchet, ax
>and saw, remember?

Now i think the point was pretty bloody obvious that Gerard is referring to
what the maples _want_ to accomplish. I believe a relevant line in the song
goes "We will make them give us light." Whether one views that as unfair
"taking" or not is not the point; the moral is "Don't take a quotation out
of context without thinking just to make another cut at your opponent."
The relevant quotation is " now there's no more oak oppression for they
passed a noble law, and the trees are all kept equal by hatchet, axe, and
saw." A perfectly valid interpretation of this is that the new law (brought
to you by the *maples*) is what brings the "hatchet, axe, and saw" into the
picture.

I don't believe in the christian god either, but saying that God gave them
their height just doesn't relate to what you try and relate it to. I don't
think Gerard would argue that babies are born fully developed..(i could be
wrong) Sure people grow in all sorts of ways and it's not all genetically
determined, but in the world of the trees, Oaks are just bigger than
Maples. They just are, it's just the way they are made. This doesn't
necessarily to have to apply to humans, and i doubt Gerard would call
poorer people a lesser form of human, i also doubt he's say the person was
destined to be poor because of some genetic reason or something. We are
talking about trees here. Yes, the trees talk and stuff, but *height* of
the trees is the issue. If the Maples really could grow as big as the Oaks,
then we wouldn't need a hatchet, axe, and saw to keep things equal because
eventually the maples would be just as tall as the oaks. (then neil's last
line would be simply short-sighted and there's no evidence for that)

>The people with all the "Big Money" haven't all earned it.  Some got it
>by thievery, and others got it by selling big bullshit.  They have to
>give some up because they took it from others.

Hey, calm down! Who are you to judge "the people" with all the money. you
don't even concede *one* of them has earned it! Come on! Further, the ones
who sold the "big bullshit", as you put it, certainly got someone to sell
it to didn't they? so people wanted it, and they provided it...Hmmmm..Some
people call that earning...(this is not to say all big business, and all
people with big money earned it -- far from it -- i am simply trying to
dispell these offensive blanket stereotypes Sabina so expertly throws
around)

        Ok, i'm done. I'm really, really sorry guys - i just got offended
and had to say something. I'll go back to my corner now. All flames/death
threats/whatever can be directed to email please.

Later on everyone...

Just who did you consider talented??????? Of Course Rush! BUT You obviously
don't know talent when you see it (other than Rush). All 3 members of Primus
are EXTREMELY talented. If you would give their music a chance, it just might
grow on you. When I first heard Primus (Opening for Rush in San Diego on the
RTB's tour). I thought the same thing you and many other people did, "These
guys suck" (literaly). Then I bought 1 of their albums and realized that they
were actually a great band, and VERY talented.

Hey all. Here's a few questions that occasionally cross my mind:
	Anybody know who the dude in the 'Body Electric' video is? He's
the one being chased by those 'androids' that look like they belong at a
Halloween party, or something. (I still can't take that video
seriously...good song, though!)
	Anyone ever laugh their ass off when you watch the GUP tour
video, and you see that '80s kid with his '80s headband air-drumming
during YYZ? (That always puts me in stiches...even though I did it myself
at the CP concert, so I shouldn't make fun :-)
	Why do you think that Neil still has his P/G drum heads during
the 'Big Money' video? Shouldn't he have had the PW logos by then?
	If you look EXTREMLEY close at the 'Closer to the Heart' video
from the '70s, you can catch a glimpse of a black guy in big yellow
bell-bottoms kneeling to the right of Neil with a camera.
	If you listen EXTREMELY close to the fade of 'I think I'm going
bald', you can hear Geddy yell 'Get a haircut, will ya!? (like HE should
talk about a haircut back then :-))
	Ever notice that the fading music during the end of 'Lock and
Key' sounds exactly like the chorus to 'The Body Electric' (You could
actully sing the 1001001 part during the fade if you want)
	YKYARF when you come up with half a dozen things to keep other
Rush fans busy...Like I'll bet right after you read this, you're all
gonna put in your Chronicles video/Lock and Key/I think I'm going bald/
to try and make me a liar!

    Just thought i'd let out some of the things i've been pondering...

        Ok, in response to the hearings of Rush-like rhythms in other
songs, has anyone heard R.E.M's Bang and Blame?  My brother has this and
the first time he played it i walked in during the middle of the song and
swore it was SOR.  It has fooled my many a time on the radio too.

(sorry about the non rush stuff!)

        Second, i also eagerly awaited the Live Unplugged performance and
thought it was awesome.  Ed (the lead singer) really had fun with it...he's
always wanted to play in a mosque (sp?) or temple and that was pretty darn
close.  Does anyone have a copy of the show on tape?  I was vacationing and
couldn't record it.

<A NAME="1090023">Subject: Guitars&Female Fans</A>

	I'm not going to start this with a list of my credentials that
makes me a qualified critic on this topic, I just want to get my opinion out.

There's been a lot of talk about who's the best guitarist or whatever. I
don't think it's childish to debate this, in fact I enjoy it.  If you
were to ask me straight up, I think that at the present time, Eric
Johnson is putting out the best work of any rock guitarist I've heard.
If any of you heard him opening for Rush for the RTB tour you can at
least relate to what I'm saying. His work is nothing less than
pheonominal.  Ah Via Musicom is perfect from start to finish, and he
doesn't dub in extra guitar parts. Everything is done on one take with one
guitar!  He has about 10 more years to go though before he can be held at
the same level as other greats, at least in most people's eyes.  Creating
new, innovative and beautiful music over a long period of time is what
makes you great. (I'm getting to RUSH)  Overall here is what I think, in
order:

Best Living Guitarist
1)Eddie Van Halen
2)Eric Johnson
3)Joe Satriani
4)Alex Lifeson
5)Steve Morse

I suppose I should mension here, that RUSH is without question far and
above my favorite band.  And Alex may not be technically as superior as
some guitarist (maybe he is?) but his solos are so emotional, he more
than makes up for it.  Here's an abbraviated list of my favorite Rush solos:

1)La Villa Strangiato
2)Limelight
3)Ghost of A Chance
4)Analog Kid
5)Cut to the Chase
6)Freewill
7)Kid Gloves

	These picks may be common, but that may be saying something.
I'm sure on a different day this list would vary slightly, but these are
what came to mind first.  I think that's what makes a solo great.  When I
think of these songs, I think of the guitar solo.  When a solo defines a
song as well as these and many of Lifeson's other solos do, that's quite
an accomplishment.  What I'm trying to get at is that technical ability
enables a guitarist to become great, but alone, does not make him great.
If you haven't heard John Petrucci from Dream Theater, you don't know
what technique alone can do.  And it can do alot.  But it's still only
about 1/3 of great playing.
	Throughout all this rambling I've probably gotten no where as
usual. But, I wanted to express my opinion.

Re:female rush fans
	Also, there have been complaints about the lack of female Rush
fans and here is what I think. If I could print this in some special ink
that only men could read I would, but here goes! I've considered myself a
Live fan for a couple of years, and still do , but just recently I saw
Live live.  It was in Ann Arbor, Mi.  Let me tell you, there were so many
women there it was amazing, which is uncommon for a rock concert.  And at
certain sections of certain songs, all you could here were the high
pitched squeals of infatuated female fans.  It may be an overdose of
testosterone, but I've always had a hard time taking a band with so many
female fans seriously.  That's what my roommate terms a 'Girlee Band'.
It may not be right to feel this way, but I do.  So, it doesn't bother me
to hear talk of the lack of female Rush fans.  If anything, it makes them
part of an exclusive group :The Women who Appreciate Good Music Group.
And that makes a girl much more attractive to me than nearly anything
else could.  So, to all the women who truly love and appreciate Rush,
you're beautiful, and to all those of you who don't, go check out Live.

Howdy all! This is my first post, and after reading TNMS for the past two
weeks, thought I would drop my $.02, for what it's worth.

Nathan Stewart asked about Neil's ride cymbal in the 20 April posting.
It is a 22" Zildjian Ping ride that, according to Lenny Dimuzio at the
Zildjian Co., he has been using for more than twenty years.  He also uses
a similar model on his back kit.  If you are really desperate for
particulars: it is of medium-heavy weight, and is characterized by a very
defined stick sound with a minimum of build-up, or spread, hence the name,
Ping.

In related news, the continuing debate about Neil being the best or not
the best is collapsing into absurdity.  In the end (pun definitely not
intended), what it really comes down to is taste and compatability.  To
put someone of a greater technical ability into his position in Rush would
certainly be a shame, because Neil and his particular musicality, along
with Ged and Alex, is what makes the music so wonderful.  Neil would be
the first to agree that there are better drummers in the world.  That's
what makes a musician want to keep playing; there are always new things
to learn and new goals to attain. But only he has the certain feel that
properly fits the context.  So, it's not about who's best, but who's right.

One passing thought concerning "The Trees" discussion....Yawn!

That is all!!

I knew that I had seen this somewhere before.  In the Apr/May issue of
Modern Drummer magazine, Neil was asked if there was a message in "The
Trees".  His reply was as follows:

	No. It was really just a flash. I was working on an entirely
different thing when I saw a cartoon picture of these trees carrying on
like fools. I thought, "What if trees acted like people?". So I saw it as
a cartoon really, and wrote it that way. I think that's the image that it
conjures up to a listener or a reader. A very simple statement.

 To continue the ol' thread of a rush tribute, I think it'd be ace.
The only problem, as was mentioned in the last posting, would be (basically)
crap covers. This is a problem, but it nevertheless would be nice to see how
other artists interpret the boys songs.
	It would be nice for example to see how a band like (the remaining
members of) Led Zeppelin would cope with some of the rush songs.
	-the first album would be *dead* easy :-).

	A more interesting point would be an album of rush covering other songs.
I think it would be nice if they did a 'The The' type of approach to a
particularly influential artists work. It'd be nice to know what other music
makes them tick. Obviously if you listen to the music and lyrics as much as I
do(a lot!), then it would be great to get to the underlying philosophy of both
the lyrics and the music (as these complement each other).

Obligatory YKWYAARF : - Knowing that 'Entre nous' is french for 'between us'!

able to say 'Between the sun and moon' to someone.
		      - naming your son 'Geddy Alex Neil Lee Zivojinovich
Lifeson Peart'! (aplogies for the spelling!!!!).

Songs I'd like to see Rush cover:
	'Something' - The Beatles
	'Dirty Day' - U2
	'Problem child' - AC/DC
	'Just like a man' - Del Amitri (If you haven't listened to it already,
please DO!!).
	'Free Falling' - Tom Petty
	'The Electric Co' - U2 (ace song!).

Whil this may be an unpleasant example to swallow, the sentiment does fit
the theme of RTB, both the song and most of the album.  Several songs
specifically talk about the indifference of chance, and how coincidence or
random events can lay low even the best intentions.  Roll the Bones, The
Big Wheel, Ghost of A Chance and You Bet Your Life, all specificallt
address this, which again just reinforces Neil's belief in free will.  One
corallary of free will is that, crudely put, shit *still* happens.

>I am suprised at how many people really like the Limelight solo!!
>It is a great solo, but one of the easiest to play

But that just points out the greatness of this song: its simplicity.  I
have no musical training, but as a devoted listener, Limelight has always
struck me as a relatively simple Rush song.  It's also one of my favorites.
I guess it proves the adage that sometimes, less is more.

The song "Mission" has alway sbeen one of my favorite Rush
songs. Even though I never really understood its true mean-
ing, I have always been moved by it. I will always remember
watching them play it live and how at the end when the three
flaming balls faded into the background and the big screen
turned into the cover of HYF how it moved me to tears.
	Well last night I finally discoverd the true meaning
of Mission (at least on a personal level). I also now believe
that Mission is Rush's most powerful song. I went to see the
movie Shawshank Redemption. It is a very powerful and moving
picture (get it). As the final credits rolled up the screen ,
I began to really think about this movie, and its meaning.
As I was driving home, I turned on my CD player amd was about
to play Red Barchetta, but at the last second, I turned it to
Mission from ASOH. As soon as I heard the opening chords, I
began to cry again. All of a sudden the song took on a whole
new meaning. It was as though this song was made for this movie.
By the time Alex was finishing his most beautiful solo, I nearly had
to pull over because I could hardly see.
	I realize that there are a few songs that could relate to
this movie, but I feel that Mission is the best. I recommend that
everyone see this movie and try to find a Rush song that moves
them like Mission did for me.

To: Rush-mgr@syrinx.umd.edu

Hi all...

I first got hooked on the guys when I first moved to Colorado Springs Colorado 
back in 1980.  I had a couple of friends of mine who lived just down the road 
from me and, well, I had never heard of Rush before I had met them.  They 
lived in a house that had a huge, dark and dingy basement where they slept.  
The basement was lit with blue and red light bulbs and by no means was the 
room neat.  In fact, it was always a mess.  After several beers one evening 
and snowing outside, they put on the very first album of Rush I had ever 
heard, "Hemispheres".

I was instantly skeptical before they put it on, since I had only been in the 
country (USA) since 1979 and being from Europe, I was used to listening to 
bands like ABBA. Rock was not at the top of my list.  Needless to say my taste 
for music was ajumble until I listened to a band called Rush.  I as mesmerized
by Hemispheres, followed by Moving Pictures and Permanent Waves.

Since, 1980 I have accumulated some 345 different Rush Collectables on vinyl 
and CD.  I've seen them 26 times, all over the country...Florida, Colorado, 
California, Vancouver BC, Washington state, Washington DC, Georgia, Maryland 
(Landover) and England.  My CD Player always has at least 3 Rush CD's at all 
times (out of 5).  All my friends now relate me with Rush, some like it some 
don't, but they all relate Rush to me, I suppose because I listen to nothing 
but.

I'm thankful to those two brothers back in Colorado, way back in 1980 for 
introducing me to Rush.  Who knows what my life might be like today if I 
hadn't.  I tribute certain events that have taken place in my life on the 
lyrical content of every Rush album to the way I am today!
