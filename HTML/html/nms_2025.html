Actually being a bass player and a Rush Fan since 1976 I used to use 4001 as my
ATM pin. That, of course, being the model number of the Rickenbacker bass Geddy
played in the early days ( I think he switched to 4003 when they started making
them though). But my bank doesn't let me pick my PIN anymore so...

After sending out a post last week about how cool it would be to see a Rush
tribute band with some fellow NMS'ers, I caught the post by Rob Tanaka
regarding the band Afterimage playing in Denver tonight (Saturday).  I ditched
the wife and kid for the evening and checked them out.  Too bad I wasn't able
to catch them with some fans I knew.

They were awesome though, much better that I expected.  Unfortunately, they
only played for little over an hour. It was cool seeing a band with dueling
double necked guitar & bass!  Also, Rob the bassist had a Toronto Blue Jays
jersey featuring player number 2112.

Erik DePoy asked the following:

>        Why couldn't Rush devote a little time each night to improv?

Neil has said before that he thinks improvization during a show is weak
sauce. He was asked if he ever improvizes. As best I can remember the quote
was something like "Those who improvize (during a show) have never
practiced a day in their lives." So, I wouldn't count on it ever happening.
Neil says that his drum solo is the one place that each night he like to take
a chance and try new things.
Another thought: a Rush concert featuring a full symphony orchestra
instead of synthesizers. Wouldn't that be fun?

I'm not sure if I've suggested this before, but I think Kieffer 
Sutherland would make a great Alex.  There's a pic of big Al in 
Visions(Page 91, for those who have the book) that just reminds me of 
Sutherland...anyone agree?
I agree. I kept telling my self that I have seen that look somewhere else b 4.

1st, they change their management to SRO and Ray Danniels.

Next, they have Howard design and run the lighting on tour.  Matt Druzbik is
also on board.  Saw the Mtv deal on Fri, but couldn't really tell the extent
of the lighting production.  I'll get to say hello to Howard in Chi when VH is
here on the 16th (8th row pulled from TM) and I'll see if he has any Rush info
(I would doubt it).

Next, AVH drum solo sounds somewhat similar to a certain Prof.

Next, they play YYZ.  Just seeing if you're awake.

<A NAME="2025014">Subject: Re: Actor to Portray Neil Peart</A>

As for a Rush movie...unless someone's willing to lose their shirt, you'll
never see one.

As much as I love Rush and all they are/were, a movie about the band would go
nowhere...the global interest, like it or not, is pretty low to risk the
*minimum* $12-million investment (and that's probably with only mid-range
"above-the-line" talent...imagine if "A-List" people were involved...somehow,
I don't think they'd be working for scale, ala COPLAND).

Besides, what would the story be *about*? Their story isn't over. And it's
just not all that interesting to anyone but us; the odds they've overcome are
intangible obstacles that matter only to those who understand and care (in
other words, those who've seen and know!).

Beginning + Middle + End = Story. Tell me where the Rush story fits into this?
In a way that means something to someone other than us. What mountains have
they overcome (besides the artistic stuff that only we fans care about)? What
major triumphs have they had, besides their obvious success, which again, only
we care about? What stirring episodes in their lives would thrill a non-Rush
kind of person? The day Neil decided to use Tama drums? When Geddy got his
first kiss?

If (and this is a might big "if") some Rush fan who had deep pockets and a lot
of love were to feel like it didn't matter if he lost money...a Rush film
will/would get made. Also, if someone who makes pictures decides to do a Rush
opus for the sheer love of it all, I'm sure, with adequate distribution and
promotion (say $3-million worth) the fan-base would make such a venture at
least a "break-even" proposition. Regardless of the film's quality.

Hey, maybe Bill Gates might decide to clean his couch cushions and finance a
Rush film, win, lose, or draw. It would be nice to see him do something of
note before he retires, seeing as how he's basically made the perpetration of
colourlessness and mediocrity his life's work. Don't remind me about how rich
he is...it doesn't mean a thing. Never has one man made so much from so little
and for such a low-level of quality and sophistication. If people were truly
rewarded for talent and vision in this world, Rush would have the $20-billion
in the bank and Bill Gates would be running the fryer at Wendy's (while
daydreaming about Farrah Fawcett).

Now: What *might* be a very fascinating, compelling film would be the focused,
finite study of Neil Peart's recent loss. To make it tangible, you'd need his
cooperation, and I doubt he'd give it right now. Depending on the execution,
the global arena would probably have room for a picture like that, whether it
was a "made-for-cable" thing, or whatever. The story is tragic, reveals
character, and works on many levels...most of them not related to Rush, per
se, but to the human being that Neil most certainly is.

So Rush would be a mere backdrop in this scenario...

The big hole in this concept is that we don't yet know the end of his story!
As Neil himself probably does not...

Again, from the "microcosm" standpoint, maybe an event picked from the life of
one member that's not exactly Rush-related: Neil's trip to China and what it
revealed to him about the world and about himself; his visit to the Serengeti
with emphasis on the same.

You get the idea...Rush as a backdrop, not the main course.

Okay, I'll be brutal: Minus TOP-NOTCH execution, I still think it would very
probably be a "here-and-gone" thing that would see low ratings and little
return. If that's okay for the guy writing the cheques...well, it's certainly
fine by me! I totally loved BRING ON THE NIGHT (the Sting movie about his
DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES band), so yes, I'll buy your Rush movie, too (BOTN
was superb, by the way).

Anyway, a Rush-related film will never happen in our lifetime, so it's little
use to talk about it. In time, Rush may likely go the way of other great
creators...only truly appreciated by a broad audience after they're but dust.
At that point we may *indeed* see THE GEDDY, NEIL AND ALEX STORY (with guest
appearance by the virtual Leonardo DiCaprio as Rutsey).

Until then, the limited videos will have to do...

If someone proves me wrong on these points, I'll buy them a coffee.

     Dear Fred Pinto (& everyone else):
     
     Thanks for taking the time to respond to my defense of C Money. For 
     the benefit of everyone else, this is a portion of what you said:
     
     "chad, for the true fans, please, next time, don't go!  i mean, since
     you're the type of guy who can't be satisfied with those "uninspiring,
     embarrassing, robotic, just plain stupid" stage antics, you really 
     ought to think about spending your time and money more wisely. and 
     then you follow up your rush bashing by saying "i love rush & i
     always will".  don't be such a hypocrite.  loving rush involves
     supporting them"
     
     First, I stand by what I orginally said. 
     
     Second, it IS possible to really, truly, in "true fan" fashion love 
     Rush AND STILL be critical of some of the things they do. IT REALLY 
     IS! It isn't hypocritical at all. You bring up how important it is to 
     support Rush, and I wholeheartedly agree. To me, that is why it is 
     just so disappointing when the band puts on their robotic shows. It 
     would do their hearts good to loosen up a bit (if the stage show has 
     to suffer, that would be alright BY ME).
     
     Third, knee-jerk, "how dare you criticize THE perfect band?!" 
     reactions like Fred Pinto's make me chuckle. There are things I don't 
     like about Rush's live show. But, this doesn't out me as a Spice Girls 
     fan at heart. Thank you for your input, but I believe I'll continue to 
     SUPPORT Rush by purchasing their records & (gasp!) even by seeing them 
     on tour. Have a day.

In elevator #1 in Jester Center West (my dorm, the biggest dorm
in the US), there is a Roll The Bones sticker stuck to the roof.
It looks like it's been there since RTB, too.

I was in Houston this weekend.  A DJ on a radio station there, KLOL,
said Rush would be coming out with a new album in "a couple months."
She didn't say if it would be in-concert or studio or what.

As far as a new in-concert album goes, I am very excited.  Some
people out there said they couldn't get excited about a live album
which is corrected until it's no longer truly a live album.  I
disagree with that, though.  If you listen to some bootlegs (which
have had no corrections done to them), there are songs which are
nearly flawless.  Bravado on Mirrors and The Weapon on Signals From
London are two examples.  I think that a a live album is supposed
to piece those songs together into one album and create a concert
which isn't humanly possible.  In addition, I might add that Rush
live albums need far less fixing than most other bands'.  The TFE
San Antonio concert was nearly entirely flawless.  Minimal corrections
would need to be done to the concert to make it album material.
Based on my comparisons between my boots and live albums, the drums
are not changed one bit.

Hey! That song's how I got into Rush in the first place. I speed as well 
to it. You feel as if your flying down some desert highway, don't you? 

Another thrill in listening to Rush.

Hello everyone,

Just a few interesting observations:

 Why is there a picture of Geddy on the drums in the Counterparts insert?

 In the remasterd ATWAS, there is a picture of Neil talking to or
explaining something to a guy who looks 18-22? years old.  Does anyone
know who this is?

 lastly, in Cx1 book 1, The lyrics give me the impression, that the
Rocinante only had one passenger.  ex:

I set a course just east of Lyra..
On MY ship, the 'Rocinante'..
MY ship cannot resist her long
Nearer to MY deadly goal..
Sound and fury
Drowns MY heart

Well, you get the idea, I and My oriented.

However, in book 2-Hemispheres:

"To the Heart of Cygnus' fearsome force WE set OUR course"

Who exactly is "we"?  Does anyone have any insight into who the other
crew members of this ship were?

Maybe their were 2 other crew members who took the only two escape pods,
passed to Olympus and became the Apollo and Dionysius gods, and The hero,
Cygnus was the captain and stayed with his ship until the end.  Who
Knows? 

What do you think?

Hello Fellow Rush Freaks....

For those who think that this list is only for gushing about how great 
Rush is, IMHO you're wrong.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with 
posting your opinions/constructive criticisms of Rush-related topics, 
from the lack of spontaneousness on stage to your least favorite Rush 
tune(lyrically or musically).  If "The Boys" were reading the contents 
of this list, I think they would enjoy reading about the things we 
weren't terribly fond of, as opposed to "our favorite Rush tunes and 
why".  There isn't anything wrong with the latter thread, but I kinda 
enjoy the diversity of the threads being put out here.  On the 
Marillion/Fish Freaks mailing list, a thread just finished up on 
people's opinions on their Least Favorite Marillion or Fish tune and 
why.  Fish is a recipient of the list and posted to it stating that he 
rather enjoyed the thread.  It gives musicians, lyricists, and fans a 
different way of looking at things.  I don't think, as a whole, we are 
close-minded enough to think that threads such as these that border on 
the derogatory are going to hurt anyone's feelings.  And on that note, I 
must say that off the top of my head, my least favorite Rush tune has to 
be from one of my favorite albums HYF ---  Tai Shan. I've tried and 
tried to like this song, but I just can't get into it. Since I am a huge 
early-Rush fan, the reason must be that I enjoy more progressive/complex 
tunes.  Ones that you can just crank up the volume and feel your 
adrenalin build.  Tai Shan doesn't do it for me... Sorry...  I would be

Brother, you are NOT ALONE!  I can't promise to help, but I can
sympathize, and we can whimper to each other.  For the last two weeks
I've had the CD player next to my bed set to just play the last song
on "Presto" over... and over... and over.  So as I doze off, guess
what I hear... over... and over... and over.  I did go a day or two
doing the same thing with "The Body Electric", come to think of it,
but that didn't last. (I'm a computer tech so hearing that "one zero
one" really does it for me! <G>)

So it should not surprise you that I've been dreaming recently that
Ged is singing this song to me.  Not in any mushy romantic way, but as
if to tell me that things will get better and to have hope. 
 
Altho I will admit... don't you guys start laughing at me, either,
like a friend did when I told him this... I've had a crush on Geddy
for *years*, since high school in fact (I'm only a few years younger
than The Boyz and have followed the band since '76).  Everybody else
drooled over Robert Plant, Freddie Mercury, and Peter Frampton, but
not me... I set my sights higher! :-)

OK, think I've managed to embarrass myself quite enough for one day... 

Hang in there, John, and don't let ANY other song get to you... we
WILL BE IN THE LIGHT!

i was going to write a story on 2112. i was to be about the solar 
ferderation, and interpret different songs along the theme of the story.  
it was very sci-fi, but it's on the back burner cause there's just not 
enough time to make it worth posting 'til the summer.

but on your idea, i think it would be cool. a lot of experiences i've 
had i relate directly to rush songs. i just haven't written anything 
down but i'm sure a lot of others have.

Rush on!!

First off I'd like to say that Michael is a very brave soul, willing to
take a chance on something unknown to him, especially something musically
risky. This is how more obscure progressive bands (beyond KC and GG) will
ever receive wider exposure.

Now, as far as KC goes, you have to decide which of the three main phases
of the group you prefer. That said, however, most Rush fans will probably
most enjoy the mid period KC (72-74) with "Red" typically seen as the
signature release of that era (though "Larks Tongues in Aspic" and
"Starless and Bible Black" should not be overlooked). Though I personally
like all of KC, that's the safest place to start for a Rush fan.

Gentle Giant is usually more of an acquired taste since it is more keyboard
oriented and often more unorthadox than even KC (though GG often sounds
like early KC and vice versa). I would recommend "Power and the Glory" or
"In a Glass House" though most GG from the mid-70s can appeal to Rush fans
on various levels. Be warned that late 70s GG became more poppy (more
new-wavey).

I'm sure others will chime in but the bottom line is to keep exploring new
music.

<A NAME="2025027">Subject: 2112</A>

Hello fellow Rush-addicts,

Recently the discussion of the symbolism of the starman has made me
look back at the whole 2112 story and look for deeper meanings.  I
have a few questions about the story that I was wondering if you
could help me First does the main character have any affect on the
eventual take over of the temples by the elder race? Or is he an
insignificant player created to help us understand the forces of
oppression in a futuristic totalitarian society?  Why did he take his
newly found guitar to show to the Priests of Syrinx, instead of to
someone else?  How long would it really take someone with little
musical expirience to teach themselves to play the guitar?  Was this
story supposed to take place over several years or several days? How
long after our hero (martyr) kills himself does the elder race take
over? Did our hero start or inspire any resistance movements or was
he just an isolated incident?

Many of these questions do not have definite answers but leave 
themselves open to personal interpretation.  I would really enjoy 
hearing some of your opinions and thoughts about this epic suite.

But there's more.  (Pause while I light a candle, and look helpless).  I

classic loves: Available Light.  That song is so, so awesome.  It's not a

riff kicks in, lines like "Chase the light around the world," Alex's guitar 
raging,  I mean how can you not beat your head rhythmically, crank up the 
air guitar, and screech "Dah - Dah - Dah, Dah - Dah De Dah!" to the 
heavens?  Huh?  Tell me HOW?

And on the third go-round of the chorus, when Neil alternates between 
smashing his symbols and thumping some floor-tom thingy (correction is 
pending, I'm certain) . . . chills, freezing hot needles, dogs and cats, 
living together . . . yes, it's bliss.  (Sob, chest-thumping, angst) Bliss

I am going to go back and listen to Presto againa nd see if I can hear those
things too.
On the same subject-
I have noticed the difference in Elex's sound when he changes his equiptment,
but everything that Ged has done after the RIC, sounds the same to me.

if you ever see the Brewers play you'll notice that every time a Brewer
