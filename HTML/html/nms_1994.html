Although the Rush news has been sparse lately, here's a few tibits courtesy
of $ean & Emmet Swimming:

  - Alex is working on a follow-up to Victor
  - Geddy is looking for some projects of his own in the next few months
  - The fate of the band is still up in the air. The live album will be
    released, but nothing is certain after that. (and please don't start up
    rumors about how Rush is/will be breaking up because THAT IS NOT WHAT I
    AM SAYING)

I have to admit, seeing Rush on MTV was the reason I went out and bought
Hold Your Fire. One cold winter morning in early 1988, I was at home sick
(or playing sick to avoid going to school) when I saw the video for Lock and
Key on MTV. I was so impressed by Rush's sound, I went out that night (after
a miraculous recovery) and I bought the Hold Your Fire cassette. 

Go figure. eMpTyV was responsible for my introduction to Rush.

First off, with Metallica doing "Driven", it wouldn't be "Mother
F******g driven to the edge of a deep, dark hole, Motherf****r!" It
would be "Driven to the edge of a motherf*****g hole.....YEAH!" :)
On to the covers:
 Ani Difranco doing "Cold Fire" ("A man talking to a woman and she's
smarter than him." -Neil Peart)
 Were Freddie Mercury alive, Queen doing "Xanadu".
 NiN doing "Witch Hunt".
 Offspring doing "Dog Years" (Geddy DID say ",It's a bit punky.")
 Victor doing "Limbo". (Please tell me you saw that coming.)
 Pink Floyd doing "Limbo".
 Primus doing "La Villa Strangiato". (hehehehehehehehehe...)
 Metallica doing 2112.
 Dave Matthews doing Roll the Bones, with John Cleese on the "rap."
 Dream Theater doing "Time and Motion."
 Soundgarden doing "Stick it Out."
 Dreamline with Eric Johnson on guitar, Ani Difranco on Vocals, Mike
Portney on drums, Jason Newsted on bass, and a symphony instead of
synths.
 KI$$ doing Different Strings (DON'T FLAME ME IT'S JUST A JOKE)
One more thing-
If you go see "Titanic", pay attention to the music at the part where
Kate Winslet (babe) is looking at the Statue of Liberty. It sounds a
little like Test for Echo.

I know fellow RUSH folk submit exciting news of a purchase or change which 
result in the number 2112, but how often do you see  or witness a RUSH  
lyric in the world??  Those who have played the game Warcraft II should know 
of one of the cheat commands which is sure to be the result of the
programer's love of RUSH.  For those who who want to learn of another great 
presence, though indeed obscure, the words are this: "glittering prizes".  
This is the cheat command in the game to award you vast sums of riches.  
If you don't know the game, go get it.  It is excellent.  

Also, how many of you have a square picture disk of Roll the Bones? Besides 
the tune, there is also an interview with Alex.  Paid $10.00 for it a while 
back.  It is from the U.K.  For a truly excellent time visit the site for 
Little Green Men, a group of guys who have excellent origanals
and are also able to play over 25 RUSH tunes......WELL!

<<<  Now, as for Rush content, I've been making my way back around to Presto
again as of late, and I was wondering that, when listening to this album, does
anyone find themselves cranking up the bass and turning down the treble, just
to get the sound to *resemble* the rockingness of albums like Grace Under
Pressure and Test 4 Echo?? (and before you flame me, let me state that if I
have to capitalize the word God, I'm sure as hell NOT abbreviating Rush album
titles, so dont remind me! :))  This album (Presto) sounds awfully
unsubstantial unless I max out the bass and crank the hell out of it....  >>>

Absolutely. While Presto is my favorite Rush album, I always have to do some
tweaking of the bass and treble to get it sounding not too tinny (even moreso
with Roll The Bones). Well, that and set it to skip War Paint and
Superconductor...

   [ Hey, I *like* War Paint (except the repeating chorus at the end... once
     was quite enough thank you)                                  : rush-mgr ]

Hmmm....good question man :)

I love the guitar...so i have a ton of favs in this category...Hendrix =
and Stevie Ray Vaughan tie for first in my list...they can do some =
amazing stuff with the fretboard...Joe Satriani is awesome as well.  =
Clapton is good as well...and...lets see...oh yeah, Lifeson (of course), =
David Guilmore, George Thorogood and Robben Ford...i love the blues :) =
and Rush too of course :)

Bass is hard, because i havent really paid that much attention to =
it...mostly to the drums and guitar.  Geddy is great....i think Rush is =
the only band that i know of where i can actually hear the bass without =
too much struggle. =20

Drums...Neil Peart, Carl Palmer...two of the best players ever...both of =
them are really progressive i think. Phil Collins is also a good one...

I might toss this one into the mix...what about piano/keyboards? Reese =
Wynans, Dr John and Keith Emerson are my personal favs...

The rap song that samples "Tom Sawyer" is Young Black Teenagers' "Time to

Biz Markie also gave the song props in an article in Spin on great breaks
to rap over.

I hope I'm not totally off-base here, but I recall Shakespe(A)re's quote
as "All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players. 
They perform their roles..."  I'm not positive, but that's the gist. 
And old Bill swiped it from Bacon anyway.

NOT quite the same as Neil's bit.  And it's "gilded" cage--as in covered

Anyone heard the hilarious rumor that Shakespeare wrote the 47th Psalm? 
e-me for details.

Although there are many flames on the NMS, I have made many friends here and
enjoy continued correspondence with them (from Half the World away, right
Erik?).  When I first got wired into the net, I found very few Rush artwork
images suitable for wallpaper and only 1 Desktop Theme.  My site started when
I altered the HYF juggler photo, which many people asked for when I offered it
here on the NMS.  Since then its become a hobby (or obsession!), and I always
love to help another fan.  It's also amazing how many emails I get from my
website from Rush fans that haven't heard of the NMS.  Needless to say, I do
my best to point them in the right direction (any of you guys subscribed
yet?).

Anyone with Windows 95 Plus that hasn't been to my site has got to check it
out.  You won't be sorry.  Trust me!  We all have great taste, right?
 
Coming soon to www.2112.net/powerwindows  ---> Permanent Waves desktop theme
(really, I promise), plus more wallpaper images.

Thanks again for the plug Erik, stop by for a brewski next time you're in the
neighborhood.

Hey fellow Rush freaks!

I must apologize for the lack of Rush content...I just read Marco's 
favorite drummers, and was so excited to see Bill Stewart in the list! 
Bill went to college with my brother, Doug Weiss (who is a big name in 
the NYC jazz scene...he's a bassist...ANYWAY...). I've known Bill for 
years, and I'm glad he's finally getting the recognition he deserves! You

Damn right!  _I_ am!  Just kidding.

RE:  the fictional account of meeting Neil:  I meet a lot of famous
actors in my work.  The WORST way to start is to pretend not to know
someone, then try to let it slip later.  Just acknowledge them, and
treat them like a normal person.  I had a great conversation and
drinking bout with Gary Lockwood of 2001 and Star Trek.  I said, "Hi,
Mr. Lockwood, what's new?" 
He started telling me about his job as an architect (since he stopped
acting in 1968 or so, although he may do some more soon, he admitted),
then we started discussing booze--he's an aficionado of tequila, I of
Scotch.  We went to the hotel bar to experiment...
If I met Neil, I'd probably just say, "Hi, Mr. Peart, How are things
going?"
That leaves it up to him to pick a subject of converstion, or not.

In the pub article, Mr.Mills (I'm assuming it was Mr. Mills) wrote
   "I knew in my heart of hearts he'd be an asshole in person." Then he went
on about the angry stare, and "and just.... do whatever you want to do....
whatever you have to do to heal.   Everybody worth a shit will understand,
just like it's always been with you & the band, no matter what you do."
Assuming this is true, and I hope it isn't, thinking that he will be an
"asshole" before you meet him is plain wrong. Thinking that he is an
"asshole" after this encounter is also wrong. You say that he is an
'asshole', but do you realize that he talked to you, and could have said
"No, you may not sit here." Neil let you sit with him, and then YOU treated
HIM with DISRESPECT.  He may act differewntly under normal circumstamces,
but you even worte that these are not normal circumstances. What do you
expect him to do, turn around and be joyful and happy to everyone, and
anyone, and continue making albums? To not get upset when some stranger
disrespects you, and your deceased daughter, by treating it like a minor
incident?  Think about this: Neil lost his ONLY daughter. Selena is not
something Neil can bike down to the nearest music store and purchase. She
was a living, breathing, feeling human being. He is, understandably, shaken
by her death, as any father would be.  Do you finally understand? HE LOST
HIS ONLY DAUGHTER!!! I honestly hope that he does take all the time in the
world that he needs to deal with the loss of Selena. I do believe that all
Rush fans should show their support to Neil, but to do it in a tactful way.
I like the idea of buying a Rush album on August 10th, the date of Selena's
death. I think that all Rush fans should not just buy any album, but, if it
has been released by then, the new live album. However, the 'do whatever you
have to do to heal' is innapropriate. He is trying to heal, and he doesn't
need people saying things of that sort to his person.
I have the utmost respect for Mr. Peart, not only as a musician, but a
decent, caring human being. I can only hope that you, Mr. Mills, never have
to experience what Neil is experiencing now. I hope nobody on this list, or
in this world, has to deal with this type of thing ever again. Alas, I know
this is an impossibility, and no parent should outlive their child.

None of us can share his pain, and  none of us can understand what he is
feeling. What happened to Neil is a tragedy, and I hope that Neil  finds his
solace as soon as possible.
I just hope that this story is a farce.

   [ As was pointed out a few digests ago, the story was merely fiction.
     Sure got a lot of people riled up though...                : rush-mgr ]

Well, this list will probably come under tons of fire, but you know
what, i am
going to add two lists.
1. Mike Portnoy <my opinion the MOST complicated drummer to imitate,
now whether he set out in life to be more complicated than Neil is
quesionable, but WOW.
3. That guy from Sepultura <i dont know his name, but he must take some
incredible drugs or he's just very over looked cause i can't stand there
music,
but i saw there video tape from a roomate, and he's great.

 ------------------------------------------------
* My taste and technical lists are the same...
1 - NEIL PEART (no doubt 'bout it)
2 - Mike Portnoy
3 - John Bonham
4 - Carl Palmer
5 - Keith Moon
6 - Stewart Copeland (ops... it's the 6th)
* Humm... i disagree with you in the point you said Portonoy is the
first in technique... i think originality and creativity are as
important as to be complicated. And Neil is such more original and
creative.
* The guy from Sepultura is Igor Cavalera... he's from Brazil, like me.
Yep, he's certainly a great drummer, but i think he could be more
technical and less agressive.
* Please forgive my grammatical mistakes, my english is really bad! :(

Cheers from Brazil,

Dear...
	Just as I thought, my pathetic insults have put some into flame. how
come is it so easy to provoke some of you Rushians? You always  take
things so seriously, don't you have anything else to do? And for those
who think this is Julien having schizophrenic tendencies, you are wrong!
However, I have no way of prooving this(If you think of something,
please tell me). I'm his real brother...As for the same adress : we live
inthe same house, he is subscribed to NMS, and I read his posts
everyday. Why wouldn't I sign my name as Julien's brother, it'll just
make you speculate even more, or bombard both of us with falsly-based
pejorative comments. Only a weak-willed individual would succomb to
that.
	But why constantly babble on about Julien's supposedly insane ideas and
motives? Don't you have anything better to do than shut down people's
ideas just because they're not yours or you simply don't agree with
them. Give the guy some respect! He wrote what he thought, that's it!
Where's the crime? Where's the insanity?
	They condemned Jules Verne for insanity because he was the first one to
think of the time-machine or the submarine. and look what happened...
	We can't always shut-down somebody's ideas by expressing  narrow-minded
remarks. Respect it, and politly don't agree. If you are tired of
reading it, don't!

MPK@BDI-AE.COM (Michael P. Kane) wrote this thing about crashing the
stage.

And I think he's right.  Admittedly, running around up there for a
second would be a cool little novelty, but shooting a driver who has
just cut you off in the face would also be a cool little novelty, but
you just don't do it because you hope the guy is worth more than one
stupid act (unless he doesn't like Rush or is a Spice Girls groupie, in
which case you should just shoot him and not worry.)

The idea of enjoying a whole concert is worth more than one stupid act.
Which is why I enjoyed it in Los Angeles when some roadies starting
beating the piss out of this cracker who ran up on stage (RTB?).

In a related story, someone threw an entire beer onto Les Claypool at
Roseland this last Monday night, and the throwee was publicly
castigated.  Now, this is the third time I've seen this happen to Primus
(out of 5 shows).  (Lest you wonder, I'm a Primus groupie, and we
worship a little stuffed doll of Eric Cartman while we snort ajax.  Most
of us have a large bone pierced through our skulls.  Join us.  Help me,
Spock).

Can't we think of some creative suggestions to deal with these morons?
Or should they just be ignored?  Should we ignore the guy who cuts us
off, shoot him in the face, or give him flowers?  Should we give flowers
to just anyone, just because we feel like it?  I don't know.  I'm
confused, so I'm gonna go shoot myself in the face until I stop typing
the phrase 'shoot in the face'.)

Responding to S. Berrets' post:

If they use the H. Odeon show from the Hemispheres tour:
I think we can expect to see Cygnus X-I/Hemispheres for sure,
and probably A Farewell to Kings and Circumstances... it is also
possible that everything except for 2112 will be included (since it was
on ATWAS).
If they use the H. Odeon show from the Perm. Waves Tour:
We'll still get both books of Cygnus (except I think Hemispheres is
abbreviated for that tour) and probably Natural Science too ;-)

So the question is ... which tour will they use? 
I thought before that the complete 2112 might appear on the new live
album, now I think it would be redundant since most of it (- Oracle) was 
done for ATWAS. 

Reading into what was said about Rush not going into the studio
to record this year seems to make sense. Live album late this year,
next studio (?) late 1999 or 1/1/2000. 
Neil writing... one could infer he's working on his second "T4E tour
by motorcycle" book... this is a good thing. and something that should
make for a great read. I hope it inspires some great lyrics for the next
album.
Yup, the English pub psuedo-encounter w NP was believeable, a
good story to ponder if you did actually run in to him. 
Thanks, to everyone posting Rush-related news...and *insider info*..!

Hello Fellow Rush fans,

lee was the guy who got Rush together. I had heard in an interview with Alex
that Geddy interduced him to John Rutsey. And it also my belief that Geddy was

Amusing Rush stories, number 637.

I was at the Milton Keynes Bowl in 1984 for the last ever Status Quo 
gig - well, that's what it was packaged as.  On the bill were 
Nazareth, Marillion etc.  I went principally to see Marillion and to 
attend what we all thought was going to be a historic day.  As it 
turned out Quo decided to go on the road again, but that is 
by-the-by.  During the afternoon, filled with some pretty dreadful 
bands, the DJ came on and cried out, "Does anybody want to hear some 
Rush", to which 20,000 people bellowed "Yeeeeeeessssss".   "Okay, 
here's The Body Electric", to which 20,000 thousand people whispered 
"Noooooooooooooooooooooo".  After all, whenj someone offers you Rush 
through a big PA, you don't need that, do you?

  It was another gloomy weekend with a mix of sleet snow and rain here in 
New England.Confined to indoor quarters I went through all my Rush stuff 
and dusted off my Exit Stage Left video.I popped it in to the VCR and sat 
back to enjoy the show.I hadn't watched this video for quite some time but 
was pleasantly reminded how good it was.The live By-Tor and Trees/Xanadu 
versions are worth the price of the video alone.The only part that wasn't 
so pleasant,to the eye,was the wardrobe of one Alex Lifeson.That Orange 
blazer must of been one of a kind because I've never seen one before or 
after that.My ears were not disappointed and the OPrange blazer was only a 
slight distraction.
I wouldn't rate this video as their best overall production but the set 
list is excellent and shows the band just after the Moving Pictures album 
really coming in to their own.
    Did the band ever release a video following the live "All the World's a 
Stage" album release? I have three concert video's that have been released 
by the band,Exit Stage Left,Grace Under Pressure,and A show of hands,the 
later being my favorite video.The overall audio and video quality are 
excellent and once again the set list is perfect.The wardrobes are even 
respectful so you can't miss with this video.Are there other concert 
video's that have been released by the band ? What are other peoples 
favorite band released video's and for what reasons ?
