  1) There was NOT DIGEST for Monday, 11/12/90.  Sorry folks, I wasn't 
     at work, and didn't have time to log on from home...

  2) This is issue # 100 of The National Midnight Star.  Whew, we've gotten
     through the first 100 issues with the new digest software!

  3) Yes, part four of Success Under Pressure IS coming - it's just been
     delayed a bit.

<A NAME="100002">Subject: Worry, Worry, Worry...</A>

I don't quite understand all of the fuss that has been made lately over the
fact that RUSH played the same surfing music at all of their shows...
Come on, folks!  How do you think that they get all of the lights to move
(i.e. the lights over the crowd, the lasers, etc.) at the right time while
they are playing?  I also saw them twice this tour, once in Albany, NY and
again two days later down in Baltimore, MD (I think that these two were next
to each other on the itinerary, but I digress), and the two shows were
*identical*.  At the Albany show, I had crappy seats (I couldn't see the screen
but had a *perfect* view of Peart), but I could see all of the amps, computers,
and other technical equipment.  I believe that they play each show the same
because all of the lights (not including the manned spots) are controlled (at
least partly) by computer.  Therefore, if they play something different, the
stage-folk would have to re-configure the lighting scheme after every show (or
during the show if the boys wanted to do something impromptu).  This could end
up being *very* tedious.  I hope I have not ruined the experience for anyone
out there, but I just wanted to clear things up...

By the way, speaking of live shows...
I noticed (during the Albany show) that Alex would step on pedals that were
hidden from the crowd by his monitor when he stepped up to the mike (and even
when he didn't).  I finally figured out, with help from a friend who knows
quite a bit about music, recording, and the like, that Alex was stepping on
these pedals to turn on the backing vocals during each song...  I thought that
this was interesting, if not wierd.  I had figured that the vocals would be on
a tape played during the songs, not a sampler.  Can anybody refute or confirm
this observation?

Lastly, I would like to say that I have enjoyed reading most comments and
questions in the "Star" over the last month or so.  I heard of it from another
user here at JHU, and I have enjoyed every minute.  Keep up the good work,
folks!!!

<A NAME="100003">Subject: Early RUSH tour date... opening for T-Rex</A>

I just read that Rush opened for T-Rex at the Worcester Memorial Auditorium,
now called The Aud, sometime in 1974.  I'll try to get the exact date. (I
remember someone here was trying to put together a complete list of gigs
Rush has done... let me know if you already knew about this one)

Anyway, shortly after T-Rex hit the stage, Mark Bolan got PO'd and left the
stage.  Apparenly the 'official' excuse was because the acoustics in the place
sucked, but the folks who were there said it was because the opening act, Rush,
had completely blown away the crowd, and that T-Rex simply couldn't compete.

Just a little Rush trivia for you all....

A lot of the folks on TNMS have been discussing the band Voivod - one usual
comment about the band is that they are a cross between Floyd and Rush.
Since Rush and Floyd are two of my favorite bands, I decided to purchase one
of their albums ("Nothingface"). Here are my impressions...

I'd say the Rush-meets-Floyd comparison is mistaken. The band is lacking the
spacey/melodic Floyd sound, and the lyrics don't hold a candle to Peart's
work. A better comparison may be "Syd Barrett meets King Crimson" - their
cover of "Astronomy Domine" is excellent, and several songs seem to draw
their influence heavily from "Larks Tongues in Aspic."

Anyway, I was really disappointed with the album. Maybe it's the vocals - I
just don't like the lead singer's voice. Is "Nothingface" typical of their
albums, or are there any others I should try before I write off this band?

Good day, and welcome to the FIRST ANNIVERSARY!!!

First off, congrats to everyone for getting this wonderful digest to
its first year (and the crowd goes wild!)!

Well...someone mentioned Westwood One doing something with RUSH.  Ihave
been listening/watching for anything--nothing so far as I know.  I did
miss listening in for awhile after Presto came out, so I may have
missed them, assuming an interview was done with them at that time.  I
doubt they'll be planning on doing any RUSH stuff soon, but I'm
keeping my ears open!   Good day, eh!

<A NAME="100007">Subject: Chron. video, planetarium</A>

Hi folks, I bought the Chronicles video today.  In a nutshell, the the
production quality was good, the video quality was lousy.  I'm sure this isn't
the first review so I'll be brief.  There are 12 tracks including Closer,
Trees, Mystic Rhythms, Time Stand Still and Lock & Key.  They didn't include
the Fly by Night promo films, or the 4 other pre-Hemispheres promos.  Yes,
these exist.  The delay on the video was no doubt caused by the band trying
to keep those from being released.  The video had a professional style to it,
like Through the Camere Eye did.  The quality, however, was crappy.  My copy
has major problems with the hi-fi tracking.  I have a high-end VCR but still
couldn't get rid of the nasty buzz caused by a bad hi-fi track.  It was also
pretty hissy, and the early promos weren't in stereo.  The video was noisy
and Red Barchetta, (live, from Exit..), seemed to have really bad color
problems.  Overall, not too impressive.  I'm sure the video disk will be
much better.  I would still highly recommend this for any fan and $19.95 is
a great buy!

  Also, the number again for the Morrison Planetarium is 415 750-7138.  The
Rush Laserium show should play for a few months, depending on it's success.
It's located at the Calif. Academy of Sciences, in Golden Gate Park, San
Francisco, CA.  You can buy tickets through Ticketron or at the door for
about $6.  Did anyone out there see the 1984 laser show??!

                                                          Take care,

  In the NTM, someone mentioned that Geddy Lee liked YES.  I saw the same
interview, and yes, je does like the group YES.  They do have a song called
"The Fish" which is just a jam between The five band members.  It was
released in 1972 on the _FRAGILE_ album.

<A NAME="100009">Subject: Anagram (for Mongo)</A>

There's something bothering me about Anagram, although it took me a long
time to realize it.  Consider this:

     Rush/Anagram: "There is no safe seat at the feast / Take your best
		    stab at the beast."

     The Eagles/Hotel California:
		   "In the master's chambers / They gather for the feast /
		    They stab it with their steely knives / But they just
		    can't kill the beast."

Is it possible that Rush could've borrowed (unconsciously or otherwise)
from "Hotel California?"

Also, as to the theory that "Anagram" is another stab at religion, certain
lines struck me as having that meaning.  Possibly as many as 1/3 of the
verses in fact.  But the remainder of the song doesn't seem to be related
to that theme (although I could really stretch a few verses to make them
fit.)

        I don't know what happened to her either.  The last thing
I remember of her was about two years ago; she posted something
about Rush which was very slightly wrong--she'd transposed the
order of two songs on an album or something.  So I followed up
the message, correcting her, and informing her facetiously that
she'd let us all down, and that I was totally disillusioned, my
faith in the Rush Goddess shattered.

	I can't recall ever seeing another message from her.  I
hope she didn't evaporate or something, like Apollo in that
Star Trek episode... :)

	Wow! This is issue 100!!!!  Well anyway someone
asked about album covers done by Hugh Syme other than
RUSH, Styx, and Whitesnake.  Well, I noticed that the
cover for the new album by Heavy Metal group
Slaughter was done by Glen Wexler & Hugh Syme.  The
album is called Stick It To Ya.  Pretty cool, huh?

<A NAME="100013">Subject: What Neil Means</A>

This was taken from the recent Blue Spotlight featuring Rush on
MuchMusic. It is a short clip with Neil talking about his lyrics,
recorded in Jan 90 that they showed in between videos.
I thought it would fit in here, with all the talk about different
meanings behind different songs lately.

NEIL:
A lot of people don't care about lyrics and they don't have to. Again, I
don't think that's important. The important thing is that they're affected
by the music and if they like it that's fine, need never pay any attention
to the lyrics except as sounds, and I have to think of that too when I'm
writing lyrics; they are sounds that have to be sung and I think of them
just in a purely euphonious way. It just has to be a nice sounding series of
syllables and then if I can get an interrelation of rhythm in there that
satisfies me as a craftsman and if I can get some other symbolism in there
that might be even just personal that will just make me happier with it, so
nothing's lost, you know, nobody suffers. But when somebody takes that
vagueness and all that big collection of images and possible interpretations
and takes it in such a diametrically opposed way, to anything I'd ever even
*thought* of, let alone intended, it's a little scary but you have to say
well that's good you know, they were able to take what they wanted out of
it.

Yo Rushheads,

     Thanks much for the anniversary issue to all involved; twas rather
informative and interesting!

     Secondly, to Meg's question about the boyz heights. I don't know actual
numbers, but you can get a good estimate (at least in relation to one another
and their wives) from a picture of the six of them standing in _Visions_. I
don't know the exact page number, but it's early in the book, I think.

     About Geddy's basses-- I'm very particular to that Rick/Jazz sound he got
prior to, I think, _Grace Under Pressure_. The Steinberger is a little sterile
to me, although very light and compact, and the Wal's top end is great, but
really lacking bottom, at least from what I've heard of him playing it. It
could all be a matter of Geddy's EQ'ing, though. He claims to have a 5-string
Wal model, and I'd REALLY like to heard some B string action on the new album.
Does anyone know exactly what Ged was going through for such songs as YYZ and
the solo in Vital Signs? Sounds like chorus or flanging of some sort.

     Looks like I may be sitting in with a local band to do YYZ tonight
(exercising plucking fingers as I type). Should be a helluva good time.

Well, I sent a fax down to the company selling the Japanese Rush CD's
asking for song titles and record dates.  They called me a couple of
days later and told me that there was nothing special about the CD's.
They are not live recordings.  The discs are simple the Japanese
versions of the American CD's.  The reason that the titles were
different is that they have been translated into Japanese and then
back into English.

I realize I dont post alot here.  Sure like reading it all though.
The last few issues have been real good.  The 3 of 4 parts of
Success under pressure, and the anniversary issues.  I remember
reading a few posts about people seeing RUSH at Alpine Valley, WI.
I saw the Presto show there this summer.  Had crappy seats, but
never a dull moment.  I was at the first of two shows there, got
rained on for about an hour, but right before the show opened, it
stopped.  Every time lightning struck, the whole place went
ballistic.  I guess I say we had crappy seats cause we were
sitting right under one of the loud speakers, and I guess the
sound coming from that, and the slightly delayed sound coming from
the stage (because of the distance) didn't mix too well.

Anyways, it was kinda neat (to me) when during YYZ, Alex broke a
string and we got to hear about 10 seconds of the song with just
drums and bass...  Definitely not record material, but I got off
on it.

[ Yep, I heard a tape where Alex broke a string during "Red Barchetta",
  and Geddy & Neil had to continue.  He did an amazingly fast switch, and
  picked back up in about 7 seconds! (GUP tour)                 :rush-mgr ]

I wished I coulda stayed overnight there to see the next days
show, but living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan made it about
a 300 plus mile trip, and the clock for the babysitter was
running!  It turned out to be expensive, but most worth it.

I had to buy 2 T-shirts at that one...

>X-Mailer: Mail User's Shell (7.0.4 1/31/90)

	Last week someone@somewhere requested lyrics for either
"Anthem" or "Beneath, Between, Behind" (I forget which).  At the
risk of boring those who know them, here they are, reprinted from
the lyric sheet where they're neatly lettered in Neil Peart's
hand.

		Anthem

Know that your place in life
Is where you want it to be
Don't let them tell you that
You owe it all to me
Keep on looking forward
There's no use in looking round
Carry your head above the crowd
And they won't bring you down

(chorus)
Anthem of the heart and mind
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
We marvel after those who sought
New wonders in the world they wrought

Live for yourself, there's no one
More worth living for
Begging hands and bleeding hearts
Will only cry for more

'Though I know they've always
Told you selfishness is wrong
Yet it was for me not you
I came to write this song

	Beneath, Between, & Behind

Ten score years ago
Defeat the kingly foe
A wondrous dream came into being
Tame the trackless waste
No virgin land left chaste
All shining eyes and never seeing

(chorus)
Beneath the noble bird
Between the proudest words
Behind the beauty, cracks appear
Once with heads held high
They sang out to the sky
Why do their shadows bow in fear

Watch the cities rise
Another ship arrives
Earth's melting pot, and ever growing
Fantastic dreams come true
Inventing something new
The greatest minds, but never knowing

The guns replace the plow
Facades are tarnished now
The principles have been betrayed
The dreams gone stale
But still let hope prevail
Hope that history's debt won't be repaid

	Somewhat similar themes, no?  Perhaps we see an earlier
version of the attitude that prevails in "Territories".  Can anyone
venture an opinion as to what "history's debt" might be?  I'd
like to relate it to the founding of the USA, but it's difficult
for me.  Perhaps someone with a better grasp of the issue can
elaborate?  I see "Anthem" as a much more personal piece regarding
independence, while "BB&B" is more institutional.

	By the way, are we just a bunch of computer-oriented stereotypical
physical scince techno geeks :-) on the NMS list, or do we have some, say,
historians, social scientists, or literature specialists with us?
Or am I the only science nerd here?

Hello fellow RUSHians,

    I would like to congratulate our exteem manager for a job
well done in the first 100 issues of the The National Midnight
Star.  And I eagerly await perhaps countless hundreds to come.

    The TNMS has given me greater insight into my favorite
group and has educated me on items I did not know about RUSH.
And I look forward in furthing my education with this mailing
list.

    I have have looked (not in the right places) for the lyrics
of all their albums from their self-titled to Presto and in
one week-end, our manager has given me all of them.  A tip of
the hat to him.  Thanks.  I feel that much complete having all
of the lyrics.

    I have stated in the TNMS at issue 65 and I am in the
process of get all of the back issues.  And I would like to
tip the same hat to Helan Todd for her help.  Thanks.

    I have gotten interested in the group ever since they came
to St. John's Nfld.  I saw them once and I was hooked.  the
concert was the "Hold Your Fire" tour in October of 1987.  I
became hooked on that group ever since.  I thoroughly enjoy
the master of lyrics, the professor himself.

   Anyhow, keep up the great work and I look forward in getting
more of the TNMS.

John.
