Hello all out there in net-land!  I'd like to welcome you all to a New
Year of The National Midnight Star (it's true).  Let's hope this year
sees continued expansion of the list, and many interesting and pithy
discussions.

Just a bit of administrivia; there were no mailings of TNMS between
Friday, 12/21/90 and today, Wednesday, 1/2/91.  Sorry to all out there
who were looking for a few shreds of non-work mail to break up the hum-
drum existance of work the week between Christmas & New Years.  I thought
I'd be able to get out a couple of issues that week, but a combination of
factors prevented it.

It's now 1991 (all those with digital watches, check to make sure they
changed), and hopefully the NMS will continue it's regimine of releasing
a new issue almost every weekday, with special editions sprinkled in.

One interesting bit of trivia; once I'd plowed through 90 mail items (on
the mailing list accounts alone!), after the end-of-term rush (sic) of 
removals due to school & vacations it looks like during the 1 1/2 weeks
in between then and now, the list actually grew more than shrank!  We're
at a "low mark" of just over 530 members, but I think we'll make it over
600 before the end of February!

One last thing, in response to mail received here at the administrative
address:  if you are interested in setting up a local redistribution point
at your site, and think that you can keep it up and running, feel free to
drop me a line here to coordinate things.  There are already two or three
such redist. points, and I've recently received a question about another
one.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a great idea - it reduces net-wide
traffic.  I only ask that you try to keep a somewhat current list of who's
on and who isn't.

One last note:  as the NMS does get sent almost every weekday, if you haven't
received a copy for several days, you might want to check with me at the 
administrative address (as always, see the end of each issue for correct
addresses).  This may be due to network/site problems (you people in the UK
and on UUNET take heed; you're the most popular candidates), or the fact that
you may have been removed from teh mailing list.  Generally people get 
dropped from the list due to their request, but there are times a userid is
removed for other reasons.  This could be due to messages indicating that
the userid no longer exists, the site no longer exists, or I get several
bounces indicating 'undeliverable mail' or that a mailbox is full.  In these
cases I have to assume that the person has either left for good, lost the
account, or is on an extended vacation/leave of absence.  So, if you are
expecting to hear from us and don't, drop me a line to see what's up!

Editor,
The National Midnight Star

Happy Holidays youns all,

While home for Xmas, I watched MTV for the first time in a coon's age.
Although I didn't see any Rush, and didn't really *expect* to, I got to
wonderin'...

Has anything from the 'Chronicles' compilation been shown on MTV yet?
And if so, what?

Thanks

Happy New Year everyone....  Just a couple thoughts here

>Who says <phrase> in <song>?

Anybody ever hear the deep voice in Show Dont Tell, following really
close to Geddy?  I have heard two spots, one is "I will be the Judge"
where "I" is a little before Geddy, and the rest is pretty much sung
along.  The second is shortly after during "give the jury direction".

Pretty Neato

>What is a Lerxt?

>   A Lerxt is an Alex Lifeson.

I think it is a little more.  It always seemed obvious that A Lerxst
sounds real close to Alice (in wonderland).  Weird movie

On the topic of Rush on the radio:

	For you Cincinnati / Hamilton / Dayton, OH fans, listen to WZRQ,
	96.5 MHz FM.  They're a new rock station (used to be a good station
	until it went country three years ago).  It's back, and with a
	*vengence*.  It started as all Zeppelin, but in the past five
	hours, I've heard two Rush songs, not to mention other great rock
	and metal groups such as Damn Yankees, Slaughter, Extreme, Kiss,
	Ozzy, and Lynch Mob.  It's a great new station!

On the topic of Mr. Big:

	Forgive me for this, but I feel it's something I have to say.  I am
	an obhective fan of Mr/ Big.  I recently purchased a Japanese
	Import of theirs ... it was a compilation of live performances from
	the 'Presto' tour.  Due to important family obligations, I missed
	every show within 250 miles of Cincinnati :(, so I did not see this
	tour.  But, the live Mr. Big stuff sounds great.  They played well
	together, and Paul Gilbert was incredible.  Now, I can see that
	some of the music may not appeal to everyone.  I thought the power
	drill was a *neat* effect (the CD contains one of his solos).  It
	was *different*, and maybe it turned some folks off.  Who knows.

On the topic of Bitmaps:

	I have been unable to connect to the server that contains these
	bitmaps.  As a result, I have a small request for whoever put them
	there.  I took the time to scan all of those images, and without
	sounding like I'm whining, I would like to ask that person that
	they somehow include my name/Email address as part of the help file
	that is available.  Thanks! :)

On the topic of the new year:

	Happy New Year everyone.  I may not say a whole lot on the digest,
	but I really like it, and the conversations that are carried on.
	It's a great source  of information.  I look forward to a new year
	of conversations!  I also hope the new year brings out another
	great release from The Boyz!

On the topic of goodbyes:

	- Jeff
