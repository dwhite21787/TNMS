This is a test of the RUSH Fans Digest.  There seems to be a problem with
the setup, but management is not sure at this point why.

There was a (theoretical) mailing on Monday, Oct. 1st.  I never received
my verification copy, and it's not in the outgoing mail queue.  Upon
checking the syslog for 10/1, I found an entry stating:

    named: ns_req:TOO many findns calls.  Auto HUP begins.
    named: reloading nameserver

I don't know exactly what this means, but I think it squelched the Digest
for yesterday.  One possibility is that the list is too long; that's the
reason for this short mail message.

If you did receive a Digest for Monday, 10/1, please send mail to:

    rush-request@syrinx.umd.edu

letting me know so.

No adjustment to your set is necessery at this point... stay tuned for more
details.

Manager,
RUSH Fans Digest
