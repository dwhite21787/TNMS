Some more real Rush news... I have heard rumors that the new album is
tenatively titled "Dimlit Stages For All Ages" (according to someone who
forwarded me an AOL board post, which supposedly came from Atlantic!)
I can't seem to find the original post, but it seemed to come from the AP
service. Now I can't verify this as actual fact, but it sounded legit.

And can we please stop discussing how great/shitty Alex Van Halen's drumming
is, it's gone beyond normal Rush content. Thank you.

Hi Rush pypolez---

Just to chime in that Rush ***must*** be coming out with something in the
next few months. I say this because I have also noticed that Rush has faded
from the radio airwaves the past few years. They get thrown back into the
rotation more heavily when something is coming out by them--that is to say
that station programmers are probably instructed to add it back in when a
new release is imminent. I have noticed this both on KGB and KIOZ in Sandy
Eggo of late.

song together, probably more smoothly than ever before or since.  My
next vote would be for Natural Science (just happens to be my favorite
song).

You may be confusing the beginning of 2112 with the end of Supertramps'
Fools Overture,   which was released at about the same time.  Perhaps you
heard them back to back late one night and got the ending of one mixed up
with the beginning of the other.  Maybe you were in an altered state of

<A NAME="2060005">Subject: Alex Van Halen, Drumming In General</A>

Hey all you whacky Rush fan type people:

Just thought I'd weigh in on the whole Alex Van Halen thread.  

First off, I'd have to say I like Alex's drumming.  I'll agree with
someone else who said that the guy doesn't have the tightest technical
skill in the world.  In fact, I'd say that that's part of his charm.
Really, if all drumming were was a contest to see who could play the most
clever fills at the highest pace, nobody would be talking about Neil Peart
as the best drummer in rock music.  Don't get me wrong -- the man has
extremely fast hands and is more coordinated on the drums than most, but
if it were a sheer question of speed, he wouldn't win.  It's what he
plays, when, and why he plays it that makes him a fantastic drummer.  Same
deal for Alex -- although I must say he pales in comparison to Neil.

Think of it this way.  I have a gigantic amount of respect for any drummer
who can find just a simple beat for a song as long as it either a)
complements the song where the song needs complementing or b) drives the
whole song along.  Both are hard to do, neither really REQUIRE formidable
technical ability.

Larry Mullen Jr. of U2 is always my favorite example.  In terms of
technical skill, he's probably the worst drummer in a well-known band that
I've ever heard.  But think of the beats he's chosen, the small little
touches he's thrown in.  Joshua Tree could not have been the masterpiece
it was with a different drummer.  Has anybody else really heard a beat
quite like the one he plays on With Or Without You in rock?  I certainly
haven't.  Same deal for the songs on the rest of the album.  Or on any of
their albums since The Unforgettable Fire (where U2 finally came into
their own).

Try to imagine what a mess Joshua Tree would have been with a drummer like
Neil Peart.  The drums have to go with the music, and Neil, for all his
formidable technical skill, probably would have made the album a lesser
album in the end.  I have to admit, though, I've always admired Neil for
"getting out of the way" of the music where he shouldn't be going too
crazy.  When you have skills like Neil possesses, it's a tough call in
terms of suppressing your own ego just to tone yourself down when the
music calls for it.  

I am NOT trashing Neil here.  He certainly has an artistic ear and plays
what's right for the music.  As I said, he's really not famous for his
technical skill so much as he's famous for what he plays, when he plays
it, and why he plays it, and how he plays it with such precision and
melodic grace (few drummers can claim to be melodic...Neil is one).  I'm
merely saying that stylistically he'd never have cut it, just like he'd
probably never quite cut it on a Van Halen album (although he'd be closer
there).  So don't dis Alex Van Halen for his technical skills and declare
he's a bad drummer.  Just LISTEN to the drums and let them hit you as a
part of the MUSIC as a WHOLE, THEN tell me whether he's great, good, or
terrible.  I think he's good.  Others don't.  It's all good :).

And now I have happily procrastinated away ten minutes of time at work,
and feel much better as a result.  Thank you, TNMS.

a bit off the latest rush topics, so i apologize(sorry rush mgr. and list 
members).  but i know a lot of nms'ers know the music business, so i've 
got a question on re-using a song.  if i were to record a rush, beatles, 
stones etc. song and put it on a cd with other original songs, sell it at 
my stores, and not make a profit but just try and make back some of the 
costs of production, what laws am i breaking?
what do i have to do, to do this legally?  what are the licensing and 
copyright laws, and how much will it cost me to use a "non-original" song?
private emails, please.
any assistance is greatly appreciated.  thanks in advance.

     I am sure there are a few... If anyone is interested in Fates Warning
you can go to the Island In The Stream website: http://www.ivorygate.com/fw
and check out plenty of information on them, audio files and on how to join
the Parallels mailing list.

     I remember reading an interview with them once where they talked about
the first time they met Terry Brown in the studio (he produces most of
their albums). They were all such big Rush fans that the first thing they
played for him was the opening to Hemispheres. I think they said something
like it made Terry go nuts, because he had spent so much time/energy on
that album...  hehe

My vote's are for Limelight, Afterimage, No One At The Bridge, Ghost of
A Chance, Middletown Dreams and Bravado (in no particular order).
Limelight is pure brilliance with the sustaining note that leads into
the arpeggios. Afterimage solo just makes you want to sob for hours. No
One At The Bridge is a slap in the face and one of my personal favs to
pull off on guitar. Ghost of A Chance makes me feel warm and fuzzy all
over.
Middletown Dreams....words cannot express and Bravado's simplicity makes
it that much cooler. 
      There are of course many more Lerxst solo's that are worthy of
attention, but these stand out in my Rush world.

It's time to answer a few ? & comments...

>Opinions. Yes, all opinions are welcomed in TNMS, but if I want negative
thoughts, I don't need to go on line for them. It seems a tragic waste of
energy to have so many people posting about "this band sucks," "that drummer
sucks," or "my band can beat up your band." If you subscribe to TNMS, then it
would seem that Rush holds some importance in your life. So why not celebrate
that there is a band like Rush that you can listen to?

>RADIO. I can describe radio in one word: SH*T! Now it's a sad fact that Rush
doesn't get much airplay in certain markets, but neither do so many other
deserving bands! Face it, radio is a commodity today. Music needs to appeal to
the widest range of people to be played. It's a sad but true fact! "The spirit
of radio" is long gone. Back in the 60s & 70s, before big business discovered
it, FM was a great place to hear music. Now the best thing a Rush fan can do
is turn the damn radio off and put on a Rush CD!!!!! Grab those remasters and
become the master of your own music destiny! Put a Rush CD on and take that
Red Barchetta out for a cruise! 

I listen to a lot of jazz and progressive rock. Radio ignores that too, So I
ignore radio!!! As Howard Beal said in the book/movie network, "I'm mad as
hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!" So turn those radios off! It's
time to have radio free Earth!!! Do yourself a favor and put on a tape/CD.

>Required positive content: Look at the bright side, there's only 90 days
(+/-) until the live Rush set comes out!!!! That'll help ease the pain of
summer being over once again. That's all those days of anticipation until we
can rejoice again at some unheard Rush music! Go for it!

Hey gang...
While I don't think Alex VanHalen sucks, I too feel that there are many
others above him. I've seen VH several times, and I've got to tell you, he's
competant. At the first show I saw, 1984, I couldn't help but think, geez,
he's got way to many drums for what he's doing. Whereas Neil uses all his
drums, cymbals, and other assorted noise makers all the time, Alex didn't,
except for during his solo. I mean, 4 bass drums? Who the hell needs that,
except for affect? He's a good drummer, but not too close to the top of my
list, which BTW way, includes:
NP, Ian Mosley, Carl Palmer, Buddy Rich(not just because of NP..), and the
late great Cozy Powell. Those are in order BTW...
Just my two cents worth, not to be taken as fact...

Hey again gang....
Ok, while I've never been so blown away as I was with the RTB tour, I've got
to say that the only other time I was so moved was at the Yes-Big Generator
tour back in 1987. No lasers, just amazingly choreographed lights that may
as well have been lasers for what they did. Perfectly blended with smoke
generators, it was the most amazing thing I'd since until RTB in 91. You
want emotion, go see a Yes concert. Not that Rush doesn't have emotion, but
you know what I mean..Ta ta for now..

I agree that Alex Van Halen is a very talented drummer. Although, recent
Van Halen albums have been decent at best, if you listen to the earlier
stuff you can really appreciate what he does. i.e Hot for Teacher, Loss of
Control, everything off of the first album ect...also keep in mind that
Alex had to invent his parts besides playing them. I personally can't stand
people who don't play the drums and bash other drummers. I am partial to
Neil Peart as most Rush fans are but most other drummers don't play in a
Rush type setting where being progressive and having many technical parts
is necessary. If you have read past issues of Modern Drummer you will see
that Neil has been quoted as saying "it's what fits in the song that
matters not how many fills you play". And one other item of interest, there
are many basic drummers (because of the role they are hired to play) that
can play like monsters outside of their hired project's. i.e Vinne Coluita
(Sting's drummer ), plus thousand's of other's.

I was wondering about this myself, but I'm quite certain that Presto is not
available as a remaster. As I understand it, the remastering process was
only applied to those albums which been originally intended for release
mainly on vinyl and cassette. When Presto was released, the mastering was
done with CDs in mind, so no remaster was/is necessary. Confirm/deny?

I think TFE is the first album not to be released on vinyl.

What's the going rate on a guitar solo?  Cuz I swear I hallucinate whenever 
I listen to Alex's solo at the end of "Mission."  It is truly a moving 
piece of guitar wizardry that conjures up some heavy imagery.

Thanks for indulging.  Stay hungry . . . like the wolf.

Just a note to "state of radio". I used to live in NH and the rock 
station there would play only play RUSH if the songs were Tom Sawyer, or 
Limelite or Subdivisions. . I mean those are kool songs but too much air 
play. Now I live in Seattle and the local rock station ther e plays all 
RUSH tunes from all the albums including YYZ which usually instrumentals 
are a no-no on the radio. So you see there are some stations will to 
expose all RUSH's material. Infact, this station was the first one of 
the stations to help  RUSH jump the border and were the first station to 
start giving RUSH american air play. 
now, I don't want to jump into this silly Alex-Neil thing but here's a 
guy(Neil) who when he recorded Counterparts and I quote" I came in sat 
down, turned up everything as loud as it would go, play the entire  
album in ONE setting,  got up and walked away"! There are absolutely NO 
drum overdubbs/mixes-nothing on the Counterpats album. Try that Alex!
Thanxs all for listening.

<A NAME="2060025">Subject: Cut To The Chase</A>

A couple quick things...
1. In regard's to Shawn Quirks statement, I love Van Halen for one. I also
love many other bands...of course Rush is my favorite, just look at my E-Mail
adress. My fav. 7 bands are, in this order, Rush, Kiss, Megadeth, Led
Zeppelin, Dream Theater, Van Halen and 10,000 Maniacs (With or without
Natalie). I notice many other bands...not necessarily Rush related. Check out
Day's of the New if you have'nt they are amazing.

2. Kiss fan's who bought Bruce Kulicks solo cd UNION, may or may not have
noticed the phrase "Roll the Bones" in the song Tangerine. Could this possibly
be, could Kulick, who wrote the song, be a Rush fan...linking Rush and Kiss,
my two favorite bands.
  
3. As I sit here listening to the radio, typing this post "The Spirit of
Radio" just came on. Sadly the only songs our station KEZO play from Rush are
Working Man, Fly By Night, Closer to the Heart, The Spirit of Radio, Tom
Sawyer, Limelight, Subdivisions, and New World Man. Oh well, who needs radio I
have 40 different Rush cd's to listen too, as well as 400 from other bands

4. To answer a post about favorite tv shows...Mine are Seinfeld, Mad About
You, and if they count ,South Park, and Beavis and Butt-Head (I seen on an
episode of Beavis and Butt-Head, that during the video "Stick It Out" Beavis
appeared to be a fan.

5. To answer another post...I have a Rush compilation called "The Tales of
Three Men of Willowdale" that I listen too in the car with these songs:
Overture, Return of the Prince, Bravado, You Bet Your Life, Everyday Glory,
The Color of Right, Natural Science, Witch Hunt, The Weapon, The Enemy Within,
Before and After, Closer to the Heart (Live ' 93) and Bad Boy (Live '74).

I may be a part of Generation X (Born 8-19-79) but I know good music. Dirk,
Lerxst, and Pratt are amazing...as well as members from so many other bands,
that I don't feel I need to waste your time listing.

6. A quick idea for a thread...Choose the members (no Rush member) you would
pick for an ultimate band...Like on Bass: Les Claypool, Vocals: Dave Mustaine,
Guitar: Eric Clapton and Drums: Mike Potnoy.

Sorry for such a long post.

The difference is that a museum buys or receives its art as donation - legal

In spirit I agree with most of your points. In that I work for a company
which deals in inventing, patenting, & developing new technology I can't
agree completely.

My biggest criticism of bootlegging (not that I've never owned any) is the
loss of *creative control* that the artist has. The $$$$, in my estimation
are not a real loss, as the people who buy bootlegs also buy commercial
releases. I disagree with people profiting from bootleg sales - this is
contrary to the spirit in which they are made.

Suggestions/votes for a song from FBN?  I'm having trouble deciding...

Now on my headphones: Marillion, _Misplaced Childhood_, "Childhood's End".  
Pretty cool (Fish is like a nifty hybrid of Peter Gabriel and Roger

Well, I've not been bashing the guy (just saying he's not exactly the

(along with that of Roger Taylor and Neil Peart and Nick Mason and, upon
occasion, Pete Roraback and Herb from Primus), and I've been playing for
about 8 years now, (semi/pro-fessionally myself for only about two,
now...) and so I, too, know what I'm talking about.  (This wasn't really
for any point other than to establish my credibility for all
percussion-related posts I've made.)  True, I occasionally "modify" the
parts a bit (i.e. I don't play exactly note-for-note what's played on the
CD most of the time), and I pick some of the "easier" stuff to play (I'm
not fast enough to do double-bass work on a single peddle...I could only
wish I was...), but I do play with some of his stuff, and...well, like I
said, he's not exactly the most talented in the field.  But, like I said
before in a previous post, he's good for what he does.

Are you saying Alex's groove can't be copied by other drummers?  If

to play to their grooves quite a bit, so it seems odd to think that Gadd
or Weckle wouldn't be able to copy Alex's groove, too.  Yeah, they might
have different ideas than Alex with what to do to the drum parts, but the
music *lends* itself to Alex's groove, and I have a feeling that other
pro drummers playing a VH tune might find themselves playing Alex-esque
stuff, as opposed to things they would normally play.  (Mike Portnoy
played some Neil-esque stuff on the Working Man tribute, although I think
he got a bit carried away upon occasion...and if you think back to "Best
I Can" and all the stuff from the first album that's played on ATWAS, I
think you'll find that Neil is playing in Rutsey's groove.  Sure, Neil's
playing his own stuff, but the songs lended themselves to a Rutsey-esque
groove, which Neil provided...)

of his playing.  Second of all, who the hell are you to crtisize Alex Van
Halen, the way I see it, hes famous, succesful, and your not....who
sucks??????>>

Not true.  I can tell Neil just from the sound of his hi-hat.  I can tell
Roger Taylor by the sound of his crash and his ride (and the way he
rides, most of the time), and his tom tuning.  (All this within the
context of a song, of course...you can't just play a sample of one little
thing for me and expect me to get it every time.  But, if you can play
just a bit of the drum track for me (not enough for me to hear the
style), I can get it.)  I can tell Alex, Roger, Neil, Nick Mason of Pink
Floyd, Charlie Wyatt of the Stones, Phil Ehart of Kansas, and more...all
of them by their playing style (as well as little quirks and particular
rhythms they have when they play).  Alex is just the only drummer in the
world who you can pick out by the sound of his kit and playing style if
you happen to *not* be a drummer and therefore not be in the habit of
listening for all the little quirks and tuning and sound differences in
hi-hats and cymbals and such.  (I said that for the benefit of
non-drummers, of which there's many...)

As for the next comment...while I've never heard him play a drum solo
(which is the only real way to judge a drummer, as most of the time,
unless they're *playing* a solo, a drummer will play down to the level of
the band, not to the limits of his own talent (even Neil does this...) ),
judging from everything else I've ever heard him do, I'm SOOOO much
better than Lars Ulrich when it comes to playing on a single BD-peddle. 
(He could whup my ass on double peddles because of one
thing...experience.)  But, he happens to be in Metallica, and not me. 
Lars didn't make Metallica famous...Metallica made Lars famous.  As to
defuse your argument, let's try this...go to a bar or something, and
listen to a virtually no-name drummer to knows what he's doing.  Then,
with that in mind, go home and listen to Bush (yes, Bush, with a 'B'),
and listen to *that* drummer.  Then, come back and honestly tell me the
guy from Bush is better than the guy who's unknown but probably actually
took drum lessons and taught himself a vast majority of the things he
does, rather than some guy from England who can just simply beat on the
drums in tempo (which takes about as much talent as picking your nose, I
might add).  Or, listen to the drum solo from "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida", and
tell me that's the most impressive piece of work you've ever heard,
because the guy who played it was famous.  If I took the time to sit down
and write out which section goes where, I could play it, too, and
probably improve it in about 15 minutes.  Does that still mean that I
suck compared to Ron Bushy?  Good god, I hope not...

I'll give you one thing, though, and one thing only: Alex Van Halen is
good for what he does.

<A NAME="2060036">Subject: Re: Bashing AVH</A>

I don't know why everyone has been on Alex Van Halen's case of late,
especially on the "Rush" list, but I feel compelled to come to his
defense. Alex does what he is required to do within the context of the
band, no more no less. He isn't the greatest drummer around, but he's a
hell of a lot better than many on this list give him credit for. What he
does do in VH is just fine, it works and for the most part it's
tasteful. He's been a successful musician for over 2 decades, and plays
very well on his band's latest release. I was also impressed with his
playing on the recent MTV "10 Spot" concert from Sydney. I've seen the
guy live, and firmly believe he did no "extra tracking" on "Hot for
Teacher". I'm a drummer myself, and have played professionally for about
25 years. You can take that or leave it, but I do have some knowlege on
the subject.

Having said that...

I can't understand why some of you feel the need to bash a musician for
doing the best he can within the framework of his band? No, Alex
couldn't be the drummer of Rush today. He is not the technician that
Neil Peart has always been. Alex might even have trouble with some of
the earlier material (FbN, CoS). Is that a knock against him? I don't
think so. There are very few with the chops to handle that assignment
(Mike Portnoy comes to mind...). Could Neil play in Van Halen? Of
course, but would he want to? Probably not. Does that make VH a lousy
band? Not at all. Some would argue that VH is better than Rush because
they have been more successful financially. Like anything else, that is
a matter of opinion and pure conjecture. Most all of us here would argue
for Rush for entirely different reasons. I doubt any member of either
band has too many regrets regarding their place in music history, or
their financial portfolio.

Why not talk about Rush, Neil and what they have accomplished. Why not
talk about what is yet to come for Rush (...or what we hope is yet to
come). Leave the opinions of Van Halen's musical abilities and validity
to the Van Halen list. Likewise Metallica, etc. etc. etc.

In responz to RUSHME000@AOL.COM'z post... 

Good post..I agree with you..cant believe I agree with an AOLer ;-)
I cant think of the number of times ppl responded with "They are still
together???", upon hearing that I was going to the Rush concerts last 
year.  Mind you, I am from a major market, Chicago, where there *was* 
advertising in the newspapers (there prob was some on the radio, but I 
rarely listen to the stations here for music *sigh*).  There was a nice 
turnout for both legs of the show here...altho I dont think there were 
sellouts, near sellouts tho.

I think it will be hard to get MTV to play rush, since its basically a 
top 20 (of several genres) video channel.  IMHO, VH1 and The Box (yes 
The Box, since it does play exactly what you request) should be targeted 
by us.  It would be great if VH1 did a "Legends" segment on Rush...or 
get some kind of "lifetime achievement" award.  Another thing ppl can do 
is wear rush t-shirts, esp ones featuring the later CDs and concerts..
so ppl will know that rush is still alive.

You are right. In the last few years of music, there have been a rising
tide of mediocrity.  Not just in rock, but in jazz, rap, soul, etc 
(yes...I listen to more than just rock).  I have over 300 CDs of various 
kinds of music.  But, lately I have no real desire to go CD shopping, 
due to the lack of quality music in nearly all genres.  Due to the lack 
of good music, in the last few years I have started getting into reggae 
(bob marley is incredible) and acid jazz (yes I know traditional jazz is 
"better").  I also like some of the latin jazz, I just dont know the 
names of the bands ;-(  Now if only today's music went retro with
the fashion, maybe we would have a reckoning in music....

But one thing we have to admit: nothing lasts forever.  Rush has 
released tonz of albums, all going atleast Gold.  That is a huge 
achievement, esp for a band that were always diff from the mainstream.  
Very few artists of any musical genre have lasted as long as rush.  
Hopefully the industry will realize this one day.

But I disagree that rush fans should take the issue on their shoulder
and bombard radio stations with rush requests.  As we all should know
by now, rush doesnt care about being top 10.  Over the years, they have
had numerous occasions to make themselves more popular, ie hiring Chuck
D to do the rap for RTB (maybe then the rap wouldnt have sounded so
corny ;-)), also peart could have possibly have had phil collins as
a guest drummer on the BFB cdz (phil is a very competent drummer, who
will be releasing a jazz version of his songs...he jammed on the set
too!  IMHO he should have been on BFB).  True that the BFB project isnt 
"rush"...but I am sure it helped rush exposure to non-rock listeners 
in some way.  BTW, ne1 knows how the BFB cds sold?  Did they go Gold 
atleast?

musically, has a pretty incredible guitar solo. I also think The
Necromancer has wailing licks all over the place.Analog Kid, along with
the sweetest bass line, also has a damn fine guitar solo.But I'm biased.
I think everything Alex does is awesome. Listen to Little Drummer Boy on
Merry Axemas. Another example of pure genius.
