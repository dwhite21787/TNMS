I also am curious about the Latin in COS album cover. Here's how it
reads:

"Terminat hora diem; terminat auctor opus."

This, by the way, is printed at the end of the Necromancer ...
My interpretation: " At the end of the day we dance the hora; all
actors end up as penguins. "

	How close am I ??

Well, it's good to see the national midnight star back in order, but I have
thing to say to those about the live bootlegs shows of rush.

First of all, I find it 100% wrong to ask for money on material dealing
with bootleg recordings, copyright software, vhs etc....   I don't agree
Uahon making a profit on someone else's livelyhood like RUSH, so there must
be a better way to distribute the bootleg material without putting a price
on a bootleg tape of rush or any other live band...

((( What does everyone else think out there? )))

I understand you payed the price for the music, but I still think it's
unfair and even to re-sale to make a profit..... (( Think About It!! ))

The Voice Of Silence
((

And if the music stops..............
    There's only the sound of the rain........
            All the hope and glory..................
                All the sacrifice in vain................

If love remains.........
   Though everything is lost..........
          We will pay the price..............
             But we will not count the cost...........

Hi there!

A couple of weeks ago, a guy in my girl's work said that he had quite a few
Rush bootleg Cd's, so anyway to cut a long story short!
He let me borrow them and WOW!

He lent me:

Rush One
Rush Two  (Both RTB tours in US. (Not sure on dates,etc))
The Fly
Red Barchetta
Life Under Pressure
The Temples of Syrinx

I've never even heard of the others apart from Life Under Pressure.  So if
anyone would like a tape of them, give me a mail!

<A NAME="500004">Subject:      the ROCKER file</A>

I have put the ROCKER01 ZIP file on the LISTSERV.  To get the file, you
can issue the command:

TELL LISTSERV AT KENTVM GET ROCKER ZIP

or send a message to LISTSERV@KENTVM with the following line in the
mail body (not in the subject line):

GET ROCKER ZIP

For the internet people, it is not certain whether they will get a good
copy or not.  It depends on the gateways that the file passes through
whether it gets translated or not.  It is a binary file, so it shouldn't
be translated or messed with in any way.

For people to get automatic distribution when the file is updated,
they need to send the command:

TELL LISTSERV@KENTVM AFD ADD ROCKER ZIP

or put

AFD ADD ROCKER ZIP

in the body of a mail message.  The file name needs to stay the same
for this purpose, that's why I didn't put in the version number 01
at the end of the filename.

Let me know if you have any question.

I noticed the other day, that there is a new Rush CD collection available.  It
is called Rush 123 Vol. 1 (presumably to be followed by Vol. 2).  It's a of 3 
CDs - Hemispheres, 2112, and Signals (I thought the combination was
interesting).
Anyway, it's a good opertunity to upgrade to CD, as the cost for the three is
about the price of 2 CD's.

On another note, reading the latest talk of The Prisoner, I was reminded of the
large red ball acting as some sort of security device on the show.  It sort of
reminds me of the cover of HYF (hmmmm...).

It's great to have the NMS back!

Since I have acces to the mailing through a gateway, I can't get the neat
things like pictures and FAQ.  Can you send me the current version of Rush FAQ.

send to: qmgate.radius.com!Aaron_Feigin

Thanks,

Hey, great to see the NMS back on line.

I was really fortunate to see the boyz in Pittsburgh over the summer. I
was also very fortunate to squeeze into front row right in front of
Alex.

Alex notes:Great playing all throughout. Nice cheesy scamming with babes
next to me (He kept making faces and smiling with these chicks)
           Nice keyboard action with his head
           At one point he walked out to the very far left of the stage,
tiptoeing to the edge, acting like he was on some giant cliff or
something-rather silly

Anyway, nice show, looking forward to this year.

Fish and several other artists. Also it contains GIFs of Rush, Fish, Megadeth a

for windows. IT is a DOS text. All questions should come to me JEPSTEIN@KENTVM
