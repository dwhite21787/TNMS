How about Sarah McLachlan for the next guest vocalist?
Anybody agree?  Sarah has an awesome voice and she is a fantastic musician.  
A better idea would be for Sarah and the boys to collaborate on a ballad 
together.  She's Canadian too by the way.
Am I on to something here or what?

She's not Canadian, but the best voice I can think of would be Natalie Merchant.

Other non-Canadian contenders would be Chrissie Hynde and Delores ____

For those of you interested in whether Rush Limbaugh is a fan of the band, I
have heard him use Bravado as bumper music on his radio show.

Also, just an aside:  Don and Mike, a couple of DJs in the DC area, used to
have Alex's "that's nice" (from the end of Chain Lightning) carted up just
by itself, and would play it whenever one of the call-in's made an inane
comment.  It was kinda funny.

Hey rush-mgr, whatever happened to the NMS t-shirts? I paid my money and
made my choice, but no tee ever showed. This was several months ago, ie.
mid 1997. I know there were some problems with printing etc, but an
update would be good...

   [ Checks should have been cashed only for those people who got sent shirts.
     There is no update; I haven't had time to find a new t-shirt printing
     place, go down and have new ones made. I also don't have enough money
     to pay for it at the moment (usually you have to order 100 shirts in the
     first batch, with designing the new shirts it'll come out to like $10-12
     per shirt). I don't have a spare $1000 laying around to afford it...
                                                                : rush-mgr ]

That reminds me, I also sent off for Virtual Songs from Mike Bahr last
November. Again, no show! If you're out there Mike, what's happening???
Anyone else still waiting (im)patiently for their copy?

Sid Poole makes exceedingly good guitars. Yes, yes, YES!! I picked up my
hand-built, custom-spec guitar from Sid last week and it is a beauty. He
certainly puts his heart into his art. Go on, support your local
luthier. Totally unrelated to Rush, but I had to tell SOMEONE!

Went to see G3 last night. My ears are still ringing! Satch was
supported by Uli Jon Roth (weird guy, weird guitar, cool sound) and
Michael Schenker (cool guy, weird hair, mean sound). Satch obviously
stole the show. During the jam at the end they brought out Brian May.
Now, Brian has been and is a truely great guitarist, but he must have
been either out of practice or stone cold (ie not warmed up), cos he
really didn't do anything of note! (pun intended). I can't help thinking
that if Alex showed up on something like that he would really go ape and
have a ball. I hate the back-slapping, "aren't we kewl" kind of jams and
this one needed someone, or something, out of the ordinary...

I'll stop babbling now.

Hello all you Rush Fans across the planet Earth!
I remember about 7 or 8 years ago in an interview Neil mentioned
something about a book he was writing about his bike tours through
China, etc....Yeah, yeah, I know, THE MASKED RIDER, right....Does
another book exist other than THE MASKED RIDER, like poems and other
literary works by Neil, or is this it?  I have a hunch there is
something more than THE MASKED RIDER..I distinctly remember a collection
of his works somewhere in print. Thank You....

   [ There are a few other books by Neil out there (3 if my memory serves me)
     but they were produced only for friends and family. I have heard rumors
     that copies exist at the University of Toronto... but I have never seen
     a copy nor had anyone confirm the rumor.                   : rush-mgr ]

	Who make up the members of the band called RUSH?  As far as I
remember, your name isn't in the list of three.  They're artists, and
were doing what they wanted to do.  What gives you the right to critique
Geddy's performance on what he did.  I think that the whole statement
should have been preceeded or concluded with the words 'in my own humble
opinion.', IMO.

A couple of things..first, several issues ago, someone noted that Aimee Mann
sings on another song other than Time Stand Still. Can you please e-mail me or
post again what song she is in. I think it was at the end of a song, somewhat
burried under the music.
Second, and I will probably get some flames for this, but whats up with those
of you who submit posts and then at the end feel a need to quote some Rush
lyrics?  We all know the words to the songs! No need to add them to the posts!
More info to come on the RUSH Marathon, a 16 hour (or more) radio program to
air in July ( I think).  Out.

Yeah, the tab on the RTP web site has that same kazoo question. Maybe it
*is* a kazoo, but I did a double take when I saw it on the tab. It's
pretty, um...funny.

Anyway, why don't you try double-tracking the solo like Alex did, with
those same lazy bends, and see if you still think it's a kazoo. I think
it's just the result of the "chorus" effect produced by two
not-quite-the-same pitches. Rush have always been good for a bit of
humor/obscurity in their liner notes - I think a kazoo would have been
mentioned on an album where they went so far as to call themselves
"By-Tor" and "Snow Dog".

No offense, but what's your source? I'll you why this sounds hokey, and
you can tell me why I'm wrong.

Rush first recorded at Le Studio in 1979. Were they "hanging out" there
prior to 1977?

I think Roland had chorus amps before Fender did.

I seem to recall Alex mentioning Steve Hackett's use of the Roland
Chorus as something that got him interested in the sound.

Just wonderin'.

I hate to pick on you again, but if you think you can hear a bass run
through "a kitchen sink" of effects and controlled by a volume pedal say
"Prince By-Tor"... either it's very expensive or not very good for you
or both. But let us have some anyway. <g>

There's an old old interview with Geddy that was in fact recently posted
where Ged lets the cat out of the bag on those monster sounds.

<A NAME="2041013">Subject: Rush Laserdiscs vanishing</A>

Hi, folks.  I know, long time, no posts (at least a year, I think).  Here's a
dispatch from the Rush collectable wars:

As the laserdisc video format begins to vanish, being quickly replaced by DVD,
I thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and start collecting up all the
Rush lasers I'd been putting off buying for so long.  "After all," I figured,
"all but the very oldest Rush discs are still listed in on-line catalogs; the
newest ones like ASOH *must* still be available."

Yeah, right.

That was back in February.  It's taken nearly four months of searching, but
I've finally completed a collection of the Rush laserdisc releases.
Unfortunately for me (and anybody else who wants to do the same thing), it was
far from easy.  A quick run-down of what's been released, and how hard they
now are to find:

Exit... Stage Left:  Long out-of-print in North America, this disc is still
available as an expensive Japanese import, and that's the only way I could
find it.  Prices range from $50 to $90.  I've seen used copies of the VHS
version for $50 or more (who else can remember the days when it played for
free on USA Network's "Night Flight" every couple of months?).  At any rate,
at least the import version is still more-or-less available
(www.laserexchange.com carries it for $50), and it's still probably the best
Rush video ever released.  There are Japanese subtitles when one of the band
members gives a voice-over commentary, but the rest of the disc is identical
to the old North American version.

Through The Camera Eye:  A P/G era release, and probably the hardest Rush disc
to find today.  I totally lucked into a copy from a Canadian video store by
mail order; it was the only one I ever even saw available.  If you see one,
grab it.

Grace Under Pressure Tour:  Once widely available, this disc has become quite
scarce  and took the longest for me to find.  Net surfers beware:  I found at
least half a dozen on-line stores listing "P/G Tour", but all these sources
wound up admitting they hadn't had a copy for years when I tried to place an
order.  I finally tracked it down last week (and that dealer only had one
copy).

A Show Of Hands:  This disc used to be ubiquitous, but it's now unfortunately
out-of-print.  Even legit sources like Ken Cranes' Discount Laserdisc still
list ASOH as available, most have to admit they're sold out when contacted.
Still, there are some copies out there--you just have to be persistent.  A
Japanese version with an extra track ("Lock And Key") is available for those
willing to pay the high price (about $75).  I have the domestic version.

Chronicles:  Also apparently out of print, this disc appears in numerous on-
line listings.  It's still available from some of these sources, but is
quickly becoming scarce.  Again, there's a Japanese version with an extra
track, "Red Sector A".  I've seen it listed for $60, but again, I didn't buy
the import.

The Big Money CD Video:  One of a few releases in a failed Polygram
experiment.  This disc was all over record store "dump bins" a decade ago, but
it's very hard to find today.  Even if you can locate a copy, many discs
suffer from severe "laser rot" on the video portion (mine, which I bought new
in 1987, is unfortunately one of these).  Since I already owned this one, I
made no effort to buy a copy this year, but I've heard that it's nearly
impossible to find this disc in new condition.

It should be noted that none of these discs have what you'd call outstanding
picture quality.  The concert sets in particular (with the exception of ESL,
which was shot on film instead of videotape) "reveal the limitations of the
source tape", as they say (and the crowd shots on P/G are downright
embarrasing).  It's painfully obvious that the transfers to laser were not
done with great care, again especially for the live discs.  On the other hand,
as you might expect, the sound quality is outstanding--the ESL laser isn't
top-quality visually, but the audio blows the VHS version away.

In closing, if you've just gotta have these discs (like I did), get out there
and get cracking.  It's highly unlikely that any of these will ever make it to
DVD, and they're not getting any easier to find.  I recommend checking the on-
line stores in thecinemalaser.com's "Places to buy laserdiscs on the Web"
(http://www.thecinemalaser.com/shop.htm).

     1. Just watched the X-Files season capper (recorded from Sunday). That 
        "Lone Gunmen" guy really DOES look like the Gedster.
     2. I can play the intros of "Fly By Night", "Limelight" & "Natural

     3. I wish I could play "Analog Kid".
     4. I think that Atari Teenage Riot could do really interesting 
        covers of Rush tunes. 
     5. "Second Nature", "Afterimage", "Available Light", "Lock & Key", 
        "Cinderella Man", "In The End" & "Dog Years" are REALLY great songs
     6. "Rivendell" is not.
     7. I think Alex, Geddy & Neil are cool...
     8. BUT, are not above criticism and/or scrutiny.
     9. Down By Law is a great band.
     10. Third Eye Blind is NOT a great band.
     11. I think Rush should put out a box set. It could cost $700 & we'd
         ALL still buy it.
     12. I've never met any of the Toronto Three.
     13. I'd like to meet them & write their post-Visions story.
     14. I bet playing golf with Alex would be a blast.

I really enjoyed the entire Canadian Invasion episode of Pop-up Video,
especially the Canadian Football League references in Rush's 
"Limelight".  As a big fan of the CFL I have to point out an error. 
The video stated that the balls used in the CFL are smaller than
those used in the U.S.  In fact, CFL balls are *larger* than the ones
used in American football.

There are numerous web sites dedicated to the CFL; one is www.cfl.ca. 
The newsgroup rec.sports.football.canadian is also an excellent source
for Canadian football information.

<A NAME="2041017">Subject: In between songs</A>

I wonder if any of you guys can muster up some lines of what Geddy
actually says in between songs.  I've always had the impression that he
isn't a talkative type - usually saying the same things when introducing
a song night after night.  For those of you interested here's a
transcript from the GUP video tour (of which I have the bootleg audio) -
this being taken just before he says "we'd like to continue with songs
>.........this is the Enemy Within"
The Body Electric finishes and Ged says
"......whooo - thank you. Well as you can see we're makin' a little
movie here tonight and you're all gonna be a big part of it.  Therefore
you can lose your minds if you so desire - say hi to mom at home an' all
that (two twangs of his Steinberger bass) - we'd like to continue with
"(as above)

In the Moving Pictures tour in Long Beach (and after just finishing The
Camera Eye) Geddy says 
"ok...that was the Camera Eye ... eye eye.  Well we'd like to do
something from Moving Pictures... this is instrumental this is where we
live this is Y  Y  Z "
By the way on the Show of Hands video (La Villa) Alex was just humming
at the beginning of the song.  It couldn't even be heard probably
because it was (the mike) switched off.  Obviously Rush found this funny
and put a warning triangle on - I thought it was absurd.

Dear fellow Rushians,

I'm curious.  How many Rush songs have gotten good radio play besides 
TSOR and Tom Sawyer?  I have only heard a few others besides these two 
and here they are and about the number of times I have heard them (not 
on any one particular station):

1.  TSOR and Tom  Sawyer:  Too many to count
2.  Fly By Night:  Twice
3.  Subdivisions:  Once
4.  YYZ:  Three or four times
5.  Half the World:  Once
6.  Working Man:  Twice
7.  2112 (Overture/Temples...only):  Once
8.  Freewill:  Once

These are it.  The station I listen to has slowly but surely sold out to 
alternativism.  If I have to hear that f*@$%ing Marcy Playground song 
again, that radio station is going to be in flames.  But these are the 
songs I have heard on my stations.  I live in Kansas City, so does it 
differ from region to region or what?  I would like to hear about what 
Rush other people's radio stations play. Take care everyone.

Palo

P.S.  Saw Pop-up video and loved it.  I was a little disappointed that 
there was not more "hidden" information that was available.  Just out of 
curiousity, what the hell was Ged wearing in the studio?  I hope his 
fashion sense has greatly improved since then.

Hi all--Terry Bozzio held a drum clinic in Richmond this past Tuesday night.
A short article appeared in the local newspaper about the clinic.  Thought
that this may be of some interest, since there was some discussion about
what he had said about Neil.
I checked the on-line edition for the whole article, but the article was not
included in the final on-line edition.

"As for the idea that Neil was unschooled, he (Bozzio) is quoted as trying
to encourage drummers to further their education and to escape the
horizontal time keeping rut.  You're seeing more and more happening...great
snippets and patterns...more drummers are using multiple instruments, sounds
and colors.   Drummers are also  trotting the glode in search of new stuff.
For example, heavy metal drummer Igor Calavera with Sepultura has studies
South American Indian and Japanese styles.  Perrenial favorite Neal Peart of
Rush has also ranged widely in search of new licks and "found" music-new
chops that materialize when drummers from different cultures play
simultaneously together."

NMS,
	I notice our favorite group has a bunch of
references to dreams in their music.  See if I have a legit

"A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission"--Mission
"Innocence gave me confidence to go up against reality"--Circumstances
"Courageous convictions will drag our dreams into existence"--The Camera Eye
"Cinderella man, hang on to your plan--try as they might they cannot
steal your dreams."--Cinderella Man
	Jacob's Ladder, Xanadu, Rivendell, and many other of
Rush's songs deal with dreams too.  Seeing the dreams behind
their songs is much like finding Waldo or one of those Mystic

Surprisingly, though, ranking them in this order was actually easier than

        1)  Limelight           11) Middletown Dreams
        2)  Vital Signs         12) Natural Science
        3)  Hemispheres         13) Force Ten
        4)  Subdivisions        14) Freewill
        5)  Dreamline           15) 2112
        6)  Analog Kid          16) Grand Designs
        7)  Cygnus X-1          17) Distant Early Warning
        8)  Mission             18) Jacob's Ladder
        9)  The Pass            19) Afterimage

Just a quick note about a stand-up show on HBO I saw Saturday night. It was a
stand-up routine starring David Spade (Saturday Night Live). The show was
titled "Round Midnight", during his bit, he made a reference about his
friend's pot smoking mother requesting her son to put in the RUSH tape and
starts singing along to Spirit of Radio, and then says put on Freewill, I know
that one better. It was a great show David Spade put on, very funny. It was
just an added bonus to hear him refer to RUSH in his routine. Thought my
fellow RUSH fans might be interested in hearing about it.

Someone writes:

> Let us know and tell us about it.

My first Rush concert experience (and I'd never even heard of the band)
was in early 1976 for the 2112 album. A group of my friends were going
to see a concert of which Styx was headlining. "Loreli" was the current
single by Styx. When we all got there they were announcing that someone
in Styx was ill but that you could go see the other bands ("Southerland
Brothers and Quiver" opened the show) or get your money back.
Personally, I had never heard of either group, but Rush was then moved
up to be the headlining act. My friends decided that we would rather be
at a concert that we didn't know what to expect than to go on home. When
we got inside of the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium there were only
about 4 rows on the floor filled up. When Alex started swaying back and
forth during the intro to Bastille Day and Neil started twirling both
sticks high over head like two plane propellers, I had a little brain
orgasm right then and there! I hadn't yet heard a whole song, but I was
already mesmerized. There were probably a few hundred people there
through RUSH's performance at a venue that probably seats a couple
thousand, but everyone that I noticed were definitely into the band
already. They seemed to know every single drum riff by heart! I can
still remember how much smoke was in the air. And that Cannabis aroma...
wow. Geddy even said during the performance: "Sacramento...You sure
smell good!" By the end of the show the mighty Zeppelin finally had one
rival in my book. By the end of me purchasing every RUSH album that I
could find (I eventually found all within a couple months), I had a new
favorite band.
   Though I couldn't understand at the time why nobody in radio ever
played this so obviously talented trio, I eventually came to realize
that RUSH was not for everyone. I certainly didn't care! I had also
taken up guitar within a couple of months from the first 2112 show as
well as purchasing every album (and CD) the day released. Talk about
influential, eh? Any time RUSH tours anywhere near to where I happen to
be I go see them. The only tour I have ever missed since 1976 was the
SIGNALS tour. In 1982, RUSH decided not to tour in Northern California
for some reason. In 1978 (also at Sacto. Memorial Auditorium) I actually
got to meet Alex and Geddy in back of the concert hall at about 1 AM. I
remember their roadies walking around with tour jackets that read:
"Waltz of the Shrieves." One of the roadies gave my friend a broken
Pro-Mark 747 that had been broken during the Hemispheres Show that
night. Alex and Geddy were amazed to see that we were still hanging
around watching the road crew loading equipment. All I remember is how
incredibly nice and polite they both were and how appreciative of our
interest.

Anyhow this post is already way too long. Anyone else have a memorable
experience at a RUSH show?
Best Regards to all you RUSH fans out there.

Okay, well, to start of, I want to begin by saying that Shania would be 
bad because she is the wrong genre and her hick accect would take away 
(no offense shania fans) Morisette would definitely be cool, but why 
when we have Geddy to cover high pitches?? :)   I say that Shirley 
Manson from Garbage would be great... Her deep, throaty Alto would be a 
great contrast with Mr. Super Tenor.... (i do like geddy's voice... 
Don't make mean comments because he's just fun to poke fun at) Now what 
if they ever collaborated with another band?? I think that they and 
dream theater would be a kicking combo.... Them, or Goldfinger. :)

Second, I have heard lots of god ideas about what to do with 2112, and 
my own personal opinion is just skip over 2112. Problem solved.

Third, I would like to tell you about the new album I picked up... I 
know that it's been mentioned before, but I think all of you would do 
well to pick up Victor's album. For those of you who may not know, 
Victor is Alex's side project. I bought it, expecting soft ballads... 
BOY was I surprised! It's kinda heavy and fast paced... I love it! It's 
almost my favorite album! (just under a handful of Rush things... Close, 
though... very close)

Fourth, (hmm, what was fourth??) Most of you know, but I'll say it 
anyways.... yyz= the code for the Toronto Airport (in airport lingo)

Fifth... Q: How many Drummers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
         A: Eleven. One to screw it in, ten more to say how Neil Peart          
could have done it better.
                                      OR
         A: Just one, but the roady has to set up the bench and place          
the light in the socket

FINALLY, whoever said that Bravado would be the SOTA track on RTB hit it 
on the head... I love that song. It's bewitching, almost....

Hello all,

Last weekend I went to a record fair and wanted to let you know what is to
be found herer in Holland. Answer: Not too much. Probably due to bad weather
and music industry/law enforcement people walking around, the number of
'collectibles' as well as the quality wasn't as good. Saw Storm in St.
Petersburg, Mirrors and Over the Europe there. Went home with something
called A New Reality, a nicely packaged CD from Australia of all places,
with the ESL video soundtrack on it, from I think the radio show
Supergroups. There is some commentary by Neil and Geddy in between the
songs. It's 'Pookie' indeed. Also found 'Frontiers and beyond' , a video
from Journey out of print I believe. It's an interesting look behind the
scenes of a big tour. Very wholesome though, expect no Kiss Xposed...;-(
