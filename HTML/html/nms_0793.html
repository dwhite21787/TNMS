This would've been in the first digest, but I didn't know about it until just
now. This is a confirmed date, the first date of the tour will be:

January 22, 1994	Bayfront Arena. Pensacola, Florida

And no word yet on when tickets for the first tour date will go on sale.

There's a couple of dates (unconfirmed) for Los Angeles, San Diego and
Madison Square Garden in NY, but I will post the dates once confirmed.
(these dates will be in Feb-Mar).

In 790, Ervan Darnell wonders about the tooth pic and the rush-mgr suggests:
   [ Perhaps the tooth itself is a counterpart -- you have the part you
     normally see (the crown), and the part you normally don't (the root).

I've been thinking that perhaps the tooth and the nail go together, though
why they wouldn't be in one picture then is beyond me. But you've all
heard of "fighting tooth and nail" haven't you?

I still like the puzzle picture, where you try to get U and I together.
Have to admit I didn't come up with that idea...I kept thinking it should
have been I and E (as in "i before e..."), but my co-worker got it. And of
course the four Suburban Elements...

Hey people,

   I would like to start off by thanking John Grothman for submitting
the little newspaper clipping about us fans in Madison WI breaking the
window of the music store.  I was there, heh heh.  My friend and I got
to the store at about 11:30pm and walked up along the edge of the crowd
so we were right by the door.  To make the story short, the store opened
their door at 12:00, the crowd pushed foward like a mosh pit, and the
window just couldn't take it.  I kind of got worried because, just as that
window broke, I was being pressed into the window on the other side.
  It was worth it though. I got into the store with the first group of
people and had Counterparts, a free Counterparts t-shirt, and the P-Jam
album (what the hell, I was there) in less than 20 minutes.  Got some free
pizza too!
   The main reson I am writing this is because there were a LOT of rush
fans there for the so called "Pearl Jam Party".  I just wish the radio
stations around here would realize that there are so many of us.
   Just thought I would blab a little instead of quietly reading all
the time.  By the way, I don't know what the P-Jam CD sounds like because
Counterparts hasn't come out of my CD player since I got it home.

See ya,

Donner.

Greetings.

Well, I must say I am a sad Rush fan.  Although I finally got the new
album -- HI JIM! -- (yay!), and marveled at the layout of all the pictures,
symbols and the lyrics side, I was even more saddened and shocked to see,

		"In Memory of Pat Lynes and Lee Tenner"

Folks, these guys were part of Rush's crew for many years.  Pat used to
drive the trucks/buses and Lee was, I believe, part of the sound team (I
may be wrong on that) -- go check your early Rush albums.  And I am sure,
they were the bands' good friends.  They helped create the concerts we
all saw and loved.  Let us pause for a few moments in respect for them.
If not for ourselves, then for Rush.

   [ I wonder if Pat (or is it Lee) is related to the nice lady who runs the 
     Rush Backstage club in Las Vegas.  I remember talking to her and she 
     mentioned her son (or was it son in law? or brother?) was working for 
     Rush as a bus driver for one of their big rigs..          :rush-mgr ]

Thank you.  Even though I didn't know them, I feel like a part of the band
is missing.  I just can't believe that.  Talk about a shock.

Yes, 'hammel' has it right about the binary!!!

I was looking ALL OVER the disk to see if it was DDD or not.  This makes
complete sense.  Each row of binary represents each 'D' in DDD.  All the
recent rush albums have been DDD.  Good show!

<A NAME="793011">Subject: Liner better than the album</A>

Well, I guess it's time to add my thoughts on the latest Rush release.

It's hard to explain my feelings on this release. For one, it has always
taken quite a while for many of the newer albums from Rush to grow on me. The
last one that I really just picked up and enjoyed immediately was HYF. Now
with the latest addition to my Rush collection, I find myself wondering if
even time will be enough for me to learn to accept this album.

My first impression was one of hope, having not heard any of the singles.
'Animate' blew me away, although reminding me of earlier U2, I thoroughly
enjoyed the song. In fact, it's the only song that I've played over 10 times
so far.
But after that...

I absolutely can't stand 'Stick it out', if only for that darn guitar lick. I
mean it sounds depressing enough, but does he have to whammy the damn thing
flat every other chord. Bleah!!!. To harsh in lyrics as well.

'Nobody's Hero' is one of the first Rush songs that comes off as total
garbage. Okay, I can understand the issue being covered by the song, but the
lyrics are so... I can't even think of a word, except it's hard for me to
keep from laughing at the lyrics. The entire song seems out of place on the
album, almost as much as Red Tide seemed out of place on Presto. Also, this
song is not solely about Aids as some people seem to think. I also like the
music itself, but the lyrics just seem so sappy.

I don't know if it's Peter Collins influence, but certain songs on this album
touch me as having the feel of a Queensryche album, especially some of the
melody in 'Cut to the Chase' and definitely 'Double Agent' (Every time I hear
the spoken words, I keep hearing 'Even in death you still look sad' from
'Electric Requiem' off of Mindcrime'.

Other than that, I guess my main gripe with the album is that it doesn't
touch me, doesn't make me feel. I can listen to songs like 'Big Wheel',
'Subdivisions', Marathon, 'Mission', and others and feel the songs. They make
me think, they seem to address me. There is nothing on this album that hits
me in this manner.
In musical terms, it seems very monotonous, especially in songs like 'Stick
it out' and 'Cut to the chase'.

So for me, I only hope they cut two or three songs from this album for the
concert tour. I bet that they will open with 'Animate'.

I do have to say that the Liner Notes are awesome. There are so many things
buried in those images. I hope someone will take the time to find out the
significance of everything and get it in the FAQ. I can spend more time
pondering that instead of the album.
BTW, Sonny, Michael, Fredo were the sons of Marlon Brando in the Godfather
series. The Hoss, Little Joe, & other guy were from some old western TV
serial that I can't think of right now. Lorne Greene was in it I think.
Also, I caught the MST3K refs., but how about the Ren & Stimpy one. John K
was the original voice of Ren and creator of the series.

You know, I've loved every Rush album up to this one. I guess after so many
there would have to be one that I just couldn't get into, I think this is the
one.

But in other news, I'm even more depressed by the new Pearl Jam album, which
certainly is nowhere near as good as their debut.

<A NAME="793012">Subject: Geddy sings alto</A>

I truly love tenors, especially this one, but it just annoys
the heck out of me when I can't sing all of a song without
either losing the low notes or jumping an octave and sounding
too operatic for the context. So this album is perfect for me
too-- thanks Cheryl. This also relates to how some ppl have
been saying his voice is different in some way. I noticed in
"Everyday Glory" on the "no matter what they say" parts, he gets
up to high C without screaming. This is different. Also he didn't
come CLOSE to cracking on it-- wow. My admiration continues to
grow, but no lawn tents for me thank you.

To vortex on the harmony thing: It's easy as anything to tell
seconds and thirds apart, because seconds buzz a bit (almost
painfully) and thirds don't. The words at the time seem to call
for seconds [at war] but I don't remember what it really is.

A bit about aging: Jamie Sandford says that you can tell this album
was done by "cool old guys."  Actually I think they seem a lot
younger on this one, but with no less talent. The pictures are done
in such a way as to add to this thought, at least on the cassette.
BTW, if you think 40 is old, chew on this: my mom, who is a mere six
days younger than Geddy, has a 21-year-old boyfriend. :^P
Even so, I find it interesting that most ppl on here call a bunch
of 40-year-olds "boys." Music keeps you young, I guess.

One last thing: I LOVE THE CD FOR CHARITY IDEA!!!

Thank you. I promise I will shut up for a while.. but then the weekend
is coming up-- I'm not sure I can hold a thought that long w/o "Losing
It." But Neil said not to swallow my tongue...
                                   Blessed be,

Wow.  Counterparts is here.  Melbourne people, unless you've found it somewhere
else, Metal for Melbourne in Flinders St. got it in on Wed.  Yes, it's great.
Especially Animate, SIO, CTTC, Double Agent and LTTA.  Haven't been grabbed by
BSAM, Alien Shore, or (especially) Speed of Love yet.  Makes for a bit of a
lull in the middle of the album, unfortunately.  I agree with whoever said
SoL sounds like Trevor Rabin-style Yes.  Yech.  Ah well.  The drummer in my
band said the whole album sounds like it will do well on American charts.  I
sorta see what he means.  Gotta love it, though.  Best since MP?  Probably.

That review has sparked questions on who Fugazi are... sorry Vortex, they are
most certainly NOT Marillion inspired.  In fact Marillion and Fugazi are
musically poles apart, and I think the Marillion album title is just a
coincidence.  Fugazi are a DC hardcore band, closer to Sonic Youth or Rollins
Band than Rush or Marillion.  VERY INTENSE music, and also very good - their
drummer is fabulous.  (A bit like a punk band that learnt to play and write.)
I have this feeling that I may be the only Fugazi fan on this mailing list,
though.  (And they're playing here in a fortnight!)  (BTW, I also like
Marillion, but I think Fugazi would hate them solid.)  I don't know about the
quoting in "Double Agent", but I don't think it refers to "Wilderness of
Mirrors" - I think more likely a musical quote in that same section of the
song.  Vaguely Fugazi-like.

I'm in a quandry with Cntrps and the new Pearl Jam - which to listen to more?
Both are amazing.  PJ have shown they're not trendy bandwaggonners - the songs
on that album (though growers, mainly) are melodic, lyrically stunning, and
wonderfully arranged.

I'm out of words.

WOK.

Oh, yes.  Apparently it as become obligatory sometime in the last week
or so to include the following phrase in every TNMS post, so here it
is:

	"The Album *ROCKS*.  It's better than great.  Rush is perfect. Did
	 I mention that the album rocks?!?!?!"

Ooops.  I can't think of a lame pun on the word "counterparts".  I
guess my post is incomplete after all....;)

Well, time to queue up the disc again....;)

Some of the counterparts that have been misunderstood or missed:

Athos, Porthos, Aramis are the Three Muskateers.

There is no counterpart to the tooth, or to the nail. They are
counterparts to each other = Tooth & Nail

I don't know where "screwed, blued, and tattooed" comes from, but
Primus uses that line in their song "Fish On." Could the boys be
playing homage to Primus like Primus has to them? (They play parts
from YYZ and Cygnus X-1 in concert)

X's and Y's are the sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosome,
males have an X and a Y.

Another funny thing I noticed. . .Yes, the picture of the sink is
literally "counter parts," but also, they through in everything . .
>.including the kitchen sink.

Anyone notice that Howard Ungerleider is NOT the lighting director in
the liner notes? Shawn Richardson is. Howard is only mentioned as
helping design the lighting. Does this mean he won't be working the
lights for the tour?

I'm not giving in to security under pressure.

I figured it represented the relationship between bass and drums.  Both
rhythmic, yet totally different instruments.  Perfect counterparts,

When I first heard "Nobody's Hero" the "He only introduced me to.." part
reminded me of "She Gives Me Love" by Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe
(specifically the line "And all that I remembered.."). As I listen to it more
though, I don't associate the two. This is the way a lot of new music strikes
the listener: one finds comparisons. Many of you have done this, but I think
as Counterparts grows on you, it will develop its own identity and such
comparisons will no longer seem as valid.

Billboard lists "Stick It Out" as the #1 requested song on rock radio.

Also, there is a cartoon depiction of Rush in a recent "Guitar World" issue.
(The issue mentions Joe Satriani on the cover.) Geddy, Alex, and Neil are
shown blasting off in a spaceship, and they have green skin. Next to the
picture is a small blurb about the imminent CP release.

First of all, I have met MORE Rush fans through my Fraternity experience
than anywhere else at North Carolina State.  By 12:30am, After all the MIDNIGHT
madness sales, there were five new copies of Cp playing simultaneously
throughout the house (Rush beat Pearl jam 5 to 3, BTW).  Most of my

Whew, I'm back after a long hiatus...some trouble with with the system
admin...After I *accidentally* forkbombed the system...

Anyway, Counterparts is just sounding better and better everytime I listen
to it.  (Just like RTB and Presto.)  My only complaint right off is the
sameness of some of their songs.  Some of them sound very much like each
other...And it's a sound that I like, I just wish for a little more
variety.
As far as difficulty getting my CD, the Wherehouse had it on sale for
$11.88.  I remember Presto being 20 bucks(in Hawaii, Mind you) when my
friend Ben broke down and bought it.  (Hi, Ben!)  I was still cd-less at
the time, so I got by on tapes...anyway, I was expecting it to cost much
more than it did!  Hopefully this will catch some new fans...?

  I'm very pleased after hearing CP, especially after RTB, Presto, and
HYF.  A few select comments (I could fill up pages):
- Animate is a Rush dance tune!!!  Cool bass chords!!!
- Stick it out is ok.  Really don't like the "Don't swallow your tongue"
- Nobody's Hero == Afterimage for the 90's.  I much prefer the latter.  I
  don't think this would be a good concert song.
- BSaM ok, don't like the ahhahahhahahahayesyesyesyes....
- Speed of Love.  Bland song, hopefully a grower.
- LTTA I like better than WMT; haunting guitar melody
- The guitar solo on Cold Fire is really neat - very spontaneous-sounding
- Don't like the album-closer.  What happened to closers like Vital Signs,
  Between the Wheels, & Avail. Light??

- It's sure lookin' like Neil's shooting the compound bow :)

I want them to play in concert: Animate, CTTC, DA, LTTA, Cold Fire.
I would die if they played:  Enemy Within, Natural Science, Avail.
Light (THE most underrated rush song).

A great example is someone who mentioned the frosted warner logo on the

        The picture of the nail is right next to the picture of the tooth.
Hence, "tooth and nail".  Wasn't it obvious?
        Also, there is a slight lyrical deviation on Animate.  Geddy always
sings "Animate Me" instead of the printed words "Elevate Me".

The tooth and the nail... sounded to me like the saying
'Tooth and Nail' (next to each other and all)

Matt Smith: I agree totally with your assesment.. I
_try_ to play bass and follow the drums with my friend
who has been playing over the past 7 years.. He's
been listening to this album straight since It's
release, and I've been doing the same.. The bass is

FYI:

COUNTERPARTS
Rush

  Some bands create trends, and others follow them. But
Rush seems to ignore the process entirely, making the
music it wants regardless of the latest trends or
fashion. So some songs on "Counterparts" come on hard
and crunchy (the self-sufficiency anthem "Stick It Out,"
for example), some are jazzily adventurous (like the
funky instrumental "Leave That Thing Alone"), and some
have the semi-acoustic sheen of singer/songwriter mate-
rial (as on the gay tolerance tune "Nobody's Hero"). In
fact, the album's only real constants are Geddy Lee's
voice - which has grown wonderfully expressive over
the years - and the virtuosic percision of the playing.
But that's all most Rush fans want, anyway.

HEY HEY HEY- can you believe it - a review that actually
liked Ged's voice? WHOA..

Hey Gang,
     I'm sure others will mention these, but I was so amused by the lists
of counterparts in the CD artwork I thought I'd help a few quizzical
NMS'ers out there.  Here goes:

blued/tattooed             - _Should_ be screwed, blued, tatooed (semi-
                             self explanatory)
hoss joe & the other guy   - from TV's Bonanza
Robbie/chip/ernie          - My Three Sons
athos, porthos, aramis     - The Three Musketeers - Dumas

I'm going with the Quebec/Canada thing on the leaves (maple & fleur de lis)
As far as the birds go, one is an African swallow and one is a European
swallow ;-)

I thought the nail went with the tooth - "tooth and nail" explains why
there's no hammer, and also gives a counterpart for the tooth

The raised Warner symbol is another counterfeit deterrent, like the holofoil
sticker.

Other random musings:
     I also always thought the trees had a little to do about US/Canada
relations.  The oaks (US) are just too lofty, and they grab up all the
(spot) light???
     At least one song from each album on tour?  Can you say concert of the
century?  Actually, as long as Double Agent and Nobody's Hero get played from
the new album I'll probably be drained...  I'd probably have an aneurysm if
they kicked into Natural Science :-)

Oh yeah, BTW, I've decoded the binary.  It says:
"Julie/Juno/Panacea speaks true & May you all be unencumbered by effects"

  Wound up and bound up so tight...            Skip Gridley

Just thought I'd add my 2 Pfennige about _Counterparts_...

*Awesome* album!  IMHO, Rush's best.  It's the first album I've bought since...
I don't remember.  Well, in a long time ...where I've liked *every* song that's
on it.  I dont' really have a favorite, either.  I like all of them!

A couple comments about the insert/cover:

1.  Those of you who wanted a kitchen sink on it, it's inside.  The only image
I haven't been able to figure out is the picture of the bare breasts.  Are the
breasts counterparts of each other, or do they refer to the "anima" in each of
the band members (and men in general)?  Thoughts, comments, interpretations?

2.  Anybody figure out the binary code on the inside/back of the front cover
yet?  I started working on it, but the number of 0's and 1's is kinda funny, I
think.  183 total characters.  I broke them down into groups of seven and eight
and neither method produces anything useful.  I may just be doing this wrong.
I'm an architecture major, which means I've have a rather limited knowledge of
binary code, so I may not be doing this right.  I've tried entering the numbers
in the windows calculator (scientific mode) in binary form and converting them
to decimal.  Then I look them up with an ASCII chart, but it doesn't come out
in any coherent form.  (I assumed that converting 1001001 to 73 eqautes to the
letter 'I' in ASCII form - we *won't* bring that thread up again, though. :)  )
I'll keep trying.

3.  Geddy does look rather lost (and almost silly) playing the drums.

4.  Lastly, what exactly is/was the Harvard Lampoon?  I've heard bits and
pieces about it, but nothing substantial.  Any help, please?

5.  Oh, I just remembered.  I'd love to have a copy of Geddy singing
"O, Canada!" at the All-Star game.  I'd be willing to trade a copy of the
CP radio special or _Rush - The Story of Kings_ interview CD (copy on cassette
not the CD itself) for it.  Please e-mail.  Thanks.

That's all for now.  Thanks for listening.

'Counterparts' a dream come true for Rush junkies

By Mike Morris
Texas A&M University
The Battalion  10-21-93

Transcribed without permission.

After many weeks of listening to the hype and hoopla that preceeded the release
of Rush's new album, 'Counterparts,' you may be wondering "was it worth it?"
Was it worth waiting in line until nearly 1:30 am to get it?

	Hell yes!

"Counterparts" is a masterful mix of both old and new.  The old is the
producer, Peter Collins.  Rush fans might recognize him as the co-producer
on "Power Windows" and "Hold Your Fire."

Part of the new is the recording engineer, Kevin "Caveman" Shirley.  Shirley
was responsible for capturing the instruments in a raw direct fashion.
Also new to the recording team is Michael Letho, the engineer that completed
the final mixing.  Letho combined Caveman's rawness, the band's talent, and
a little spit and polish to get the best Rush album in years.  Gone are the
multiple keyboards and other electric gadgets.  What is left behind is what
made Rush famous - pure guitar, bass and drums.

The "pop" sound is the only thing lost on this album.  "Counterparts" shows
that Rush is still the most intelligent band in rock-and-roll.
Rush's lyricist and drummer Neil Peart describes "Counterparts" theme as
"reflections in a wilderness of mirrors.  Not reflections in the conventional
sense of looking back, but more of holding a mirror up to our hidden selves,
to human nature and its doing in this world, and to the tragedies and
inspirations of everyday life."

This theme winds and twists its way through the drumbeats and guitar riffs,
putting "Counterparts" on an intellectual scale of its own.
The first track on the album, "Animate" is about a man exploring his female
side, the "sister in my soul."  This song's message is that in order to be
a whole person, a man must understand his entire being.

The rocking tune that has been receiving tremendous radio airplay, "Stick
It Out" tells us not to quit.  This tune's drum intro is reminiscent of
Living Colour's "Vivid" album, but it has Rush written all over it.  It's
the kind of song you can piss off your neighbors with.  God knows I did.

A homosexual allowing his friends to be a "straight minority" while introducing
them to a "expanded reality" is one of the subjects of "Nobody's Hero." This
song is about true heros, and shows off Neil Peart's songwritting ability.

Believe it or not, there are even a couple of love songs on this album.  Whether
your love "is born in solar flares" or "can turn into a long, cold burn," "The
Speed of Love" and "Cold Fire" are two songs that will make you explore your
relationships.  Anyone cynical of love can easily relate to the message of
these two tracks.

"Leave That Thing Alone!" is the fast-paced instrumental that wraps up
"Counterparts" and brings back the "power" in the power trio that is Rush.

"Counterparts" is a dream come true for Rush junkies.  Even if you only have
a slight interest in Rush, you have to run out and buy this album! It is what
stereos were invented for.

	All right, everyone else is doing it, so I will too.  Here's
the lousy luck I had getting Cp.  I walked into the cheapest local
record store and BSAM is playing.  Cool, I thought, they must have it.
Then I see Pearl Jam for 12.99.  Also cool, maybe I'll get a deal on
Rush if I can find the fucking thing.  First I look in the Rush section
and it's not there.  Must be in new releases, right?  Ok where's that?
I finally ask the clerk:

Me:	Do you have the new Rush?
Clerk: Sure. Over here. No. Maybe over here. NO. How about over here?
	Oh I guess we're sold out.
Clerk 2: Wow, I don't understand that, we got 10 more this afternoon.

Ten!?!?  That's all??  Of course you were sold out, you idiots.
I ended up buying it somewhere else for (gasp) $16.99 (worth it, though)

	To whoever (sorry, forgot the name) said that the blurb at the
beginning of Alien Shore was "I've had about allll..." you're
correct.  Well, I don't know if you're correct, but I sure laughed
my ass off when I went back and listened to it again.  Reminds me of
my favorite misunderstood lyrics: 1 Rush, 1 non-Rush:

>From Metallica, Enter Sandman:
	"And of things that will bite"  sounds like
	"And a baked apple pie"

And from Bytor and the Snow Dog:
	"Centurion of Evil, the Devil's prince"
		sounds like
	"Set Joey on the people, the devil's for rent"
Even though we knwe they were wrong, my friend and I couldn't come up with
nything better for years.  Any other misunderstood lyrics out there?

  Hi,

  Yes, there is talk about the archer picture and "Cut to the Chase" but
  have you noticed that the archer is Neil.  Geddy said on Rockline that
  Neil's new "fad" is archery.  Neil would shoot arrows with some of the
  road crew under the stage during the RTB tour.  His fondness of archery
  probably influenced the line in "Cut To the Chase" and that is probably
  why there is a picture of him shooting an arrow.

  BTW, nice mohawk picture of Neil.

Again, this is all a joke.  I love this album.  No flames, please.  These

I must say I had the same feeling when I heard "Everyday Glory" the first few
times.  Very U2'ish.  Could this be a new direction for the boys?  Think
they've been influenced at all by U2? (or has U2 been influenced by RUSH?)

Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin analogies?  Couldn't agree more.  But John Rutsey

Hi,

Just a couple (okay, a few) things:

On alt.music.rush, people seem to think that the words before "Alien Shore"
are "Man (or men) about oars!"  That makes sense in the context of the
song.

As for the counterparts Doron didn't understand, I know three of
them:

sonny/michael/fredo - the three brothers from the Godfather movies
hoss joe & the other guy - the brothers from Bonanza
Robbie/chip/ernie - the brothers from "My Three Sons"

also

athos/porthos/aramis - The Three Musketeers!

My guess would be that this song is kind of a "counterpart" to Animate.
Sun has traditionally been a symbol for man, and Moon for woman. What I
think Neil is trying to say here is that the "space that not too many
know about" is the balance between one's anima and animus--in other words,
the best place to be is balanced between reason and emotion, between maleness
and femaleness. (Although as a female, I get a little tired of always being
stuck on the "emotion" side of the continuum--I rather pride myself on being
rational, thank you! :-) )

Well, CF is one of my favorites on the album. I don't see much in SOL, so
I won't comment on that. What I see in CF is kind of the same thing that
Mahesh does: the words speak to me on a deeper level than just a great Rush
song. I think it's because Neil has put into words a feeling I've had for
a long time: that love must have rationality as well as emotion in order to
grow and persevere. I think too many people out there expect love to work
like it does in the movies and the love songs, and then they are disappointed
when it either doesn't work or when the object of their affection turns out
to be "only human" instead of the godlike being that they have worshipped in
their fantasy. If the review somebody posted is right and the song is also
commenting about women worrying about abuse, this might also touch on the
fact that many women tend to overlook serious flaws in abusive men because of
this idealized fantasy view of "love." The fact that Neil has the woman in
the song basically telling the man "I'll stay with you as long as you realize
that this is a rational relationship as well as an emotional one, and therefore
don't try to take advantage of my emotional attachment to you" appeals to me.
I think if more women (and more men, in many cases) would keep this at the
forefront of their minds during relationships, they would work out better.

There--how's that? BTW, the music is *great*, too. Fits perfectly with the
words.

Just curious--of the women on the list, how many of you really like CF? I
think this one might possibly strike more of a chord with women than with
men--any takers for my theory?

Cheryl sez:

<<Well, I'm not familiar with his works to compare, but count my husband as
someone else who thought so [DA sounds like Frank Zappa]. That's been his only
comment on CP so far, other than "Do we have to put it on repeated play
again tonight?" :-)>>

*My* husband thinks it sounds like some of the spoken-word parts on the
last couple of Alice Cooper albums ("Trash" and "Hey Stoopid")! :-) He also
thinks that the sound quality of the whole album doesn't work. I believe his
comment was "The producer and the engineer should have gone out in the alley
and duked it out, and the winner gets to make the album!" (He doesn't like
the combination of raw instruments and "processed" vocals). Oh, well--that's
*his* opinion, not mine!

That's it for now--back to Counterparts.

:-) In Stick It Out, I keep expecting "Don't swallow your gum" ...which is
so obvious I wouldn't be too surprized to hear Geddy sing that in concert
(a la "Catch a fish" and "One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball").

ps. Julie/Juno/Panacea (you know, three names is a little clumsy...can
we just call you one of them?), as far as I know, Weird Al is American.
My one bit of trivia about him is that he was an architecture major
(then dropout) at the college I graduated from: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
(yup, I lived the SLO life, too!). He recorded My Bologna (sp?) in the
men's room upstairs in the Graphic Communications building--right next to
the radio station, for those of you familiar with the place. But that has
*absolutely* no relation to Rush (unless of course Weird Al were to record
a Rush parody!).

Robbie, Chip, and Ernie are, collectively, "My Three Sons."

Sonny, Michael, and Fredo are three Corleone brothers.  Don't
tell me that you don't know who the Corleones are.

"Double Agent Zappa"?  I don't think so.  I am an avid fan of
good ol' Frank and his works, and Geddy doesn't sound too much
like him on "Double Agent."  Zappa doesn't sound that sinister.

The chorus of "Between Sun and Moon" is fan-fucking-tastic!  What
seems to be everybody's problem with such a nonsensical, "It sure
ain't 'Free Will,' is it?" chorus in a Rush song?  Sometimes less
is more, folks.

Quite a few of my not-quite-Rush-fans friends marvel at "CP."  Most
of 'em think that "Double Agent," "Leave that Thing Alone," "Cut to
the Chase," and "Cold Fire" are the winners on the release.  Add
"Animate," "Between Sun and Moon," "Nobody's Hero," and "Stick It
Out" to that list and I'll tend to agree.
