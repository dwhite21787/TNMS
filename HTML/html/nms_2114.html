<A NAME="2114001">Subject: Robert Plant's "Fate of Nations"</A>

I have to heartily agree with lerxst@voicenet.com regarding Led Zeppelin.  The
bottom line is, unlike the Stones, the contribution made by Zeppelin to mold
and create Rock and Roll into what it is today cannot be ignored.  You can't
listen to a hard-rock/classic rock station without hearing a Zeppelin tune or
at least an 80's clone, which is probably why many people don't listen to them
anymore.  I recommend popping in "Physical Graffitti" and hear some of the
best music ever recorded that you probably won't hear on the radio too often.
I agree that Page's style is firmly entrenched in bluesy-rock, but that is
fine by me as its what he does best.  

As far as Plant, I also agree with lerxst that he is a rarity as a constantly
developing musician/songwriter, not one to sit on his laurels.  Its also nice
to see his album Fate of Nations get brought up yet again on the NMS.  

Fate of Nations is a great disk.  If any of you Zeppelin/Plant fans haven't
heard it, I believe it is his best solo effort.  Its got a couple of skippers,
but there are some excellent non-top 40 friendly tunes, although I can do
without the political commentary.  Great musicianship and melodies, plus it
blows away "Now and Zen" and "Manic Nirvana" (imho).

Hi NMS, first of all thank to everyone who send me their answers and

Who Assumed Control? Final Result

Total answers: 63

Control Assumed by the Priests: 2

Very big margin of victory!! 
I Think after this, the priests might be thinking to come back again and 
Reassume Control. That would be a great battle, just think of it 2112

I present to you five boners found on the acclaimed live album
 "All The World's A Stage."

1.  Lakeside Park  @2:59, 3:09, 3:20 and 3:30--Geddy's open D note is
fluttered; yet, when he frets the D the next time around @3:41 and 3:51,
it sounds normal.

2.  2112 @6:41--Geddy gets a late start on the lyrics to "Presentation." 
Alex was scared momentarily.  Of course, Alex has given Geddy many late
starts over the years.   

3.  By-Tor & The Snow Dog @ 10:35--Microphone feedback.  You can hear
more of it on "In The Mood."  Sound man was busy talking to girls instead
of manning the console. 

4.  In The End@ 0:53--Geddy muddles Neil's lyrics; he says "takes you
stronger," when it should be  "makes you stronger."  Neil forgave him.

5.  Neil's drum solo--@ 12:36-41--Neil gets bogged down--he's not sure
what he wants to do with the solo at this point.  It's okay, no one else
knows what he's doing with the solo at this point either.

A futile letter e-mailed to Rolling Stone magazine this evening:

"STOP IGNORING RUSH

Dear Rolling Stone Editor,

What is this double-spoken crap about Phish being great "noodlers"
because they "jam as a band"?

That "they've got chops, but they also have a sense of humor"?

Perhaps once, over the past 25 years, you could have stated the same
about Rush.

What is your point in eliminating "Different Stages" from the fall live
album releases?

The fact that the drummer's child and wife both recently died - wouldn't
it have been kind of RS to express just a blip of a condolence?

Your continuing agenda of pretending Rush doesn't exist, for no obvious
reason, still pisses people off."

    I've never submitted anything to the NMS before but I just wanted to
tell all you older Rush fans that Rush is still making lots of new fans
today.  I'm a senior in high school now but I saw my first Rush concert
in Boise, ID when I was a sophomore.   When I saw that concert I knew I
was hooked, seeing Geddy play live made me go on a praticing rampage
once I got home ( I play bass).  Since then I have learned basically
every well known Rush song.  Now my brother who is a drummer (age 16)
got hooked on Rush and  my guitar player friend (age 18) got hooked
too.  We play a lot of Rush songs at basketball and football games like
Tom Sawyer, YYZ, Leave that Thing alone, and other ones.  Kids come up
to us a lot and request leave that thing alone, its really cool to know
a band that has been around for so long can still get at every
generation.

I'm not sure if they are still in business, but there was a lawsuit a
while back--the Registry has no legal standing to record the names
anywhere other than their own catalog.  No astronomical group recognizes
their names or authority.  They may still be doing it, but the names are
not official, and have no standing--they used to claim it was an
official name you were buying.

Remember those great Stratoesque type guitars Alex used on the HYF
tour?  I think the company's name is Signature.  Anyhow, I found one at
a local music store here where I live(Huntsville, Alabama).  It was used
of course.....and the vendor didn't know very much about it.  He just
knew it was an "Aurora" model.  It's kind of a deep crimson color, and
has a Floyd Rose on it.  The name "Kent" is engraved on the 12th fret. 
I'm left-handed, but I bought the son-of-a-bitch anyhow.  Does anyone
know the parent company of whom makes these guitars?  Or does anyone out
there know any other info. about Signature guitars?  I have tried to
hunt down info. on this axe.....but to no avail.  I would like to get my
hands on a lefty model......the sound does somewhat shred.  :)

On a number of things. 
What Slim says about English pronunciation is correct, but, by the 
same token, nobody here says Zed-Zed Top.  You do not have to be 
consistent.  Part of the fun is knowing that letters 
and combinations of letters have different values, even within the 
same language.  But while we are at it, how do you pronounce Peart?
Like Heart? Pert? Peert?  More to the point, how does he pronounce 
it?

As to assuming control, of course its the elder race, the bloody song 
says so.  Jeez.

And finally, for now at least, the Lifeson/Page thing.  If you get 
out your old Melody Makers or Sounds, you will see that everyone was 
accused of sounding like Zep/Page.  Brian May, Sabs and a few others. 
 Often it was a compliment.  It was the sound of the early-to-mid 
seventies.  Don't tell me no group today sounds like any other, or 
does not use similar sounds, because that would be laughable.

Currently listening to Elgar's Pastoral Symphony  - nice.

This is a bit outrageous.. they split after ten years because one 
of their members died!  And they still have a huge fan base, bigger
than Rush's, for example, even though they have been (apart from a
few reunion gigs) extinct for 18 years.

> I love Zep, but for variety I'd much rather listen to Rush.

Well it's all a matter of taste but I would argue that Zep's music 
has -more- variety not less.. with Zeppelin you got hard rock, 
blues, funk, acoustic folk, progressive rock, even though their 
career spanned ten years, compared to 25+ years in Rush's case.

For consistency and quality, however, I prefer Rush (up to Grace
Under Pressure, anyway)

<A NAME="2114013">Subject: We Are Fans-Hear Us Roar!!!</A>

"Halloo" from Ohio!

It's become apparent to me that everybody seems to be dropping what they're
doing and petitioning the Rock-N-Roll Hall Of Fame for an induction
nomination for our favorite Canadians (as well as our favorite musicians),
and I, for one, think that this is something pretty amazing.  People who
don't know each other encouraging one another and banding together to try to
tempt fate despite the odds.

Okay, it may sound a bit cheesy, but think about it.  Aren't I correct?

It has been said on many occasions that Geddy, Alex and Neil consider Rush
to be a "club that no one else is allowed to join."  Upon reflection, we
fans have kind of the same opinion about ourselves.  This is not a *bad*
thing.  We are open to help others to acknowledge and maybe even agree with
our musical taste, but we *are* a kind of "club that no one [who isn't a
fan] is allowed to join."  Rush doesn't get heavy radio airplay, yet we the
fans buy up everything they release.  Why is that?  Because we're loyal. 
And because of that, Rush doesn't need heavy radio airplay.  There's too
many other bands around today that would die without the radio.  Besides
much of the stuff played on the radio is for "teenyboppers" and is very much
"here today, gone tomorrow."  Rush isn't, because of us fans. Whether or not
Rush is inducted into the R-N-R Hall of Fame is not important.  We've
already won!  The years have proven Rush's place in history.  And we've all
been a part of that.

"Rush.  They must have been one hell of a band."  Yes, as a matter of fact,
they are.  And I, for one, am PROUD to be a part of our "club."

<A NAME="2114014">Subject: Who assumed control?  THE FINAL WORD</A>

Dear Rushians,

It's been a few weeks.  But here's the final word on who assumed control.

There is no final word!  The argument that just because the priests had
control at the beginning, therefore they could not assume control holds no
water IMHO.  Let's just say that there was a battle during which no one had
total control somewhere in the grand finale.  Finally, someone assumed
control among the chaos.  Who it is, no one can know for sure.

Just to put my two cents in, I think it was the elder race that assumed
control, but I am not so sure that I am going to tell everyone else that
they are wrong.  As with most of Rush's tunes, your own interpretation is
what counts.

Peace,
Max

P.S. - rush mgr, good thing the colts got a chance to play the chargers this

Daniel, I too was 13 when I was first turned on by Rush (by my cousin who is
5 years older and has been a fan since COS.  He took me to my first concert
ever, GUP tour in the NJ meadowlands.)  I've been to every tour since then.
I too, am 28 years old now and still going strong and am quite impressed by

Unusual sighting here:  On the local Sports Talk station's lunchtime show,
the intro to hour 2 was "Bastille Day".  They played it from start to just
before the first chorus.  Pretty cool!

The station is the Sports Animal, 104.9FM, Oklahoma City.  It's owned by
the same company that owns our AOR station, KATT 100.5FM, and they usually
use rock music for their production beds.

I know our company is a little behind on the technology front but we just got 
new computers with Windows 4.0NT.  Previously, we had windows 3.0.  With this 
new technology I figured out that I can access radio stations from across 
the country.  I found a few good ones, right now I'm listening to WAAF in 
Boston.  Can anyone suggest any other stations that might play alot of Rush?
Thanks!
Go Steelers!!!

<A NAME="2114021">Subject: First Rush concert</A>

For issue 2112 I would like to share my first Rush concert experience:

It was back in 1989 when Presto was released, me and a couple of friends
went down to the record store and each bought a copy of the album.We all
then talked about getting tickets for the concert when they came to our
area (New Jersey).Well the day came when the tickets went on sale and
purchased eight tickets for their concert at the Meadowlands Arena.I
also bought an additional 4 tickets for their concert at Nassau
Colliseum which was 2 days after the Jersey concert.Finally the day came
and after school (we were all seniors in high school) my friend Keith
drove his van to the concert and we were so excited to go see them.I was
in totally awestruck throughout the whole concert.I mean I had seen the
Exit Stage Left,Grace Under Pressure and A Show Of Hands videos but they
truly did not do the band justice.You just simply had to be there.And to
spend it with seven of my closest friends it is truly an experience I
will never forget.After the concert I just couldn't wait to see them 2
days later.

So to Geddy,Alex and Neil - Thanks for the great music and concerts over
the years and to many more in the future!!!!

Hold Your Fire, Keep It Burning Bright!

     To, Rush-Mgr,
     
     Glad to see you make it to issue 2112. I do read the issues but 
     haven't contributed much input. But here is a little.
     
     I enjoy the issues and am glad that you are there working as hard as 
     you do to provide us, the Rush fans, a means of expressing our 
     thoughts about the band and their music. I have enjoyed Rush since 
     1977 and think the TNMS is the best place to get information on the 
     band. The band should thank you for giving their fans a place to 
     communicate.  
     
     I am still waiting for my tour of your work place but haven't heard 
     from you. If you get the time let me know.
     

   [ Um, I kinda don't work there any more. ;-)                   : rush-mgr ]

     Again, thanks Rush-Mgr for the dedication you have put into TNMS.

<A NAME="2114023">Subject: The National Midnight Star #2112</A>

Greetings from Canada (The land of RUSH),

To signal issue 2112 of the National Midnight Star, I would like to 
thank Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neal Peart for all the excellent music 
they have created over the years.

I first became a RUSH fan in 1990, my first album was Presto.  
Thereafter, I bought Chronicles and was hooked.  Right before the 
release of Roll the bones, I had acquired all their CDs and 
videocassettes.

I have had the pleasure of attending three concerts, the first was in 
Ottawa, Ontario (Nov. 1991 - Roll the Bones Tour), the second was in 
Montreal, Québec (May 1994 - Counterparts Tour), and in Ottawa, Ontario 
(July 1997 - Last show of the Test for Echo Tour).  Being a guitar 
player, the music of RUSH and Alex's guitar playing have been a huge 
influence on my life.

As you may know, the French speaking province of Québec has always been 
receptive to progressive rock bands: Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Pink 
Floyd, Genesis, Marillion and RUSH.  Some of these bands were huge in 
Montréal &  Québec city before the rest of North America had heard of 
them.

Furthermore, the province of Québec is also part of RUSH's history.  
They have recorded great albums in the Laurentians: Le Studio - Morin 
Heights, Québec.  The first album to be recorded in the province of 
Québec was Permanent Waves, followed by Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace 
Under Pressure, Presto, Roll the Bone and Counterparts.

The members of RUSH also took French lessons on the road.  While working 
at Morin Heights, they became good friends with the staff.  However, the 
Studio's staff were French speaking.  How many rock bands have hired a 
French teacher, and learn French while they are on the road ?  I am 
counting the days for the new live album.

Salutes to RUSH and all their fans, 

Frank

Hi fellow Rushians
	My lyrics section is finally up and running. You can all come and see
it. I even got a lyrics section for Not Fade Away/You Can't Fight It and
Bad Boy/Fancy Dancer. But I couldn't get the lyrics for You Can't Fight
It or Fancy Dancer. I have Fancy Dancer. Maybe I can listen to it very
closely. I don't have You Can't Fight It. Maybe somebody can help me
with that. When I first got the lyrics for Not Fade Away, I realized
that they are not what Geddy sings. So I listened very closely to make
some changes.
	By the way, I'm still going to New York City on Oct. 14, for my 8th
grade field trip. I'm going to get lunch at MARS 2112. And since I'm
going to MARS 2112, I've gotta bring my 2112 cd on the bus. I listen to
it, and I'll let my friends listen to it so they can all see why I like
this song so much. I'm also bringing AFTK and Hemispheres. A couple of
friends of mine really like Cygnus X-1. They love the guitar playing.
I'll right back to you guys after I get back from NY.

Hi Rushians!

Don't think this'll make it into issue #2112, but here we go:

Top 10 Reasons Why 2112 is Cool

10.  In the year 2112, we'll all be dead.  (Who'd want to live without
rock'n'roll anyway?)

 9.  Somebody (a Rush descendant?) assumes control.

 8.  The number 2112 is a combination of 2 1's and 2 2's.  And 1+1=2.
So there is kinda like 3 2's, but there isn't.  And 21 is 12 backwards.
And 2x1=2 but 1x1 only equals 1.  And. . .it's just neat!

 7.  We will be 114 years closer to 2525.

 6.  The X-Files: The Next, Next, Next Generation will still be looking
for The Truth.

 5.  Everyone, except a few rebel souls, will be driving alloy aircars.

 4.  The Priests will have already blown up the Rock'n'Roll Hall of
Fame.

 3.  The National Midnight Star, by that time a psychotronic newsletter,
could have a special 2112 issue.

 2.  Twinkies will finally go stale.

 1.  IT'S A KICKASS ALBUM BY ONE OF OUR FAVORITE BANDS, RUSH!!!!!!

Dear Rush Mgr,

Excellent job on the issue.  I was one of those who never submitted an idea
because (to put it bluntly) I couldn't think of one.

However, the way you handled it was perfect.  I had never heard the history
before.  I've been a Rush fan since 1981 and actually remember Tom Sawyer
was the first video I saw on MTV (probably in '82).  But I've only been a
TNMS subscriber for a few months.  Congratulations to you and all the
wonderful people who make up this digest.

Rush forever!

<A NAME="2114032">Subject: Merry Axemas II, Other stuff</A>

Found the following article today on http://www.wallofsound.com that might
be of some interest to those of you who liked last year's Merry Axemas CD.

 --------

Guitarists Celebrate Merry Axemas 2 in October
That ho-ho-ho with feedback that you're hearing in the distance can only
mean one thing—Merry Axemas, Vol. 2. The sequel to the Steve Vai-organized
Christmas album, one of the best holiday albums from the 1997 season, is
slated for an Oct. 27 release, and once again features a score of
well-known guitarists having their way with an assortment of Yule
favorites. This year's list features: Steve Lukather (ex-Toto), "The
Christmas Song"; Neal Schon (Journey), "Oh Emmanuel"; Steve Stevens
(ex-Billy Idol), "Do You Hear What I Hear"; Stu Hamm (Joe Satriani),
"Sleigh Ridge for Two"; Trevor Rabin (ex-Yes) "O' Come All Ye Faithful";
Zakk Wylde (ex-Ozzy Osbourne), "White Christmas"; John Sykes
(ex-Whitesnake), "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"; Robin Trower, "A Little
Town of Bethlehem"; Al Di Meola, "Carol of the Bells"; and Ted Nugent,
"Deck the Halls." 

The individual players took distinct approaches to their songs. Schon
recruited Journey keyboardist Jonathan Cain to play pump organ and went for
a somewhat reverent feel. "We did 'O Holy Night' years ago, sent it to
radio and they played it a lot," Schon remembers. "It's a fun thing to do.
Having all these different guitar players doing these Christmas songs is a
cool idea." 

Ted Nugent, not surprisingly, took a more aggressive approach but,
fortunately, didn't shoot any reindeer during the making of "Deck the
Halls." "I got in there with Tommy Aldridge and his double bass drums, and
I played the bass and then the big ol' (Gibson) Birdland guitar," the Gonzo
one reports to Wall of Sound. "We're playing a real reverent version of the
melody, but with just thunder grunting on the bottom." —Gary Graff 

 --------

I would have really liked to see Santana and Brian May on this one,
especially since Brian was going to do the first album until he had a
scheduling conflict, but it should be good anyways.  Funny that although
this is promoted for the guitar players, the one guy returning this year
(as far as I can tell from this article) is bass player Stu Hamm.  Alright
Stuuuuuuuuuu!

Congrats to the Rush-mgr on issue 2112.  I've only been around since
January of 1996 (it seems like yesterday), and it was cool to see the info
on some of the history of the list.  I thought it was going to be a bunch
of posts saying, "Woohoo, I posted a message in issue 2112."  Not that
there's anything wrong with that, but......  

About the middle of the day yesterday (Oct 6), I had a Rush thought run
through my head.  Yesterday was the day that the live album was originally
going to be released.  Oh well, paraphrasing Neil from The Masked Rider,
sometimes the anticipation is the best part.  I guess I'll just have to
anticipate one more month.  Besides, it's well worth the wait to have The
Analog Kid and Show Don't Tell on there.

Bravo! I had been wondering how we could best put this issue out, and I
think this is the best thing possible. It has been a long journey to this
point, and we all deserve a bit of recognition.

>From my perspective, though, I'd like to give a special congratulations to
Jimmy Lang, Meg Jahnke, and Dan Delaney (The previous FAQ keeper) for
providing us so much from the start. Without this digest, and without
their hard work, we also wouldn't have what I consider to be a fairly
kick-butt FAQ which I am proud to be the steward.

Also, I want to thank *everyone* who has contributed to the FAQ these many
years. Even if your piece didn't get included, it still has influence on
the content (the F does stand for "Frequently", after all)

Has it really been 9 years already? I remember it quite near the
beginning, when you still got the digest with a full list of recipients
(there must have been at least 50!), and we've been through it all, the
ups and downs, the anticipation of albums, tours, and interviews. I've had
the pleasure to correspond with so many fine Rush fans as a result of this
digest, and for that I'm thankful.

Onwards to issue 4224!

To all fellow Rush fans,
	We have been reading a lot of hype regarding issue #2112.  But I would
have to agree with rush-mgr's decision.  It was those involved who got
this thing as far as it did.  This is more for the fans, and not the
band.  I liked the non-extravagant style of it, and the write up on the
history of TNMS.  I have not been a subscriber very long at all.  So I
haven't seen all the work that has gone into TNMS.  But in my opinion,
2112 is just a number.  Please, this is not heresy.  What if the boys
had decided on a phrase to use as the title of the album?  The number
would mean nothing to us.  There aren't a whole lot of bands that use
numbers for album titles (excluding Van Halen).  It was just a fluke. 
Just imagine Yes fans waiting for issue #90125. HA HA!!!
	But the whole underlying theme is, those in charge probably had a plan
long ago.  Nothing we could come up with would have changed their
minds.  Because, the rush-mgr has assumed control!

for the last five years, whether for news about new releases and
tours, connections within the community of Rush fans, or the
occasional spirited discussion about the band. Though I don't get to
follow Rush to other cities when they tour, the NMS has also allowed
me to live vicariously through the fans that do, and for that I'll

account of the early years what a distinguished place in the history
of Internet resources the digest has had. I think you all deserve a
massive standing ovation (cigarette lighters burning) for a doing a

Greetings fellow Rushites!

I am a 37 year young Rush fanatic since the old days... i.e. '2112',
'Hemispheres', 'A Farewell To Kings', etc.  I still remember the day my
brother knocked on my bedroom door back in the 70's to show me this album
called '2112', and my initial response to the 'holy musical trinity' from
Canada after my first listen.  I loved the music, but initially did not like
Geddy's voice.  That changed after a few good listens.  The unique Geddy
became my favorite vocalist in no time!  In one week, Rush became my favorite
rock band, and this has not changed since.  To date, i've probably seen them
about 35 times live, and I can't imagine time passing without listening to
Lerxst, Dirk, and Pratt!  

I am curious as to what other music Rush fans listen to.  I was at 'The
Church' concert here at The Odeon in Cleveland recently (they were
INCREDIBLE!!), and most everyone I met and spoke with that night (about 7
individuals) mentioned Rush as one of their faves.  That, of course, doesn't
surprise me.  I always have known Rush fans to be into other bands too.     

My favorite other bands are:
* The Church (any other Rush fans out there into them??  Are my 'close second'
to Rush)
* The Ocean Blue
* The Beautiful South
* Strunz & Farah
* Al DiMeola

Please post YOUR favorite bands.

Yours in Rush,
George

Well I'm sure you have received mail on the English convention in Mid
September.  It was worth the £12 admission fee.  The weather was pleasant
and it was great to meet so many people just going crazy when the tribute
band came on.  It took a couple of songs for the audience to warm up but
then my inner feelings were " Who needs the real thing when we've got a
tribute band?"  We could ask for requests - can you do that at a Rush
concert? No way man.
The only fault of the band was that everything was pre-GUP days but who
cares?  A great drum solo - general musicianship was of a high standard and
a good time was had.  The singer was Scottish which is marginally easier to
understand than Canadian or American!!!
