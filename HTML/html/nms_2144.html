Neil Bonfield just made a good point to me about DS on vinyl.  Do you 
have any idea how many records would be required for a recording that 
length?  I remember the problems Iron Maiden had getting as much 
material as possible on Live after Death, and I cannot imagine that 
anyone has invested in research on how to get the grooves closer 
together without reducing sound quality since then.  Neil reckons 
five or six discs.  We'll see.  Red herring anyone?

Thanks to all for replying re my enquiry about the DS release in UK,
unfortunately it appears that we have to wait yet another week until 23 Nov!

Most of the shops in Swansea have'nt even heard of it and may well not have it
then so it appears I may have to travel to Cardiff to purchase mine.

Interestingly the other week whilst in Cardiff at Virgin Music I was informed
that there was a japanese version retailing at £45.00 available as opposed to
the £24.99 standard price - does anyone know what if anything this has 
different to the standard release?

Finally has anyone in UK had any luck ordering their copies overseas at the
lower US prices - I am considering this as an alternative option, suggestions
welcome and still counting down to my own copy!

Hi all,

well thanks to CD Now I received my copy of DS a week before it's
officially released in Europe. Atlantic  is one stupid record company.

The CD as y'all know is awesome. It's so loud and in your face.. Geddy
rules, both as producer and as a player. His voice sounds richer too,
very good. Alex is great as well, what's with the Dreamline solo though?
Thanks to anyone who had something to do with putting Analog Kid on the
record. Grrrrrrrreat.

One thought: with people in Europe buying a lot of copies through
Internet, recordsales go  down even more, making it even less likely
that Rush will play Europe again.  Atlantic  is one stupid record
company...

I didn't get my copy of different stages in the mail before I left town
for a conference, but I came home Sunday and popped it in.  Dreamline
brought me to tears as it did at the concert.  I then start leafing
through the liner notes to find out that the majority of songs were
recorded at the World Music Theatre in Chicago (I got shivers just
writing that); a show for which I just happened to be in attendance. 
There are times in the show I can hear myself yelling (maybe, it could
be me, I guess.  I choose to believe so).  I can't help feeling that I'm
a (small and probably insignificant) part of Rush history.  Perhaps this
falls in the 'get a life' category but I don't care.  I couldn't be
happier with the disks.

I was just kidding in my subject line. This post is about DS just like
everyone else's. I haven't seen these things mentioned yet:
1. After the "live" soloing in Dreamline, the "official" solo starts,
and Alex seems to "miss" the jump to the higher notes. Notice that? He
"misses" & that part of the solo ends up sounding quite different in
tone (lower). He seems not to care because he just pulls it apart. It
sounds fantastic! Very dirty.
2. (Most) everyone is talking about how, even after the setlist
bitching, they're glad SOR, CTTH, YYZ, etc. are on DS. But, I haven't
noticed anyone talk at length about TS. Does anyone else notice the
different guitar sound during the verses? It's almost as if there's an
extra note or something in there. Fresh sounding. Very cool. Check out
:48 - 1:04 as an example.
It's cool is how I read all of your observations about DS. Then, I sit
down with DS & listen for all the things you guys talk about. I'm such a
geek. Thanks to all of your observations. You have made my listenings
that much more fun. I'm such a geek.

To all who are having problems with Clusterworks,

It is my belief that most everyone's problems are related
to one of two causes:

1) CD-ROM is old and it cannot handle the Enhanced CD format
This will be the problem if you cannot get the CD to recognize
that there is other stuff on the CD, besides the audio

2) Video card and/or video drivers are old or not compatible. 
This is the case if you get memory allocation errors, general
protection faults, dreaded blue screen of death, or basically
any other symptom.

When I first tried to use Clusterworks on my NT machine
here at work, the the screen would slowly go black as if it 
was going to start, but then an error would occur with some 
kind of memory allocation error 

I originally chalked this up to the fact that I trying to
run it under NT, when the instructions say it will work 
under 95/98 (and not NT specifically), but then I tried to
run it on my machine at home which also uses NT, and it
has absolutely no problems.

The major difference between my two machines - the video cards
I am running - a 2Mb Stealth 3D at work and an 8Mb ATI Expert@Play
at home.  Since 2Mb of video memory should be plenty for such a 
basic application, I gotta figure that the reason for the crashes
at work is that those drivers are not up to date.

So for all you having problems with Clusterworks in NT, 95, 98,
try updating your video drivers. 

Hope this helps,
Chris

<A NAME="2144007">Subject: In Defense of Criticism</A>

Recently, I came to the defense of those seeking to analyze the
tinkertoys because people were starting to complain about it. Some
people are getting awfully hostile. Personally, I've REALLY appreciated
the various interpretation of the toys: symbolizing Neil's losses, the
band members personal/professional relationships, the 3 discs, etc. I
think that these are all valid, and NOT just because they're "opinions
so they can't be wrong"; but, because they make SENSE from a critical
standpoint. Look, Hugh himself might, indeed, have said that there is no
hidden meaning. He may not have INTENDED for these discussions, but
let's face it, he shouldn't have based the cover art of a Rush album on
the number 3 if he didn't want people to analyze it. It's that simple.
Think about the inner liner of HYF & the back cover of Sig. There ARE
slightly hidden little messages & jokes on those. It is undeniable. So,
that's why those of us inclined to do so are analyzing DS. I'm pretty
sure people like Shakespeare, John Updike & L. Frank Baum never, at the
time of writing, assumed that their writings would be pored over in
detail. But, in college I wrote many lengthy papers on the symbollism,
gender roles, etc. these writers employed; whether they intended it or
not. Was my work stupid & unecessary? I don't think so. It certainly
trained me to look critically at art. It's part of who I am.
No one has to agree with what I'm saying, but come on.... We ALL love
Rush. That's why we're here. In many cases, this love of Rush is the
only thing we have in common. We shouldn't get bogged down by bickering
about the differences in our artistic criticism. Let's be glad as a
group that we have this wonderful document from our heroes, and accept
that each of us has different ways of expressing our feelings.

In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much from DS.  Rush's last
three albums are among my least favorite of their releases, and
the setlist looked less than stellar.  It just didn't seem like
two full CDs from the TFE tour would be something I wanted to
hear.  Then I bought it.
Wow.
Allow me to elaborate:  Wow.

Despite the "double qualification" of your statement (on a live
album / of Rush's), I still don't quite agree.  It seemed...
unnecessary.  Neat, but not needed.  I play bass, btw, so don't
start looking for an instrumental bias.

I was very surprised with the live version of Driven.  It was
one of the first things that hooked me about DS.  It caught my
attention immediately, as I don't like the version on TFE.  I
could explain my reasons, but eventually it would just get down
to my own subjective opinion, so I'll leave it at that.

Re Clusterworks
I haven't had any problems running it on my PC at work, save
for one rather annoying twitch  It won't run in 24 bit color.
It'll run in 256 color, 16 bit, and 32 bit.  Yes, that's right,
it'll run in color modes above and below 24.  Just not 24, which
is where I happen to have mine set.  And, due to problems with
other programs, switching between modes doesn't always work well.

Not to burst your bubble, or put a damper on any joke you were
making, but extrapolations don't work that way...

To quote Mark Twain in an effort to show you why:
"In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the
Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles.
Therefore... in the Old Silurian Period the Mississippi River was
upward of one million three hundred thousand miles long... seven
hundred and forty-two years from now the Mississippi will be only
a mile and three-quarters long."

The book isn't moving, true, but the light that's allowing you
to see the book is.
It all depends upon your point of view, and what definitions of
"static," "perception," and "real" you're using.  In the strictest
sense, nothing is completely static... even at absolute zero, there
is still some movement.
So many arguments appear between people using two different
definitions of a single word.  Don't let this be one of them...

Talk about blowing things out of proportion...
Would I complain about the Porsche?  No, but if I asked for 
and/or was expecting a blue convertible and got a puke green
hardtop with no hubcaps, I'd be a little disappointed.  I'd
probably voice that opinion, too, but not directly to my
benefactor.  Maybe, say, in a forum about Porsches or grandmas.
Now if only there were a place to voice my opinion about the
packaging of a Rush album...

I appreciate the work done by just about everyone that does
anything for me, including the poor fellow working at the sandwich
shop.  However, this doesn't mean that I think everyone does
everything perfectly.  I know I don't.  If no one lets me know
what I'm doing wrong, though, how can I correct it?  Hopefully,
word will get back to the designers of the CD, and they'll come up
with something different.  Who knows, that may be how this layout
came to be in the first place - people complaining that they didn't
like the 2 CD "mini-stacks" in which many double albums are sold.

Ok, here's what you need to do. Remove the CD from the drive (Be carful not
to damage it) and insert it back into the protective cardboard holder. Turn
off your machine. Unplug the computer. Pick it up and take it to your
nearest Apple retailer and tell them you want to exchange it for something
that actually works (ie. a Mac).

If you are a RUSH fan then you know what it's like to be a Mac advocate.
Whether it be music or computers, Apple and Rush both produce a great
product (the best in their respective industries) and both get neither the
respect nor the recognition they deserve. They are both victims of "bad
press" and are constantly fighting the false stereotypes pertpetuated by an
industry that doesn't bother to check it's facts but instead would rather
rely on tired cliches.

If you are a WinDoze user ask youself this the next time you spend hours on
hold with techincal support, "What computers do RUSH rely on to make their
music?" Macs!

Sorry if this sounds like a SoapBox monologue and I don't want to incite a
Mac vs PC debate but I just find a lot of parallels between Rush and Apple
that I haven't yet seen mentioned in this forum.

This will be my only reply to the digest about this, because it could
easily digress far far from having any RUSH content (as if it hasn't
already). Anyone who would like to respond past this please do so via
private email.
The classic analogy of vision working like a camera, in which we passively
register static images, like snapshots, is far from correct.
The idea that perception cannot occur without motion is based on the fact
that we, as observers, are never still.  Even when standing as perfectly
still as we can, we still experience slight eye movements and typically
significant postural sway.  This keeps the image on the retina in constant
flux.  Perception is a dynamic and active process that is enabled by
our ability to move.  The cutting edge of perceptual research is now
known as Perception/Action.  Further, perception is temporally extended
beyond the razor's edge of the present.  

A classic experiment that examined the possibility of freezing the retinal
image was once performed in which a picture was glued to a contact lens,
and thus no matter how the wearer moved, the image moved too so that the
same receptors on the retina were continually stimulated - and guess what?
Perception broke down.  Among other things, the receptors adapted to the
point that they no longer could function.  The subject reported seeing
nothing after only a few moments.
For those interested, I direct you to J.J. Gibson's classic treatise, The
Ecological Approach to Visual Perception, published by Erlbaum in 1979.

(note that I won't touch your brief assertion that perception is some sort
of an illusion - oh boy)

Other things regarding Clusterworks on Macs:
Does anyone who is using system 7.6 (or anything predating OS 8) have
trouble with Quicktime 3.0 ?
When I restarted my PowerMac with 7.6.1 after the installation, a weird
system error kept occuring, and I could do nothing with the machine, so I
had to restart without extensions, and I disabled various nonessential
Quicktime things like QTVR, and restarted and it managed to work, although
a few of my games don't function as smoothly as before.
Clusterworks functions, though I found it somewhat boring.  I have
AfterDark screensavers that are more psychedelic.  

Now I am reading that some Mac users on this list are able to synch it up
with the Rush music (as opposed to the lame music that accompanies
Clusterworks)? How do you do that?  I can't even access the audio tracks
on disc 1 of Different Stages when its in my computer.  All I can see are
Clusterworks and QT data files, and installers.

Can someone please post a list of all commands for interacting with
Clusterworks?

Oh - and to all those who suggest that the tinkertoys are about Jackie and
Selena - isn't it the case that Neil had very little to do with the design
and production of DS and that this is the work of Hugh Syme?
Why would Hugh bring such attention to this tragedy by placing it smack
dab on the cover of a new Rush album.
Besides, on the back cover, the 3 tinkertoys are labelled as Stage1,
Stage2 and Stage 3, i.e. Different Stages.  I think the significance is
directly related to the Differnent Stages of RUSH represented on the
album.  Further, there are 3 tinkertoys because there are 3 members of
RUSH - with the number 3 being apparent on just about every cover since
Signals, that I can think of.
Art is such a thing that you never know how people will interpret it.

Actually, if you research the etimology of the word "Farewell" you will
discover that it descends from the Old English term "yare" which means "to
travel without shoes" and refers the displacement of the Monarchy at the
hands of the Serfs. When Medevil Kings were cast out the serfs removed
their shoes so they would have to walk like the common folk...barefoot.
Thus the term "Farewell to Kings" thought to mean "good-bye my honorable
king" is actually "Yarewell to Kings" or "Walk without shoes you rich, fat
bastard". That is why the shirt correctly reads YIIK.

I disagree that the ClusterWorks program is a "pretty serious waste of time
by Rush."  Yes, it's true that it may not have a very strong relationship
to the music.  However, I still think it was a nice gesture by the band to
include it on the CD.  It's nice because we're getting something for
nothing.  ClusterWorks didn't add anything to the price of the set.
ClusterWorks didn't detract anything away from the music on the set.  And
people who enjoy computer-generated art will probably find the program to
be interesting.

So, to answer the question "what's the point of putting it on a Rush CD?",
I just think that the program falls in line with the bonus CD...a little
something extra from the band to the fans.  Something extra that does not
add to the cost of the project, or detract from the quality of the project.

Of course, another opinion on the matter could be, "Why not keep
ClusterWorks off the CD and add more music to the free space on the disc?"
In one interview of Geddy that I read, it sounded like the decision to add
ClusterWorks was towards the end of the project, maybe a last minute thing,
so the setlist for the set was probably already determined.  (This could be
way off, but that's how I interpreted the interview.)

Anyone else with some thoughts on this?

Now there's someone who's paying attention!  Ben, I'd highlight your whole
post as it was filled with detailed tidbits throughout, but I don't have the
space.  I've had countless opinions similar to yours over the years but
wouldn't have been able to describe them nearly as well as you did.  Be that
as it may, I'm of the opinion that every single omission or change to a song
is intentional and not an oversight.  And while I may be disappointed that
Neil now chooses to hit the remote hi-hat in place of the china cymbal at
the end of Tom Sawyer, I respect his and the band's decision for these
modifications--after all, they're the ones who play the songs.  I hope you
can appreciate the gems of the additional animal sounds at the end of The
Trees, and the resurrection of the "barroom piano" (anyone remember where
that came from?) at the end of TSOR as evidence that they do indeed revisit
these seemingly overlooked nuances and make conscious decisions about what
to play and what not to play.

Dear TMNS and numerous RUSH fans,

    With the release of DS, we can certainly have a happy Christmas! 
I've been scanning the feedback about the new live set, and most are =
quite pleased with the finished product. Time will tell if this is the 
last recording by the boyz, but, if it is, it's a great way to conclude 
an incredible career.

    Personally, I feel Geddy, Alex, and Neil still have much to offer 
the music world. Despite Neil's personal tragedies, his love is playing 
the drums and being part of the band, so I can't see him not wanting to 
have this in his life. It's not like he's unable to play, or is 
handicapped in any way. I'm sure we'll know the future plans of the band 
in the not so distant future.

    My favourite tracks on DS are "Driven" and "Natural Science." These 
songs seem to exemplify the band's live sound the best. Boy, this is one 
recording that makes me glad I own a house and can crank the volume 
control at my own pleasure.....

To avoid potential confusion:  Yes, in the studio Working
Man, you're right.  However in Hammersmith '78 Working
Man, Geddy sang "Watney's Red Barrel" instead.

The Japanese actually came up with the modern ice beer
craze.  Accidentally frozen doppelbock was called eisbock
in Germany though, and the beer resulting from removing
the ice was quite potent and malty-sweet.  But that's a 
whole 'nother thing...

But, "ice cold beer" has been a common term since long
before the ice beer fad you refer to, which Working Man
actually preceeded in any event.

Victory is a world-class brewery, and I'll refrain from
offering a list of my favorite local, regional, and extra-
regional GoodBeers for brewvity's (hah!  typo-cum-pun)

Actually, that rather short-lived trend in brewing was started by Labatt,
another big Canadian brewer. They even had a patent on the process if I
remember correctly. I'll agree with you about the taste though, it really

How about an "OV" or an "Club" or ever a "Pil"?? All are good beers for the
Working Man, except perhaps the middle one, which is really quite awful and
should not be consummed by anyone (gag gag, ackkkkkkkk). My preferences lie
with the latter - Pilsners all around!!!

sorry if this has been covered already but I haven't caught up with all the

Someone asked about the equations and stuff on the cover.  Someone already 
pointed out the gravitational constant (more accurately, the acceleration 
due to gravity) of 32 ft/s^2 (although it's actually 32.2, nbd) and the 
2112^3.  But the two equations (I'm not going to try to recreate them, 
you can look at the cover) are completely meaningless, from a mathematical 
or physical standpoint anyway.  It kinda reminds me of that old CloseUp 
toothpaste commercial where the girl has to tutor the football player...
"Now, Chuck...the equation...", "x=2cos(a)","You'll pass"  <CloseUp 
toothpaste smooch>.  That always pissed me off because x=2cos(a) doesn't 
mean anything.  No wonder I didn't get any action in high school...I was too 
concerned with reality! :)

I love all the little tinkertoy sightings.  It just makes it more fun for the

Size (you may say Hey Mark, Princess Bride hadn't even come out yet! to which I
say - you think demonspawn can't see in the future? HELLO!!!) ok, next; 
h-u-k-w-i-n:  As we all know Hukwin is the patron saint of pool cleaning 
implements - I tremble with fear just thinking about the slime and muck 
involved, and lastly; t-e-r-t-o-u-r: an anagram for torture, duh!  Crytsal 
clear from where I sit - listen to Rush or be forever tortured by having to 
clean giant rat turds out of the pool.  

For myself, I'm forever trapped in this Limbo I call Rush fandom.  But it's not
too late for some of you younger fans.  Run!  Run I tell you, burn those CD's 
and tapes and concert programs and listen to wholesome music like that 2Pac 
Shaker guy or Marilyn Manson (I always thought she was a pretty American girl, 
despite the Playboy thing.  poor Joe Dimaggio)

If you have to ask, the answer is yes.

Have a good one!

Mark
