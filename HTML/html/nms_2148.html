I didn't think I was going to join the flood of great reviews for DS: I
figured I'd just kick back and allow you guys to go at it.  There's
certainly been no shortage of good news.  But the music drives me to

It's very simple; he didn't listen to the album.  He jsut looked at the
cover.  Got his e-mail addy?  I'll flame him with a torch, er, lighter.

That would be totally bogus, but that's not really the case.  He used to
perform the "magic note" live using a digital delay.  First he'd get the
note singing, then hit a pedal that looped a small piece, then go to town on
the arpeggios.  My guess is he's just gotten lazy about this!  It's more fun
to run around stage than to be tied to pedals all the time...

<A NAME="2148006">Subject: DS in UK at last</A>

So, I finally got DS.  Still listening, so I'll tell you later.
I don'y know if I am the first, but here goes.
Apart from the obvious doctoring, the photo on the Hammersmith disc 
sleeve is not 1978.  It is from the June 1980 Rush 'five-nighter 
marathon' on the PW tour.  The light, dress (only in Newcastle are 
folk brave enough to wear short sleeves in February), and the date - 
it would have said 19-20 because Rush played two nights at 
Hammersmith - I was there the night before -  and the PW font on the 
poster are clues, but the real give away is the van registration 
plate - it ends in V, which means the vehicle was registered between 
August 1 1979 and July 31 1980.  

First thoughts: not enough Presto, but we have known the set list for 
so long it's pointless carping.  Also, Animate is pedestrian: you 
cannot compensate with bombast for the energy of the original.  
Otherwise, my ears like what they hear.  I wonder if we needed 
another version of the Rhythm Method.

Yours awaiting the flames

YEAH, Oh Yeah! At last DS is in the shops here in the UK (and I assume
in Europe). HMV are selling it at £21.99, Tower at £23.99. Virgin don't
even have it yet...

First listens are favourable - the packaging is great IMO. I have
several card sleeves, mainly by The Trag Hip, and I don't have a
problem. In fact, I used to love the old LP covers when they got a bit
dog-eared - gave 'em character!

Geddy definitely went for the warts 'n' all approach here - sounds a bit
like a good boot (a VERY good boot that is!).

<A NAME="2148008">Subject: DS Hammersmith Photo vs MP Tourbook photo</A>

I don't have either DS yet because I live in the UK and CD-Now has cocked up
my order.  I also don't have the MP tour book, but thanks to the Power
Windows website I can view the DS artwork
(http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/) and the Rush/NMS Web site
(http://syrinx.yyz.com/) shows the photos from the MP Tour book in Tourbooks
section.

Having looked at both photos, they are definitely not the same.  However
they were taken within literally a few minutes, if not seconds, of each
other.  Most of the crowd have been airbrushed out, but you can see certain
individuals remain in place.  If you look at the DS artwork, underneath the
"O" in ODEON, you can see two blokes, one with a light shirt, the other
dressed in black.  They are also in the MP photo, albeit their body posture
has now been slightly changed.  They appear to be examining a tour programme
or a magazine of some kind in the MP photo.  Similarly the next pillar along
on the right under the "N" shows a few people who are common to both photos
(It helps if you convert the MP photo to greyscale and blow it up by 100% so
the images are directly comparable).

Therefore, I believe that the DS Hammersmith artwork is a genuine photo,
which has been heavily doctored.  The posters out front are identical,
except where the Joan Armatrading posters on MP photo have been replaced
with Tinkertoy posters. The original sign outside stated "Rush...On the
five-nighter marathon.  No support.  Bar.  Official Gear Inside".  On DS the
sign now simply reads "Rush Feb 20 1978 Plus support.  Bar Official Gear
Inside".  The date has obviously been added by an American - the English
would have written 20 Feb 1978.

Another clue that the photo is doctored, other than the obvious ones such as
the band being in the photo and mental nurses in their undercover "Jolly
Teabag" Comma van(?) is the cobbled road.  This sort of road is called
Belgian Pave and is very, very rare in the UK.  Edinburgh seems to be the
only place where the streets remain like this in any significant quantity.
I'm pretty sure from memory that the Hammy Odeon isn't paved outside, but
maybe it was in 1978.  I doubt it.  Someone else has also noted that the
number plate on the van is also 2 years out of date.  Probably a genuine
number plate from wherever the van element of the photo was lifted - it
isn't there in the MP photo

Incidentally someone asked what Official Gear Inside meant. "Gear" is
English slang word for merchandise, so Official Gear Inside means that
proper tour T-shirts, etc are only for sale inside the concert hall.  This
is a quite common statement for UK venues because official merchandise
inside the hall costs currently approx. £15-20 for a T-shirt and £25-30 for
a sweatshirt or a baseball jersey.  The unofficial stuff outside costs about
£5 for a T-shirt.  Therefore promoters try to encourage customers to buy
inside to get the "superior quality official merchandise".  Mind you the
bootleg Signals T-shirt I bought outside lasted considerably longer than the
official baseball jersey.

Desperately looking forward to getting hold of DS in the UK.  For the time
being I'll have to console myself with Dream Theaters "Once in a livetime"
instead.  Mind you the first time I played disc 2, I thought I had a
misprinted Rush CD.  The first two minutes of Trial of tears reminds me so
much of Xanadu, it isn't true.  Anyone else think this?

Cheers, Mark

David Letterman?  ANd also where can I find there videos on tape or 
instructional videos?  Another questions is are they going to come out

going to come out with a new CD in the year 2000 is this true?  Thanks

If you want progressive Rush, You have to go WAY back.
Try these tunes:

2112
Cygnus X1
Hemispheres
Xanadu
By-Tor
The Fountain 
The Necromancer

These songs are more in line with what I find to be progressive.  I listen
to a lot of YES, King Crimson, ELP, Tull, etc.

These bands are known for songs that take up a whole side of an
album.(remember those?) As an example, I have a YES album (which I think is
their best), "Tales of Topographic Oceans" It is Four songs contained on
Two records.  A deffinate must have.

<A NAME="2148011">Subject: RUSH & Queensryche</A>

Hello for the Great (wet & windy) Northwest!!!!

As far as Rush being "quick" about releasing new material...where has 
this guy been? (not a flame, just a question!!!  :}  )
Rush hasn't been quick about new albums since, oh say Moving Pictures or 
maybe Signals (pretty short span in there!).  But he is right, as they 
have matured, the span between releases has seemes to have gotten wider.  
Nothing wrong with that, though, they deserve the breaks they take, it 
has long been my contention that Canada's "musical ambassadors to the 
world" are among the hardest working bands in the business.  One last 
thing on this note...Queensryche is history...KISW in Seattle announced 
that about 4 months ago.  Sad, I had long held them as the next great 
cerebral rock band in the vein of Rush and Pink Floyd.  From what I 
hear, Chris DeGarmo is the one to "blame" although I cannot be certain, 
so I will spare him the slings and arrows of any futile hostility. (I 
won't bother to mention Metallica...blech, to mention them in the same 
pool with Rush & QR is a waste of time & cyberpaper).

And Barry J. Cook Sandy, Utah asked about the remasters....YES!!!!!! 
(for a plethora of audiophillic reasons)

Dear Adrianne..."PROLLY" is not a word, I hope this was a misnomer on 
the part of tired fingers! We here of serious intellect deserve, as do 
our trio of heros, something farther from "kindeegarden" lingo.
  How about "Alien Shores" or "Driven", better yet...BOTH!!!!

Yes, Dave...Tinkerlith gets my vote!!! And this...."The above message is 
brought to you by "Presidential". The new cologne
for men that will leave you feeling unimpeachable."  Too damned 
funny!!!!!

Favorite show???  The Gorge at George, WA 1997 (April???  I was pretty 
loaded..."look out for those tall weeds, Slim, if ya burn 'em they do 
funny stuff to yer head") At sunset, Geddy and Alex both turned around 
to look out over the river and were visably moved.  The only 
disappointing factor about the show was that is was a breezy night, and 
that affected the sound a bit.

On the topic of Rush and MTV (or ANY music awards show): Face it folks, 
the station's on the air, but no one's in the control room...same thing 
for music awards.  Besides...how did the line in the song go (forgive me 
if I get this wrong, but it's 5am and my cd's are in the 
car!!!)..."braggers and boasters, all those black lights and posters, 
we're not into that scene.....leave me alone and let me rock and roll".  
I think that sums it up.  While the music industry is busy telling us 
that Coolio, The Spice Girls, and Puff Daddy have some redeeming social 
qualities, we can all just sit back and take a breath, shaking our heads 
the way our parents used to just before saying "You're grounded"!!!  MTV 
sucks, now and forever..."Music Television"???  Nah   Mindless 
Television" is closer, methinks.

Well..I suppose that's it.  Except for the guy who called Neil a 
"nonbeliever".  That's a term most often slung about by the 
Fundamentalist camp...easy there Trigger. I'm a Buddhist (by philosophy, 
not by religion) and I believe that Christ was too (read an awful lot 
that points to this conclusion) so what does that make me??  Neil 
believes in what he believes...so what if it's not your patriarchal 
deity?????

     Barry wondered in a recent post:
     
     "I'm thinking about replacing my Rush albums with the re-masters. 
     Question: is it worth the money?"
     
     -> To Barry and others considering the investment, I say "go for it".  
     The remastered editions of the earlier Rush albums are *much* better.  
     Unless your stereo system is a plastic boombox, you should notice a 
     marked improvement in the digital transferring.  The sound is richer, 
     purer, and cleaner.  Price-wise, they appear to be the same, so why 
     not go for the better product?  If you're in a CD mail club, you may 
     be able to get most, if not all through their '12 for 1' marketing 
     promotions.
     
     While I have yet to acquire all the remastered titles, you can safely 
     bet that I will have them eventually (I'm a completist when it comes 
     to Rush, so I'll probably get both the remastered and 'cheap' 
     versions).  I'm far from a sound engineer; just a fanatic.
     
     Cheers,
     John

I just got my CD today (in Norway) and I am also having trouble with the
Clusterworks. Like with you, I also believe everything is set up
correctly and also have a new computer. I also checked to see what was
on the CD and there was only the songs listed. I also wonder if the
European release is not enhanced. Does anyone know the answer to this?
Other than that, from what I am hearing right now, DS rocks! I would
just love to see the enhancements that go with it.

Rush is 3rd in Gold albums behind The Beatles and Kiss.  Kiss' new album
just went gold, so they are now tied.

And as for the Metallica special, the album was Roll The Bones.  I can
also distinctly remember hearing "Enter Sandman" over and over while

Greg Sanderson states that The Rhythm Method will be the least listened
to song on DS.  He argues that it should not be part of a Rush concert
because Geddy and Alex don't have solos and the drum solo is only there
because of tradition.  He invites serious attempts to dispute his case.
Consider this one of what I'm sure will be many...

In "A Work In Progress" Neil Peart states that the drum solo is a good
place for him to experiment and take chances in a concert without the
risk of screwing up Geddy and Alex.  Neil clearly wants to do a drum
solo.  That's a good reason to keep it in the show.

As for Alex, he has solos in most songs.  Just because a guitar solo
isn't always unaccompanied doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

And as for Geddy...Have you listened to Driven on DS?  In addition to
that bass solo he has many jams that could be considered solos in other
songs.  Two examples from DS are "Freewill" and "Leave That Thing
Alone".

Rush Friends,

Dare I add fuel to the fire?  There is yet another missing article.  I
do not mean articles of clothing or stolen goods in general. Rather I
mean definite and indefinite articles.  Not only is "The" missing from
"The Analog Kid" in disc two, but the "A" is missing from "A Farewell to
Kings" in disc three.

As I study the artistry behind the musicians, I find that once you make
it big, you have an unofficial license to add or remove articles
(a,an,the) whenever you deem fit.  Another example that comes to mind,
is The Smashing Pumpkins.  On the early albums, "Gish," "Siamese Dream,"
and "Pisces Iscariot" (B-sides), they call themselves simply "Smashing
Pumpkins."  From "Mellon Collie..." on, they are now "THE Smashing
Pumpkins."

Tendancy for public performers to the think that a they are above an
laws of the grammar is quite sad commentary on their profession. A
article is not the something to be the trifled an with.  A Pink Floyd or
The Led Zeppelin or even The Metallica would never do such a thing.

I love The Rush,

I didn't know it was the only Minnesota date...something's
wrong with that, since there've been plenty of MN concerts.
The only two tours after Caress of Steel that didn't 
include the twin cities were PeW and Signals.  Wait, after

Hi folks,

This is a little premature, but I am convinced that Rolling Stone again
chose not to review Rush. If so, DS becomes the fourth straight Rush
release to be ignored by RS (six, if you count the Retrospective
series). This is a bleak statement.

I would have expected the review to appear in the 12/10 issue (which did
not occur).

I also noticed today that DS - as well as its 4.5 star user rating - was
no longer on the "Recent Releases" section of the RS website, or any
other section of that page.

Like the Rush manager, I am hoping for a late review.

Any additional information out there?

Thanks,

Sam Scott

P.S. I understand the sour grapes attitude many of you take in regard to
Rolling Stone. However, a 4-5 star review from RS would surely put a
smile on essentially everyone's face. The gratifying sense of
redemption/resolution/due respect would be very high.

	I must say that before the Test For Echo tour started and I heard that
they were going to play Natural Science, I started listening to that
song over and over again for like three months. When the tour rolled
around and I heard the "Wheels within Wheels" part done twice I was
ecstatic!!!  That is the part I found myself rewinding all the time.  I
think it serves the song better to have it done twice!!!!  So, when I
saw them a bunch more times and they were still using the verse twice I
was so happy.  It's like the extra measure Neil adds to the intro to
Animate.  I think that little bit makes the song SO much cooler!!!

Just for the record......  If Genesis ever reunited and they performed
Supper's Ready, I believe they would have to play the "Guaranteed
Eternal Sanctuary Man" part for four verses each time rather than two! 
;)	
That part is a song in itself.

Actually, just a delay loop, I believe.  He played the note, let the
pedal start feding back, then stomped infinite repeat.  The a/b box
trick would work, too.

>Why doesn't he use a wah-wah anymore?  Why doesn't Alex and Geddy use

Last time I saw the stage rig, Al had Taurus pedals.  Ged has MIDI
pedals.  I've heard him use Wah within the last few tours.  Most modern
effects, including the Digitech racks Al has (EVERYBODY has some
Digitech these days), incorporate a filter that can be controlled by
pedal--i.e. a Wah.

Just wanted to ad some points here. It seems everybody is sort-of
"complaining" about Alex not playing the sustained note at the end of the
Limelight solo. Well..think about his "newer" style of playing, starting
with CP,...and think about his gear set-up for this tour. We know he pretty
much prefers a more "direct to amp" sound, in order to get that nice natural
"Marshall" sound. Listen to his solo's on CP, in particular Between Sun and
Moon, and Colf Fire. They are VERY pure solos...almost NILL effects or
processing...just Al's fingers, fretboard, and amp. I think he has dumped
most of his eefects for the past two tours. And, as ANY guitarist knows, it
is MUCH more difficult to pull off a complex solo without all sorts of
effects to "cover up" your mistakes. Thats what Alex's post-CP sound seems
to lean towards...a very clean, dry, direct to amp sound...and THAT is part
of which makes his guitar sound overall on DS sound so good. That is also
why he SHINES so much as a guitarist on DS, because you can distinguish his
awesome guitar playing without all of that "processing". So, regarding the
Limelight solo, his sustain/ delay level may be much lower then on previous
versions, but the OVERALL effect of the guitar is MUCH cleaner and straight
to the bone! Somebody also mentioned the A/B "doghouse" switching system he
had used in the past...I don't know if even uses this anymore. If there is
anybody with a DEFINITE (ie. has proof via spoken words from Alex himself)
whether he still uses this or not, it would be interesting to know.

Also, the comment about the guys being "lazier" because they don't use the
Taurus pedals, and/or where on "tape"...Rush has NEVER used tape during any
of their songs.(If anybody has a quote from any of Ged, ALex or Neil to
prove so, please "reference" it.) Yes, they use sampled sequences now, but
they are STILL triggered by the band, and the AMAZING sound quality of the
samplers they use is ALSO what gives DS such a "real" feel too it.

So...some of this is "oppinion" on the "quality" of sound...but the
methodology is what I was trying to hammer at, which is info direct from
interviews I've read with Alex and Ged.

Hey fellow Rushians,

OK Mr. Greg Sanderson.  First, I am not flaming.  I am just discussing. 
We are all entitled to our own opinions.  And in your write up on TRM,
you bring up some very good points.  But I would like to bring up one or
two.

I can see your point about tradition being the only thing that has kept
it in the setlist.  I also agree with your point that Neil's best work
is with the band.  But listening to the drum solo on E..SL, and
comparing it with the versions on ASOH and DS, Neil has made the piece
more of a song, then a display of "look how fast and technical I can
play."  With the added synthesizers and other forms of sequenced sounds
(I'm not a musician, ? on my terminology) plus Neil's experimentation of
different styles and cultures, it is now a wonderful array of rhythmic
sounds and beats.  Not just a drum solo.

Now for the fact of it being on DS, well that one is tough.  I like the
DS version much better then the one on ASOH.  So I'm glad they included
it on DS.  But, I too, would love to have had another song or two (TRM
on DS is 8:10) replace it.  So I see your point very clearly, but I'm
straddling the proverbial fence.

Thanks Greg.  You have brought up a very good topic of conversation.

Take care all.

<A NAME="2148030">Subject: 'Limelight' Guitar Solo's Magical Note Performed "Live"</A>

Alex stopped playing the "Limelight" guitar solo's last note, loop-delayed (to
simulate the studio recording), during the Power Windows tour era.

The description of how it WAS achieved "Live" as previously suggested by Mr.
Ray Lambert <raylamb@world.std.com> in his recent post is somewhat accurate.
Alex's "footdance" with his effects pedals during this part, IS shown on the
Exit Stage...Left video. I achieve the same/similar results with my old
DigiTech PDS 1002. It's a 2 second digital delay with 2 pedals to create the
solo's repeat-hold delay & then bypass to the chorused arpeggiated riff, while
the repeat-hold delay is still in progress.

Lifeson has updated his effects rig & custom pedalboard significantly since
those tours and I guess he feels it to be unnecessary or perhaps he feels it
doesn't fit in with his current "High-Tech" arsenal.

The way I figure it is the boys & him wrote and recorded these songs years ago,
they can reproduce these anyway they deem fit. If they came out on stage &
played Limelight, or any song for that matter, with flutes & bongos, I'd still
love it.

Hello Rush Fans,
It seems to be quite a controversy over the "magic note" in Limelight, and
the changing of NS, and whatever other changs that exsist in DS. I think
that changing the songs is a good thing, it kind of keeps the listener on
their seat wondering what to expect. If you listen to other music, say
Hendrix for example, the guy usually never plays the same song the same
twice. It is up to the listener to decide what version of their song they
like. Besides, I am a musician and when people are asking you to play the
same songs over and over again every time you play, the songs begin to
become a bit monotonous to me, and if it is a song that I wrote, I tend to
change it up, and if noone else notices, at least I did and it gives some
variety. Rush have been performing a VERY long time now, and many of the
songs that they are playing have been with them from the very beginning, (or
at least since Neil has been part of the band), and they must be pretty sick
of constantly playing the same exact thing every single time. Just my
opinion.
