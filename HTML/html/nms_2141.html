Hi Everybody (Hi Dr. Nick),
     Well, I just got done watching the Fancast. Did anybody else have sound
problems? The only person I could understand was Alex. Geddy & Jo Robinson
(sic) were VERY muffled. There was also no replay! They kept saying 7:30 when
in fact it started at 7:00! So I missed the first 15 minutes or so! It would
have been pretty good if it was better sounding!
     I'm done,
        Keith

    That comment I wrote about giving a finger to see a Rush concert was
a little bit strong. When I wrote it I was just a little bit drunk...i
would not give a finger for it, becouse I love to play my drums and I
don't have all that paraphernalia that Def Leppard bought to their
drummer. But I'll try to travel to Canada or U.S.A. to see a Rush
concert, if my worst nightmare doesn't come true: the end of the band or
the end of tours.

Hello there!

I havent posted for months but with a new live album the time is right. 
I must say the majority of the recordings are outstanding...they really 
put the listener right there! 
The guitar and bass are right on. Drums a little soft with Neil's new 
grip but as noted they seem to blend into each song really well. 
My favs are:
Natural Science: nice fast tempo awesome sound, quintessential Rush!
I really like the change into the heavier sound after Hyperspace.
Bravado/Resist: These ballads are just beautiful. I especially like the 
2nd verse of resist where Ged sings in a higher key, pure emotion here. 
Resist should have been a single on mainstream rock, IMHO it could have 
cracked the top 40 chart. 
2112: This goes without saying. I like the ATWAS higher key but hey, 
Geddy is in his 40's and still able to hit high notes which is amazing 
Discovery solo rocks. Geds improv on the high parts comes off fine and 
it doesnt compromise the way it was orignally written.
LTTA/RTB: better than the studio, longer and meatier as they say. How 
about geddy's bass line at the end before Neil's drum piece. Cool!
CTTH: Nice jams at the end, and great to hear a different take on it.
Driven: Gotta like the reverbs during Ged's solo. Wish it was longer.
YYZ/Cygnus Teaser: Great song to end the performance with! 
The H. Odeon disk: A notch above ATWAS excepting By-Tor and Working Man 
from ATWAS. Cygnus X-I is amazingly good when it's cranked high!

Decent performances for the rest of the songs except for (maybe) Show 
don't Tell. It's lacking a bit from the studio version-> SDT is too top 
heavy IMHO and lacks balance but it's still cool to have it live.
Freewill, Limelight TS TSOR are showing their age but come off OK. 
Freewill is a bit slow. Part of the 2001 intro is cutoff, oh well ;-)

Just a couple of things that could have been included or improved on:

Packaging: the disks are hard to get out and could be scratched easily
Song Selection: How about taking out TS/Freewill for Xanadu/Hemispheres 
Prelude-> maybe we will get some more live "unreleased" performances if 
the band decides to retire/not tour again. The fact that we got the H. 
Odeon disk indicates this IMHO. 

Can anyone post any relevant info on what Ged/Alex said during the chat 
Sun. night? 

Thank you...Goodnight!

Yeah, that overdub (or whatever) is really, really funny
on Cinderella Man!!!!!  I thought the dub said "Might fine keep!!!!"

Mighty fine keep, i suppose, would be something a girl might say if
she saw a guy she liked (the dub sounded terribly
girlish to me)  You now, kind of like a fisherman
who see a fish he/she thinks is a kep and says :"mighty fine keep."
>....no humor was really intended  : )

ANYWAY, I tell you one thing, this CD ser is VERY fun to listen
to!!  I was driving around Baltimore's I-695 just having a field
day blasting "Roll The Bones" or "Driven" while weaving 
around cars, trying to pass other cars.  

I love this band called Rush.

Well, I saw where some people were trying to
dicipher the meaning of the tinker toys on the
album cover.....Well, how about something
more simple.  Take a look at the inside of the
booklet, with all the Rush memorabilia.  Notice
how a turtle is placed along the chronologically
ordered layout of Rush albums, tickets, passes,
awards, etc.  This turtle must represent the slow
"procession" of Rush into rock history books and
into decent stardom...and probably the development
of an extremely firm bond between Geddy, Alex,
and Neil and their music....among other things.  

That's definitely low-hanging
fruit compared to the figuring of the EXACT meaning of the
tinker toys!

Hello fellow fans,

Extremely long time no post.  Last time I think I caused the controversy over
whether you're a fan because you yelled "Hey!" during Overture/Syrinx.  I'm
not back to cause controversy, but if it happens, oh well. So anyway hi.  Will
go on record and agree with most of you that DS is the best Rush live release
by no stretch of the imagination.  What could only make it better for me is if
my computer at home or work could play the Clusterworks thingy, but oh well.
A new fangled computer for home will be forthcoming next year probably, so
hopefully....  

Also wanted to remind many of you how fortunate you are that you have radio
stations in your area that play Rush and/or played the radio premiere, etc.
Here in Little Rock, AR, there's only one station that actually plays Rush
(105.1 FM - Little Rock/Conway), which I hear every now & then.  After the
supposed first single (SOR) was playing on radio stations near you, I emailed
the radio station about it and also asked if they'd be playing the radio
premiere on Nov. 4th.  Response came back saying they'd been playing (SOR).
Bullshit.  I listened to that station all night for about a week.  Not one
single mention of the new release.  Response also said that they would not be
airing the premiere but would instead air a two-hour special focusing on the
new live albums by Rush, Aerosmith & Sabbath.  Hmpf.
I ended up listening to the radio premiere via Real Audio from 107.1 in
Memphis, TN.  I emailed my local radio station and blasted them for their lack
of Rush and not playing the premiere.  I still tuned in and never heard any
new Rush till this past Saturday night, the 14th, when they aired that 2 hour
special!  Well I've had DS since release day, the 10th, thank you very much!!!
What dumbasses!!!!  In my email, I reminded them that if Rush will probably
never ever play in Little Rock again because of the lack of radio support.
This town lives up to its name: little rock.  For there is very little rock in
this town.  So this 2 hour special airs Saturday night, and the Rush segment
lasts about 30 minutes.  It wasn't taken from the radio premiere that Jo
Robinson or whatever her name did, it's Geddy only quotes.  Stuff that sounds
similar to what I read in the Liner Notes article on the tnms website.  They
played TS, SOR, Limelight & CTTH.  Wow, they really went out on a limb didn't
they?  

I'm furious.  Now you know why when I drove 6 hours to St. Louis and saw Rush
in the Kiel Center on Halloween night in '96 for T4E.  Saw them later in
Houston with my nephews.  Things haven't been the same since I moved to LR
from Houston in '94.  

Alas, it still tickles me to hear the hammered dulcimer in Resist on DS.  It's
a sample I know but I don't care.  It's cool to say there's any kind of
dulcimer on a Rush recording.  You may remember that I play the fretted
dulcimer and was the '92 National Champ. :)  Not to toot my horn.   

One more thing: Has anyone ever mentioned the loud sound of the loon that you
hear during 'Time & Motion' segment of Neil's drum video?  I wonder why?
Hmm....

Later taters,
Scott

nickb@teleport.com said in TNMS #2138:

"$18.88 at Fry's Electronics in Wilsonville Oregon wasn't a
bad deal at all, though I'm loathe to patronize such a
civil-rights abusing corporation.  Anyone that's been there 
knows what I mean:  their workers who want to search your
receipt and merchandise as you leave the store.  Under the
Uniform Commercial Code of the USA, merchandise becomes the
personal property of the customer at the moment of sale, not
upon leaving the store's property.  Fry's has *no* right to
inspect your personal property, and their tactic of asking
to do so when you leave their store amounts to a violation 
of your right to a protection from unreasonable search. 
Next time you're at Fry's you can refuse to show them your
receipt and merchandise.  You can sue them for false arrest
if they detain you without reasonable cause."

Give me a big break, Nick, and find something more useful to rant
about!  I'm a member of Costco here in Colorado, and they do the same
thing as you leave the store.  Sit down, stop acting like a leftist
lawyer, and let me tell you why stores do this: 1) Loss prevention --
people I know who work at this Costco store have told me many stories of
customers who tried to take merchandise out who had NOT converted it to
"personal property" by paying for it; 2) Over- & Under-charging for
merchandise (this has happened to me, when the cashier thought an item
did not scan when it actually did, and I was double-charged); and,
though a rare occurrence, 3) making sure you didn't grab someone else's
cart by mistake.

Abusing civil rights -- HUMBUG!  Now, if they asked you to take a mark
on your right hand or forehead in order to shop there...that would be
something to get irate about!

OK.....What do the tinker toys mean?

At first thought: The 3 CDs, two recent and one past.  But the colored dots
on the back don't match the positioning of the toys on the front.  Second
thought: Neil is Yellow, alone and writing lyrics.  The other two are
writing the music?  Then I see the dedication and I thought, Neil is Yellow
piece and alone.  His wife and Daughter are now together in heaven?  Also
the inside picture where the tinker toy looks like it is reaching up into
the heavens?

Any thoughts or ideas?
I also am aware, that the arrangement of the toys has no meaning.....but I
like to believe otherwise.

ThanX to the rush-mgr for putting the rush
videos back up.  I was wondering if u will be
putting up other videos?  I see that the atlantic
site has different videos on their site, except 
they are more like slide shows and cant be 
saved.

   [ If I ever get other videos on tape, I will put them up. What is on the
     NMS site is all I have on tape from the newer videos (I have TTCE &
     Chronicles and still need to do the rest from those)        : rush-mgr ]

Additionally, will ne site have the fancast
viewable online?  What about it being transcribed?
I missed some of the interview ;-(

Oh, and thanx to all for asking good questions (overall)
to the band.  Atleast the ppl on the net has some
knowledge of the band and dont ask typical dumb
questions.

Well, DS finally arrived via mail-order today.  Could I possibly be the 
LAST one to receive it?  :-)

I'm about 1/2 way through the Hammersmith disc.  It's awesome.  I especially 
enjoy the "European" recordings (i.e., this, and Side 2 on ESL), as their 
crowds are more respectful of the band.  They don't seem to have the same 
need to "be heard" during those quieter parts of certain pieces as we do in 
North America.  

I'll pace myself for the other two discs, as I have to get something done at 
work today.

I think the packaging is way cool.  When I heard the horror stories of disc 3 
"falling-out," I didn't envision it having its own sleeve.  Hey, works for 
me.  I'm not sure if I'll perform surgery on it to fit it in one of those 
"CHRONICLES"-like multi-disc cases.

I really like the overhead shot of Neil amidst his set-up on the fold-out; 
it's an overwhelming, formidable set-up (he's just awesome).  The one picture 
which brought a smile to my face is the one of Alex standing with his hand 
on the wing of a Cessna 152.  I'm a pilot, so it seems fitting that the 
guitarist in my favorite band is also an aviator.  I wonder if that was his 
plane or a rental?  I've flown a 152 myself; it's a tiny 2-seater, but has 
good climb performance.  Not much hauling ability though.

Anyway, I'm glad DS is here.  It's an extremely tasteful presentation of a 
25-year history.  Everyone who receives e-mail from me in the next few weeks 
will be encouraged to pick one up (see below).

By the way, if anyone knows how I can get one of those "Total Access" passes 
for the next tour, please let me know.  I'd love to be able to tune a guitar 
or two for Alex and exchange hangar stories!  MK

Couldn't agree with you more Jose!  The Fountain of Lamneth is the
epitome of what Rush was back in the 70's.  The music arrangement is
every bit as good as 2112 (better, in my opinion) and the lyrical
arrangement is the best of early Rush.  I deeply regret that we don't have
a copy of this song played live at the Hammersmith.  
Funny how Caress of Steel didn't sell well in stores but it is definitely
Rush's best album of the 1970's.

Hey Rushheads,

I, for one, really like the packaging.  I understand that people have their
preferences and don't blame anyone for criticizing.  My CD rack holds CD's
in the upright position.  The only other cardboard CD that I own is Pearl
Jam's Vitology, which I bought for my wife one year.  Vitology is taller
than jewel case CD's, so it can't even fit in my CD case.  What a pain in
the ass it is.  Different Stages, however, is the same height as jewel
cases, so there is no problem fitting it in my CD holder!   :o)

Additionally, I had no idea that the third disk was loose when I first
opened the package and IT DID NOT FALL OUT ON ME!!!!!!!  All those people

Dear All,

As was mentioned in an earlier issue, I can now confirm after 
telephoning EastWest Records that the release date for DS has been 
officially pushed back to Monday November 23rd 1998.  I personally have 
decided to order the US version through a UK mail order company, which 
will hopefully arrive by post tomorrow (17th).

No reason was given by EastWest for this further delay.

And the Canadian Constitution says what, exactly, about this?
Neil's apparently in favor of even *stricter* gun control laws
(merely offered as potential liberal-bashing fodder), in case
it's of interest to you.

I have very hard evidence that George Washington was a proud

I'm torn, but yes, it does ostensibly sound like a sneeze.

Yes, indeed I did.  And for a Canadian post-hippie in 1978, this

all that many good beers around back then.  CAMRA members can

If you look really close you will notice four (4) not three (3) tinker toys
on the dedication fold.  The forth (4th) being below the others, green in
color.  This was probably used in every application during the design phase.
All Syme does is crop off what is not needed at any given point.  Which is
why you may see three (3) everywhere else except the dedication fold.

Hi all my counterparts

Does anyone know what the hell is going on at Atlantic?  DS was to be
released in the UK today and our friends at Atlantic have decided to delay
the release by one week!

On another note, I thought the fancast was great with both audio and video
better quality than I expected.

Hi Frank...

I've had the same trouble with Disc 1...only audio shows up on my computer.
 I guess I was just chalking it up to having an older CD-ROM which is not
able to read a "multi-session" CD properly.

I have a newer ROM at work, I guess I should try it there, but I don't have
a sound card there...oh well.

i listed 14 songs separated by commas and by the word "OR".  which means 
any of the songs on the longer first list could replace any of the songs 
on the shorter second list.  it does not mean that ALL of them HAVE to be 
included.  it's difficult to insult someone's intelligence when you do it 
ignorantly.  and "no, i'm not complaining" again.  i was merely 
responding to the guy who asked "where are the people who bitched about 
the set list".  i was letting him (and any other NMSer's who wondered) 
know that some of us are still here and that we still believe there was 
room to improve the set list.

>Would you really rather have a jumbled collection of live versions of

if it means getting the more obscure live songs that were played, then 
YES!  the video will take care of the real rush concert experience.

"to you?"  oh i see.  you can have your opinion, but mine isn't valid 
because it's different.  does it surprise you to know that i have 
received a few emails in support of my invalid opinion?

>Even though there are a few songs
>missing, and a few added in from the Counterparts Tour, at least you can
>listen to these discs and feel like you've just listened to a real concert.

that's because the production is better.  the tracks were still taken 
from different shows, the order was switched, and different tours were 
included.  the transitions between the songs is improved on DS because 
production technology has advanced.  a producer can take two songs 
recorded at different shows on different tours and make them sound like 
they were played back-to-back.  but you seem to think it would be 
impossible to do the same thing with the other songs i listed that were 
recorded on the past 4 tours.  do you really think that a producer 
wouldn't be able to make the other songs sound like a real concert?

i'm glad for you.  and i never said i didn't like the album.  i simply 
said that it would be a great deal better if it included different tracks 
(my opinion, obviously not yours).  i would prefer a live album that 
would "bring me back" to being at a few different shows (instead of one). 
 excuse me for having an opinion that is not yours.

did i say i wasn't pleased?  no.  i merely voiced an opinion that is 
different than yours and different from the guy who asked about the 
people who bitched about the set list.  and you feel the need to slam me 
because of it.  and the guy who asked where are the set list 
bitches(ryan/stumpy) sent me a private email that was so vulgar and ill, 
i had to laugh.  he wrote a novel telling me what a fucking asshole i 
was, and then told me i needed to get a life.  i urge you both to look 
again at my post.  you'll see that the word "OR" separates both lists of 
songs.  you'll also see that to someone with a different opinion, the 
point i made is valid.  and please, keep in mind that i was merely 
responding to the guy who asked the question "where are all the people 
who bitched about the set list?"  i did not instigate the discussion.  i 
was willing to leave it alone.  we beat it to death before the live 
album, because people like you thought it was sac-religious to think that 
rush could do wrong.  i merely answered the moronic question, "where are 
all those people who were bitching about the set list?"

>PS And don't get me started on the "packaging" whiners!

peace be with you, as well.  but the "packaging" whiners are entitled to 
their opinions as well, and this IS the place for them to talk about it.  
this list is not just to jack-off to how great rush is.  it's a list to 
discuss various opinions the fans have, whether you agree or disagree.  
so can we just please agree to disagree on this one, and leave it at that?

This is not entirely related but here in Toronto all the major retailers
seem to have great deals going for DS. I picked it up at Sunrise Music for
$19.99 plus 15% tax. For those in the US that translates to less than $15
US. Sam the Record Man and HMV seemed to have similar deals going.

 "Randolph Mack (Hello!)" said:
It seemed to me that Rush has *four* (maybe five) stages, and that the
space represented a stage not represented in the CDs: the 80s. Consider
the albums recorded in the 80s (PW was recorded in 79, released in 1980,
so it doesn't count) and the songs from them on DS: MP: 2, Signals: 1,
GUP: 0, PW: 0, HYF: 0. So the missing space, almost exactly a tinkertoy in
height, represented the 80s stuff (perhaps chronicled satisfactorly on
ASOH to them).

Randolph, there are 3 from MP,  TS, YYZ, and Limelight.  But I agree with
your interpretation of the tinkertoys.

One question I have, though.  No one mentioned that there are hearts in the
side of the tikertoys.  It's been a while since I played with them, but for
the life of me, I can not remember there being hearts in the sides.  Take a
close look.  I thought this definitely symbolized Neil's loss.  But I think
the cover of a new album wouldn't be the place where Neil and the boys would
want to symbolize it.  But why the hearts then?

Hi Folks

Not quite what I expected either but excellent nonetheless. BTW, I 
was the 'mrkb5' that asked if you if you were THE rushmgr <g>

My computer crapped out about a minute before the chat began 
though so I had to reset, log back on and get back into the site so I 
missed a few things from the video feed. Apparently they chatted 
for an hour and a half but I missed the last half hour or so as I'm in 
the UK and it was 1.00 am by this point <g>

Main highlights and news though

1. Video and DVD version of DS at some point. Geddy seemed 
particularly keen on the DVD version and he hoped to be able to 
use some of the special features of DVD. From the way he talked 
though (comparing DVD to CD-Rom) I think he meant in terms of 
menus and additional info as opposed to something like multi 
camera angles.

2. No new Victor album anytime soon - Alex said the first one was 
something he had to do at that time in his life.

3. When someone asked how the band has managed to last for so 
long - Alex jumped on top of Ged and started making humping 
motions - he got so carried away that he actually fell over the back 
of the couch <g>

I'm sure other people will post more stuff but this is what I mostly 
remember.

<A NAME="2141038">Subject: Guitar Sounds on Different Stages</A>

Alright,

So, when I was listening to disk #1 of Different Stages for the first time, 
I noticed that the guitar sound on 'Freewill' was a little strange.  In 
particular, it sounded as though the high E-string had entirly different 
tone than the rest of the strings.  I think the guitar only sounded like 
this in certain sections of the song; everywhere else it just had standard 
tone.  It sounded as though the guitar had a seperate output for the E-string 
and was being sent though the clean guitar patch, and all the other strings 
were going through the distorded route.  I know Eddie Van Halen did something 
like this on 'Top Jimmy' with a Ripley Stereo Guitar (or something like 
that, I can't remember exactly) where each string could be panned 
independently back and forth between two different outputs and then each of 
these outputs could be routed wherever.  Anybody know what was going on with 
Alex's guitar setup that night?

<A NAME="2141039">Subject: Geddy's albums, a bargain and the Rush ManagerESS</A>

Whoo hoo! Geddy mentions The Who's "Live at Leeds" - a raw, loud riot of
a show. I was a Who fan before diving into Rush, and I'm always thinking
in terms of Entwistle/Lee, Townshend/Lifeson and Moon/Peart. Obvious
differences, but the skill levels of all are through the roof.

And then "Relayer"! Yes happens to be another old favorite band, which
I've seen live more than Rush. This year's *** 30th *** anniversary tour
was jaw-dropping stunning. Again, there are Squire/Lee, Bruford/Peart
thoughts churning away. (Howe/Lifeson? nah, too different.)

I liked Geddy's responses to the past openers questions. Very supportive.

And a big "I can't believe people are blowing $60 on Bruce rather than Rush"
scratch of the head. DS is DEFINITELY a bargain, cheap at the price. I
certainly hope that the boys have invested wisely and are doing fine;
perhaps
that plays into being able to tour with 2 sets and sell DS so cheap?
They have assumed control ;-) and are refraining from "asking the price
of the land"?

And a ROTFLMAO at the Rush-mgrESS ... [ Not last time I looked! :-) ]
Beauty, eh?
