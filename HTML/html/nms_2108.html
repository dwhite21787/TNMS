Glad to see the news about another Victor project. Some of the best CD's, or 
most interesting I've bought in the last couple of years have been solo or 
project CD's.

Starting with Victor and all the way to a couple of Ty Tablor solo and 
project CD's, I am really starting to like side projects. They are more of 
an uncompromised approach to making music, as they should be. Victor really 
showcased Alex's playing and his strength as a song writer. The follow up 
can only be better.

For you Dream THeatre fans, Myung and the keybord guy (Name?) hooked up with 
drummer Rod Morganstein (Dixie Dreggs/Winger) and Ty Tabor of Kings-X 
(Guitar). The CD is called Platypus, "When Pus Comes To Shove". Strange 
cooky name, but great disk.  You can get it at :   www.vvinyl.com  Do a 
search on group name.

A mix of Dream Theatre progressive, with straight ahead rock and some Kings-X 
Beatleesque harmonies!

Ty stretched himself and really proves to be a well versed guitarist. All in 
all these project, side CD's are a great way for the artists to take  a 
break from the regular routine and learn or do something new. Many interviews 
show that the artists involved felt a sense of renewal and enthusiasm 
towards making music. Hopefully we will see another Victor CD soon!

One more shameless plug. Get Doug Pinnicks solo, Poundhound!

I heard on the radio in a recent interview with Geddy Lee 9-17-98 that
they have absolutely no plans for a new album, and the other information
didn't sound so good for the future. Geddy sounded like TFE might possibly
have been the last. That was the impression I got from him.
Hopefully Im wrong.

I can't believe it, but Rock 105.3 here in San Diego is playing Entre
Nous as I write this.  It's 12:55 PST on Monday 9/21--incredible!
Anybody else (Rush Mgr?) lucky enough to catch this?  This is a landmark

Spirit of Radio, Freewill, CTTH, etc).  I have never heard this one on

Scott Finkel: ditto on your last four albums analysis.  I also was quite
depressed upon first hearing Presto, and like you I now like it.  Roll the
Bones was better, but Counterparts quite simply restored my faith.  

Hey Rush-mgr, my wife is very interested in the cross stitch program you
downloaded.  Can you tell us where?  Apparently cross stitch/craft stores
change "Big Money" to do custom patterns from photos.

   [ Oh yes, yes they do. Maybe I should start up a line of Rush x-stitch

Another Rush sighting; I was working at the book store on the same day

in Minnesota, and met Ged in early 80's.  He said that he was a chain smoker. 
I know Neil was, but I never read or saw pictures about Ged being a chain

need something to tide you over until Nov. 10th?

on Oct. 13th the Mike Peters album "Rise" will be released in the US.
Mike is best known for fronting The Alarm in the late 80s.  Since then
he has had a very respectable, but underpromoted, solo career.

"Rise" is the best album I have bought in the last 18 months, hands down
(I bought the UK import).  The US version will have 3 bonus tacks! This
is a solid disc with fantastic music. Guest appearing on several tracks
is the blistering Billy Duffy formerly of The Cult. He and Mike have
paired up to form ColourSound and expect to release an album sometime in
the near future.

Until then, I cannot recommend this CD enough to my fellow rush fans.
You will not be disappointed.

Hi all:
Found this on AOL's SPIN Online, and figured it was worth a mention. Besides,
it's funny to read the back-handed references to Geddy and Neil, and the "...a
group calling themselves..." reference makes us all sound like a bunch of
terrorists.
That's right. We will get them in the Hall, or there will be great music
forced upon the heathens of radio....

What with this week's release of the Clinton grand jury testimony on video, we
think that people are losing track of the important issues--like how the heck
are we gonna get Rush into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? That's right,
everybody's favorite Canadian-high-pitched-lead-singer-sporting, best-drummer-
in-the-world-boasting rockers are eligible for induction next year (having
released their debut album back in '74), and a group calling themselves The
Rush Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nomination Campaign are preparing to do
something about it. They're trying to get 250,000 Rush fans to send petition
letters to the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation in order to get a nomination on next
year's ballot. Those interested should address their letters to The Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY

<A NAME="2108009">Subject: Tribute CD</A>

I finally found a copy of the RUSH tribute "Working Man".
Overall its pretty good, but some of it sounds like these
guys never got out of the 80's, especially the vocals. I
guess their vocal styles work in their own bands but when
you sing RUSH with that 80's metal sound it just sounds very
cliche. Analog Kid is good except you can't realy hear the bass
in some places. Steve Morse kicked ass on LaVilla and Red Barchetta.
I love his style, especially his solos. Natural Science is also
good but the vocal are a bit extreme. The first time I heard Devin
Townsend sing was on Steve Vai's Sex & Religion CD. I think he's
a good singer but he just needs to stop screaming and growling.
I am puzzled by the absence of John Myung & Kevin Moore of Dream Theature,
especially since the rest of the band was involved. (I know Kevin has
left the band but I think he was still in the band when this tribute
was made.)

There are a couple of things that I thought were funny: 1. why didn't
they use a classical guitar on The Trees? It just doesn't sound
right without it. 2. Why couldn't they find a triangle for YYZ?

The mixing seemed strange in some places especially when you
realize that Terry Brown mixed the CD. Some parts come in too
abruptly or too loud. Maybe this is how Terry wanted to mix the
original versions of these songs.

It's great to see some of the musicans that RUSH has touched and
possibly inspired to become musicans in the first place. That's how
it was with me.

While this is an overall good tribute, it makes you appreciate
Alex, Geddy, & Neil even more.

See ya,
Chris

The latest album I've seen on 8-track was Moving pictures. It's possible,
though by that date unlikely, that ESL was also 8-track-ed. GUP definitly
not. So the latest confirmed sighting was MP.

1)I'd bet serious money that when Rush release their upcoming live video
on DVD it will no doubtedly be recorded in Dolby Digital (AC-3) not that
half assed DTS. I say half assed cause they've been bragging about DTS
for a couple of years now and theres still nothing commercially
available. Dolby Digital has been the standard 5.1 surround system for
laserdiscs for a few years now and they are also the standard for 5.1
surround on DVD. Where is DTS??? Who will really switch over to DTS when
DD already has a major stronghold on the market.
2)I just picked up a cd from Victor Wooten who is a phenominal bassist.
The title of this disc is "A Show Of Hands".
3)Unless I read it wrong, (or you meant prior to any release) someone
mentioned Zebra being the best "non-proffesional" band they've seen.
They have 4 CD's out and Randy has a couple solo cd's too...how many
releases do you need to be considered "pro"?

Well, I actually owned my first copy of "Hemispheres" on 8-track. Wish I

OK now that I have your attention....

I'd like to attempt to best address the Rush @ Red Rocks(NOT) issue...

***(For those NMSers in CO)  Has Rush ever played at Red Rocks?  If
***not, why not?  It's such a great venue and an excellent place to 
***see ashow.

***[ Nope. Have no reason why though, could be a number of things
***(size, location, time of year, $$ the venue costs to play...)
*** rush-mgr ]

Traditionally when RUSH had been in Denver it was usually in the fall to 
winter months (That being the pre-Presto era(s)....you see Fiddlers 
Green is relatively a new venue, only about 10-12 years old...and it was 
designed to lighten the impact on Red Rocks as well as have greater 
seating capacity, which it does.  Red Rocks holds about 9,000 people, 
where Fiddlers holds roughly 17,000....what's more is, just due to the 
intensity of RUSH's tour schedule, they would usually be in Denver 
"every OTHER tour", so we missed some gems like GUP, HYF, and 
Counterparts.....I think we missed CP because they actually played out 
here on Presto & RTB....but we loved every high voltage minute of 
T4E...it was awesome....but they have played outside at Fiddlers ever 
since Presto....

Currently Having a RUSH MOMENT!:::  93.5 The Fox in Denver is currently 
going through the "Classic Rock Catalog 'A to Z'" and as
I write this...guess which song hits the airwaves....hint we are on 
'W'....that's right Workin' Man....I guess that's what I am...

CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and
Billy Joel rank among the recording stars nominated for induction
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for 1999, the Cleveland Plain
Dealer reported Tuesday.

The paper said other nominees included heavy-metal pioneers
Black Sabbath; doo-wop groups the Flamingos and the Moon-
glows; the gospel group the Staples Singers; pop singers Darlene
Love, Gene Pitney and Dusty Springfield; soul singers Solomon
Burke and Curtis Mayfield; early rockers Del Shannon and Ritchie
Valens and jazz-rock alchemists Steely Dan.

The inductees and venue for the induction will be announced in
November, the foundation said.

I have been just sitting back just reading the NMS and the next producer
question got me thinking about who would be capable of producing a Rush
album. One artist I have always liked and the production on his albums
is great and he is Kim Mitchell, formerly of Max Webster. He produces
his own stuff. Give his stuff a whirl and you'll hear why. I also like
the idea of Trevor Rabin. He did an excellent job of Yes's Talk album.
That's it for now, until next time....Thank you very much and see you

Hello all-

I was a Zeppelin fan once-at around age 7. I thought they were the greatest 
back then.   But alas, Philthy Radio discovered them, and now I never need to 
listen to them again.   They have a few good songs, Page is a decent 
songwriter, and Bonham was a unique drummer for his day. But like Pink Floyd, 
I don't need to hear them anymore.

And Page & Plant's recent output really blows.

Regarding Victor, I think it's much better than many people in this forum 
give it credit for being. There are some really strong songs on this CD, 
like the title cut, Start Today, and At The End. I didn't really appreciate 
Alex's dark side until this album came out and I'm looking forward to Victor 
II. Eddie Vedder on it would kind of look like a PR move, but it would 
definitely be cool.

Is anybody out there as upset as I am that Ripken sat down? Hear me out on 
this-an entertainer who always gives his best, has had a brilliant career, 
has kept his output consistent through many years, keeps his family together 
despite all the things that could break it apart, and has an undisputedly 
high level of integrity. But mostly what you hear about him is that he's old, 
tired, and should just give it up. Sound familiar?

Have fun everybody. Oh-Rush-mgr, does Rush still own their Mercury stuff? I 
must know...

   [ That's a good question. With so many different groups owning different
     parts (lyrics, melody, artwork, etc) it's hard to tell who owns what.
     With Mercury's recent loaning of "Tom Sawyer" around, who's to say
     where we'll see it next. Looking forward to that Microsoft commercial,
     aren't you?                                                 : rush-mgr ]

great thread, being in Rush circles on the net has paid off for me in
the following ways:

1. Marillion - huge fan now! especially Hogarth 1990s era stuff
2. Kings X - I love these guys! nice spectrum of work from HARD to

3. Tragicaly Hip - my favorite "fun" band

I believe my primary reason for enjoying this band for so
long is because there are so few people who feel the
same as I do. Popular music changes so rapidly. If the
machine throws enough money at something, it becomes
popular. By the time the average pop fan is reeling from
the machine's marketing stampede, the fad is killed and
a new one begins. Music isn't the subject anymore.

I stopped trying to convince people how great this band
is. Let it be my little secret. ; )

If I may ask, my source says the band Bruford existed
from late '78 to early '81. Can somebody fill me in with
album titles from this band? I'd like to check it out. Also
some background on Allan Holdsworth. I know he
played in a band named UK with John Wetton, Eddie
Jobson and Bill Bruford. Was Allan involved in anything
notable prior to UK (my source is obviously limited!)

Could somebody fill me in on what album(s) UK put out?

<A NAME="2108022">Subject: Victor II confirmation</A>

Heya Hiya Rush folksies:

Just wanted to say, I called up our local radio station HTZ FM here in
St.Catharines, ONT Canada, and got to chat with their program director
during their "Music News" hour at 6:00pm. HTZ FM, being so close to
Toronto, has usually been accurate with their info about Rush via
Anthem/SRO. He confirmed what I had heard, that Alex IS working on the
next Victor project, but it won't most likely see the store shelves till
early next year. And yes, there apparently IS ALOT of outside help on
this project...but we won't know who will show up on the album until Big
AL does his "whats included..whats not included". Like the first Victor
project, which had Tom Cochrane co-writting and playing a couple of
tunes with Alex, and Sebastian Bach doing most of the vocals, obviously
everything turned out different. Here is a list, though, of people Alex
HAS recorded stuff for this project for. Some most likely, like Edwin,
will show up again. We will have to see about the others, though. (Oh
ya...look for Alex on Edwin's solo album due out just before X-Mas).
Ok..here is the list..Many Americans and people from other countries
from other then Canada may not recognize these names. But, then again,
many are quite successful internationally. Here we
go....(vertigo..AHHHH!!)..hehe

1)Jeff Martin, from the band "The Tea Party"
2)Gordie Johnston from the band "Big Sugar"
3)Tom Cochrane
4) Sarah McLachlan (only b/g vocals on two tracks) (sorry..no "duets"
here..hahah!!)
5) Tara Mclean
6) Bill Bell (obviously..you all remember Bill as Alex's co-writting
partner on the first Victor..well..his wife is now the lady above..Tara
Mclean..very beautiful, soft voice.)
7) The ubiquitous Edwin..(No..he DOESN'T have a last name..hahaha!)

Again...what shows up on the record..who knows! But, I do have a feeling
that this Victor will be a little less "dark" then the first one. This
is what I've heard from people who have VERY luckily got to hear some of
this stuff, so far. Again..I stress...this is all just in it's "Lerxst
incubation" period..this guy changes his mind like most people change
their underwear. (If you wear any..Hhaahaha..oppsss..sorry;-) (Hey...if
ANYBODY gets to the orbit room this fall, you may be fortunate enough to
hear some of this stuff!)

Chris:

Well...one little "tidbit" to add here. I wouldn't worry about Sarah's
influence (regardless if you like/dislike her). She has done some VERY
interesting stuff with a Canadian industrial goth band called Skinny
Puppy who could make Victor sound like elevator music. This was a few
years ago, but she sang some b/g vocals for them. And, as far as I know,
she is limited to doing some b/g vocals for Big Al right now...and it
may not even show up on the album. Hope that soothes some of your
fears..

Peace

 own Chronicles & ASOH videos, Masked Rider, and A Work in Progress
 Been to 4 shows, GUP, CP, and TFE 2x

Other bands I love:
Yes, Jethro Tull, Dream Theater

I was recently introduced to Massive Attack on NPR's Metropolis. I also =

rounds on Ged's CD player quite a bit. I know it's been posted before, =
but not for a while. You all should really check out this band. They =

Rush content: Very sorry to hear about Geddy's disclaimer on the future =

these shows as much as any Rush show. In the final analysis, it's all =

Please -- I request that none of you flame me for being so behind in my
posts.  My hard drive crashed a little over a week ago, and I'm still
trying to catch up on e-mail, so...be patient, let me express my opinions
like an idiot for a few days, and then I'll be caught up, okay?  Thank
you.

<<I've also been disappointed by Rush's latest efforts.  The "in your
face" big loud sound that Rush has done on CP and TFE almost seem a cop
out compared to the work they did on MP-HYF.  Don't get me wrong, I'm
glad that Rush is "progressive" (although some might argue that point). 
They are constantly re-inventing there style of music.  However--I, for
one, don't really care for the direction they have taken.  Does anyone
else agree with me?  Again--all this is my opinion.  I'm sure some bozo
out there is going to slam my opinion. I say its OK to agree to disagree,
but don't slam (or
flame) me because your opinion doesn't match mine.>>

I have to disagree.  I think they desperately needed the alternative
sound.  First off, I *love* the 70s Rush, and I *love* PeW through GUP,
and even parts of PoW.  But I really think HYF, Presto, and RTB are
rather weak albums.  Alex's guitar, although more present, is *much* less
powerful.  I really think the boys going with the edgier, more
alternative sound was really more like taking a step back for them, sort
of revisiting the days of Alex playing killer riffs, and Neil using a
*real* kit.  But at the same time, it allowed them to take a step
forward, away from the (for lack of a better word) rut they'd gotten
themselves into by using a lot of keyboard, and not putting much power in
the bass or guitar.  I'm sorry, and I know there's going to be a lot of
people who hate me for saying this, but I think HYF, Presto, and RTB all
sound rather bland and flat.  RTB is by far the best of the three,
though.  But none of them really have much *power* to them, I don't feel
like.  In my opinion, HYF is the worst Rush album there is.  But that's
not to say that it sucks, and shouldn't be bought.  There *are* some
noteworthy tracks on it, such as Time Stand Still.  But, if I had to pick
an album and lable it "worst", HYF would get my vote.

     In my opinion, Rush may be a difficult listen for most people.  Try 
     for a moment to step back and listen to a Rush tune like you have
     never heard them before (this would be difficult for a long-time fan).
     They have odd signature beats and rhythms, and challenging guitars and
     keyboards.  You certainly wouldn't expect to hear a Rush tune
     re-arranged by Muzak over your local K-Mart sound system. :)

     Some critics label Rush as "progressive rock".  I've always thought of
     them as "intelligent rock".  While I don't think non-Rush fans are all
     "%#@*ing idiots", I DO think that to be an avid Rush fan requires a 
     higher-than-average degree of intelligence, and an appreciation for 
     music that "deviates from the norm."

Pankaj- Exactly John right on the gut... It requires more than average
intelligence to let rush rush in one's mind and blood!.. I have tried a
