Forgive me - I haven't checked the list in a while, and I read the last one
and realized that:
1)  I need to read the list more.
2)  I also have no idea who Jackie and Selena are.
3)  I had no idea there was a TS remix.
4)  I was unaware that a new live album was about to be released, and that a
tribute album had been.

For the slow people in the group ( :-) ) could someone post a brief
explanation of who Jackie and Selena are, how they passed away, what their
relationship to Rush is, and what announcements Rush has made since the
tragedies regarding their future.  Also,  any album dates for the live album
and information about the tribute album would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Scot

<A NAME="2078005">Subject: Rush Pre-74</A>

Hi Rushians,
	You guys have always been a big help for me. There is somethign I am
trying to find out. I made this page on my computer that tells the whole
bands history (1968-present) in case I ever need it for a school report
about my favorite band. The paragraph I keep on updating is the first
paragraph. It has to do with Rush from '68 - '71. I keep on finding more
information on this subject so I keep on updating it. Recently I found
out that Geddy quit the band in '69 and formed his own band for a while.
Read the rest of my paragraph:
 
	Rush is the only band that has Geddy Lee's wail, Alex Lifeson's blazing
guitar licks, and Neil Peart's furious drumbeats.  It is one of the
greatest rock bands of all time.  It was started in Toronto in the
Spring of 1968 and they played "Led Zeppelin" style.  The band members
were 15 at the time.  It was started by Alex Zivojinovich and John
Rutsey.  Alex changed his name to Alex Lifeson because his real last
name was too hard to say and spell.  The name "Lifeson" is an English
translation of "Zivojinovich."  In August of '68, the formal lineup was
Jeff Jones on bass and lead vocals, John Rutsey on drums and backing
vocals, and Alex Lifeson on guitars and backing vocals.  They first got
a job to play at a coffee house called the "Coff-In."  While they had
dreamed of playing, they had neglected to come up with a  name for their
group.  They all went to John Rutsey's basement and they didn't have
much luck coming up with a name.  Then John Rutsey's older brother
yelled, " Why don't you call the band Rush?" So "Rush" was the title of
the band.  In September of '68, Jeff Jones (bassist/vocalist) was
replaced by Gary Lee Weinrib who had changed his name to Geddy Lee. 
Then in January of '69, Lindy Young joined the band and he played
keyboards and back-up guitars.  Soon after, the band was changed to
"Hadrian."  In May of '69, Geddy Lee (bassist/vocalist) quit Hadrian and
made his own band called "Ogilvie."  He was replaced in Hadrian by Joe
Perna. In June of '69, Geddy Lee changed his band's name from "Ogilvie"
to "Judd."  In July of '69 Lindy Young (keyboardist) left Hadrian to
join Judd and then Hadrian split up.  Then in September of '69, Judd
split up also. Immediatly after, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and John
Rutsey formed together again as Rush. In February of '71, Mitch Bossi
joined Rush. He was a 2nd guitarist in the band (along with Alex
Lifeson.)  He quit in May of '71.  Then there were only 3 members left.

	Now you probably know that Rush has had 8 members in all. I would love
to get my first album sighned by all 8 of them. 
	Anyway, You can see that at one time there were 2 bands: Hadrian and
Judd (or Ogilvie). I need your guys help to update this paragraph again.
What I am trying to find out is what was the formal lineup for Judd
(besides Geddy Lee and Lindy Young) This information is probably hard to
get. But I'm sure that there is somebody who can help me with this.

Let's see here.  If -I- were faced with a similar challenge...

Freewill (the jam in the middle)
Red Lenses (innovative, technical)
La Villa Strangiato (Live Version, of course)
YYZ (live version, so it includes that amazing solo)
Subdivisions (album version...fills that fit so damn well you barely notice
that what he's doing is insane...really interesting work at the end, one
particularly random fill that jumps out of nowhere, fits perfectly, and is
so random that i've never been able to quite nail it...any drummer here
probably knows what fill i'm talking about :)

Tom Sawyer is a good pick.  Big Money is not -- I've been playing drums for
just over a year and (with a little effort) I can nail those fills at the
end.  They're not all THAT hard to do and I could probably name about
twenty drummers who could do them as well.  Neil's never been just about
fast hands.  A human being can only have hands that are so fast -- so there
are other drummers with hands as fast as his.  Neil's strong points have
always been coordination (hands the confidently go all over the place
seemingly at the same time) and melodic innovation -- that is, fills that
are somehow almost like melodic lines, innovative.

I just realized something this weekend while I was listening to T4E. Everyone
probably knows this already, but dense little 'ol me just figured it out. I
was sitting there listening to "Dog Years" and singing to my dog (long story)
when I started thinking about how "in a dog's life a year is really more like
seven...". Then I told myself that "Dog Years" is probably track #7 on the
album because Rush always pays such attention to detail, so I looked at the CD
and you all know the rest...

I'm kind of cheesed off about a RTB MIDI.  I was trying to find one to 
put in my active worlds domain (if you don't know, don't ask) Anyway the 
one i found sounded like shit. It was the furthest thing from RTB i 
could imagine. So i went to another site, and another, and another.  All 
of them had the same MIDI. One said, Original MIDI files by good 
authors, so i got it.... same bad MIDI. Finaly I settled on a  midi of 
La villa, which is the better choice anyway. But This midi haunts my 
dreams, hw could anyone write it, and put the Roll The Bones name to it. 
it doesnt even have the same beat. anyone else know what i'm talking 
about? it's worth looking up for shit's and giggles though...

Sorry this is a little late...I tried posting before but didn't know the
address had changed. I didn't transcribe that song, no. But the Sci-Fi
channel put on an episode entitled The Final Sacrifice, set in Canada. The
"guys" knocked Canada something fierce, but Mike did point out Rush was
from there. Later on, when the two main characters were at a rustic old
cabin, they said it was Geddy Lee's birthplace. Ah, I just adore those
MST3K guys as a source of Rush humor & comment! Bravo once again!

     Hey, I was walking around State College PA yesterday when I ran 
across a music store that had about half of rush's albums on vinyl. It 
also had an OLD copy of Presto in a cardboard liner-box (?) The vinyls 
were around $7 a piece. I think the place was called City Lights... It 
was down stairs below an arcade. Had I any cash on me, I would've bought 
them and sold them to you guys without making a profit. Oh well! Any of 
you guys in the State College area might want to check this out if 
you're interested.

     Oh, one more thing, I was at talkcity today (my first time there) 
and I saw, "Rush Chat, live chat with Rush M-F at 9 AM" I doubted 
highly, but I entered.... Yeah, I know now, it was a Rush Limbaugh Chat 
page.... I thought you guys would appreciate it, I thought it was 
funny!! You've been warned.

do my eyes deceive me, or did the "possibilities" for the upcoming live 
release(according to info posted by the rush mgr) include "the pass" and 
"vital signs"????  i'd be very happy to see these two cuts on the 
upcoming live release, but i'm under the impression the album is 
comprised of the T4E and CP tours only.  am i mistakenly not remembering 
those two songs being played on the CP tour?  it's quite possible.  could 
somebody help me out.  i tried dialing up the rush setlist project, but 
my browser keeps telling me that website's server is not accepting 
connections--whatever to that.

   [ The Pass was played during the CP tour. Not sure why Vital Signs got
     mentioned though...                                          : rush-mgr ]

Got to listen to it, and I quite like it.  Then again, I'm a fan of John
Oswald's plunderphonic work (if this guy got ahold of Rush, he'd really
put it through the wringer), so I'm not as precious about these things as
some of y'all are.  I don't think you have to fear it replacing the
original, because it's jest too well-established for that to happen.  If
anything, it should be seen as a great side story of the original.  I
mean, seeing as it's been used in a rap song by Young Black Teenagers
("Time to Make the Donutz" from _Dead End Kidz Doing Lifetime Bidz_) and
given props as a great hip-hop break in Spin by the one and only Biz
Markie, hey, this was the next logical step.  And who knows, maybe
they'll put the money they make from it towards charity.

Well, I guess it depends what kind of music your friend is into?
Then you could maybe pick the most suitable track? But -  today, my 
choice would be one of the following:

YYZ / The Enemy Within / Bravado ...... 

>......or if he can watch it on video, then maybe By-Tor from 
Exit....Stage Left, just for the wild fills at the end which seem to 
freak out the uninitiated!

The list is almost endless isn't it?  Ok, one track....BRAVADO.

The Commute From Hell
     or
How to plagiarize classic rock during Rush hour

"Well, I get up at 4 am, and get to work by 6,
 Too much time spent drivin', yeah,
 We're livin' in the sticks.
 Seems that I could transport me,
 like Scotty does on "Trek"
 But then I couldn't hear Rush
 and that would be heck.

 They call me "commutin' man" -
 I guess that's what I am.

 I get home at 6pm and dodge the banzai deer;
 Always seem to be wondrin'
 why there's hunters hangin' 'round here.
 Seems to me I could live my life
 A lot better than I think I could
 That's why I'm goin' to 
 The next Rush tour (knock on wood.)

 Well they call me the "Rush"-in' Man
 - I guess that's what I am."

Apologies - just had to get it off my chest. :-)

Vital Signs, huh?  That's interesting because I thought all of the tracks
were going to be from the CP and T4E tours.  Did they play VS on either of
those tours?  Maybe you mean Virtuality instead rush-mgr?  Anyway, I hope
they include Virtuality.  Also, Double Agent was awesome live.  Any word on
a video release?

I really like the TS remix on 'Small Soldiers'.  Except it doesn't include
any of the guitar or drum solos.  It does include some of the keyboard solo,
however.  I like what they did with the vocals and especially the drum part.
Did I really say that?!?  It helps me appreciate the original version.
Thanks to the person who put up the MP3 of it.

<A NAME="2078024">Subject: A *RUSH* at the record store!</A>

I hope this is appropriate--but I thought I'd write a little story 
involving Rush lyrics. In fact, anybody who can give tell me where each 
of the lyrics comes from, gets a cheap and superficial prize!!!

I woke up one fine morning with the grand design of going to the record 
store to buy a Rush album, "All the World's A Stage".  Then upon 
realization that I had no ride, I remarked "This is a fine place, how am 
I to get there? Shall I take my Red Barchetta, or the Thailand Express?" 
I decided on the latter.

As I waited for my train, I noticed the sky pitching violently with 
rumbling thunderheads--the more peaceful clouds bowing their heads in 
fear.. Maybe I shouldn't go,
I thought, but, hey, Freewill, right? Freewill! I boarded the train 
headed for the city and nurtured sweet memories of Rush, yet sadness and 
tears at not having that one album, ATWAS. Everybody needs a mood 
lifter, and this would be it. Just keep smilin' I kept telling myself, 
ignore the clouds, feel the sun on your face.

Finally, we arrived at the mall on the edge of the subdivisions, and I 
went inside, passing the Florida Coastline bookstore, but not going in. 
Heading straight for the RUSH section, I browsed through and did not 
find what I was looking for! At this point I was fully animated, 
agitated and not at all the modest man I used to be.

"Can I help you?"  I turned to see the salesman coming toward me with 
proud swagger. His name tag said By-Tor and beneath his baseball cap I 
could see he had three eyes.

"Yes, you can help me," I picked up a RUSH CD and stuck it out and cut 
right to the chase. "I need ATWAS. You're out." 

"So?"

"So? I need to find what I'm after. Could you look in back?"

He seemed slow to understand. I became irritated. "Okay, I think it's 
time for us to recognize you need to get your manager right away. I may 
look like just another junkie on a scoring run, but I desperately need 
this album."

"Okay." 

"Man, you could try to understand me a little better!" I muttered.

So I waited for the manager, whose name was Necromancer (after reading 
his nametag). He came with mean, mean stride, his head looking as if 
he'd lost a few more hairs, or else he was losing it. "Try your luck 
with me," he muttered, trying to smile, "By-Tor is training, he needs to 
make his own mistakes."

I explained my situation. He smiled again. So far so good. "And what 
would you like me to do?" he asked.

Getting right to the heart of the matter, I said "If it isn't too much 
fuss and bother, could you look in the stockroom? I know they've always 
told you selfishness was wrong, but I need this CD."

"What if I don't find it?"
  
"I not afraid of that. I'm a lot more afraid of your lying. Since you 
are the manager, it must be a natural science for you to find stuff in 
the back. My sweat was running cold with anticipation, then a saw a tiny 
moment of truth in his eyes. He understood my predicament.

Wordlessly, he disappeared into the stockroom, as if it were second 
nature, to go find the CD which was under lock and key for some reason.

I waited with crossed arms, looking around the store. A group of kids by 
the rap section had their party disrupted by an uninvited guest (a clerk 
told them to keep quiet), I could hear a girl saying to her mother, "I 
swear you don't listen to me", a few girls were  pretending to look at 
CDs, all puffed up with vanity, some mystic rhythms were playing 
overhead, and some young men were singing to the Backstreet Boys. Now, 
THAT'S entertainment, I thought.

Suddenly I heard the voice of Necromancer, "I think we may have it, but 
it's up on a high shelf,".

I barked at him, my patience running on empty, every nerve torn apart. 
"You're playing with fire, big guy," I barked, "now go be nobody's hero 
and show me, don't TELL me!"

Again he disappeared, unhappy at his circumstances, no doubt. He seemed 
divided, like a torn-up photograph, as whether or not to help him. But 
hey, who knows? Maybe I'd give him a tip (There is a miracle once in a 
while). Yeah, with big money.

In a flurry, he appeared at the speed of love. "I get this feeling," he 
said, handing over the disk, "that you are a die-hard RUSH fan."

"Where would you rather be?" I quipped. "But you must realize, this is 
more than simple greed. I have to fill my collection."

I thanked him profusely and proceeded to the counter. What a thrill to 
be alive! The cashier rang the total and I was surprised at the low 
price. 

The cashier noticed my surprise. "Well you can't get something for 
nothing! You must pay the price, yet not count the cost" Then, on seeing 
my purchase, "Wow! All the World's A Stage, and we are merely 
players..."

"Yeah, a great band, eh?"

"Yes, I love Spirit of Radio myself."

"Cool." I left then. I was starting to get hungry when I noticed the Tai 
Shan Restaurant next to the Digital Man bar. (I bet they never sleep 
there). Oh the wind can carry such wonderful smells like the Chinese 
food I smelled.

As I neared the restaurant, I heard shouting guards, and kids yelling 
"Hold your fire!" Man, what a shame, I thought, but hey it's just the 
age, just a stage.

A suspicious-looking stranger served my lunch, and I decided in the end 
I wouldn't have desert. He was of the attitude most waiters have, "Don't 
annoy us further", or "Take it easy on me now."  

Suddenly, I had a great urge to listen to my CD. Perhaps I could go the 
audio store and play with the biggest toys there. Or go home. Or go the 
Digital Man bar. They had better beer than this place. I was at a loss.

I decided on going for a walk, a walk in the streets, where the 
buildings are lost in limitless rise, a world of red neon and 
ultramarine,see the everyday people, go sing in the acid, in a
world of indifference. I would rather, however, go skiing fast through 
the woods in the silent forest,  or ride my motorcycle, stealing in and 
out back alleys.

But alas, I ventured out into the city, the miles of yellow tape, 
silhouetted chalklines and a brewing storm I walked toward. Here in the 
city, the gods of Love and Reason were calling out an SOS as the 
dangerous chemistry of humankind scoffed at the wise.(There
was no end to what they'd take)

I longed to drink the mild of paradise and listen to my CD, but I was 
far from home and had no means to--it brought the word patience closer 
to the heart. Instead I enjoyed the brief sun upon my face. Maybe I 
could stay in town? I had a list of cheap motels...I could get a room, 
buy a Discman and be set.

C'mon, man, I thought to myself, this isn't a fantasy-land, you have to 
go home! "Don't give me speeches, they're oh so droll!" But, I still 
knew I had to go home.

Suddenly the sky changed. The sun dogs disappeared, replaced by rain, 
and lots of it. I raced for the train station, realizing that water was 
taking me home, and plopped down on the seat. Man, I was tired after all 
that waking. Some stranger started talking to be about home loans, and I 
asked her politely, "couldn't we talk about something else instead?" I 
realized she was just being vain and "smart", but I was tired and wanted 
to get home to listen to that great CD. I guess you couldn't win without 
a fight--oh well, let the pain remain behind you and go on, you'll be 
home soon, I thought to myself.

Today the ride was even longer. I began having an urge to scream, to 
howl, as dog's cry for the moon, as the storm outside gave way to night 
time--a night turning thing, filled with a thousand saxophones

Just try to sleep, I told myself. But that wouldn't work, either, as a 
rabbit went under the train's spinning wheels with a thump. But, 
thankfully, we were at my stop.

I sprinted all the way home! Once inside, I ripped open the CD and put 
it in my stereo, the PLAY button grinning at me, "Press this key to see 
amazing things," it snickered. So I hit play.

As the wonderful sound of RUSH blasted my ears, I wanted time just to 
stand still as I enjoyed this moment--I'm not one to believe in magic, 
but this was AWESOME!!! And all those wasted years without ATWAS! What a 
shame I'd missed them all.

I listened all night, as the night tuned thin and the saint went to sin.

THE END

Excluding the first album RUSH, there is a line (or part of one) from 
every song since
FBN. Good luck!!!

Hey!

Here's the question. You're friend has been
stranded on a desert island for fourty years.
They get back to civilization and want to catch
up on the music scene. What ten CLASSIC
rock albums would you recommend they listen
to?

http://classicrock.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa072198.htm

Last year not one Rush album received more
than one vote. With a little awareness out there
about the survey, maybe we can crack the top
ten with 2112 or Hem (etc). I gotta believe we
can beat out ELO "out of the blue", which came
in seventh place last year! Just an aside, I like
ELO ootb, just not *that* much.

Point your browser to the above link and send
in your votes. Remember, this is a classic rock
quiz, Presto may not be the best choice. :) I
would think PeW and previous could be
considered classic.

later,

Someone requested the lyrics to the song the boys on MST3K ("The Final
Sacrifice") sang, about Canada? I checked out the MST3K newsgroup. Here
they are:

"Oh I Wish I Was Back In Old Canada"

Oh I wish I was back in old Canada
A land which I never shall lampoon.
How I pine for the ice covering Lake Manitoba
And the beauty that is Saskatoon.

Oh I wish I was stuck in the hills of Alberta
Drinking beer with some big dumb guy trapping fur,
As he scraped and he chiseled all the moose dung off his boots
I would learn that he's the Prime Minister!

Oh I wish I was in the land that gave us Peter Jennings,
Alanis Morrisette, Mike Meyers, too.
No, I take that back, I wouldn't go there even if you paid me-
O Canada you are a place I must eschew.

Oh I wish I was blowing up Prince Edward Island,
And going on to bomb Ontario.
The destruction of Canada and all of its culture
Is by far my favorite scenario.

Just where the hell does Canada get off sharing a border
With countries far superior to it?
Why you lousy stinkin' francophonic bacon-loving bastards
Your country's just a giant piece of - !

Some comments on the setlist for the new album:

   * 2112 - I can't imagine the AFTK version is much different than ATWAS.
The TFE version is screaming to be included.

   * Drum Solo - no offense to the drummers out there, but isn't it enough
already, as far as putting this on the live albums.  When Neil switches to the
electronic drum kit, and samples the recorded music, I lose interest.  I vote
for the old YYZ drum solo.

   * Tom Sawyer - who said there are no skippable songs :)

   * Limelight - it would have been a crime to exclude this one.

   * ESL repeats - Red Barchetta over Freewill, but give me live SOR anytime;
compared to the ESL version, SOR is so much better now (see ASOH video).  For
me, SOR live is still a concert highlight.  And don't even think about
including CTTH!

<A NAME="2078030">Subject: Rush & Victor sighting in a magazine</A>

Hello all,

While flipping through the latest issue of "American Cinematographer" I was
reading an article about the Floria Sigismondi who directed the Marilyn Manson
videos.  I'm not a fan of MM and I found the videos' visuals disturbing, but
very stylistic.  The article mentioned that she had worked with other Canadian
bands like...Victor(!).  Has anyone seen this video or know which song it is
for?  They had stills in the mag, but not any for this video.

The very next article was about Gerald Casale, one of the co-founders of Devo
(who I am a fan of) and the director of all their videos and shorts -remember,
they were doing videos before practically anyone.  Among the artists he was
listed as working with was Rush.  Again, does anyone know which one?  I have
seen many of Devo's shorts and videos and his visual style is not what I would
think of when watching a Rush video.

As for the magazine, it is not a casual read for the media obsessed (ie People
or Entertainment Weekly).  It is a journal of photographic techniques and
backgrounds on cinematographers' decision making.  If your really into a
technical explanation of lighting styles and lens choices go ahead and get the
mag (August 98 issue).  Otherwise, the articles only mentiopn Rush & Victor
and don't even go into any of those particular projects' contents so it's not
worth your dough.

Sometimes on those videos at the head and tail they list who directed the
piece- If anyone knows which ones these two worked on I'd be grateful for 
the info.

Thanks,
Eric

<A NAME="2078031">Subject: tribute album</A>

Well, I picked up the "Working Man" tribute album yesterday, along with
a remaster of Power Windows.
I'd describe WM this way:  half of it is by Jake E. Lee, Billy Sheehan,
and others of their crowd.  They are competent musicians, but seem
determined to play the verses note for note, then use the solos as a
chance to prove they can play more notes than Ged or Al.  
So what?
We know the boys can play that fast.  Deciding not to throw in as many
notes as possible is true maturity in rock.  I didn't think it was
possible to be too excessive when playing "Analog Kid," but they manage. 
Mike Portnoy does a decent job on drums, but he sounds as if he's
intimidated by the daunting task of keeping up with Neil.  He'd do
better to relax.  He's good.
Billy throws in extra bass harmonics on the intro to La Villa.  Again,
unnecessary, and changes the tone.  Steve Morse handles most of LVS
guitar, and could have done it all.  His playing is tasteful and
original.
Which brings us to the other half of songs.  Fates Warning does a really
good rendition of CTTH, as a straight cover.  other performers on the
better half are Stuart Hamm, who doesn't try to outdo Ged on YYZ, he
just plays it his way.  AS enjoyable as the original--Stu is good.  Deen
Castronovo sounds phenomenal on drums.  Matt Guillory on keys for most
of the album is another really good player, and listening to him makes
one realize that Ged is actually a VERY underrated keyboardist,
considering he plays bass and sings simultaneously.  George Lynch plays
a good version of Anthem, and hearing him and Stu tear it up is really
cool.  When you consider that Stu's tracks were played in HIS studio,
alone, by mail, so to speak, you understand why he is so in demand as a
session player.  Stu can play ANYTHING, and I'd STILL love to see him
and Ged as a duet.  Maybe he can open for the boyz some day?
Most of the vocals did not impress me.  They weren't bad, but Sebastian
Bach, Mark Slaughter, James LaBrie, et al, all have that cheese-metal
voice from the 80's.  They can't screech like Geddy.  Eric Martin sounds
great on Mission, as does Ray Alder from Fates Warning on CTTH.  Devin
Townsend does Natural Science HIS way.  It wasn't really my thing, but
it was a good interpretation, I think.  He wasn't copying or trying to
outdo, just having fun.  This is as it should be.
Robert Berry does all the instruments on Mision, save the drums, and a
REALLY good interpretation.  I don't know who he is, but I want his
other stuff.
All in all, it seemed that one half were trying to outdo the boys for
bragging rights, and the other half are genuine Rush fans who just love
playing.  Well, we KNEW that about Steve Morse--how often has he opened
for them?
Terry Brown, our old friend, mixes it well, but some of these guys had
WAAAY too much compression behind their distortion--it sounds choppy in
some parts.  Too studio, not enough inyoface.   
I recommend buying it.  It's growing on me.  And it makes you appreciate
Rush even more, for their unique approach.
