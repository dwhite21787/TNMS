Hey!

Just a quick note.

The rush-mgr brought this up but maybe it didn't
get across to everyone.

If you address an e-mail to: rush-srv@yyz.com and
type in the subject line Digest.0001 and send the
mail, you will have tnms issue#1 in your inbox
within 2 minutes.

I understand that many may consider reprinting #1
a tribute or sumthin' but why pay a tribute to
tnms (no dis intended)? Let's see a tribute to the
band! Personally I have all confidence in the Holy
Bitch/Divine Goddess's ability to deliver (no
pressure!) :-)

Just a quick question.

In Vital Signs what type of bass(es) does Ged
play in this tune? Especially during the "Tired
mind become a shape shifter" sequences. *Or*
does Ged play bass at all? Moog? In the liner
notes he's listed for instruments among other thing
"bass guitars" (pl). It's been so long since I've
seen the Vid(MTV), I can't recall. Was Steinburger
around in 1981? OK ENOUGH QUESTIONS!!!!

I'm awaiting the boot "Fear" to hit the mailbox.
It contains VS. I'm also pumped about the fear
trilogy in order, live. This boot is supposed to
be complete g/p tour video (which I've never seen).
I'm also anxious to receive "Critical Mass" a boot
from the Palace of Auburn Hills CP tour. Many here
are familiar with this one. I was also surprised
to see many from this list have been to the Palace
shows(/\/evik-Buffalo & rush-mgr-San Diego). When
you're at the Palace look me up in Suite 127.

Hey! *I'm* "Beelzebub's uncle's wife's brother"
and I was never much of softball player I prefer
chess thank you. %^)

Just a little comment in response to several posts about Cygnus X-1. The 
Racinante is not just a horse, its also the name of a ship in a famous 
piece of literature which escapes me at the moment. The song specifically 
says, "On my ship the Racinante". Also, Cygnus X-1 is not some random 
name, it is the first black hole to be discovered, or at least the object 
most likely to be a black hole. Also, though this is about six months 
old, A cd came out at Christmas time called "Merry Axemas" put together 
by Steve Vai on which Alex Lifeson plays "Little Drummer Boy", all parts, 
bass, guitars, and drum programs. Interesting since he plays in a band 
with the best rock drummer of all time, and uses drum programming on 
"Little Drummer Boy". It's an awesome Christmas cd though.

     So, Neil smokes Winston Lights, huh? Somehow I imagined him smoking a
nameless cigarette with a gold dollar sign on it. But, I suppose he is a
Canadian, after all.
     We now have one more mental image to associate with Witch Hunt:
Clinton's war on tobacco. Sieg Heil, Herr Clinton!
     Maybe we could have some smokes made especially for Neil with the
Rush-pentacle logo on it. It can't be filterless though, because if he were
to light the wrong end... it would become a pentagram!!!

      As a long time Rush and old Genesis fanatic, I would very much agree
with you in that "Selling England By The Pound" IS quite the classic album.
For all of you out there who are spoiled by Rush, by that I mean being used to
having EVERY song on EVERY album being spectacular, you should pick up some
Gabriel-era Genesis.   
     Starting with 1971s "Nursery Cryme", the classic Genesis lineup was born:
Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, and new members Steve Hackett and
Phil Collins.  "The Musical Box" and "The Fountain of Salmacis" are two of the
many highlights on this album.  Talk about virtuosic displays of both chops
AND dynamics...wow!  Phil Collins was 20 years old on this recording- keep
that in mind when listening to it.  Check out the double bass work on the
"rocking" section of "Musical Box".  I KNOW Neil had to be hitting the
woodshed after hearing that!!  Phil was- IS- an absolutely incredible, SORELY
underrated drummer!  
    1972s "Foxtrot" REALLY brings ALL of the members of the band into focus.
"Watcher Of The Skies" and the classic 23 minute "Supper's Ready" were both
BIG influences on Rush!   Listen to the musical similarites in "Watcher" and
"The Fountain of Lamneth".  Very similar guitar, bass, and drum interplay on
the main riffs of the 2 songs.  I've pissed off QUITE a few hardcore Rush fans
when I say that Rush came close to actually ripping off the main riff from
"Watcher" for use in "The Fountain Of Lamneth". Listen to them and judge for
yourself!   
     "The Cinema Show" off of "Selling England By The Pound"  has an extended
musical segment at the end which is ESSENTIAL listening for those interested
in exploring true Rush influences!!  The entire piece is in 7/8 time- ala A
Lerxst In Wonderland (La Villa  gtr solo #1), much of Subdivisions, and the
instrumental section of Marathon.  Listen to Phil's sense of phrasing  in "The
Cinema Show"- listen to his sense of phrasing and dynamics within this
complicated time signature.  Listen to how his groove just sits so perfectly
beneath the rest of the band.  Hear how his fills are both technically
challenging, yet flow so well with the rest of the music.  Then listen to Neil
on the songs I just mentioned.  Try to hear how his grooves fit so well
beneath Geddy and Alex. Hear how well his playing complements Rush's
incredible music so perfectly.   This very subtle aspect of FEEL, I think, is
Phil Collins' greatest gift to drumming AND his biggest influence on Neil.
Just the fact that Phil could play, to many, a very awkward time signature
such as 7/8 so damn smoothly and with such incredible feel and conviction in
1973, is testament to his mastery of the drum kit.  
    Then go pick up "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway" and prepare to be
floored...  I've been a hardcore Rush fanatic since 1984- THIS album is the
one that I think ranks EASILY with 2112, Hemispheres , PerW, MP, ANY of Rush's
best!!  If you haven't heard it, GET IT NOW!!!  Then check out Phil's playing
on "In The Cage", "Back In NYC", "Ravine", "It", etc, etc...   Gabriel left
after this album's tour- the albums that followed, "A Trick Of The Tail" and
"Wind And Wuthering" are great as well.    Fantastic web site at
http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Ejkochel/genesis/   details the story of "The Lamb"
with several great interpretations!!   Be prepared to be sucked in...  this is
the real deal guys and gals!    Just my opinions and 2 1/2 cents...

Not likely:
  Neil continues to play real drums and not let someone else fill in for him
  Neil wouldn't be caught dead singing cheesy adult-contemporary love songs
  Neil did the Buddy Rich thang a few years ago; Phil is currently touring
with the Phil Collins Big Band
  Rush got the self-titled album out of the way a long time ago; Genesis
waited until what, the early 80s to get around to it

But in all fairness, SEBTP *is* a great album. Check out "Trick of the
Tail" and some pre-"And Then There Were Three" stuff, too.

Craig

Forgot this one.  In the late 80's, Broon produced IQ's album Are You
Sitting Comfortably.  There's a song on it called "Wurensh", which is an
anagram of New Rush, because that's what they thought the song sounded like.

It's a good CD, though some of the songs are a tad pop-tripe.

Greetings from Colorado!!

Just the other day I picked up Rush at a used CD store for $4.99.  I
figured, "It's only five bucks, I don't have it, good opportunity to add
it to my collection, so what the hell!"  After listening to it for a
couple of weeks I came to the realization that it isn't half bad.
Granted, it isn't, by far, my favorite and there are a few tunes I can't
believe came out of Rush (i.e. Need Some Love, In the Mood), but I would
say for a first album of a band of future epic porportions, it portrayed
their raw style at the time fairly well. I can now see what a huge
influence Neal was both musically and lyrically to take the band in a
new direction.

Can anyone shoot me the lyrics for What Your Doing?  I, for the life of
me, cannot make out anything except "what your doing" on that song.
Geddy looses me on both the studio version and the live version.  The
echo on the CD screws it all up and he sings it way to fast on the live
version.

Here are a few random questions I'll throw out about the band that have
been kicking themselves around in that dusty, old attic I laughingly
call my head, for a few years:

1) Does the picture of John Rutsey on Rush remind anybody of the guitar
player in Quiet Riot?  I think he's the spittin' image. (Also, Alex
looks like he was just woken up for his picture.)   
 2) Does Geddy ever play Stienbergers anymore?  Do they sound like crap
or he just moved on? (I'm a schmuck when it comes to the technical side
of music)

3)  What are the 3 snapping sounds in YYZ? (There are 10 listed
instruments that Neal plays on MP, but I can't figure out which one it
is)

4)  Is there only a Part IV of the "Gangster of Boats" trilogy that
appears on RTB?

5)  What is "Gaia" in Totem on T4E?  My girlfriend and I tried to look
it up in a dictionary, but to no avail.  

Feel free to get back to me with any answers to these questions.

Following the recent thread...Countdown from Signals is my least fave RUSH
song. It just plods along. I can understand what they were trying to convey,
but even live it didn't connect with me. I guess you had to be at the launch.

After having not listened to RTB in ages (years?), I pulled it out last week
and gave it a spin. Wow! what a surprise. I forgot how good it was. Bravado is
cool. So it's on my play stack again.

End of CD songs are cool (except as noted above). Available Light is a great
song that sets a mood. I can play it over and over too. Presto is a great CD,
even if the sound is a bit lacking. The Pass is one of the boys best tunes. 

Must haves for the live CD: Natural Science and Xanadu (or at least the
Xanadu/2112/etc medley). These are 2 of their best longer works that ebb &
flow and build to a climax.

That's all for now...Michael Bettine

People email me to email the NMS more often.  I'd love to but I only have so 
much info to offer.  You know what I really  think. 

 I still think Rush will release their greatest album to date.
   I think the next Studio will kick some severe ass. 
I think they should open up with the Spirit Of Radio forever
I think they should close off the show with In the Mood
I think they should improve their stage show with some props.

Rush have come to a point where, F=&^ everything and let's just have fun.  If 
it doesn't sell so what.    I'm tired of hearing oh Rush is a serious band, 
they don't need this they don't need
that, it's not about need, it's about having fun, blowing the stage up.   All 
those fans who came to T.O to see rush last summer, were very upset.
The crowd was so lame, dead.  It shocked me and I live here.  But what can 
you do?  

So we should go to the stereo, put on a Rush CD and listen to the greatest 
muscians of all time., and that's all that matters.
About Maple Leaf Gardens goodbye Party.  Personally I heard nothing of this, 
not even a closing date for the gardens.  Tonight if ALex is at the Orbit 
Room I will ask him myself. 
But when it does happen, get prepared for the craziest evening in the history 
of Any Rush concert.  IT will blow your mind away, and I will set up the 
biggest party Rush fans have ever seen.

I hope that Concert is during a snow storm.  That's  where Rush belongs..

That's what I Think?

<A NAME="2028018">Subject: Geddy in Seattle? ;)</A>

Hey everybody  

All this discussion of who should play the boys in a Rush movie reminded 
me of this guy I saw who looked just like Ged-
It was two weeks ago, Friday afternoon... I was at the Pacific Science 
Center, getting ready for my weekend gig of camping out with kids and 
teaching them about electromagnetic radiation and computers and 
stuff...I was outside enjoying the rare Seattle sun, sipping on a latte,  
when all of a sudden, I saw him. Medium-long brown hair in a ponytail, 
little round glasses, big ass nose, not too tall, ordinary clothes: 
jeans, tennis shoes, t-shirt, jacket..kinda unattractive in an oddly 
appealing sort of way...the only thing that kept me from dropping my 
precious caffeine was the earring, that didn't seem right.
What would Ged be doing in Seattle anyway, much less at the science 
center? Going to see see Laser Rush? ha! If it were this weekend, with 
the Blue Jays in town, that would make a little more sense. anyway. 
that's my bogus Rush sighting.

All this talk about what Rush to listen to when driving (MP is always my 
first road trip CD, though La Villa makes me punch the gas too) , having 
sex (oh come on! it's waaaay too distracting!), etc...so...

What Rush do people listen to when they're down? I was in a bad funk 
recently and it got me thinking ...I have a "Tough times demand" tape ( 
Double Agent, Between the Wheels, etc) ... GUP is pretty dark...Losing 
It is pretty depressing...I happen to find Bravado depressing too, 
though I know a lot of fans think it had a positive message. I suppose I 
should be listening to something upbeat today, but I'm at work, the boss 
is in the lab today, and I'm stuck listening to NPR... If I have to 
listen to one more crappy soft jazz tune...AAAAAAAACK help me!!!!!!!!! 
:) Can't wait to get in the car and crank something that rocks.

Enough rambling. back to work.

Hey gang..
I need a little help... I'm doing the music for the slide show at my high
school reunion this summer. 10 years goes by so fast...Everyone knows I was
a huge Rush fan in HS (and still am, of course) and they are expecting me to
play some. Now, I was in high school from 84 to 88. That rules out anything
pre-GUP or post HYF, right? I've come up with "Time Stand Still" but I need
a couple others. This show lasts about an hour, so I've got to pile a lot of
music in there. I'll probably play TSS, but I need one other song that
everyone will know.. Any Thoughts???????????????????????????????? 
You can mail me privately or here on the list too..Any ideas Chad?
Cheers from New Mexico..
Dan

<A NAME="2028021">Subject: re: last song on album</A>

On most Rush albums, I think, the closer is absolutely great.  (Natural
Science, La Villa, Cygnus, Countdown, Between the Wheels, etc.)  In my
opinion the only albums with weak closers are Hold your Fire, Roll the
bones, and Test For Echo.  I'm sorry, but You bet your life does nothing
for me.  Probably my least favorite rush song.  And Carve Away the stone is
pretty weak for an album closer.
	In regards to Available Light not being bettered since, although I agree
this is a magnificent and emotional song, nothing closes an album for me
better than Everyday Glory.  This is such a beautiful song in my opinion,
and so powerful.  On those last lines, "We're the ones who have to fly,"
coming out of the bridge, and then the final,"In Everyday Glory," always
sends chills down my spine.  Anyone agree?

Not a bad idea.  I can remember getting 2112 shortly after I grabbed
hold of Rush during the Moving Pictures era.  While reading the album
(vinyl that is...) notes, I was floored by the concept of this
(futuristic?) story.  I also remember (at the time) actually carting my
2112 album back to my parent's house to have my mom read the story, then
I even played some of it for her.  While she smiled kindly at me, I
think she was mostly unimpressed.  In any case, I didn't let it stop
there.  I told many people about the story and played them cuts whenever
possible.  I guess it must have been the whole "mini-series" concept of
devoting a whole album to one specific theme that really impressed me.
It seemed to me (IMHO) that these guys cared alot more about their music
than just writing songs with hip beats for the mainstream.

Later in college I got around to actually reading Ayn Rand's book
"Anthem" (it wasn't that long and WAS interesting reading) to complete
my education to 2112.

In response to Greg Cormier's posting on the top ten Rush songs he would like
to hear live, I have a list of my own I'd like to share:
These are in no particular order...

1.  Available Light
2. Middletown Dreams
3. Afterimage
4. High Water
5. Everyday Glory
6. Losing It
7. Tears
8. Entre Nous
9. Different Strings
10. Lakeside Park
And of course I must not leave out "Tom Sawyer" (Just Kidding)
It was a real treat to hear them play Natural Science and 2112 on the last
tour.  Hopefully the next tour will give us more Rush with no opening band.
Did anybody like this idea or do you like to see the opening bands perform.

I don't think that NP was that influenced by PC...what a revelation, a pop
star who is a great musician!!!  He could have been influenced by him, but
he did lift some beats from Phil and also Bill Bruford and Keith Moon.Can
any one pick out what drummer he was emulating the early era?

His playing got more original in the late 70's.

Nuthin' wrong with it, but it's pretty obvious.Listen to In the Cage and
Subdivisions.

I firmly believe he did it for the children, however.

Writing credit generally only applies to the person or persons who write 
the mainframe of the song.  Can't say I agree with it but that's the

Dear fellow Rushians,

As much as I know that I will get flamed for posting a "list" of songs I 
really want to hear live (because I have never had the pleasure of seing 
the guys live, even though I have a couple boots and all the live 
albums), I'll do it anyway.  In no particular order:

1.  2112
2.  Cygnus X-1:  Book I
3.  Cygnus X-1:  Book II  Hemispheres
4.  Distant Early Warning
5.  Double Agent
6.  YYZ
7.  Closer to the Heart
8.  Virtuality
9.  Force 10
10. Anthem

And to whoever made that "Ugh" comment about Stanley Kubrick, hold your 
head in shame.  I don't care if he did "butcher" the "Shining", the rest 
of his career is solid and damned successful.  I'd take him over James 
Cameron to direct a Rush movie any day of the f%#@ing year.

TAke care everyone!

Hello Rush Fans!

For those of you who may not know, "The Line" is a humorous column in the ESPN
Magazine in which the writer launches into a stream-of-consciousness ramble 
in which he touches on many things that may or may not be related to sports, 
with a humorous bent.  Then, he gives a list of mock bettings odds based on 
the things he wrote about.  This item appeared in ESPN Magazine #4, which can 
be accessed via
http://ESPNET.SportsZone.com

 The Line
 By Jersey Zeke
 ESPN Magazine

              Things do have a way of getting messy when grown men play
              games. Case in point: Johnson's TKO over 'Zo, Van Gundy's pit
              bull shenanigans, Buffalo thug Rob Ray's dust-up with
              CoreStates property (but hey, at least the Sabres won). Of
              course, messiness and cleanliness are two sides of the same
              coin. Take play- off grooming in hockey and hoops. Or getting to
              first base? Every Little Leaguer knows a clean single is as good
              as a messy walk. Speaking of baseball, raise your hand if you
              weren't watching the Angels-Rays Sunday nighter while the rest
             of the family sat hypnotized in front of that Hallmark-y D&D stuff.
              Speaking of things we see but don't believe, how 'bout that hot
              start in Beantown? That can't last, can it? Especially if the
              Japanese darling of the moment continues to give his Bronx
              mates solid innings. The Red Sox aren't the only ones to kick too
              early. Did you see the Derby? As always it was the late closers
              who hit the board at the end. Maybe April RBI machine Juan
              Gonzalez will be an exception. And you don't have to be Geddy
              Lee to know that "2112" rocks harder than "Big Money." Which
              isn't to say money can't help. That's why while you can barely
              make out the two teams from where you're sitting, L.A. Jack can
              chat with the ref without raising his voice. Now there's a guy who
              knows it's all about whether you win or lose. By the way, when
              you win, make sure you go out on top. Are you listening, Bob
              Baffert? Jerry Seinfeld is. And the money's rolling in.

So, Early Rush is an 8-point favorite over Late Rush! What do you think about 
that?  Of course, it's written by a guy named "Jersey Zeke", so make of that 
what you will.

Hey all,

Hopefully, no one has already posted this idea for the 2112 issue of the
NMS.  Anyway, here it goes:

We should get the Rush -mgr- to request a Rush "insider" or someone
(who represents Rush in a public relations sense) to collect postings
from NMS subscribers.  These posting would be, of course, interview-like
questions for either Geddy, Neil, or Alex about the music of Rush!!!

Once the Rush representative has collected these postings, he or she would
then give them to Geddy, Neil, and Alex and let them decide which 10 or so
questions they would like to answer and post (the answer w/ question) to The 
NMS!!!!  I mean, wouldn't it be great to somehow have Geddy, Neil, Alex 
post to the NMS....at least once - on an issue so fitting as no. 2112?

There could even be a contest for this.......those with questions answered
by Geddy, Neil, or Alex get a prize.....to be donated by Rush!!!  How cool!!!!

email your comments privately or post if you wish,

thanks,

Chris

ps.  Rush Mgr., I hope this post (referring to the wish fro a Lee, Peart, 
Lifeson NMS appearance) does not violate any NMS rule.  Let me know if it does,
thanks.
