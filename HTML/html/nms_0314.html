Hi people, have not had time to write in the past few weeks.  I called
our radio station here in Lexington, KY (WKQQ 98.1) and they said that
they did not have the new song DREAMLINE yet.  I told they some other
stations were playing it but they informed me that doing so was against
the some FCC regulation (or something like that).

     Anyway, would anyone be interested in having a RUSH party in this
area of the country?  If so, lets try to get together some time.

     Also, I lost the name of the person that said that they would make
a copy of some bootlegs, would he/she please send me their name and
mailing address, I would pay all postage and any additional fee if they
want.

Hey Rush-fans,

WDVE (Pittsburgh) played the new single earlier this afternoon.  (Tues,
Aug. 13).  Unfortunately, it was the first half of a double-shot of
which I caught only the tail end. (!!)  'DVE plans to premiere the
whole disc this Friday, at the house of some yet-to-be-determined
"loyal listener".  Wouldn't that be cool?

        For those of you in the Bay Area who want to hear Dreamline here
is some information

        Last night I was listening to KOME <98.5> And I decided that I
would call and bug them about Dreamline.  The DJ answered and this is how
the conversation went...

           "Hello, KOME!!"

        "Yeah do you have the new Rush single yet?"

        " Its AWESOME,  Have you heard it?"

        " Well over the phone from 3000 miles.(thanks Pete!!)"

        " Its pretty good huh?!"

        " Yeah but can you play it for me "

        "It is locked up for the night in the back room, I don't know if
I will be able to get it out. If I can play it, I will play it before
11:30pm

                At 11:20 I decided that I would call him back.

        "Hello, KOME!!"

        " Are you going to be able to play the new Rush single tonight??"

        "Negative, I couldnt get it"

        " Well then when are you going to be able to play it?"

        " Probably later on this week?"

        " Oh well, Thanks anyway."

        The funny thing is that when I call back this morning, They say
that the earliest that they can play it is Friday.

KSJO <92.3>

                I called them this morning to.  The DJ didnt have any
idea that A new Rush single was to be released. He asked me when I was
expecting they should have it and I said the middle of this week.  He
shuffled through some papers and finallysaid that I was right and that it
should be playe at the end of this week or maybe even premiered next
week!!!

I was not able to get a hold of KRQR<97.3>

  Please    !!!!!!!     Keep calling these radio stations and bugging
them. We know that they have it at least KOME does.

As an addendum to my earlier post today...

>...WDVE just played "Ghost Of A Chance" off RTB!  Don't know how many cuts
they've played already, but they said they'd be playing different ones
throughout the week (plus the premiere on Friday).  The sound of this one
seems like a cross between _Presto_ and _Signals_ to me.  RTB sounds like it
could be a good one, indeed!

Hello folks,

	I have made a return to the land of Internet thanks to Case
Western's Freenet system. Thanks, CWRU! *cheering*

	For those of you who don't recognize the UID or name, I used
to be MLS129 and JPJ103 at Penn State. A change of schools has rendered the
future use of PSUVM impossible. :(

	Anyway, the reason I'm writing is to share a rather interesting
fact with the readership of TNMS.  I don't know if this has been intro-
duced before; if it has, please bear with me.

	On a recent trip to Toronto I purchased a copy of AFTK on Anthem
CD.  (BTW, for those interested, the Ahtnem packaging is far superior to
the Mercury version, IMNSHO. The colors are brighter and the disk itself
has a unique design...)  At any rate, I was listening to "Cygnus X-1" and
was surprised to hear the famous heartbeat at the end of the song! It
appears that what was left off of the US tape and disk versions made it to
the Canadian CD version.  ("Hey, what's this real low, beating sound? Must
be a passing car with a REALLY low bass response!")

	I'm curious to know if anyone has encountered similar anomalies in
Canadian/foreign pressings of Rush albums.  Please e-mail your responses (if
any) to the address below as I am not yet receiving TNMS due to a lack of 
computer access.

	Thanks, eh?

Well, today is Aug. 13th, a day before "Dreamline" is scheduled to be
released.  And, whenever I turned on the radio and heard a DJ talking, he/she
always mentioned "new Rush"!  Supposedly as a WDVE (102.5 FM) exclusive, for
those of you in Pittsburgh.  Anyways, they're giving away THE ALBUM.
Every day they give out a copy.  And they've started playing it!!!!  They
played "Dreamline" earlier today, but I missed it.  So I was about to call up
and request it, and I hear the DJ go: "This is some new Rush--this is called
Neurotica".  So I didn't get to hear "Dreamline"... :)  "Neurotica"'s cool--
and I got it on tape.  (I wonder what I'll be playing non-stop soon??)
Plus, after they played that, they had to play another Rush song, since it's
blocks of two on Tuesdays.  Turned out to be "Fly By Night".  Cool.  And:
after that, the DJ says to stay tuned tonight for more new Rush.  It seems
like if I keep a tape in recording constantly, I could get the whole album
by the end of the week.  The DJ said we'll be hearing parts of it all week.
Cool.

Has anybody given any thought to having Rush parties during the RTB tour?
It seems like it would be a good way to see the concert.  If people
could volunteer to buy a block (say 10) tickets for a show in their city
and have a bbq at their house the day of the show, I'm sure they would
find plenty of buyers for the tickets.

Besides, I'd like to meet some TNMS readers.

Questions, comments?

I'm interested in a listening party somewhere around here (preferably
South Bay, if that's not too provincial...).  I could probably even
drag my Rushfan wannabe husband to it.  As far as musical ability...
well, I can't play any instruments other than kazoo, but I can sing
a bit and I've got about the same range as Geddy (hey, I even have a
big nose!  Well, not _as_ big...).  Tho' I'd probably do better singing
with someone else...particularly since I've haven't got _all_ the
lyrics memorized.

Yo, Matt!  Buddy, ole pal!  You live in Mt. View?!  Instant long lost
friend!  :-)  But you'll have to get up early or sleep at Shoreline
even if you are a Mt. View resident...I tried that last year.  Got to
the park at six a.m. or so and reached the box office just in time for
it to close at noon...bleh.

	I got this catalog in the mail the other day that included a video
tape sampler of concerts that this guy offers for sale.  There are both
pro-shot productions and bootlegs, but the one I'm interested in most is
a pro-shot Rush show from 1990 in Detroit.  The only problem is, the sound
is definitely the garden-variety audience drivel that comes with the
territory on far too many bootlegs.  My question is, why do a pro-shot with
lousy sound.  This shoot must have been authorized by the band, but for
what purpose?  If any one knows why this was done, please post it to the
NMS.  And, does anyone know if there are any other pro-shots from the
'Presto' tour out there with better sound?  Inquiring Rush fans want to
know.

I have heard some complaints of late from a couple of people of the
fact that the digest is often extremely large.  And that it does not
contain much information that is useful to them.

My answer to that is that the digest follows fairly closely (maybe
even precisely) RFC 936 which describes a format for digests such as
this.  As a result, it is possible for many mail readers (such as
vm for emacs) to break the digest apart into it's component messages
so that you can read only the messages whose subject lines catch your
fancy.

Oh, and by the way, (this is directed at the person on the Marillion
list) as our esteemed :rush-mgr pointed out, the RUSH list is now over
800 members strong.  The Marillion list, by your own accounting, is
only about 100.  That means that the Marillion list is going to be
significantly smaller.

hi,
  unfortunately i was too excited to pay attention, but in the new york
(and i think worldwide-so pay attention to your local rock stations)
Roll The Bones will be world-premiering on Aug 29th at 11pm EDT.  In the
NYC area it can be heard on 102.7 WNEW-FM.  As I said, I think it is
supposed to be worldwide.  Check your time.

P.S. I always wonder whether Rush ever considered the title 'Third Stage'
as a suitable title for their third live album instead of 'ASOH' and if so
I wonder if the boys ever wished Tom Scholz(Boston) would ever have a hi
Rockman shoved up his ass.           Makes me wonder, how 'bout you?

I was wondering if anyone knows if the Boys have any plans
to digitally remaster any of their early albums. I don't
know if it is a universal problem, but my copy of Hemispheres
has a fair amount of hiss in the background (I guess from the
tape used for the dump onto CD), and it's pretty irritating,
especially at the start of La Villa (probably my Favourite
Rush track - although its a tossup between about 10 different
tracks!) (might even be a good question for the interview with
Geddy)

Also, why is PoW "Brought to you my the letter "M"", and
Presto "Brought to you my the letter "D""? I assume this is
some of their usual humour - am I mistaken?

Sigh..  Well, I TRIED to do the Sparc->Soundblaster conversion on dreamline.au
and unfortunately it bombed.  SoundTool for Windows basically churned out a
file of static with a beat.  Sorry, folks.  If you want to try it yourself,
you can get Sound Tool via anonymous ftp from cica.cica.indiana.edu (the big
Windows 3 ftp site).  I'm not sure off hand what directory it's in.  Anyway,
Sound Tool can save in raw 8-bit format, so try that, and use voc-hdr (that
came with the soundblaster) to make it into a .voc file (I think the sampling
rate is 7330 hz)

Anyway, I did find a Sparc and a NeXT and played it on those, and..  wow!
Hurry up September 3rd!  The song is pretty incredible...  that's all I can
really say....

Rush fans in the Pittsburgh area might want to tune in to WDVE, 102.5 FM.

They've been playing various tracks from "Roll The Bones".  I'm listening to
"Heresy" as I type!  One of my friends heard "Neurotica" last night, and the
DJ just said they'll be doing this all this week!!

For the record, I LOVE "Dreamline" and so far "Heresy" sounds pretty good...
My friend said "Neurotica" sounded great...

Howdy,

I read Frank Lancaster's post about his probable interview with Geddy.  A
question I've been meaning to ask Mr. Geddy if I should run into him at a
Jays game is:

Hey, the bass sound on Madrigal from AFTK is really quite different from any
other bass sound on that album. It's rather different from any bass sound of
that period.  Did you use a fretless bass on that song?  If so, have you done
any fretless playing on any other songs?

So if you talk to Ged could ya ask him that for me?

                                                          Tanks,
                                                          Dave

ps  Frank, when are you gonna start making dubs of that pre-release of the
    album and mail them out to everybody on the list?

Well, it seems that the radio stations around here are clueless.  All of them
are surprised that Rush has a new single out, and have no idea when they will
get it.  One Denver station acknowledges that Rush has been working on a new
album, but not much more.  When I went to Sound Warehouse to look for the 
singleI didn't find it, but in their "Up Coming" list was "Roll The Bone", to
be released on the 3rd.  Close enough for me, but I really want to hear it now!

I was calling around town (San Antonio) trying to see if any of the local
radio stations had the single off RTB, SUPPOSEDLY Dreamline. Most of them
were pretty clueless to the existence of a new album much less a single from
it. In desperation I called Atlantic in New York. The woman that I talked to
said that the single was being released today, but it was going to be (and she
enunciated this carefully) Where's My Thing, not Dreamline. Oh, well...I guess
we'll all know soon enough!
BTW - If y'all are anticipating this as much as I am and want to keep abrest
on the latest info, the phone number for Atlantic is (212) 484-6000.
