<A NAME="693001">Subject: The Trouble with Rap</A>

A couple of things about this anti-rap theme:

1)  Don't be hypocritacal.  Many of you all have bitched about people that
don't like rush, or say that the music is junk (many also treat the former as
if they were the latter).  The standard reply is that they just haven't
listened to the right songs/albums, or haven't listened enough, or hard
enough, etc.  Now here comes an artform that is different, and you are making
judgements based upon a small sampling of the pop stuff.  My advice is to
explore, find the stuff that isn't pop (i.e. the same old shit, recycled,
with light, fluffy lyrics).

2)  Rap suffers the same fate as all forms of music.  If you go by the radio,
you would tend to think that the only classical composers are Beethoven,
Motzart, the only classic rock artists are Tom Petty, Crosby, Stills and
Nash, Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood.  You'ld also believe that the Greatful
Dead wrote only two songs.  Time and time again, something that is unique is
adopted by the masses and in the process, it is reduced to the lowest common
denometer.  The real stuff is still out there, it's just not heard on pop
radio, and therefore, the vast, vast majority of people don't know it exists,
and worse yet, assume (or are peer-pressured to beleive) that it isn't good
(If it were any good, we would have heard it on the radio!).

In summary, for those of you that understand parables, just because $7.99 for
two large pizzas Pizza Shop down the street sells the grossest stuff you've
ever tasted, doesn't mean that the small, just came over from Italy last week
family run Pizza Place (that can only be found by stumbling upon it) doesn't
exist.

I would defeintely suggest PE (Public Enemy) as a starting point.  The Enemy
Strikes Black esp.  The stuff in hard, the lyrics are good and race is not
brought in unless it is the issue.  Most of the themes are about attitudes
that are asppearent in many "economically deprived" (and if you belevied the
media, the ONLY people in this catagory are urban blacks -- you'ld be
supprised how popular rap is in almost-totally white depresed rural areas)
and just fucked up attitudes in general.

So what if he did?  Other than the fact that they were justly
rewarded for their effort, IMHO it would be an incredible compliment
to hear your fill in Neil's solo.

Hi-

I'm wondering what other mailing lists are available.  Do any of you
know of any relating to:   Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, ZZ Top, or STAR
TREK (yes the TV show(s), not a band)?  If so, please respond to me
personaly with the addresses.

   [ Remember, I have a list of all the e-mail musical mailing lists available

<A NAME="693004">Subject: Rap</A>

 One thing I'd like to point out about "rap". It is not only considered
a form of music but also a style of delivery. The section in RTB is a
rap in delivery style, it has nothing to do with sampling or thieving
other people's songs. Another example: Faith No More's "Epic", Mike
Patton raps the lyrics to that song, he sings on all their other stuff.
 I'd also like to second the recommendation of the Disposable Heroes
of Hiphoprisy. They have some of the most intelligent lyrics around. At
the very least everyone should check out the single they had "Television,
the Drug of the Nation". (Ironically I discovered it by seing the video
on eMTpy Vee. Even more ironically, U2 liked the video so much, they hired
the director to organize their ZooTV stuff.) Also, check out Urban Dance
Squad. Yeah, I know, the name's kind of goofy. These guys have a
singer(rapper), a guitarist, a bassist, a drummer, and a turntable DJ.
They combine real music and riffs with samples used to accent the music,
*not* to replace it. The result defys contegorization.
 Oh, BTW, I don't particularly like the rap section of RTB.

Lael Forester asked if anyone has heard any stuff by the band 'Til
Tuesday (who's vocalist, Aimee Mann, sung on Time Stand Still): I have
one album ('Welcome Home'), and have heard another. I think it's really
good. It's pretty hard to describe what it sounds like. It's light, and
fairly keyboard oriented. But if you like Aimee Mann's voice, it's
well worth searching for an album...

As a reply to carey_maa@csusys (sorry, You did not give your name), another 
band has also sampled a Rush track as part of their own track, The Band is St 
Etienne and the sample that has been used is The riff off `The Spirit of 
Radio`. The name of the album that this track is off escapes me for the moment 
( I think it is called So Tough).As I don't own a copy of the album I can`t 
comment on the trackbut reviews have been quite favourable.

Does anybody know of any other bands that have covered Rush tracks ??

Also is it possible for TNMS to compile a list of all the bootlegs available so
fans would Know which ones to avoid and which are worth getting. (I know you do
not approve of bootlegs but at least it will save some fans money)

   [ Send email to meg@syrinx.umd.edu  She keeps a list of CD bootlegs
     that are out there.   			- rush-mgr ]

And it continues,in such an ever sparkling vein, to downplay rap...

While I have to thank you for mentioning this song as one of those things that
Rush fans like to know, why bother making such a point of hating rap.  I don't
think anyone was waiting to persecute you if you had said that you liked rap.
Hell, I like rap, so I was a little put off.  I also like Rush.  I pray that
doesn't offend you.  And I thought combining the two was not only very
amusing, but an idea whose time has come.  Maybe they're next album will be
all rap!!!  And they could name it K-RUSH Groove IV and make a movie with Kid
and Play!  Now I'm all excited.

In response to Guy McArthur's question on what the last song that Ged and
Alex did w/out Neil, It's "Different Strings" from PeW.  Geddy wrote the
lyrics as well as the music. Hugh Syme, who designs covers for Rush and
Kim Mitchell, played piano on the song.

""Whoever you are, you seemed really concerned that we only mention
books that Neil ACTUALLY read, not ones that might be casual references.
I don't know how tenable that distinction is (Varifying Neil's reading
habits, for most of us, is a task akin to varifying Russia's adherence
to the START treaties!), but I'd like to mention a few things that I see
as influences:""

That "you" is me.  Actually, I meant book or authors that had influenced Neil.
How do we know that they influenced Neil?  Why he mentions them, of course!
I certainly don't expect any of you to ask Neil the next time that you hang
out with him.  Yeah, Neil (oops, I mean rush-mgr, *grin*) certainly is an
intellectual fellow .

Oh yes, this Arsenio Hall that you mention...has he written anything? (*grin*
**giggle**).  He's a non-fiction writer, correct? (Ha!)

Also, you mention Gangster of Boats as a four parter....
"(as opposed to the 4-part Gangster of Boats Trilogy)"

HEY EVERYONE!  I'm looking for the names (and dates) of HYF boots.  Please
e-mail them to me privately.  I have yet to hear of a HYF cd boot.  That's
what I'm really looking for.  Any help that my fellow fans can offer is
much appreciated.

Also, someone brought up that Asian Rush fans seem to like HYF the most.  I
know that I do.  I don't think that it's the Tai Shan attraction either.
Anyone else have comments?  Brothers and sisters, speak up!  Please post
your reponses or e-mail them to me.  Love to hear from you.

Gotta go, y'all take it easy.

 That's the title of a two paragraph article with a picture in the latest
issue of Car & Driver. Its the July 1993 issue, and the article is on page
33. Its about a *new* barchetta from Ferrari. It has no official name yet
and is being refered to as "the barchetta".

I wuz curious when someone stated that The Rythym Method was in YYZ on MP...
Actually, I believe that it is just plain(?) ole YYZ; unless, of course, I
bought a defunct version of MP.

With all this talk of where The Rythym Method should appear, it leads me
to believe that people are getting tired of that solo...Well, not tired,
but maybe a yearning has developed for a new solo from The Professor. I
love The Rythym Method like any RuSh fan, but I would like to experience
another solo on the skins from Neil.

Think about it...

A couple of weeks ago I asked which wrestler was nick-named "The Modern-Day
Warrior".  Unfortuately, I have not received alot of responses so I might as
well give you the answer.  Kerry Von Erich was called the "Modern-Day
Warrior" during the early to mid '80's.  When he entered the ring "Tom
Sawyer" would play.  Kerry committed suicide back in February.  I forget
why he did it, though.

Hello fellow NMSer's

     Well, here's an interesting little factoid about a car we all know and
love.  I was looking through a Car and Driver magazine from a couple of
months ago and saw in the new car section, yup, a barchetta.  It's not the
Ferrarri barchetta, but the Maserati (forgive if I misspelled ;-)
barchetta.  I haven't been able to find that issue again (it was a
friend's) so I don't know much more that that.  But hey, the car in the
picture was red :).
     Anyway, just a little something new to let y'all in on.
