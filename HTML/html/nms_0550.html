Enough of all this talk about the quality of the NMS, I thought the
whole point of it is for people to air their views about the band.

If something doesn't interest you skip over it (you can do that with
computers you know)

Howdie fellow RUSH fans.  I'd like to say that i'm the newest member on this
list and i'm really looking forward to receiving your comments, opinions, 
questions about one of the gratest bands that ever existed.  I can say that 
RUSH is *THE* greatest canadian band since i'm from Montreal Canada.

I saw them 4 times in concert (Power windows with Marillion.  What a show! - 
Hold your fire - Presto - Roll the bones) All great shows.  I own all CD's and 
i'm interested in getting some bootleg stuff.  Someone tell me?

Well, gotta go.  Later.

Not really about Rush, but...
On a whim, I bought a used CD of a band from Lincoln, NE called The
Millions "M Is For Millions".  They have a woman singer with a great
voice, and it sounded really good overall.  Looking through the liner
notes, I saw the words "Produced by Terry Brown".  It seemed kind of
strange, a well known producer doing a album with an unknown band, on
an independent label (Smash(?) Records).
Oh well, I thought it was interesting.

well, the first thing to remember is, Geddy's voice is the lead part.
it's *SUPPOSED* to be the part you hear.  background vocals are just
that....background.

I can't really speak for singing, but I know that in a jazz band, for
example, if you're playing fills or punches behind a soloist, and you
come out on top of that soloist, instead of just kinda being buried in
the background, you might just find yourself swallowing a few teeth
later on....or so I've been told (never really tried to find out, and
I never punched anyone out for standing out when I was soloing, either).

it's spelled ``Morse'' Code.  Morris is a cat.....  where did people
ever start getting this strange spelling for Morse, anyways?  this isn't
the first time I've seen this blunder....

This "which member of Rush would win a free-for-all" thread reminded me of a
running gag from high school.  Here are a few examples:

1.   If the members of Rush took on all the Smurfs, who would win?
2.   If the members of Rush took on 2 foot tall clones of all of the members
     of Yes, who would win?
3.   If Rush, the Toronto Blue Jays and King Crimson had a war with the
     Cinncinati Bears, the former members of Led Zeppelin and Eddie Van Halen,
     who would win?

And so on, and so on, and so on.

I think I'm going to have to pick up Signals after all this talk.
I Didn't know it was so tight of a concept album.

To answer a few questions to the best of my ability:

- "Now it's Dark" appears on the RTB liner notes

  I believe this is a reference to the movie Blue Velvet.  In that film
  (a David Lynch classic), there are several rather violent acts, many of
  which are followed by a picture of a lone flame being blown-out, and
  the voice of "Frank" (the particular main evil person in the film)
  saying "Now it's dark".  The feeling is that Frank is systematically
  bringing darkness to several corners of the neighborhood.  Exactly what
  this means in liner note, I'll leave up to the individual.  One could
  even argue that it's just a joke from people who like Lynch's movies.
  You'll notice that Geddy is frequently seen with buttons and posters
  from Eraserhead (Lynch's first cult hit), as seend in the Le Studio in
  videos like Vital Signs, so one could infer that he's the fan.

- Alex's voice sounds like Geddy when performing live?

  Could be that Geddy's voice is sampled and triggered for backup,
  as is Aimee Mann's in Time Stand Still.  Just a guess.

- IMHO...

  Stands for In My Humble Opinion.  Of course, I was once told
  that everything is from the individual's perspective unless stated
  otherwise, so such tags (like "I think", for example) seem
  superfluous, but that's just my opinion ;-)

	Yo.

	First of all, what's all this blab over which bandmember would win
in a free-for-all?  I hardly think that these guys would ever stoop that
low, to the caliber of "when in doubt, whip it out, I got me a rock and
roll band, it's a free for all!"  That's disgusting.  That's for Ted
Nugent.  Not for Rush.  I mean, just look at the quality of the lyrics to
any Rush song and compare them to a majority of other hard rock bands
such as Damn Yankees or Aerosmith- no comparison!  I rest my case.

	Second, this is pretty obvious, but with all the talk about new
albums, etc, if you'll notice, Rush comes out with a live album after
every 4 studio albums.  I hope we'll all see the next one, they've got 2
more to go before that, though.

	Third, tonight I saw the "Laser Rush" laserlight show at the local
planetarium here in Grand Rapids.  INTENSE SHOW!  They played a wide
variety of stuff- 2112, Tom Sawyer, Countdown, La Villa, Different
Strings, Time Stand Still, and much more for only $4!!!!!!  A must for
anyone who likes Rush and has wanted to go to a laserlight show.  It's
the first one I've gone to, and it kicked a$$!  Go see it.  That's all
I've got to say.                     later... --

Nope... I taped the beginnings just in case..... No dice.... at least
Geddy's favorite team won though.... And that Canadian flag thing was
inexcusable.

But the ycame out with these tshirts that have the flag upside down with

I like all the philosophy we're comming up with here on TNMS!

Yes "the point of the journey in not to arrive".
	In both Xanadu and Fount O'Lamenth we see characters who,
single-minded of purpose, see and fufill one dream and then go nowhere for
the rest of their life.  Sure we should "hold <our> fire, keep it burning
bright" but "from first to last, the peak is never past.  Something
always sparks that light that gets in <our> eyes".  Throughout the many
changes RUSH's lyrics have undergone, this is one of the themes that
remains over the years.  "Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose."
	Taking this same lead, an _old vs new_ argument becomes invalid
because "<we> know changes aren't permanent, but change is."

	There really is alot of material to work with here. . .

I saw a mention or two on alt.music.rush and also one on this forum
raising the question of Geddy singing the Canadian national anthem at the
World Series.

Do you (figurative) really think the same person who sings "Territories"
would sing a national anthem at a baseball game? I personally would be
disappointed if he sold out in that way.

I have a question that is probably really silly..

You guys keep referring to the B-man.  Are you talking about broon?  I am
a huge rush fan, but must admit I am not over the edge like many of you
seem to be.  I would be interested in getting this book however if someone
could give me details.

Another thing I wanted to mention is the Rupert Hine thread talked about
earlier.  I think we all can agree that MP is one of the best albums and
if we compare roll the bones and presto to it we see how bad these albums are.
Don't misunderstand me I like both of these albums, but compared to their old
stuff they are nothing special.  So why did they get rid of Broon and
cant they go back to him and dump RH?

I really dont want to fan the old vs. new debate, but I really feel that
the albums done by Broon where the best.....

DUMP RUPERT HINE!!!
WE WANT BROON!!!!!

This post is somewhat RUSH related. (read roundabout).

I have a couple of CD singles from Dream Theater titled,
Status Seeker and Afterlife.  On the first CD there is
a remix by Terry Brown!  These came out in 1989 and where
released by MCA for Mechanic Records (Out of business now).

This might help the poster who was wondering what Broon has
been doing lately (well, three years ago).

P.S.  I had to get new licence tags for my car and just by
      chance I was issued HYF-88J.  I can imagine Neil saying
      'get a life' now.  Oh well.............................

The other day Derek Atlansky was asking about Neil and electic drums. The
whole thing is very funny and in B-man's book. But Geddy was trying to
get Neil to try them but he would't, he hated them with a passion.  He said
"My drums and I have a simple relationship, I hit them and they
speak."(short exerpt).
I still laugh when I think how it must have sounded when Neil said that:-)

Hi there!

To all the guys who sent me tapes, I'm very sorry to have kept you waiting!
It's just that I've been in hospital, and I'm getting through most of them now!
I have receieved them all from you so don't worry and thanks for being patient!

As for the NMS convention, I'm in Liverpool,England and if it was definetely
on, how would I go about paying for accomodation,etc????  I really would
love to go (one of my friends (another Rush freak!) wants to come as well!)
but I don't want to be stranded in a country where I know no-one!!!!

Please, Please can someone mail me, or print in here the details of when it
is, how much it will cost,etc??????

thanks!
