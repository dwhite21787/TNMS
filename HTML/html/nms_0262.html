Convention Center Arena

AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. It can make or break a show, and tonight the 
fabulous crowd made Mr Big bigger and Rush into an overpowering aural
cataclysm.

At 7.30pm sharp, Mr Big ease onstage to a healthy round of applause
and jump into a seven-song set of bluesy rock and roll. The tunes are
catchy and well played ( of course! ), but I have to admit that I 
preferred them in the more intimate setting of a small club I'd seen 
the band in a couple of months ago. It's da blooze, after all, so it
can't really knock over a stadium rock crowd.

The crowd's enthusiasm and the bands energy, do win out though, and
_Merciless_, _Take a Walk_, and _Big Love_ are three heavy hitters.
Vocalist Eric Martin is a showman as well as a soulful singer, getting
down on his knees to praise the virtues of Texan women, then harassing
his bandmates during their instrumental sections.

Then it's a fun ride to show closer _Addicted to that Rush_ , and the
band increase their efforts, culminating in Eric Martin's query:
"Are you Addicted to RUSH?" The song is momentarily drowned by screams
and yowls. Ask a stupid question....

There are a lot of Rush fans in South Texas, and it looks like every 
one of them got a seat for this show. How else can you explain the 
tremendous roar that goes that goes up when the lights go black, the
vibration that rolls up your spine as 13,000 people rise to their feet,
the applause that crackles like prairie fire from balcony to 
stage-edge?

The opening video is an oldie with a new twist; tonight the cartoon
people are queueing to see "Attack of the killer Rabbits". The 
musicians onscreen hit their stage just as the opening bars of 
"Force Ten" burst from the expertly wielded instruments of the now visible
Lifeson, Peart and Lee.  The song streams through multicoloured cones 
of light, and we're all entranced like deer on the highway - well,
deer who yell and play air guitar and jump up and down!

The band are in shades of black, white, grey, and silver ( Peart's
drumkit, that ), but the crowd are bathed in a rainbow for much of the
show. Being able to see each other and knowing that Rush see us 
inspires even higher levels of hyperactivity. The perfectly clear
and strong notes ( especially those from Geddy's throat ) answer us 
and encourage us to still more. Let me tell ya, I'm not going over the
top here; These are easily the most exciting concert moments I've 
experienced in years.

Its the old songs that get the best response, and Rush run through 
several of them; _Freewill_ , _Time Stands Still_ and _Red Barchetta_
are the biggest adrenalin pumpers. How can the music be so hot, while
the band are so cool?

_Superconductor_ and _Show don't tell_, off the new album, don't meet
with as big a welcome, but then they're not old friends yet. Just wait
a couple of years. In the meantime the new video backup ( cartoon 
magicians and computerised weirdness emerging from a top hat ) keeps 
up properly impressed.

After Geddy shows his best on the classic _Closer to the heart_ ,
it's time for a surprise - the seldom heard _Xanadu_. It leads into
_YYZ_ and Neil Peart's kilt spins around in preparation for what will
be another lesson in When You Certainly May Solo, In Fact, When You Had
Better! The sound is nearly African in parts, orchestral in others.
Special effects and synthesized jazzy outbursts keep us cheering,
though Peart never stops to indulge himself in our praise.

Back to full band efforts, and a portion of their stage show obviously
affected by their excellent sense of humor. From each side of the stage,
two giant rabbits emerge from magicians' hats. They remain static 
through _War paint_ and the _The Mission_ but can't resist _Tom Sawyer_
-they begin to shake and shimmy and wave their long white ears. Utter
silliness and perfect one-upmanship of the Rolling Stones' inflatable
bimbos. Even Geddy's laughing as he strolls across the stage,
grabbing the sides of Alex's mouth in an attempt to make him smile too.

It's not over till It's over, and Rush give us our money's worth on
the encore, hopping through _Big money_, _2112_'s rocketing 
_Overture_ with a segue into _La Villa Strangiato_ and _In the mood_
under dark blue lights and lasers gone mad. Even Alex infected by the
general joyousness, shows us some dance moves, under Geddy's 
direction.

We're screaming, they're smiling, and it's for the same reason;
"You guys have been great" Geddy yells.

Right back atcha, gentlemen.
