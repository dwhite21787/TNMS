Is anybody actually keeping this information?  I think that a complete
list of opening acts might be too big for the FAQL, and I don't have
time to keep track of this information.  Maybe it could be added to the
list of concerts?  Jimmy?

   Ok, third times a charm, eh?  As I was trying to say before, Voivod's
guitarist [nicknamed Piggy] is a really big RUSH fan.  There, now
I said it...
   I hope Rush gets a different producer. Presto seemed to be too
commercial in many respects. The War Paint singalong finale always
embarrasses me, I mean that's top 40 radio material! The bass and
guitar playing were too conventional for my tastes, but the drums as
usual were awesome. Especially on Scars... too bad the music wansn't
that great.  Enough complaining, I guess I'll just cross my fingers
on the next album and hope for an instrumental/epic...

Does any one out there have any soild info on Geddy working with VOIVOD, in
regards to their(VOIVOD's) new alblum?  VOIVOD is one of my favorite bands,
as well as RUSH and it would be nice also to hear from some other VOIVOD fans
who are out there.

 Greetings...

   Mark Maxham made a comment in yestday's TNMS about what Neil "means"
 when he uses the noun/interjection "Christ" in  The Pass.  I wonder how
 he can be so sure in his claim.  Does this mean the the person he is
 addressing (in the 2nd person) is Christ?  Seems like one of those
 subjective interpretation calls to me!

   Does anyone know if Zebra ever _did_ open for Rush - aside of that one
 time when they had to cancel at the last minute?  That was a band with a
 lot of potential.   *My* favorite opener had to be Blue Oyster Cult -
 gotta love that green lighting for _Godzilla_!!!

   On the subject of Aimee Mann and the "blanked out" concert screen, it
 happened in the Philadelphia Spectrum, also.  Did anyone else have the
 feeling that not as much went into the Presto stage show as in at least
 the previous two?  Yes, the rabbits were great (alas, no playboy bunnies
 appeared on-stage in Philly), but the use of lasers, etc.. was a bit less
 than in the HYF and PoW tours.  Not that I'm griping - I'd have given up
 all the stage effects for _Freewill_, _La Villa Strangiato_, _Xanadu_,
 etc... ! ! ! ! !

<A NAME="169005">Subject: Warm up groups, DDD, etc.</A>

     When I saw Rush the warm up groups were:

                Fastway:  P/G tour Glenns Falls NY
                Steve Morse Band:  PoW tour Rochester NY
                ??? (I can't recall)  HYF tour Buffalo, NY
                Voivod:  Presto tour Toronto ONT, (both nights)
                Mr. Big: Presto tour Albany NY

    I also can't remember who opened for them when I saw the Signals
    tour, but that is just a sampling.

    As far as DDD sounds on the Rush compact discs, I think
that Moving Pictures is DDD, and so is everything that they made
after that point.  To all of you audiophiles, the disc player was
already making waves as early as 1983, you just couldn't get them
for a reasonable price until 1985 or so (I got mine in '85)
Moving Pictures was one of the first discs that I bought, and I
think it was my first DDD purchase, (along with Dire Straits, Money
For Nothing)  There wasn't much out then.......

     As far as the last song being a song of things to come, the person
who said that Between the Wheels was Signals like, has their albums
reversed.  (Between the Wheels was P/G and Signals was *before* not
after P/G)  I also don't think that Permenant Waves (the song) was
anything like Moving Pictures, or that Countdown was anything like
P/G, or that High Water was anything like Presto.  However, I do think
that the final songs are different from the album that they are on and
in general are excellent songs.

      Oh Well....... enough is enough
      if only that field goal were another two feet to the left, the
      best team in the NFL would have won the super-bowl.....

My uncle tells me this Rush story (wish he had a country place that nobody
knew about!):

It's 1973 or 74, and he's going to see Kiss in Atlanta. He gets downtown and
while waiting in line notices the marquee advertising the concert. It's got
KISS in huge neon letters, pictures of the four members in their full makeup
and costumes, the band members names, etc. Under all of this, at the bottom
edge of the marquee, in comparatively tiny letters, is the legend "with rush".
He sees this, thinks "who is rush??", and goes into the concert, hoping that
this lead-in band won't play very long so he can see his favorite band.
Rush absolutely blew Kiss off the stage, and my uncle was converted!

	I think it would be great if local RUSH fans got together and went to
RUSH when they came to town.

	All Omaha area NMS subscibers contact me at "za073@zeus.unomaha.edu"
as soon as posible so I can have some idea as to numbers...

	BTW...when RUSH begins thier next tour, somebody please post the tour
dates?

	Two more things (horray! from the peanut galery...) I would personaly
beinterested in going to other shows in diferent areas(kansas city, etc...),
and Luther, if you send me mail about wanting to go, I'll shoot you...

Neil's line "Christ, what have you done?" is an interjection and a noun.
Neil says himself that he likes to write multiple interpretations into songs.
It's the mark of a good lyricist/poet.

On a completely (well, more or less) different subject I, too have often
thought Moving Pictures is a great album - the next one will be better,
right?

I have been reading the NMS for some time now, and as time went by I
noticed a few people who noted they were musicians themselves. I am
now curious to find out how many people who read the NMS and enjoy
listening to Rush are bass players, drummers, and guitar players. You
might call this a little poll. Send a simple message to my address
below (stating that you are answering to the poll and what instrument
you play).

Just some notes here from out of the blue...

I remember hearing about how "La Villa" is in part based on cartoon monster
music. Well now I know for sure. One night staying up watching Bugs and
pals I noticed the same notes from the "Monster" part of "La Villa" - I
found the same music several days later in another Warner Bros. cartoon,
this time with Daffy (this one had him waiting for a Dick Tracy magazine
in front of his mailbox, and as he was pacing the music was playing). So all
you late nighters turn on TNT on cable and watch those Warner Bros cartoons!
(How many cartoons I wonder have this music in them??)

I want to say thank you to all the people who have been contributing the
Rush gifs to the anonymous ftp at syrinx... they look great! (Except for
Signals.. is it supposed to have the bottom part cut off?) Wall posters
coming soon to a hallway around our campus!

If anyone would like any of these line printer wall-sized posters and either
doesn't know how to make them or can't get access to a printer I'd be willing
to process them and print them and mail them out to anyone here on the list
(provided you're willing to pay for postage.. paper's heavy! :) ), or even if
you would just like a laser picture of one of the gifs, e-mail me for more
information.

Keep up the good work list.. and keep growing!!

ps. I hope that their new album contains a longer song like "The Camera Eye"
    or the one off Permanent Waves (sheesh it's so late I can't even
    remember the title! ugh!)... and a tour in fall!

Hmm, I am highly suspicious of this statement.  How do you come to the
conclusion that's what he's saying?  The theme of the song is about
teenage suicide (they've said it, and it's pretty obvious from the video).
Jesus (who was no warrier) didn't commit suicide, he was killed.  On top
of that, Neil doesn't subscribe to Christianity; he doesn't even believe
in the Devil (from Neil's editorial on Satanism, issue #28).

I think it's much more likely that Neil refers to the concept that when
presented with apparently impossible situation(s), some might think it's
'noble' to hang it up and kill themselves.  I personally disagree with
this, and I think Neil does too, judging by the lyrics.  I think it's a
sad waste for somebody to kill themselves (in most cases - there are
arguments for terminally ill patients), especially a young person.  I
know, I was an unhappy teenager (eons ago), and toyed with the idea of
suicide.  I'm glad now I didn't!

Also, if you'll notice, the actual ordering of the lyrics is:

   "No hero in your tragedy
    No daring in your escape
    No salutes for your surrender
    Nothing noble in your fate
    Christ, what have you done?"

This most certainly doesn't sound like Jesus' death!
