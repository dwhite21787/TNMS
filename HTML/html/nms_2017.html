Alex did something similar at the show in Charlotte. It had me in tears

<<If you ask me, this is a far cry from the mindless drab that most other

I think all the Brothers and Sisters of Rush would agree with you here.
Luckily for us we can swim against the tide of what is popular and

"Cincinatti, 1991. THe Riverside Colloseum really sucks in acoustics, maybe 
because it's a concrete structure built in the 1940s isn't made for music( 
But somehow, it becomes a main venue in the area. (It still bemuses me why.) "

is this post referring to CINergy Field, formerly known as Riverfront Stadium? 
btw, it's coliseum or colosseum, and Cincinnati. what an appalling job our 
public schools are doing.
If so it wasn't built in the 40's; try late 60's. It's the same basic design 
as Three Rivers in Pittsburgh, The Vet in Philly, and Busch in St. Louis, 
though Busch has been renovated much more completely than the others, mainly 
due to the fact that the others have to house both baseball and football 
teams, while Busch is home only to the baseball Cardinals. And the reason 
that ALL of the stadiums are main venues in their respective cities is b/c 
they're BIG! (50K+ seating for games, more for concerts) They (the promoters) 
aren't doing acoustical tests - they know it sounds shitty!  but where else 
can they pack that many people in?
Riverfront has a storied history as a concert venue - Rush was not alone in 
pIaying this venue often in the 70's and I believe it was the site of the Who 
concert that degenerated into a riot with several people stomped to death. 
This and other incidents (some at Rush shows) convinced the boyz to do away 
with "festival seating" (general admission) after the Moving Pictures tour, I 
think.
If this was in reference to some other venue I sincerely apologize for my 
spelling/stadium lesson, but I felt motivated to defend a stadium where I 
attended not only vintage Rush and Kiss concerts, but watched Charlie Hustle 
and the Big Red Machine take the 75 series from the hapless/clueless BoSox. 
It is made out of concrete; you got that part right. And it sucks overall, 
you got that right too.

<A NAME="2017003">Subject: opinion on Neil's videos</A>

Hey folks --

Thought I'd throw my two cents in on Neil's A Work in Progress vids.
Thanks to the loan from my friend Tom in LA (former NMSer -- Tom, come
back!!) I was able to see the first one but couldn't see the second before
he needed them back.

Now...  I held the same opinion as many of you before viewing these.
"hey, I'm not a drummer, I know NOTHING about drums, why the heck should I
care about videos on drumming?"  Maybe it was the fact that I DO play
piano/keyboard and guitar, so I have a good sense of music/music theory;
but nonetheless, despite my hesitation...  WHOA, this was great!  

<BLARING OPINION ALERT!  VOOT VOOT!>  Now, I'll admit to, in the past,
having thought that drummers have excellent rhythm but don't know a whole
lot about music itself, since they don't actually play notes.  Thanks to
reading NMS and watching these vids, my opinion has changed.  Yeah, there
are the drumemrse (a la Hanson) who do bare-minimum, let's keep the beat
playing.  Then there are folks in the Neil category, who make drumming a
work of art just as any top-notch guitarist, bassist, what have you.

Bottom line?  These videos helped me appreciate drummers a whole lot more.
It made me appreciate their music a bit more.  Heck, I even appreciate
Rush more after watching this.  And you just may learn something about
drumming.  What I found particularly interesting was the ability to watch
Neil's drum parts UP CLOSE while the rest of the song was playing in the
background.

now if I can only get hold of the second video...  TOM, COME BACK!

This will probably be mentioned a gazillion times by the time this post
show up, but . . .

Did anyone catch David Spades' comedy show on cable? I'm not sure what
station it was (probably either HBO or Showtime) and for all I know it
might have been a repeat of the show, but during his "bit" he motioned
to someone at the side of the stage and said "Yeah, crank it up! Spirit
of Radio!" (I think someone in the band played a few notes of it or
someone was playing a radio nearby)  He then proceeded to do a poor
imitation of Geddy's voice singing the lyrics "...crackle with the
energy". Then he told the same person to crank it up higher, and for the
guy to play Freewill, because he "knew the words to that one". He also
made a comment that all singers who sing like that never use their REAL
voice, or something to that effect.

I believe David is Canadian and therefore may be a true fan. I'm still
waiting for the guy on News Radio (channel 4 in NYC) to make a reference
to Rush on the show. I KNOW he's Canadian.

Cute, Russell. But I've grown tired of this stupid thread. Surely you guys
can talk about this half-assed sh*t via private email? It takes up too much
space in digest mode. Thanks, I appreciate it.

oh, btw:

E = 5
L = 12
I = 9
A = 1
S = 19

5 + 12 + 9 + 1 + 19 = 46. What's relevant about this? Nothing whatsoever.

DT is good when they don't get too poppy (like they do some on FII).  I
too hear many Rush influences in their music, but the most obvious ones
to me are in:

Ytsejam, Light Fuse and Get Away, Only a Matter of Time, Metropolis,
Learning to Live, Scarred

The end of Learning to Live sounds like a cross between Digital Man and
Analog Kid to me.  The last part of Scarred sounds very
Hemispheres-like.

Of course much of the drumming will make you think of Rush, since
Portnoy basically only lists Peart when you ask for his influences.
Myung lists Lee as one of his three biggest influences.  Petrucci's
influences are more varied, however.

Don't forget CoS.  Necromancer and TFoL are both very progressive, IMO.
But I agree Hemispheres is the daddy of them all in progressive metal.

HEy gang..
I'm gonna try to make this as short as possible....(ha ha)

First, neat thread about kiddos getting into Rush. My 1 year old daughter
has been listening to them by default, so I'm sure she'll grow with them
too. Last semester, one of my students dropped by my news room/recording
studio here at the station to work on a project. He saw my stack of Rush and
made "Cool" type comments. I asked him if he was a big fan. He said he
was..etc. etc.. He also added on to the end: Yeah, my old man is huge fan,
and that's how I got into them..Now I feel old....

Actually, I'm not going to dwell on the star thing, but this is kind of
related...Back in high school (84-88) I played in a semi talented too much
time on our hands garage band. We played a lot of Rush badly. Anyway, one
day our guitar player comes to practice with a tape his brother had given
him as a joke. On it, some preacher is telling an audience about the horrors
of rock and roll. Eventually he came to Rush and the Man-in-the-Star thing,
spouting the "obvious" satanic meanings, blah, blah, blah...But then, much
to our suprise, he starts ragging on Hemispheres. He shows the audience a
picture of the cover and tells how the naked man on the one side of the
brain represents Satan, while the guy in the business suit is our innocence.
He then explains that the "devil" is reaching out across our brain to entrap
our innocence, blah, blah, blah.. I don't think there have been many times
I've laughed that hard. The best part was that this guy was speaking with
that Southern Evangelist type of voice you see in the movies.. What a riot...
Anyone else hear this tape before... Wish I had a copy, just for occasional
comic relief..
Cheers from New MExico..

Good thread.  I remember seeing Rush in Hampton VA on what I think was
the Power Windows tour - I recall the stage was setup with ramps on
either side of the drumkit and a platform linking them.  During one song
(CTTH?), Alex runs up the left side, along behind Neil, down the right
and crouches behind Geddy's amps.  Although Geddy saw Alex take off
running, he evidently didn't see where he ended up.  So Geddy returns to
the mike to sing the next verse and spends the verse nervously trying to
look behind him to see where Alex is.  Alex ends up running up behind
him and stabbing Geddy in the back with the headstock of his guitar.
Pretty funny.

Hey NMSers,

I'm conducting a poll (for curiosity sake only, I guess) of what Rush songs
y'all feel are not just great songs but have really hit a chord in relation
to your life. These are songs that, for one reason or another, have really
hit deep and on target on some emotion, experience, belief, etc.

Here are mine:

"Subdivisions" (as a "outcast" high-school student this is my anthem!)
"Afterimage" (great personal meaning...)
"The Analog Kid" (I'm 16 and this song has helped me realize what I will
miss later in life and enjoy it while I can)
"Natural Science" (talk about an encapsulation of life)
"2112" (to a fervent individualist it doesn't come much better than this)

Just in case anyone cares, the CD player currently holds:
    1. Triumph _Classics_
    2. The Police _Every Breath You Take-The Classics_
    3. Rush _Moving Pictures_
    4. Rush _Signals_
    5. Queensryche _Operation:Mindcrime_

Somehow, however, I think rush-mgr wouldn't be too happy to start the
"currently in CD player" thread again...

       I personally think that Rush should come out with a new cd.  My dad 
     is always wanting to just get more of their music.  I have never heard 
     any radio station play Rush on the radio recently.  I guess they just 
     haven't had the time because of what's going on with Neil Peart and 
     his daughter.  I'm just thinking that rush should come out with more 
     cds for more people to appreciate their music more and I'm sure that 
     everybody that visits this site often, would definitely buy their new 
     cd-if there is another one.  This is my father's e-mail but I had to 
     post it after reading it.  If rush decides to come out with another cd

<A NAME="2017019">Subject: Another insightful article</A>

I'd gotten a few great responses on my previous articles, so I thought 
I'd throw another into the fray (in other words, my next $.02)--I guess 
some days I see Rush in the grand scheme of things, the "grand designs". 
Anyway, here goes:

Emotional Rush
by Martin Gibbs

Emotions.

Fear. Pain. Rage. Love. Exhileration. Desperation.

All are expressed in the music of Rush. How do three rock musicians 
epitomize the human soul and its wants, needs and desires? How can a 
master drummer, a wailing bassist and wild guitarist capture humanity 
and turn it into a rock song? Was Neil Peart blessed by gods, or does he 
simply possess a greater understanding of the world? Or is each member 
blessed by Apollo?

Whatever the answer, it is clear that these three members are truly the 
best musicians in their genre.

Then what is their genre? Perhaps they define their own, which makes my 
last statement an insult. But then again, perhaps they are the 
best-practiced, most-talented, best-rehearsed, most-intelligent, and 
freshest band to come along. Period.

Where's the recognition? The top-40 hits? Billboard rankings? 
Five-year-long tours across the globe? Publicity lauding their 
greatness?

Nonexistant and unwanted. It seems these great musicians hold a dearer 
bond to their families (both wives' and kids' as well as the fans) than 
they do to the spotlights and the rave reviews by the "in" crowd. The 
problem with the "in" crowd is that they are in one day and out the 
other--purely a fad--and yet Rush remains "in" through the decades. In 
fact, they've been going strong since 1974. The rave reviews don't 
happen because Rush has always been there, and has always been present. 
The glamour is unnecessary.

Instead, they go about and do that which they love--make music.

And capture the human emotional experience, which is done through the 
poignant lyrics of their drummer, Neil Peart and the majestic music of 
Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee. That is the combination which gives the 
world the greatest emotional music of all time.

How?

Perhaps we'll know when we die.

Or perhaps we know right now.

There is a strange phenomenon which exists. Either you love Rush or you 
don't really get into it. Why? It's like those people who are deeply 
embedded in their own religious sect and those who just go to church on 
Sunday.

Rush...a religion?

Well, why not? Why discount them as a valid faith? They preach kindness 
and decency, and the drive never to give up (see "Marathon"), the evils 
of suicide ("someone set a bad example/made surrender seem alright"), 
and the "freedom of music". I could fill a tome with quotes that portray 
Rush as a deeply humanistic band, a band looking out for the betterment 
of mankind and the survival of higher morals, of decency. They point out 
the weekness of man, "I can learn to coexist/with anything but pain", 
and they reject turning the other cheek: "You can fight without ever 
winning/but you can never win without a fight".

Rush...a religion!

Then I gladly join the masses as I shovel off to prayer...I think "2112" 
is playing somewhere and do I hear "Freewill" on that stereo? Or was it 
only an "Afterimage"--am I "Losing It"?

Rush...a band with emotion. The band with the soul of humanity coursing 
through it's every note. Rush...a religion.

Baptize me.

"Hold your fire
keep it burning bright
hold the flame till the dream ignites
A spirit with a vision
Is a dream
with a mission."

Hello fellow Rush freaks!

I too looked up the KISS 99.5 webpage. They are giving away a whole
bunch of concert trips. One of them was for Rush in Toronto. Most of
these trips, like for Metallica, have the concert dates posted on the
webpage. However, the Rush concert date was undeclared at this time. I
e-mailed them and received a response today. Here it is:

> There is a Rush show planned before the closing of historic Maple Leaf's
> Garden.  No details if this is a one shot, a tour kick off, or what.
> More details later.
> --
> =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
> Kevin Vargas
> kevinv@kissrocks.com

This may be total bull and rumors, but since Rush is putting out a live
album in late summer/fall, it is possible there will be a tour. This is
also the same time frame the radio station is referring to. I don't
think our beloved band toured for ASOH, but hey, ASOH came out the same
year as Presto. Since Presto was due out following ASOH, Rush had
probably decided to wait until Presto's release to do a another tour.
So, since it will be two years since TFE by the time the fourth live
album is released and there are no plans for a studio album this year, I
think it damn possible for there to be some form of tour. We can only
hope. Almighty Rush manager, what are your thoughts?

   [ I think they won't be touring for the live album. Kinda redundant, 
     don't you think? ;-)  I have heard no word on this Toronto show. I 
     suppose anything's possible, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for
     it. I can't believe they're closing MLG! *sigh*           : rush-mgr ]

This is my first posting!

I see there is some talk about the Red Star and the Nude Man.  I have a
pendent of the symbol and get quite alot of comments about it.  My
explanation to the uninitiated is as follows:  The Star represents the evil
and the oppression of collectivism i.e. socialism/communism.  The Nude Man
is renouncing The Star and what it represents.  In a word, The Red
Star/Nude Man pendent is a symbol of individualism.  Enough "isms" already!
is usually the comment I get back after my explanation.  Some people do not
by that explanation and insist it is a symbol of the Devil.  At that point
I usually just internally laugh at them and go my merry way.

A few more thoughts!

The 2nd leg of the T4E tour was the best!  I saw the show at the Nissan
Pavillion in VA.  All my friends who have been going to Rush show w/me for
years were equally amazed.   Personally, the Nissan Pav. show was my 20th
dating back to Sept. 26, 1980.  Who would have thought at that PeW show I
would continue attending Rush shows deep into the 90's.

What was really cool about that 1st show was the willingness of the band to
sign autographs after the show.  The only thing I could say to Geddy was
"Intense show man".  He replied "yea man, real intense".  I still have the
tickets stub with Geddy's and Alex's sig.  It's the showcase of my ticket
stub collection.

I liked Ozzy a long time ago and i still revered the guy for some great

mouthed because the guy told the truth about himself: he cursed 20 hrs a
day even in frontof his children. He revealed it himself on VH1. It's a

I wasn't quite sure who Slim was responding to, but I have to agree with
that person. Neil is adamant about the lyrics in the liner notes being
correct. While, I think (as others do as well) that Geddy has sung a
different word once or twice (everyone-please don't start a flame war over
the last phrase-we've all heard it before), when what is written, and what
is sung are the same, the burden of proof is on the one who says it was a
slip of the tongue. As far as I can tell, nothing short of a confession
from a band member will constitute "proof". No disrespect intended; just
how I see it.

On a rather different matter, I'd like to request people not "quote" entire
posts that they are responding to. TNMS is long enough without page-long
quotations. Thanks, most readers will appreciate it, I think.

Lastly, since most Rush fans are as or almost as interested in the lyrics
as the music, I want to commend Queensryche's latest, "Hear in the Now
Frontier". The lyrics are quite good (as is the music), especially, "Some
People Fly." Check it out if you haven't already. I was bummed to hear that
Chris DeGarmo has left the band; I thought his song-writing was getting
quite good. Anyway...

One last thing in this long post (not long due to overquoting, mind you :) ):
This has probably been discussed quite a bit, but I was not reading TNMS
during this period---Are the remasters for Signals, Moving Picture and 2112
better than the gold-plated original masters? Feel free to email me
privately on this part. I'd appreciate it.

Have you really listened to any of their music?  There is just as much
emotion in their lightning fast phrasings as there is in their slow bluesy
passages.  Ever heard Joe's "Rubina," "Always With Me, Always With You," or
anything from his self-titled album?  BTW his new album Crystal Planet is
his best yet IMHO.

Yes I can!  Take a listen to "Blue Powder" and "For The Love of God" from
his Passion and Warfare CD.

Dear fellow Rushians,

Hey, hey!  16 days till graduation and I feel great!  HOw are you?  In
response to Aaron Calder's question reagarding which Rush album sounds
the most progressive--what do you mean exactly?  Are we talking
progressive in as far as they are akin to the progressive rock movement?
Now, call me stupid or whatver, but what in the hell does "progressive
rock" mean?  I do know that it is a common label shared by such bands as
King Crimson, Yes and Queen along with Rush, but what does the phrase
describe.  All of these bands had radically different styles from one
another.  What does it mean to be progressive?  Just to be around for
awhile and continually alter your sound?  What does it mean?  I'd
appreciate any answers, preferably private correspondence, or if any one
else out there in NMS land is as confused as I am, post it on NMS.
Until I find an answer, then I will give my opinion.

Thanks!

Palo

Yup!  I was there!  In fact, that date is the reason I will never go see
another show at Alpine again.  I was stuck in the parking lot there until
5am, 'cuz my idiot friend locked the keys to the car in the trunk.
(Believe me, we tried to get that back seat apart too.)

I guess I shouldn't say "never" 'cuz hey, if the boys DO tour anytime soon,
and they don't hit either venue here in Milwaukee (Bradley Center or Marcus
Amphitheatre) I will have to go see 'em at Alpine.  *sigh*

Anyway, just thought I would mention that.

Hola,
   Hey all Rushians !!  What a great band Huh?? I try to convince people who
really haven't heard Rush to give them a try :) They don't know what they're
missing.
Anyhow I liked a lot of the threads.  I saw rush during the Presto tour in
Jersey, The Meadowlands to be exact.  They most certainly played Presto and
Show don't tell.
I won the tickets from W. N. E. W.  in New York....Yeah!! 
   I also agree with the guy who said that Cold fire represents things that
have a kind of added sparkle to them in a relationship.  While the sparkle of
it's existence still remains it's now a cold fire i.e......the moonlight on
the bedroom floor, the diamond, the eyes, etc.......
    I also saw Rush on the TFE tour in Jersey again....yuk, I think I spend
too much time there.  Anyhow, Alex also did the same thing with the stooges.
It was hard to see from where I was.........I always sit on Geddy's side a few
rows up if I can, I have to see the professor at work you know.  He
disappeared for a while behind the set and now I know what He was up too.
Which brings me to my next and final story.
 The funniest thing I ever saw at a Rush show was the RTB tour.  This time in
the garden in NYC I was sitting in the same spot and about half way through
the set a young blond haired kid came out on Geddy's side behind the stage and
started shooting plastic darts at Alex.  They were whizzing right past Geddy's
face and landing really close to Alex.  From the looks of the kid I would say
it had to be one of Alex's sons.  After Alex realized what was going on He
bent down and put on of the darts in his mouth as Geddy was laughing at Him
and walked over to the side of the stage and threw it at the kid as the kid
shot another one that almost hit him square in the head.  Then the kid took
off.  It was pretty funny and damm nice to see the lighthearted humor. Well
thanks for the time, I enjoy the posts :)

For anyone considering purchasing  "A work in Progress" I would highly 
recommend doing so. I am not a musician and have a limited understanding of 
the associated terms etc. but these videos offer so much more than just 
Drumming/percussion instruction. They are well directed with intervals of 
Neil telling you his own insights and beliefs of how everything ticks 
within the group and outside of the group. There is footage of Neil growing 
up and some brief early footage of the band. 
   The main body of the videos is Neil playing and then breaking down each 
track from "Test For Echo". He explains how he developed his drum parts for 
each song and the factors that help to determined them. Hearing Neil speak 
his mind is worth the price of admission alone ! My own personal highlight 
is the practice routine segement where Neil demonstrates his warm up 
routines and shows where he experiments with new variations on these 
practice routines to help keep the practicing enjoyable. These vidoes where 
done in such a way that anyone can enjoy and come away with some new found 
knowledge about the Neil Peart,the band,and what is involved with making 
the awe inspiring music that we have all grown to love.

Hello Aaron and the rest of NMS,

I agree with the idea that Rush's real progressive albums are from the
1976-1980ish era.  However, I think a lot of people over look the redefininf
progressive-rock stance Rush kept in the 1980's!  Many big progressive acts
ceased to be progressive around the 1976-1980 period (except for King Crimson
rebounding with Discipline in '81)!!!!  Does anyone else agree?

For example: Yes - they went and put out "Tormato" (yuck) and "Drama" (very 
Rush-like despite)...slowly giviing in to pop....they then hit paydirt (in 
terms of giving in to pop) with "90125" (yuck).  Genesis had gone to "Abacab" 
and "Mama"

Around "90125"'s time, Rush had "Signals" and "Grace Under Pressure" out as 
new material....  These albums (MV included) are progressive in a lyrical 
sense, I believe, but probably not musically real progressive....except for 
maybe Tom Sawyer and The Camera Eye...
  in the 70's sense of the word (lots of changes in mood and time signatures).  

Go to 1985....1987....you have POWIND and HYF.  These albums
are very much "redefined" progressive with a splash of pop thrown 
in musically and lyrically.

BUT, HYF and POWIND are a new breed of progressive rock when compared to

the 1976-1980 run of Rush albums, in believe.  The 1976-1980 still allowed 
"Art Rock" to be a part of the progressive rock definition, IMHO.  The 1980's 
Rush worked at leaving Art Rock out and putting "radio-accessiblity" into 
progressive rock.

Really, if it had not been for Rush (and others to some extent) Dream Theater 
would have been harder to put together musically and even lyrically.

To sum up this messy post:

1976-1980:  Rush had "progressive music" in the truest sense with 
SMALL tinges of Crimson/Yes/Genesis....the Art Rock elements.....

1981-1987:  Rush redefined "progressive music" to mean heavey use
of keyboards and futuristic lyrics that would be accessible to many 
more....notice how Peart has used less "Shakespearian" lyricism in
the 80's-90's era and has now turned to "world/'human" issues to
directly portray his thoughts/opinions.

Still, this is all opinion, and don't get flustered by anything I have said
here...it's only opinion.  I just don't believe Rush truly defined "progressive
rock" in the 70's...they simply made it cooler with heavier guitar/ loud bass 
and the best drumming EVER.... their defining role really flourished later
(when they reached more people)...and after all those "wacko" art rock
groups kind of turned on their bellies...except for King Crimson ; ).
I constantly analyze the constant cycle of rise-fall-rise-fall of
progressive rock.

BTW, I have always believed Rush was out to make "Art Rock" a heavier kind
of music.  Yes and Genesis and even King Crimson (to some extent) sometimes
get too pansy-like for my tastes....too many flutes...too much soft-spoken 
passages....  >.....I LIKE TO ROCK....but with Peart's ever-thought-provoking
lyrics!!!!!  I think "Art Rock" is more or less dead by the way....thanks to 
punk, heavy metal, and Rush...

Does anyone have thoughts on the influence of King Crimson on Rush, BTW?

yeah!

Chris

ps.  You can't say Rush, Dream Theater, Voivod, Fates Warning, and Queensryche, 
etc are in the same genre.... but Rush did help get these other mentioned
groups out!!
