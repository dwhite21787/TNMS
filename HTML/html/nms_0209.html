The regular NMS for Tuesday, 4/9/91 was not actually mailed out until today
(Wed 4/10) due to a problem with the scripts which has been fixed.  We should
be back on a normal schedule today.  To test this theory, there should be two
mailings for today, this one and a special edition.

In NMS 207, Anand Rangarajan asked whether Neil "single stroked" or not.
Usually the term is used in relation to how a drummer does a roll - when each
stroke alternates hands, that's a single stroke roll.  I can't say I've ever
seen Neil do a single stroke roll.  In fact, I tend to believe the unevenness
of his buzz rolls is the only drumming weakness I've ever seen in Neil.

Now Anand might have been referring to the way most drummers will double up
the ride stick when playing some sixteenth notes on the hi-hat.  It isn't
much of a sin, but it is basically being lazy.  I've noticed that Neil almost
always slips his left hand over to do these parts in a single-stroke fashion.
It makes each of the strokes more even in volume and tone than if both were
played with the same hand.  I haven't studied his playing in person nearly
enough times (no, 5 is NOT enough!); but I see a pattern where whenever it's
possible to play a part with BOTH hands, Neil will do it that way.  Not only
does it SOUND better, but it makes him look like he's working harder...

As if it needed to be said - Neil Peart is the BEST drummer in the business.
Period...  (Don't come crying to me "But what about Greg Bissonette?  Or
maybe Alex Acuna?"  I don't want to hear it!!  Phil WHO?)  Has everybody
caught a glimpse of the light reflecting off his drum heads after a show?
Notice how all the stick marks fall into neat little circular areas in the
center of the head on each drum.  Let's talk about PRECISION now!  Has
anybody ever heard Neil hit a rim by accident?  I didn't think so...

Bon Jour!
   Could someone please post a translation of the French lyrics to
the song "Circumstances?"  I'd do it myself, but "Je ne parle pas
francais."

Merci

[ "Plus ca change, Plus c'est la meme chose"  roughly translates to "The
  more things change, the more they stay the same".  The translation is
  right after the French in the song.                          :rush-mgr ]

Mark Marcelissen in NMS #207 said that the band FM was the backup band for the
Ottawa "Power Windows" gig.  Would that be the British band "FM" (a la Dige
Digital on keyboards), or am I confusing this with another band?  Unfortunatly,
my copy of #207 died just after this comment, so please excuse me if you
explained this in you post.

     I am responding to a post by Liz way back in issue #200 which
inquired as to what the typical RUSH fan is like.  I doubt if this
will provide us with a psycological profile of the average ( if there
is such a thing ) RUSH fan, but it might prove to be interesting
none the less.  And besides I've been wanting to ask this for quite
some time now.
     The first time I saw RUSH live was on the Power Windows tour
in Seattle.  A close friend that introduced me to RUSH originally
was with me.  We were both pleasantly suprised when during the
beginning of the show they flashed a picture of the three stooges
on the screen.  Since we are both big fans of RUSH and THE STOOGES
we thought we would ask a few other hard-core RUSH fans that we
knew if they were really into THE STOOGES as well.  The criteria
I usually use to define a "hard-core" Rush fan is that the person
has at least ten RUSH albums.  It is a little more difficult to
narrow down what it means to really be into THE STOOGES.  In any
case what we found out was that all five of the other RUSH fans
we knew between us considered themselves to be hard-core STOOGES
fans too.  Could this be the common thread that joins us?
     If you are a serious RUSH fan ( by my definition ) please
let me know if you like THE STOOGES.  I will not tabulate the
results, and this should in no way be considered a poll.

Hi,there.

Yesterday,when I read an bootleg-catalog my eyes came upon a
record by Rush which I haven't seen before.I'ts called Electric,and
I am wondering if anyone (of course!) can tell me a bit about this record.
I'm not really an addict-collector,but if there are some interesting stuff
on it,I'll probably buy it.It's rather expensive,(for a student) but please
tell me if it's worth the 40$ it costs.Another interesting thing is that
it's mentioned in the catalogue as:

Rush                  Electric(studio)
                               ^^^^^^
What does this mean? Is it a studio-album that was withdrawn?
If that's a fact then I am REALLY interested.

[ This is probably referring to the Electric Lady(land) studio tape which
  was done as a promotion for their second album/tour.  It's got about
  eight tunes on it, and you can hear unfinished versions of "Fly By Night"
  and "Best I Can" (different lyrics).                           :rush-mgr ]

BTW,I also wonder if anyone can recommend any groups with fantasy-inspired
lyrics. (eg. Magnum,Led Zep.....etc.)I trust your musical taste and would
like some help.
Bye..

	Please forgive if this is a repost, but:

	I was analyzing the ol' posted Rush catalog and, keeping
	in mind that Neil claimed that no single was ever issued
	that didn't officially appear on an album, I realized that
	I have a single from the Power Windows era which has
	Territories b/w a live version of "Red Sector A".  The
	cover is actually a strange photo of Geddy choking Alex
	in some sort of "live" studio setting.  Red vinyl, too, now
	that I think about it.

[ This is a different version of a relesed single.  Neil was referring to
  singles not available on any Rush studio album.  There are several EPs
  released between the time of P/G and PoW; I know of about five. :rush-mgr ]

	Are there any other singles out there like this?  I'd really
	like to know what I'm missing.

Yeah......I'm from the Boston area and I'm going to try to make it to the
RUSH party at WPI (no guarantees as my scheudle is INSANE these days
> ...between Volly-ball, Chiors, bands rehearsals, and LP collecting, it can
get to be tooooooo much......but I like it that way). Anyway, I'm coming
from out from Marlboro (about half-way between RT128 and Worcester). It
would sure would be nice to go to something that is close by for a change :-)

	A few weeks ago Skarbo@wharton.upenn.edu announced that _SHE_
would host a Rush party in Philly.  Well, I twisted _HER_ arm enough
to let some of us bring musical instruments and try to play a couple
of tunes by the boyz.  This is a request for any musician that would
be interested in coming to Philly some weekend in May to jam.  If you'd
think you could make it, send mail to me at kdrenard@vms.cis.pitt.edu
and tell me what instrument you play (or could bring).  The date has been
set at 18 May.  Believe me, I am no Neil Peart, so don't be afraid or
discouraged.  Come on, it'll be fun!
