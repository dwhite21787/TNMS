Good day, ay,

well, it's been a while since i've posted.  busy at work, away for a
while, then even busier at work. anyway, just caught up with all the
digests, and i'd like to comment on some of the discussions i've
missed.  please forgive if any of these are old subjects.  and
forgive the length in advance, I missed a lot.

Background music on TV -- Entertainment Tonight.  they followed Keanu
Reeves (sp?) around Winnipeg while he was performing in a play there.
He's from Canada; he was performing in Canada.  What was playing
during this spot?   -->  what else? "Limelight".  YIPPEE!!

Opening bands -- of the 19 RUSH shows and over 40 other bands, the
single most best opening band (nice grammar) i've seen was the Steve
Morse Band when they opened for RUSH in Connecticut at the beginning
of the Power Windows tour.  We saw them on the 2nd and 3rd nights of
the tour.  they were actually better than the boys since they were
trying to get the bugs out of all the new technology at the time. of
course, when RUSH got around to the Meadowlands and the Spectrum
later in the tour, they kicked ass.  in fact, I believe this is
mentioned in Visions.  Stevie Ray Vaughn was also right up there when
he opened for Robert Plant at the Spectrum on the Now and Zen tour.

that CD/Video thing -- I remember some folks asking the condition of
The Big Money CD/Vid.  at that time I had never seen the video, but
the audio was always fine. well, my new neighbor has a laserdisc
player and offered to play.  we did.  it was perfect.  no snow, no
distortion, no nothing.  it could be those individual cd's of just
bad storage or care (no offense)

The change in lyrics and song length -- there was some discussion
about the fact that RUSH songs got shorter and the lyrics more
personal over the years.  Well, I remember some time around Signals
that they found it a challenge to them to write shorter songs -- to
get their point across, musically and lyrically, more concisely and
quicker.  Neil used to use broad symbols and characters to tell his
stories, hence side-long stuff.  But as he matured, his writing
matured as well, and he was able to more directly tell his story.
It's even mentioned in Visions a few times.  In talking about "Red
Barchetta", it was noted that "on an earlier album, that song
would've have taken up a whole album side".  The same thing was
stated about characters in the Analog Kid and Digital Man on Signals.
There was also a quote from Geddy: "It has become easy for us to
write long, complicated pieces of music, therefore, it's pointless to
do so."  Believe me, I love the old, long songs as much as the next
fan.  I'm just repeating what they've said in interviews.  I mean,
one my fantasies is to see the entire Cygnus epic done live start to
finish.

Better live than studio: Red Sector A and Force Ten on ASOH.

Fave solos: Between the Wheels, Limelight, Freewill,
Ghost of a Chance, Leave that Thing Alone.

And I have to agree with Mike Messina who, way back in
Digest 1071, said,"I'm having a hard time finding single female RUSH
fans to converse with. I've talked with other women about RUSH and
they look at me like I'm from another planet or something."  i've
been met by the same reaction.  any who would like to make contact,
please do.

The obligatory YKYAARFW:
you name your truck "Grace Under Pressure" (on the bug shield)
and your Jet Ski "Permanent Waves" (along both sides).  (did both)

you start playing Craps in AC just so you can "roll the bones".

well, I think thats it. (I know, that's enuff)
 sorry again for the length. i'll keep short next time.
"you guys have been great! we appreciate it!
we'll see ya again some time.  BYE BYEEE!"

Howdy all,

	On the idea of a possible Rush tribute, I must say that I have some
mixed feelings about the whole thing.  You see, it seems with every tribute
album, somebody like Bonnie Raitt does a classic and just screws it up hard
core so that no fan of the band covered can ever listen to that song again
and get the same thing out of it.
	However, there are some awesome covers on tribute albums, and there
are quite a few bands who could produce acceptable covers --- even of Rush
tunes.  So as you can see, I'm able to look at this both ways.
	Then I started thinking... who could do the Boys' tunes right and
who would screw them up?  So I concocted a list of what I think would be
appropriate tunes for appropriate bands, and then I threw together a list
of "other things" that you may have to use your imagination on...

	 -Right-					-Screwed Up-
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pearl Jam - "Jacob's Ladder"	   |		Rollins Band - "I Think I'm
				   |			Going Bald"
Yes - "Closer To The Heart"	   |
				   |		Tool - "Time Stand Still"
Neil Young - "In The End"	   |
  (w/ or w/o Crazy Horse)	   |		Megadeth - "Red Barchetta"
				   |
White Zombie - "Cygnus X-1"	   |		Bonnie Raitt - "Working Man"
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Those are JUST ideas stemming from me sitting here brainstorming
and saying, "Hey that might be cool," and "Man that would be putrid."  See,
some bands could do it, and others just wouldn't work out.  Any other ideas?

I'm rollin',

	First off speaking of t-shirts, are they out there in the mails yet?

	About all of this political stuff, why are we all getting so bent
over this?  Can't Neil, Alex and Geddy have the political beliefs they
want without everybody trying to interpret what they are from the music?
	I kknow when it comes to some issues I can be a real right
winger(ie. gun control) and on the other hand I can be very liberal
ie.(peace man, and and a hooah for gay rights).  Do I have to put myself
in a party?  If I did it would have to be called the mish-mash party!

	Finally, I have completed my rush music(studio) collection.  I
got hold your fire a couple of weeks ago, now I own all of their stuff on
either tape or cd.  (:  I can't wait for the new album  I hope its not
country;)
later,              Eric

<A NAME="1088304">From: Sabina Becker - JOUD/F94 <sbecker@acs.ryerson.ca></A>
<A NAME="1088003">Subject: Animated counterpart</A>

Well, I bought Counterparts yesterday...what a good record.  I totally
related to it.  I can now comfortably say that the Boys have a definite
pro-liberal stance in terms of lyrics (see Animate, Nobody's Hero, Alien
Shore, etc.)  And with that confidently in mind....

"Spit out your anger,
Don't swallow your tongue"...
Okay, Neil, I get the hint.  Let's take Gerard D's assertions, flip them
over and gut that very flabby underbelly.  Scalpel!

Says Gerard:  "I don't think those of us with sight should be blinded out
of 'fairness'".

Duhh!  No one said that had to be done, certainly not me.  It just means
the sighted should learn to exercise a little humility, and not take
their ability for granted, or as a mark of superiority.  The Oaks do just
that.  They think the "underlings", the Maples, should be grateful for
the shadows they cast, which is like saying the blind should be glad they
can't see.  And which is, by extension, like saying women should be glad
men dominate them, or that slaves should enjoy being "mastered".  And
since pride goes before a fall, the Oaks must lose a few limbs to learn
their lesson, since they couldn't overcome their arrogance and show the
Maples some respect.

Gerard: "God gave the oaks their height, for whatever reason.  Who are
the maples to take that away."

Ahem!  The maples aren't doing that much taking.  It's the hatchet, ax
and saw, remember?

And what is this about God?  Aside from my non-belief in that kind of
deity, I say that this "god-given" argument still smells like last year's
limburger.  Saying that God gave oaks their height is like saying we're
all born already full grown, with all faculties developed, and what we
get is what we're stuck with.  RUBBISH!  Our growth is influenced by
numerous other factors than genetics--it is a product of nourishment,
exercise, rest, and illumination, of body, mind and soul.  It is also
influenced by choice. "God" may have given me less to start with, but I
for one am determined to run farther with it than the ones born with the
bigger muscles and longer legs.  I am a late bloomer...so be it.  I will
bloom brighter, and stay that way longer.

Gerard snarks: "With such modesty, you're sure to go far in the world."

Why, thanks, and how perceptive of you to pick up on it.  For once you're
right.  I am sure to go far.  Just not as fast.  And not on anyone else's
terms.  Especially not yours.  False modesty might be your bag.  It is
not mine.

Also adds: "Who are you to judge the deadwood from the fruitful branch.
Are You God?"

Yes, as a matter of fact, I am!  Funny you should ask.  I was recently
promoted from Pope.  And now that I have a lightning bolt in my hand...

KERBLAM!!!!! <g>  Nice shot.  Burnt some real deadwood there.

And if you don't believe in using force, as you say, then why are you
trying to ram your odious ideas down my throat?  I thought I told you not
to go trashing other people's freely held interpretations all over a
forum for the discussion of art, and you've just gone and done it again!
You're just as arrogant as those bloody oaks!  Who died and made you the
expert?  (some expert!)

The people with all the "Big Money" haven't all earned it.  Some got it
by thievery, and others got it by selling big bullshit.  They have to
give some up because they took it from others.  Having a lot does not
give anyone the right to be an asshole.  Fairness hurts.  Face it, and
know that casting a shadow on others does not mean you earned the light.

As Neil's lyrics rightly observe, "Big Money got no soul".

And as some English poet (whose name I can't remember) said:
"Sceptre and crown
Must tumble down
And in the dust be equal made
With the poor crooked scythe and spade."

My parting salvo:

"I'm old enough not to care too much
About what you think of me
But I'm young enough to remember the future
And the way things ought to be"

There, now.  That oughtta lay it to rest...

'Bina.

Yo Rushies!

	Now that major league baseball is up and running again, I offer the
following rewording of Closer to the Heart in honor of the occasion. Maybe 
Geddy may prefer to sing these lyrics during the next Rush tour:

			Closer to the Start(er)

			The one who's making millions
			Must be the one to start
			But he can't win a ballgame
			Where's the closer to the start(er)?

			The catcher is an artist
			Keeping pitches in the park
			He's tired of chasing sliders
			Send in the closer to the start(er)!

			You can buy the peanuts
			The beer will be my part
			This guy who's making millions
			Shouldn't be the one who starts!

			Shouldn't be the one who starts!
			No!
			Shouldn't be the one who starts!

	OK, OK... I know I'm stretching it a little! But it does express my
sentiments quite nicely. GO ORIOLES !!!

Dino ("The Rock'n'Roll Dinosaur")

"Each of us, a cell of awareness
Imperfect and incomplete
Genetic blends with uncertain ends
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet."

     Well, I lived for a couple years in a northern Manitoba town in
which I associated with a small group of friends.  We partied
hard--and informally referred to ourselves as the "Wolfpack" ("If you
want to run with the wolves, you can't pee like a pup!").  One of the
many traditions we started was to head out to the lake (about 20 min
away from town--one of the top three clearest lakes in the world)
after closing time at the bar, and, as word spread, much of the bar
would follow us.  Invariably, we would have to intersperse the
festivities with a group howl, beer in hand, at the moon as it
reflected brightly off the water.  (We even had Tee Shirts made as a
joke when someone commented "What, are you like a club with jackets,
or something?" :-)
     Anyways, I take the line in "Between Sun and Moon" now the  same
way I did then (even though I don't carry on that way anymore):
Sometimes we need to let our hair down and go wild.

	Fall, 1982.

	The day was average. Then night fell....

	Matt was 16 - he had his license. I was 15. He drove.

	We had some time to kill before it would be "cool" to show up at
the dance - there was no hurry. We drove the red truck around the eastern
suburbs of St. Paul, exploring whatever street or avenue caught our
attention. My feet were on the dash, the windows were down and we were laughing.
In the stereo, we were listening to a tape that had "that Tom Sawyer song" on
it. This underscored our aimless tour. After the song that
ended, "....the underlying theme..", there was a moment of silence as we
anticipated what was to come.

	Strange sounds began to creep into the cab. It sounded
like car horns....and, typewriters?......this song was weird, or at least
 - different. A synthesizer explored a four note melody, punctuated by
guitar harmonics and drum fills. Finally all came together with a
crashing chord. We didn't speak.

	As the soaring unison guitar-bass melodies filled our ears, and
the soft spring rain fell like an English rain from a leaden sky, we
continued driving, knowing without speaking that this was one of those
moments. And as the trees passed and the autumn air blew in, we realized
that, if only for tonight, everything was perfect......

    I was watching the (very disappointing) Blackhawks game against the
    Dallas Stars yesterday. The Stars scored their second goal in the 3rd
    period (to make the score 2-0) and I started mentally tuning the game
    out. A fight broke out and the TV announcers actually shut up and let
    the cameras do the work. At that point, something about the background
    music being played through the stadium's PA system started tugged at my
    subconscious. It took me a few seconds to focus and realize that they
    were playing "The Spirit of Radio". I couldn't believe it. In Texas !!!
    At a hockey game !!!

    If any NMS subscriber in the Dallas area knows the person who selects
    the break music for the Stars games, give him or her a big pat on the
    back for me. Thanks. And, as a way of saying "thank you", why not offer
    a "gift" subscription to the NMS as a token of my appreciation?

    L8R

    YKYARF when a little bit of Rush, heard in the background of a hockey
    game, is the best memory you have of that game.

    <sigh> Are the Blackhawks EVER going to win another game this year
    without Jeremy Roenick? This is getting oooooollllldddd.

Hello, all!
I'm looking to add a few hard-to-find items to my Rush collection, and I
figured, this being a Rush mailing list and all, that this would be a good
place to start looking.....

Here's my list of wants:
 1) the "Through the Camera Eye" video
 2) the GUP tour video
 3) a fairly good-sounding recording of the 'Not Fade Away'/'You Can't Fight
    It' single
 4) any good bootlegs, especially ones from the "Rush," "Caress of Steel," or
    "Signals" tours, or ones which have Cygnus X-1 (books 1 and 2), Natural
    Science, and/or The Camera Eye on them

I have a few cool items to trade, so if anyone has any of the above and the
wherewithal to make copies, send me e-mail, I'll send you a list of what I
have, and we'll see what we can work out.....

Hello all,

	I, like all of you, have been reading different opinions about Neil's
personality.  Here's my take on the situation:

	Neil knows what's going on.  He understands the kind of fame he
possesses and understands how to handle it.  He cherishes his privacy - don't
we all?  Here's what I think,

  "Neil's probably the coolest guy who would want nothing to do with you."

Hi all,

     In response to Kathy Dittrich's last post:

>Oh yeah, and NO ONE should open for Rush on their next tour.
     >Instead, they should open for Michael Bolton. So there.

You're kidding right? Why would anyone want to see Michael Bolton and Rush
on the same night?  That's fine if you happen to like Bolton, but they are
two completely different performers.  Bolton is pop and Rush is rock.  I
thought Primus opening for Rush was bad, but Bolton and Rush together?  On
the Primus note, I never thought it was possible to listen to the most
untalented band and the most talented band in the same night.  It was awful!
 But at least it made Rush's appearance just so much better.

And to Bill Sheridan regarding "The Camera Eye":

     I agree, Camera Eye is a great song.  I especially love how Geddy's
voice seems to jump an octave on lines like:

     "...an angular mass of New Yorkers."

Great vocal technique!

This was an organized tour because they did some Canadian dates with Motley

Apparently the band resent being constantly compared to Rush. They are not
"very RUSH influenced" although their music has many of the same sort of
qualities, which makes them appealing to many Rush fans. I doubt they will
ever open for Rush, although Neil has said (can't remember where) that he
did think they were a good band and they are managed by Ray Daniels at SRO
here in Toronto.

> These guys are getting screwed over!

It depends what you're objectives are. They continue to have a die-hard
fan following continent wide, and they prefer to play awesome small club
shows, as you mentioned for the Gretchen and the FHL tours, and as I can
concur with for the Dogman tour. I don't think they want to become the
stadium rock band giants Rush are.

I don't know about that....

I was just talking the other day with a friend of mine about King's X
opening for Rush and we both came to the same conclusion - they're one of
a select few that would blow Rush away on stage.  Rush are tight, that's
true, but King's X are just as tight plus they actually *harmonize*
(they don't have Alex mumbling a few words every once in a while so
they can be edited out on the ASOH CD).  But it would be one helluva
show....  Same goes for Dream Theater [I know there are some people that
actually hate DT - there's no accounting for taste :)].  They are incredible
live as long as Kevin decides he's going to stay in check and try to
actually _sing_ some of the songs.

Anyway, my point is that even though Rush are awesome, there are some bands
I wouldn't want to see open for them simply because I think it would be
beneath them.  King's X and DT should be headlining shows, not opening up
for Rush.  Let the wannabes like Candlebox continue to open up so that
Rush look even better.  When Candlebox opened up at the Chapel Hill, NC
show for Counterparts, the singer said "OK, folks, this is our last song"
and the crowd just went crazy with the cheering.  I kinda felt bad for
them.  Then Rush came out and proved how a real band should play.  I
don't think Rush could show King's X or DT anything about playing live.

Of course, I wouldn't mind being proven wrong by actually seeing such a
show....

Rush fans,

        This is my first contribution to NMS, in case you care.

        I noticed two issues ago someone asked for feedback on groups that
Rush fans enjoy other than the power trio.  Let me first say that Rush is
my favorite band.  I have been listening to them since I heard "The Spirit
of Radio" four years ago in my friend's car.  Rush opened my ears to
classic rock and rock in general.  Here are some of my other favorites.

         -Joe Walsh: This guy is not an average guitarist, and his work
with The James Gang is really cool. (Funk #49, Walk Away, etc.)

        -Pink Floyd: The best effects in concert (yes, better than Rush)
that I have ever seen.  Plus David Gilmour is the trippiest guitarist
alive.

        -Peter Frampton: I know many people think he is too 70's, but if
you see him play "Do You Feel Like We Do?" live, you would be amazed.

        -Here are some others: Neil Young, The Eagles, Steely Dan, Pearl Jam,
                               Eric Clapton, Led Zepplin, Michael Stanley Band

        Also, I have a question about my recently purchased "Signals" cd.
What is the relevance of the map of the subdivision?

Does anyone out there know of any scheduling of music trade shows touring at 
the moment.  This seems to be a "stroke of luck" thing.  I went to a trade show
a couple years (more like 5) and found some great Rush stuff from guys who 
either were looking soley for money or serious traders looking for something 
better (I don't know how a autographed backstage pass from HYF would seem like 
dead weight).  The guy would only trade for it (no cash) and i had nothing 
better to offer for it.

So, not with standing that, if your local to Houston (even in the state for 
that matter) drop me a line and inform me!

Well, i'm sorry that i forgot who everyone was that asked for this...but, a
friend and i went ahead and solved that little problem of the guitar music over
the bridge right before Alex's solo in The Trees. This is specifically the
section that starts right at Neil's cymbol roll after the second windchime.
This is roughly halfway through the "quiet" section before the solo.

In 5/4 time, played as straight eight notes...

|------------------------------|----------------------------|

the best way to play this is to keep your index finger anchored to the 11th
fret and use your middle finger for the 12, and use your pinky for the 14. this
has a really funky feel to it, but once you get it down...you'll be doing it
in your sleep. the part that gave me the most trouble was the movement from the
12th to the 14th fret in the second pattern (it all feels like one big up beat
to me ;-). for a better idea of how to do this...watch the close ups of Alex's
hands on Chronicles or Exit...Stage Left videos.

Johnson/McGee PRB in TNMS #1085 asks about the pronuncation of "La Villa
Strangiato".  The letter combination "gia" is (in my limited experience)
unique to the Italian language (although "Strangiato" is not an Italian
word).  This would mean the correct pronunciation is
/la/ (like the musical note)
/vil-la/ (pronouncing the "l" as in English)
/stran-gia-to/ (pronouncing the "gia" as one syllable, and a "soft" g sound,
as in "gee").
The grammar also is consistent with Italian.
Hope this helps.
BTW, this does not mean RUSH would pronounce it this way.  Another song,
"Red Barchetta", is mispronounced even on the album.  The car is made by
Maserati, and I have heard talk that Ferrari will build one soon by this
name, so obviously this _is_ Italian.  It it pronounced /bar-ket-ta/.
It means "small boat", literally.
This is not meant to criticize RUSH in any way -- I guess they just don't
speak Italian!

Okay, I've been reading the NMS for the better part of a month, so now it's
time to post. First, the obligatory "don't flame me" plea and bio: I first
heard of rush when K-ROCK in New York City did an interview with the boys
after RTB came out. I still wasn't sure that I liked what I heard till a
friend played Hemispheres for me. I have since purchased Hem, 2112, PeW, FBN,
ATWAS, and ESL. (PeW and FBN on vinyl, the best format in the world, IMHO).
The urge to post a response came when someone in NMS #1085 asked how to
pronounce La Villa Strangiato. As I recall, Geddy announced the song on ESL as
"La Villa Strahnjato" (with the l's in "Villa" pronounced.)
By the way, has anybody ever had an embarrassing moment mis-hearing Rush
lyrics? I still wanna crawl into a hole when I think about how I sang "A
parade of mutants fill our hallowed halls" from 2112, and I'm still convinced
that the line is "If you choose not to decide, you still HAVE made a choice"
from "freewill" (the rest of the lyrics on the lyric sheet seem to be
accurate, tho'...I never figgered out what the fuss was about). Anyhow, take
care and be well.

I've never played a lick of guitar in my life, but I'm glad to hear
someone who knows a bit more about music than I do admires Alex's
playing!  Poor Alex seems to be the underrated member of the band.
I've always thought that Alex had the most interesting solos of anyone
in rock.  I've always liked Eddie Van Halen, too.  VH is, of course,
known for the sheer speed and "innovativeness" of his playing, but I
think Alex has always been better at expressing the mood of a song in
his solos; well, at least since the 2112 album.  By the way, doesn't
it sound like Alex is doing some "VH-like" hammer-ons on "Cut to the
Chase?"

Eric Johnson is really close, I think.  His solo on "High Landrons"
sends chills up my spine, which is my true measure of a guitar
player's talent.  My other favorite players are Mark Knopfler, the
late, great Stevie Ray Vaughn, and Eric Clapton.  There's one guy,
though, that can just about bring tears to my eyes:  B.B. King!!

I have a couple friends who are accomplished guitar players, and they
agree with you, Tony, that the most remarkable thing about Alex is
that ability to turn on a dime from lead to rhythm guitar.  I really
like the chord solos that he's done, especially on Grace Under
Pressure (when he won the Guitar Player of the Year award).

Here're my favorite Alex solos:

	1) Emotion Detector
	2) Ghost of a Chance
	3) Free Will
	4) Kid Gloves
	5) Lock and Key

well, let's see.  i think that in all of the great drummers ever known
throughout this world...the best has been overlooked...he's not with us
anymore but it was a guy who could make a 5 piece set sound like a 25
piece set.  i had the priveldge of seeing him in concert some time back.
his name?  BUDDY RICH...though i'm not much for the big band scene, he kix
ass. for those of you young folks who might not have
heard of him...i suggest you pick up a cd and get ready for a lesson.
and please, no more neil bashing...he plays great...but also writes
great...not many combos like that around...that's my 2cents.
