Hi there,

    Just a quick request:

    Now that it's getting to the end of the semester and accounts have a
    way of changing or going away.  If you know your address will change,
    *please* send me mail at the 'rush-request' address in advance.  It
    makes my life much easier, and I don't have to worry about mail from
    sysadmins informing me that the account I've been bombarding with mail
    is disabled/deleted.

    If you're going away for an extended break, and you run the risk of
    having your mailbox fill up (and start bouncing mail), please consider
    dropping off and re-joining when you get back.  I'd much rather take
    the extra 5 minutes twice than deal with a month's worth of 'mailbox
    full' messages.  Everyone gets a few gratis, then I get tired of it
    and end up removing them anyway.

    Lastly, remember that all important addresses are at the end of *every*
    digest.

Editor,

	With all the advances in electronics in the past years,
music has joined the computer age too with sampling.  It's a real
neat idea to have control over any sound you wish to record with
electronics.  Imagine the studio during the recording of YYZ on
Moving Pictures after the 6th take.  There would be broken glass
all over the place without sampling.

First of all, I'm actually NOT Mr. Peart.  But I thought I'd do this just to

Rush fans are starting to get restless and bored.  Face it, I CAN'T WAIT

I recorded IN THE STUDIO from the radio, I believe, around the time

But I'm not sure when the interview took place; unfortunately,
no mention was made during the interview. Sorry. (I've often

I think most of us could care less about people's opinions towards
rap and sampling and pentagrams or whatever else. Most of us, I'm
sure, would rather read stories that are insightful and different.
And most of all-- articles that deal with Rush and their music.
It makes reading the National Midnight Star a learning experience.

Ok, folks:

I promise this is the *last* I'll ever say about sampling.

I was glad to see the article in NMS #115 about the *true* "Sampled Sawyer".
Figures, the rumors about it got all out of proportion.  I think I'll try to
get the local pop (read "garbage")/top 40 station to play it tonight.  Faint
as "Hip Hop Creature"'s connection with Rush may be, it still may have a place
in my Rush archives, along with "Take Off" and other such things.

I agree that these sampling discussions are getting a bit out of topic for
this list.  Anyone want to start rec.rock-n-roll.sampling.guys.who.cant.sing.
but.like.to.steal.other.music ?

Rushically yours,

I don't remember it....maybe....but he did carry drums around in a trash can or
something when he went to the audition. I think Alex made a remark about
it in some interview. Geddy was in a band called "Hush" (pretty sure it was
Geddy) before they formed Rush.

Also, RUSH had a keyboardist at one time during their bar days, but it didn't
work out.

Dave Kehrer asked what Broon's been up to lately.  Well, he did produce IQ's
last (in more than one sense of the word) album in 1988:  "Are You Sitting
Comfortably?"  Genesis/Marillion fans might like older IQ (not produced by
Broon), while Rush fans might like the later stuff...

Last night I went to the Smithereens concert here at Brandeis (as the
medical standby, so I got in free ;).  I don't claim to know a lot
about music, but I thought I'd mention a couple of things I noticed
about the opening band, Carry Nation.

	One of the backup singers played a violin through most of the
opening act...  she seemed to be pretty much destroying it.  If you
think Alex Lifeson breaks a lot of strings, you should have seen the
bow hairs hanging off the violinist's bow!  It was very funny.

	The other thing I wanted to mention was about the drummer.  He
seemed to be hitting the drums extremely, perhaps even EXCESSIVELY
hard...  to the point that one of his drum sticks broke into three
pieces and flew all over the place.  Anyone ever seen something like
that happen to Neil?  BTW, the drummer wasn't very interesting to hear
or watch...

Greetings RUSHans--

I noticed something odd recently while looking at the FAQL.  It said that Ged's
real name was (and I quote), "Gary Lee Leibovitz".  I have heard from variouys
others that his name is Gary Weinrib.  I'm not bashing Dan (good job on the
List, Dan!), I'm just curious as to the source of that information.  I'm going
to check my main source tonight at Rocky, but I'd appreciate it if someone
could let me know where Leibovitz comes from (if someone says Poland, I'll
KILL)

"Peace and save the planet!"

Right..  I managed to break a string on my BASS last year during a gig...
That's something you definitely don't need.  Alex went through the entire
Cincinatti show I saw without breaking a string or switching axes.

Right, it's both.  They've got two sets of pedals (I THINK, someone correct
me if I'm wrong here), one for bass/synth lines and one for MIDI effects,
samples, triggering sequences, etc etc..  At least that would make sense...
I too heard the 'show me don't tell me' sample, mainly because Alex
triggered it just slightly late (oops! :-)

I was watching for that.  They all seem to have the same outfit for both

<A NAME="117013">> Subject: bunnies & guitar duels on the Presto tour</A>

My 2 cents: at Cincinatti: bunnies inflated from the two hats on the stage.
Sat there for a few songs, then danced a bit during Tom Sawyer.. (pretty cool,
I thought!)  No guitar duels with Paul Gilbert (Mr. Big), and most depressing,
no scantily clad bunnies appearing on stage :-(  I think it was the last two
weeks of the tour, so maybe they were winding down the act a bit..  I dunno.

Okay, and now a question: does anyone have a good rundown of what MIDI
stuff the boyz are using, in particular what keyboards/tone modules Ged
is using?  I know they started with a Minimoog and Mood Taurus bass pedals,
then he got an Oberheim, then around p/g time he went out and got a lot of
new stuff when Neil got his Simmons kit..  I think I saw a Roland D-50 on
the ASoH video, and I know Neil's Simmons are hooked to an Akai S900 sampler,
but does anyone have a full rundown of what they're using nowadays?

I'd like to get some recommendations from the guitarists out there
on Rush sheet music.  My sight reading is pretty lousy so I'm more
interested in tablature formatted music and 'fake' books, i.e. the
ones which just have the generic chords.  I've seen a few Rush
music books at record stores and was wondering how good they
were.

I've picked up a few songs from back when I subscribed to the
magazine 'Guitar for the Practicing Musician'.  They always seemed
to have pretty good transcriptions in tablature.  My subscription
ran out a while ago so I don't know what's been in there recently
by Rush, if anything.

I've only been on the NMS list for a few weeks so if this topic
has already been thrashed about and summarized, someone please
just send me a note saying so.

Thanks,
Pat

I know that this has nothing to do with Rush, but it does have
something to do with the current sampling discussion.

I believe someone brought up some "samples" of Owner of A Lonely
Heart by Yes. Are you referring to the "dance mixes" of several
of their songs? If so, they were done in conjunction with at
least one member of the band(Trevor Rabin, i believe)--I believed
he co-produced and engineered the "mixes". They aren't very
good, and in no way reflect Yes, but they were legitimate.

Sorry for the digression...

all you Bay Area Rushians, get some groups together and GO!

Shows are Friday and Saturday at 7:30 and 9:00, Sunday at 5:00.  Tickets

In the last digest, dwk@sunsrvr2.cci.com (Dave Kehrer) asked...

"I was wondering if any of you out there knows what Terry (Broon) Brown's
been up to lately."

Last year (1989) he produced an album by the British progressive-rock-type-
band iQ (sadly now disbanded, I think :(

iQ were on the Squawk record label, which if my memory is correct was run
by Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch, both of whom have been mentioned in the
'thank you's on various Rush albums.  I heard that Rush wanted iQ to open for
them on the HYF tour in London, which would have been great, but they
couldn't book them as they weren't on the promoter's lists.  Rush had no
opening act that time.

I think Squawk records has gone bust, too.
