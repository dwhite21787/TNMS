This will probably be the last NMS until at least Wednesday, 12/26, if
not later in the week.  I'll try to get a couple issues out next week
sometime, though. 

Happy Holidays everyone!

<A NAME="139302">From: RUSH Fans Digest Manager <rush-mgr></A>

Have there been any occurances of members sending mail to the "rush@syrinx"
address, and not having it show up in an issue within a day or so?  This
doesn't count long articles, etc. sent to the rush-request address, or
things that I removed & sent you mail about (there's about two of these
in the last year).  I'm referring to general posts to the list.

If this has happened, please send me mail letting me know when you sent
it (to the day), and if you received any strange mail messages in relation
to it (bounce mail, or similar things).  Send any mail of this sort to me
here (rush-request@syrinx.umd.edu), not to the list alias, please.

Thanks,

The source for 'xloadimage' is now available from Syrinx.  This is the
full tar file of version 2.02, "Copyright 1989 Massachusetts Institute
of Technology".

It is a compressed tar file, and requires a binary ftp transfer (unlike
the raster images themselves).  Once it's transferred, just do the
following:

    % uncompress xloadimage.2.02.tar
    % tar xvf xloadimage.2.02.tar
    % make

Once it's done, you can toss all the .c, .h, and .o files - this will
leve you with just the executable, the makefiles, and a couple other
informational files.

Thanks to Chris Craig and Dave "Louie" LaPlant for their help.

Enjoy!

FAVORITE ALBUMS:
        My favorite Rush album is the one that's playing.

RANDOM RUSH GENERATORS:
	Last summer, I wrote about a Random Rush Generator in the
digest: ...on SunOS (converged Berkeley and SysV Unix), there's a program
called 'random' in /usr/games that I use in the following alias:

   alias rush 'cat ~/info/text/rush.txt | /usr/games/random 50'

where "~/info/text/rush.txt" is the pathname to the lyrics file and
"random 50" is a text filter that randomly selects lines with the
specified probability.  Typing "rush" gives a random sample of Rush
lyrics; inevitably some Rush song then starts playing in my head.

	The problem here is that "random" may not be available on all
systems, so since then I've written (with help from public domain
source code) my own random number generator (in C, since not everybody
has a compiler for Ada, the language of choice :) that displays good
randomness and have incorporated it into various "quote generators"
(mail me about the Twin Peaks Quote Generator (TPQG) if you're
interested).

	The Random Rush Generator only works on lyrics right now, but
the TPQG could be adapted for Rush quotes quite easily.  Just need the
quotes, as Jimmy Lang says.  And we have ample material to select
from, given the copious quantities of excellent articles that have
appeared in the /V /V\ _|`.  I'm willing to send the source to anybody
who wants it; just e-mail me.  (You'll need a C compiler and a C shell
interpreter.)

OTHER MUMBLINGS:                    ***

                             Seasons Greetings
                                    and
                              Happy New Year

    A couple of items to add to the Seldomly Asked Questions List (SAQL):

        SAQ #6,337,243:
            Q: Which Rush Album has the most occurrences of the word "water"
               in it?
            A: Hold Your Fire.

        SAQ #6,337,244:
            Q: How many times does the word "water" occur on the Rush album
               Permanent Waves?
            A: Zero.

    Well since everybody kept asking...

#end ;) ;) ;)

  Autumn woods and winter skies
  To the endless winter night
  To face a world of cold reality
  Not so coldly charted, it's really just a question
  and I take myself out a nice, cold beer.

	Someone mentioned that RUSH was featured on the
King Biscuit Flower Hour and wanted to know if anyone
taped it.  Well, I did.  Sorry I don't remember who
wanted it.

<A NAME="139006">Subject: FAQL/Mail didn't like each other!</A>

I just want to mention this to avoid confusion.  A line got dropped from the
most revent posting of the FAQL.  It was caused by my starting a line with
a ~ character and then saying

mail rush-request@syrinx...  < faql

This caused mail to assume that that line contained a tilde escape.  Here's
a reformatted version of the offending section of the file:

>   If you want a copy of the current version of this file, email me and
>I'll send you the most recent version.
>
>(Polyslo users: look in ~ddelany/Info/faql - it's world readable!)

(Boy, that's embarrassing!)  Sorry if this caused any trouble.  (I know it
did - I already got email about it...  :-) )
