Hi everyone...I hate to make this post, but its long overdue!
The now infamous CD, will not be produced in the near future due
to my contact in San Antonio wimping out on me! (If you are reading
this, you should be ashamed!).  Basically I was ready to shell out
all the cost in producing this thing, you my contact stopped writing
me back!  Oh well maybe he will change his mind after he reads this..
C'mon Robert!

Now for good news...I have a new idea that can be implemented easily!
How about a video?  I have quite a few live video shows...And some
of them are of extremely good quality!
I have a few proponents......

Reno '92
---------
I have previously review this show. All I have to say that this
show is a second generation (from the people that taped it!).  Its
recorded in Hi-fi and it rivals OTE as far as sound quality!  The
picture if full of color, and the video screen are seen perfectly.
This show is simply amazing, and the performances are very memorable (
the best that I heard from the last tour..and I heard many shows!)
Its 130 minutes, and it has the Trees, The Analog Kid, and Vital Signs.
My favorite show to watch.

Madison Square Garden '91
-------------------------
This show was professionally shot, with a tripoid.  No people to interfere
or anything.  It has some awesome close ups, and you can see PERFECTLY
how Geddy and Alex play their instruments...Excellent shot.  The one
and only problem with it....Its shot a bit too dark..sound is also
hi-fi, very good.  This show is very good if you want to closely
figuare out how Geddy plays all those notes!

I figure a fair price would be $15 including postage.  I have two hi-fi
vcrs...so I could do it myself, or pay a video duplicating company to
do it.
I also have some other good shows..lets start discussing what everyone
wants to see...like a greatest hit video where I can take picture clips
from every tour starting with the SIGNALS tour!!!!!!

Thought you folks might be interested in this tidbit from the
mainstream media - it's from "Pop Notes," a regular column by
Cliff Radel, The Cincinnati Enquirer's music critic, 1/6/92:

  -----beginning of article (bad pun in headline not mine)-----

                  PLANETARIUM IN RUSH FOR SHOW
      Band places first in poll for next laser rock concert

   The people have spoken. Rush is the winner.
   That's the result of the Cincinnati Museum of Natural
History's telephone poll for the next rock and laser show at the
planetarium.
   Caller's to the museum's 345-8505 number voted for one of five
candidates whose music they wanted to hear paired with a laser
light show. The polls closed Tuesday with the votes going to:
Rush, 23; Led Zeppelin, 17; Yes/Genesis, 16; Depeche Mode, 3;
U2, 2. Even though they were not on the ballot, the Grateful Dead
received six call-in votes.
   Armed with these results, planetarium director Dave Duszynski
is looking into booking shows starring the music of Rush, Led
Zeppelin and a tag team of Yes and Genesis.
   "I'll talk with Laser Fantasy (producers of the planetarium's
shows)," Duszynski says, "and pick a combination of titles that
they have been successful with and ones that will work in
Cincinnati."
   The planetarium's current laser-rock show, Pink Floyd's _Laser
Floyd: Welcome to the Machine_, runs through Jan. 17. For
tickets, call 749-4949.
   Duszynski will announce the new laser lineup Jan. 13 in time
for a Jan. 22 opening at the Gilbert Avenue facility.

    --------------------(end of article)--------------------

Needless to say, I do plan to participate in this cultural event.
I suspect this is the same outfit that did the Rush laser show in
Michigan (?) that was highly recommended by someone on TNMS a few
months back. Also, I saw the Floyd show a coupla weeks ago, and
it was awesome enough that I'd definitely plunk down the same
$6.50 to see Rush.

If anyone within driving distance of Cincinnati is interested in
taking in this esteemed production, I'd be happy to provide
further info (such as directions to the planetarium) - and maybe
even a free place to crash, if you need it and your timing is
right.

Anxiously awaiting my NMS T-shirt (dammit),

Hi there,

Firstly, concerning the Ryhthm Method score. It is available in Britain in the
A Show of Hands music book (it might the tab book, though, I can't remember -
it's a long time since I looked at it).

Secondly, does anyone know where in England, (particularly Bristol or
Sheffield) where it is possible to buy Rush boots. I'd love to get hold of Over
the Europe, but I just don't know where to go.

Thanks for listening.

Hey everyone!!!

In yesterday's edition the issue of whether or not the drum parts are part of
the music was brought up.  Last December, when Neil was on Rockline he was
asked this very same question and he said that he does not feel that he should
get credit for the music because the percussion parts are not really a part
of the actual music.  When asked if this bothered him he said, "No."

See ya!!!

BTW, has anything heard anything about a Van Halen release this month???  I was
in Camelot music and there new music board had Van Halen listed under January.

OK.  I am ready to shell out the $50 or so Over The Europe is supposed to
cost.  What I need now is the location of a store here in the Washington DC/
Northern Virginia area that has the sucker.  I'm relatively new to the area,
so if anyone can help me on this one, I'd surely appreciate it.  Thanks
in advance!

<A NAME="593007">Subject: Geddy's best bass lines</A>

Greetings fellow Rush fans!
   To Benkamin Bowles Nevile (I hope I spelled your name correctly,this is
how it appeared in your post):
   Freewill is not simple. This not just my opinion, I have friends who
are bass players that have agreed with me.
   I agree with you on YYZ being very difficult to learn. However, once
you get the hang of it, it seems simple.
   I don't agree with you on Turn the Page. Give a good listen to it.
Have you listened to The Analog Kid yet?  The triplets are a killer.
They were meant to be guitar riffs.
   Email me to respond.

    I originally sent this part of the post in December when most people
were on vacation.  So, for those of you who missed it here it is:

    I thought an interesting topic to discuss would be Geddy's best bass
lines.

    I am a bass player and I have been playing for 10 years now.
Rush has been my main musical influence, obviously.
   Over the years I have learned to play Geddy's bass lines,
some of them were difficult, some were not so difficult.
Here is my list of the most difficult in order of decreasing difficulty
(1 being the most difficult):

1.) The analog kid (those amazin' triplets)
2.) FreeWill (during solo)
3.) La Villa Strangiato (bass riff,VI - The Ghost of the Aragon)
4.) YYZ (some of the bass riffs)
5.) The Big Money (some of the riffs)
6.) Marathon
7.) Show Don't Tell (during solo)
8.) Where's My Thing? (some of the riffs)

    I think it would be interesting to hear from other bass players
or Rush fans what they feel are Geddy'd most difficult.

Well, that is all for now gotta gooooooooooooooooooooo!

I agree completely with Will Geeslin's assessment of Alex Lifeson as a
guitar player. Sure there are a lot of technically better players like
Eric Johnson, Steve Morse, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Nuno
Bettencourt (just to name a few), but how many of them do you think
can survive as rock musicians in the same band for 20+ years and still
crank out high-quality music? Alex Lifeson balances technical ability
with musical songwriting to create great music. And of course, it
doesn't hurt when he can combine his efforts with such talents as
Geddy Lee and Neil Peart. The result is a trio whose musical sum is much
greater than the individual parts. Their partnership for so long in an
industry plagued with image-conscious and money-grubbing rock stars
and record executives never ceases to amaze me. They are an oasis in
the middle of a music entertainment desert!

<A NAME="593010">Subject: boot cd prices</A>

Hi there (again!)

	In the boot cd thread...there has been discussion of price
ranges and "am I getting ripped off by this?..." questions lately.
Just a little advice:

the lowest I've seen double-disc cd boots go for has been $45.00
the lowest I've seen single disc cd boots go for has been $25.00

  [ I've seen a single disc boot for $20 at a record convention.  : rush-mgr ]

	I (personally) wouldn't pay more than this (or at least not
more than $5.00 over each price) because you can always find these
"lowest possible prices" if you look around a little...LOOK IN
GOLDMINE!

	I , by no means, profess to be an expert...but these are the
lowest prices I have been able to find.  If anyone has seen
lower...please let us know!

	Anyway, I hope this helps someone avoid being reemed!

<A NAME="593011">Subject:      music publishing</A>

The "music" credits are attributed to who composes what would be on sheet
music.  Drum parts are not notated as such.  Yes, there is drum notation but
I'm refering to the music publishing, or who gets the cash.  It is my under-
standing that a record company pays its artist for two things:  performance
and publing rights (or the right to produce, or publish, their original
works).  For example, Hason Newsted of Metallica would get a performance pay-
ment for the song "Enter Sandman" but not a publishing payment since he did
not write the song.  This notion of who writes the song is determined by the
artist(s).  Van Halen, for example, split publishing and performance four equal
ways, although Eddie writes the majority of the material.  They agreed
in the befinning to do so.  Metallica, however, do not.  They split publishing
by who gets the writing credit.  I don't know if Rush split publishing accord-
ing to who gets writing credit or three equal ways.  Does anyone know?  If I
have said anything that is incorrect please enlighten me because I find this
very interesting.  By the way, does anyone know anything about the next Rush
album?  I got a press release from Atlantic that said they were "hard at work"
on it.
