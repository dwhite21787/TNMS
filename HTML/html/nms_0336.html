<A NAME="336001">Subject: RTB and a nifty new poll!</A>

Hey all!

  Like everyone else, I figure I might as well express my thoughts on RTB.
First of all, I must agree that Rush did a good thing by trying something
new and different by not releasing a rehashed 2112 or MP or whatever.
  Secondly, although I am not at all a fan of rap music, I do enjoy Rush's
version in Roll the Bones.  I think it does fit well and I especially like
the fact that there is still music behind the "rap."
  Overall, however, although I think the album may grow on me, I feel like
RTB is lacking something.  That something is the powerful instrumental
sections of Rush's past work.  I believe this is a result of Rush's recent
switch to 4-5 minute songs.  Although I am pleased with the guitar-
orientation of the album, I really miss the prominence of Ged's bass.
  One final point is that I **REALLY** like Where's My Thing? and it does
remind me of old Rush in the respect that all three instruments are
prominent and there are a few times changes.  The only differences I find
between Thing? and Rush's previous instrumental masterpieces are the
great presence of keyboards and the short length of the song.

  Now for something new and different (and non-RTB)! :-)
I've been wondering what all you Rush fans listen to besides Rush, and I
think it'd be great to know your favorite non-Rush players.  Please note
that the word _favorite_ does NOT necessarily mean _best_.  You can cast
your votes for up to 5 musicians for each category.  I have listed what
I believe to be the 5 most prominent pieces of music:
(1) vocals, (2) guitars, (3) basses, (4) keyboards, and (5) drums.
Please list each member and band as there will surely be many quality
musicians who are relatively unknown.  Vote soon and I'll leave you with
my votes.

By the way, make sure you rank your players accordingly as points will
be awarded according to position.  (5 pts. for 1st, 4 for 2nd, etc.)

Those of you Rush fans who are also Simpsons fans know what I mean...

My brother came up with the same idea (independently) as Ron K.'s girlfriend
last week, that the elephant is there because ivory from elephant tusks was
used to make dice.  He wanted me to give him credit where credit was due.

Also,forgive me if this has been said already:

To the guy who kept asking why the rap was in "Roll The Bones":

	WHY IS IT THERE?  BECAUSE IT'S THERE.  ROLL THE BONES.

First off, I'd like to say thanks to everyone for keeping this digest
interesting to say the least.  Now, however, I must stray from the
content of this digest to ask a necessary question that will bear
significant impact on my existence as an "internetter"

The University of Pennsylvania will soon be taking away my access to the
internet (I'll still have my account here, but I just wont be able to
dial in to the net).  What I need to know is if anyone out there knows
of any dialups (anywhere in the US!) that have anonymous access to
telnet capabilities so I can still use my UPenn account here.  Much
thanks in advance to those who can help.  I remember something on the
"TERMINUS.MIT.EDU" that would allow me to do this, but I have since lost
all of my information regarding that.  Thanks... and sorry for wasting
valuable space.

It's the week after my birthday, and it's a Friday.  2 reasons for me to go.
(Actually, living in Buffalo is a pretty good 3rd reason.)  8)

He did look younger in the Presto pic, but I think he still looks the
youngest of the three.

Hmm...on the RTB CD Launch, Ged and Alex said it wasn't Rupert.

Personally, I don't think RTB sounds a whole lot like _Presto_.  I like
all of their albums for different reasons, and even though some of the
stuff on the new disc isn't that innovative, there certainly *isn't* a
lack of energy on the album.

>                                         Alex seems to have one
>setting on his guitar and pedals: bright and metalic.  There is no

Not necessarily true.  Although his higher rhythm work is very bright
sounding, I think his riffs have a nice low end. (e.g. "Ghost of a Chance")

>Geddy's bass is in good form, whipping up and down the fretboard, he
>could give Stanley Clark a run for the money.  Neil continues to be a
>dissapointment.  As a friend of mine said after the _Presto_ show "I

>morning".

I think one reason for this is that Neil takes his drumming *very*
seriously.  And everyone has their bad days.  At the Toronto _Presto_
show, I noticed all 3 of them were happy and vibrant, as opposed to
the gloomier moods they displayed in Rochester.

>but that quickly deteriorated to a rather dull, rock-steady sound.  He

He has, in part, adopted a "less is more" attitude, but it's not like he's
lost his chops.  The "bed" tracks Rush does nowadays are more cohesive than
their pre-MP counterparts, and this means you don't hear Neil stand out as
much.  I still appreciate his drumming, and he still throws in little fills
here and there to keep you guessing.  8)

>I remember the first
>production change when Peter Collins replaced the beloved Terry Brown
>after the release of the generally panned _Signals_ (an album which,
>despite it's "synthetic" sound has held up quite well, I think).

You're wrong.  Peter Henderson was the first post-Broon producer.
Actually, they produced _Grace Under Pressure_, for the most part, by
themselves...by the time they found Henderson, all they really
needed was to divine the sound for the songs, and engineer the recording,
which were Hentor's strong points.

>Broon's departure, it was thought, would mean the end of the band.
>They had been together for over 10 years at that point.  It was like
>losing a band member.

I have noticed the change in their sound, but I think the catalyst was
_Signals_, not _Grace..._.

>     The original choice of replacement producer was Steve Lillywhite
>(of U2 fame) for the work on the next album _Grace Under Pressure_
>(P/G) but for whatever reason (some say he laughed at the idea of
>producing a band like Rush) he declined and Peter Collins stepped in.
>His production values, while fundamentally different from those of

>my all-time favorie Rush song), "Tai Shan" and "Prime Mover" (both
>from _Hold Your Fire_) to get an idea about what I'm talking about.
>The lyrics  were more introspective than in the earlier Brown years
>and the music seems to fit.  Gone are the progressive Wagnerian pieces
>like "2112" and "Cygnus X-1 / Hemispheres", replaced by tighter, more

I wish you would have done your homework before you posted this tirade.
Give credit where credit is due.  I think "Afterimage" is a great song, and
I like GUP as a whole better than PoW.  I don't know if this is because of
Henderson, but I would like to think he had something to do with it.  8)
Peter Collins' work on HYF was better than PoW.  They had started to
produce shorter songs *way* before GUP.  Try _Permanent Waves_.

>Unfortunately, this [shorter song length] also set the tone for the
>albums _Presto_ and _RTB_, where the tighter song format was transformed
>into a pop sound.

HA HA HA HAHA H AHA HA HA!  And I suppose Metallica's shortening songs
suggest the same trend?  Bzzt.  Nope.  A more concise song format leads
to more musical ideas on one album, besides the fact that is makes the
music a little more palatable (sic) to those whose attention spans
wouldn't allow listening to a 10-20 minute song.

>     Collins in turn was replaced by Rupert Hine.  Unfortunately, I
>get the feeling that there is nothing behind these releases _Presto_
>and _RTB_ except the quest for the royalty check.

If you want to say it, don't beat around the bush -- you think they have
sold out.

>                                                    The sound he has

"Show Don't Tell" -- now there's a lifeless song.  Bland?  No passion?
Man, you must have gotten a bum copy of _Presto_, because I can't see
any foundation for your point of view -- for *any* of its songs!

>                                                             Rush has

I think it depends on what emotions you are talking about.  The songs
have never been very "lovey dovey", but they are charged with a love
for life, a curiousness about the world, and the questioning of
authority.  Certainly different emotions than those that drive the
current top-40 groups.
"Where's My Thing?", albeit very synthy, actually does shine.  I didn't
expect another "YYZ", even though they rehashed some of it on the new
instrumental.  Geddy really lets loose, and Alex and Neil keep great
rhythm and have their own little avenues to solo, while not missing a
beat. (Actually, they added a beat in one part -- the song is 4/4 with
one measure of 5/4.)

I'm sorry they couldn't keep you on the bandwagon.  I think I'll always be
a fan of Rush, through all their changes.

Actually, in "Heresy", there's a chord change reminiscent of REM's "Get Up"

I keep fighting the urge to do a full-blown review, like everybody else.  But
here's a couple more musings from this last weekend of listening:

 - People have already noticed the "supercalifragilistic...." bent to the
   backing lyrics in "You Bet Your Life".  But does anybody else out there
   find themselves following "Jack, relax / Get busy with the facts" with
   "No serenade / No fire brigade / Just pyromaniacs" ?  No?  Maybe I'm the
   only one who likes Lef Zeppard...  :)   But all kidding aside - that whole
   spoken section has really grown on me.

 - With a different chorus, "Neurotica" could easily be one of my all-time
   favorites.  It's intense, emotional, and full of rockin'.  But then the
   processed gee-whiz cheez-whiz chorus comes in and wrecks the whole mood.
   I mean, really - "Neurotica - exotica - ewww oooo ewww oooo oooo oooo".
   A whole chorus full of random words that rhyme.  Why'd they repeat with
   "exotica - neurotica" at the end?  Something like "idiotica - moronica"
   would have added just as much meaning.  What a waste!

Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away.  Time to put the CD on again...

Hello fellow Rush fans!  I have two questions.

	1. Does anybody know what Neil is playing on the bells during the
	   "Invisible airwaves" part of Spirit of Radio?  It sounds like
	   almost random eigth notes in the key of D, but I'm not sure.  I have
	   neither the time nor the transcription to answer my question.
	   Please send the answer to the address below (unless our rush-mgr
	   doesn't mind the digest getting even BIGGER!  :) ).

	2. I know this has been asked already, but it bears repeating.  I WANT
	   TOUR DATES, AND I WANT THEM NOW!  Especially for Tucson/Phoenix,
	   Milwaukee, and Detroit.

And one small opinion.  I think it's high time Rush switches producers.  I like
RTB and all, but I think they should switch again.  (Two albums per producer
seems to work well, doesn't it?)

Thank you for your support.

I personally love this slightly `anti-realist' move. After all the cover

Boy I thought Neil was a robot/coke addict who's up for every show he's

I hope this is a joke!! Apparently the writer never listened to p/g or
Power Windows (or HYF). Perhaps the writer is not a drummer. I like
Stewart's drumming but I'm glad that he and Neil aren't the same
drummer. As for the ``rock steady'' bit, Neil's moved more toward
working within a form (called ``rock and roll'') which takes much to
be done well. For today's Neil, playing 2112 is an effing joke and
``Natural Science'' an amusement.

I don't love Rupert either. On the other hand no non-cynic could believe

``Dreamline'' and ``Show Don't Tell,'' not to mention ``Neurotica''?

I had the idea about Tony myself but didn't notice the ``Jack Funk.'' I think

oh guys, we're getting *far* too serious here.
1) the motorcycle interpretation is so funny i laughed out loud,
   causing my boss to look at me strange (like she needs an excuse...)
2) i think everyone should respect everyone else's opinions in music,
   and therefore stop telling others that their opinion is wrong
   (by definition, there opinion is always their opinion)
3) enjoy the new album, it gives you a chance to rotate your listening
   list of rush.
4) i *like* ghost of a chance very much.
5) if one more person comments on hearing _rush_ on nbc i think i
   shall nod off.  since 90% (i'm guessing here) of the readers are male,
   i guess that most of us (i include myself) watch football.  after all,
   we are all products of a society which propagates this, so i just
   figured that we all saw it [please note *no* seriousness here].
6) i think that the "rap" voice is Alex.  he always has new ways to
   corrupt his voice with electronics.
7) i think neil, at times, shows on this album why he is the best (or one
   of...)
8) Alex's guitar work is perhaps his best in 10 years.
9) what is the signifigance [sp?] of Boris and Natasha? (in _show of
   hands_ video)
10) i salute Atlanta for several things:
   a) "Rush hour" last week - an hour of old & new stuff
   b) playing a Rush track/hr. to preview the new album.
   c) having music stores which'll call you to say "i've got your copy
      here - reserved just for you!"
   d) {completely unrelated} they played "Ina Gadda Da Vita" [sp?] at
      the risk of pissing off the station PD (Mr. Richard B. Head) and
      got over 550 phone calls supporting long songs on the air, paving
      the way for my requests of "Close to the Edge" and "2112"

11) on a down note, prince is still alive.   ;-)
12) jimmy connors lost :-(
13) i cannot fix my [deleted expletive] ZMODEM to work!!
   (i'm trying to download gif's too - with no success)

14) back on a good note, i plan to start up my windows with RUSH - every
    cretin with a computer owes it to themself to look at something better
    than their MS or NEC creations.
15) oh well, time for dinner...

	Eric Theis, you are truly a satirical genius.  Comparing RTB to
motorcycles left me rolling on the floor in the  'puter lab.. Thank you
for something truly unique amidst all the RTB Love/Hate squabbling...

 	People like you make mailers worth reading.

My RTB comments are quite simple and summed up in 3 easy points:
1) Overuse of this album WILL destroy your stereo's subwoofers. Geddy is
turned up to '11' in the mix, and though it sounds truly awesome, ya gotta
have some restraint or you'll start paying through the BOSE (speakers that is.)

2) Somebody better give Neil some more inspiring books to read. The lyrics to
this album don't SUCK, but this album is way-hard to swallow when it rides on
the coat-tails of its predecessors. Dreamline is the only TRUE  RUSH song on
the album, with the exception of You Bet Your Life. The rap is only cutesy.
HYF-->Presto-->RTB is pretty non-sequitor listening.

3) Alex has got to listen to his contemporaries or at least get some more
chops. Slowhand Clapton you ain't, homeboy. His solos are melodious, but too
simple and not interesting enough to my taste. Arthritis setting in? Ack! I
hope not! But you listen to Working Man, and then RTB and you say "Gosh, he's
lost a little bit, hasn't he!" I can find GLAM bands with more musicality than
this album (ie FIREHOUSE or TRIXTER). Style or no, he's just gotta put more
into his work.

And one last comment on Where's My Thing:
It sounds way way similar to the concert-encore jams that they did on the
Presto tour, don't you think?? That bass line is AMAZING, and has so much
feel to it, that I can't help but suspect that it's been practiced before
and honed until it just FLOWS from Geddy's fingers... WOW. Alex's part is
like YYZ on acid, until he goes 'Slowhand' in the middle sections.. Neil
is just kinda there, but he gets in a few nice fills..

	I want another new album from the boyz SOON, 'cause if something
AWFUL happened to the band and this turned out to be their last album, I
would be seriously grief-stricken. This is NOT a good representation of
what they can do nor what they do in concert..

Several things --

1) Am I the only one who thinks that "Where's My Thing?" is FUNNY?
That song just cracks me up!!  My favourite part is the double-bass
part Neil plays.  I've listened to that song 100 times and it STILL
puts me on the floor...  I mean, you figure that the TITLE is off the
wall; the song MIGHT BE, as well.  Or have I just lost my thing?

2) Thanx to the fellow who mentioned his girlfriend thinks Alex is
good-looking.  At least I'm not the only one out of my mind!  (no
offense intended to your girlfriend...)

3) I KNEW that kid was Alex's youngest!!!!  I was waiting for someone
else to mention it...

4) About the "direction" that RUSH are heading to.  I don't think
they're "heading" into any "direction".  They're just trying something
different -- they'll head off somewhere else, in time.  They're just
trying to experiment what they can do with this one particular style
-- once they feel THEY'VE mastered it, not giving a damn, I'm sure to
what WE think, they'll move on to something else.  I know that many of
you consider RTB to be a failure.  But think about it, even failures
are important!!  To contradict what I said before, on the Rush,
Profiled! CD Alex said that if a fan told him, "Well, I like this
song, but THIS song really sucks because xxxxx reason", he'd consider
that important criticism.  If something  ain't working, TELL 'EM.
What the hell?!  But don't send them tons of mail, though... and
please don't tell them I sent you...  (Me?  Oh no, Mr. Lee, it wasn't
me.  It...uh...it was my TWIN SISTER!... yeah, that's it!)      :-)

5) I love the "Neil Peart -- Drums and Cymbals" bit.  So what do you
all think?  A joke?  I mean, cymbals are a  kind-of given, I guess.  I
mean you usually associate 'cymbals' with 'drums'... right?  Or is
that just me?  Ha ha!  It's rather amusing, actually.  Speaking of
which, does  anyone else miss the nicknames and nonsense in the liner
notes?  Whatever happened to "Shrav"?  "Slider"?  "Ho-hooo"?  "First
Base"?  Get with it, Neil!!

In my opinnion <if there is one up there>, presto took a while to
accept, but I can really appriciate presto and the direction that
they are moving towards with rlb....

Must have listened to rlb 50times or more, still it's taking a while
for some tunes to motivate me, but comparing rlb to the other albums
on the market......this is none....

Alot of you grown up with old rush which you favor more then present
status that rush is writing today!!  I came in when moving pictures
hit the scene, and that really hit home, not too mention the other
albums before pictures.. But what we all should appricite is that
they still are playing, coming up with new ideas, and writing
execellent music....

As a guitar player, I give the band *A+* for the changes they have made
within their yrs together.......Technology has changed , and rush has
decided to change with it......  I'm sure, neil,geddy and alex don't
want to keep writing the hard rock as they did in the earlyier yrs
up to pictures, so they've turned to the sentlemental side of

music to take on a different meaning in their playing.. I guess
when you actually play an instrument, the more respect you have for
the artist, because it's a battle uphill to write/compose and perform.
to satisfy everyone's ear......

Take it for what it's worth......

Hi!

	Well, in the spirit of the (radio) new album, here's a repeated
offer to the digest (since the first time I posted this was before the jump
in circulation and during the summer slow .edu months ...)

	If you're interested in getting the RUSH fortune script (and
accompanying quotes file), just send email to either:

		sasaki@cs.jhu.edu  -or-
		usagi@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu

	For those not familiar, the script searches through the quotes
file in a semi-random manner, selects one, and then prints it to the
screen.  I've recently updated the quotes file to include stuff from
_Roll_The_Bones_; but the nice part about this is that you can easily
add your own quotes to the end of the quotes file, and personalize it
somewhat.  So, if you're a Quantum Leap fan, for example, you can
add *their* quotes file to the end of your RUSH quotes.  :)

	Right now, I have this shell script running on a UNIX system V, a
Sun-OS, and an ULTRIX machine, so it should be easily ported to your UNIX
machine.  (At least, last time I didn't hear about any problems.)

	Send mail if you're interested (to me, *not* the digest).

<A NAME="336324">From: David Sandberg <sialis!dts@cs.umn.edu></A>

Be forewarned - I'll try to keep this short, but I'm probably
going to fail.  B-)

I've been listening to Roll The Bones for quite some time now,
and I feel confident that my opinion of the album is pretty much
set in stone.  Also, the following opinions are OPINIONS, no
more.  Enough said, I hope.

(Alert: Entering acronym mode.  Check earflaps before proceeding.)

I'm very happy with RTB.  I place it on a par with HYF, which in
turn was my favorite Rush album save AFTK.  I certainly consider
it a step up from P (uh, maybe I should call this one Presto B-).
I view the lyrics as very cohesive.  The whole of the album seems
to make a single statement: that good and bad things just happen
in people's lives, and the best you can do is take your shot and
accept the results.  Even "Heresy" fits into this concept (about
accepting the costs that the Cold War extracted from all of us,
and just going on).

Now, Rush is not my religion.  I don't think the new album is
perfect.  For some reason "Dreamline" leaves me completely cold.
But pretty much every other song on the album grabbed me right
away, whereas usually half or so of the songs on new Rush albums
take at least a month or two to grow on me.  By contrast, only
_two_ songs off Presto grabbed me this way right off the bat.

The strongest point of the album is in songwriting.  We know
Rush has been trying to concentrate more and more on that to the
exclusion of individual technical heroics, and I think they've
reached a watershed in that effort.  Don't get me wrong - when I
was younger I got off on all the hot licks and odd time
signatures as much as the next kid.  But I'm older now, and I
don't yearn to hear that anymore.  And Rush is one band that has
certainly proven they can pull off all the difficult stuff... but
I don't think they need to go on proving it time and time again.
Great chops are not the prime ingredient of great music.

Some other guitarist (I think it might have been Robert Fripp)
once made a comment which can be applied here.  Paraphrased, he
said "You don't have to flaunt technical ability in order to
benefit from it.  If you have the capability to play a million
notes, and then you play only three notes, that lends an amazing
profundity to the three notes you did choose."  IMO this is true
of Rush's latest - they can play a simple song and make it a
*statement*, because they're making a *choice* to play something
simple rather than being limited by a lack of ability.

There have been suggestions that Peart sold out on this album by
writing "cliche lyrics" about love, as opposed to his usual fare.
I have a response to that - they aren't cliches coming from *him*.
Neil hasn't really written much about love before, and when he
finally did on this album I think it was especially powerful
because all of us know he doesn't toss off these kind of things
all of the time.

Alex does do some nice guitar work all over this album, but
especially on "Ghost of a Chance".  I also like the "plastic
guitar sound" he gets during the last verse of "You Bet Your
Life" - it fits right in with the lyrics.

A quick tour of my RTB favorites: "Bravado" (majestic music and
dark lyrics), "The Big Wheel" (should be a killer guitar rhythm
live), "Ghost of a Chance" (*THE* love song from Rush), and "You
Bet Your Life" (inventive chorus, lyrics which tie up the album
concept as cleanly as a ribbon around a birthday present).

(Here endeth the review.  And now for something completely
different...)

In the "has anyone else noticed?" department, you might check out
the drum part (particularly the snare) during the last choruses
of "Neurotica" and notice it's similarity to the last verse of
"The Big Money".  (Of course the tempo is quite different, but
I'm talking about the rhythm.)

Lastly, it's my guess that the "mystery rapper" is none other
than Fee Waybill, former lead vocalist of the Tubes.  (You know
what they say - always bet on the long shot!  Besides, it _does_
sound a wee bit like him.)

--
   "and if the music stops, there's only the sound of the rain
    all the hope and glory, all the sacrifice in vain            rush,
    and if love remains, though everything is lost             _bravado_
    we will pay the price, but we will not count the cost"

improving future work.

   Incredible to say, _Roll the Bones_ was on sale in Italy the 1st week of
September. It's an album I really like, by far better than _Presto_ (which I
did not like at all, even though it contains oe of the best Rush songs ever
written: AVAILABLE LIGHT), but IMO not up to the band's highest works (2112,
P/G, PowWin : absolute perfection). I really like Dreamline, RTB and GhostOAC,
but cannot understand why the boys wrote Face Up, WMT and Neurotica.
   Alex worked really well this time. I thought that PowWin was his epitaph
(in HYF and Presto he did nothing noteworthy) but he has proven me wrong.

Hi,

This is my first posting to TNMS, so I hope it gets through all right.

I don't know if anyone has mentioned this before, so forgive me if I'm
repeating something you already know, but has anyone else noticed that one of
the acknowledgements in HYF is to "the Gangster of Boats"?

Just wondering.

BTW, I *like* the rap section.  Reminds me of Blondie's "Rapture" more than
rap.  And I *despise* rap.  I also like the chorus in "You Bet Your Life,"
which seems to have gotten rather bad press around here lately.  My husband is
having a great time making up new pieces for it.  So far he's come up with
"neurotic neo-Calvinist," "rabid fundamentalist," and "moldy anthropologist."
(we don't get out much! :-)   )

Rush.....
              .....is.....
                                 .....awesome.

Roll the Bones is better every time i listen to it.  i think i'll drop
out and become a
roadie....

i admit i was a little disappointed the first time i listened to it
the whole way through, but after giving it a chance and really listening to it
i'm finding lots of things in the music and lyrics which are suprisingly
emotional and interesting.

>...one thing, though--not sure if this has been mentioned yet (i scroll a LOT
these days), but wasn't Johnny Abdul that funny Indian "King of Rock-n-Roll"
on "In
Living Color"?  "Are you ready to raaahck"<--(much hacking and spittle)...
perhaps
they were inspired in some way?

Anyway, i'm happy to say i like the new album.

later,

Well, gee.  Maybe so that the entire title can be read?
People, I think some of you are going a bit too far with
interpreting the album cover.  There are dice because of the "roll"
in the title.  There is a skull because of the "bones" in the title.
Its just Rush having fun.  No "666" or any shit like that.
It's sorta like the ole' Moving Pictures cover, where people are
actually MOVING pictures.  Or HYF, where the guy is HOLDING fire.
I was suprised that Presto didn't have soe guy's toe going through
a big press or something.
Geddy said he thought the RTB cover was "funny".
So in the immortal words of Neil Peart.....
"Get a Life"

Hey, even eMpTyV uses "Show Don't Tell" as background music from time to
time.  I also hear Yes stuff alot.  I think the people at eMpTyV secretly
KNOW whats hip.

 I've had this RUSH t-shirt for a couple of years and it's been puzzling me
 ever since I've had it. Here's what happened.

 Right after the Toronto HYF concert on March 7 , 1988 there was this guy
 trying to sell a shirt in the street. Since I wasn't too happy with the tour
 shirts (I thought they really sucked) I decided to get it. I'm pretty sure
 it was a bootleg shirt of some sort. Anyway here's what it looked like:

 It's all black and on the back it has a huge picture of the Star of the
 Federation with the guy standing in the middle of it ( from 2112). Above
 the picture the words "HOLD YOUR FIRE" appear in red and at the bottom "TOUR".

 On the front there's a picture of the boyz with "RUSH" at the bottom.
 At the top of the picture the words "Adventures in Paradise" appear. That's
 the part I don't understand. Does anyone know what these words refer to ?
