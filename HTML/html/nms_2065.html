So good to read the notes from all those out there who like me have been
touched by the magical music of Rush.  Seems strange that the band that
captured my interest as I was struggling to pass the 8'th grade would
still be my favorite musicians now that I am 30 and have an MBA.  I have
listened to everything trying to find the same level of artistry,
inspiration, and intellect and keep coming back to Rush as nothing else
compares.  I'm sure that my freinds and family are sick hearing me go on
about Rush and quoting Neal Peart so its great that you are all out
there.  Take care.

<A NAME="2065002">Subject: What was Alex thinking?</A>

    I am a guitar player who wants to be a great  musician with my band
and I am a Rush-infected-music-fan.  I listen to and admire some other
bands and musicians but I always find myself returning to Alex.  I want
to share my thoughts on 2 subjects with you.

    First subject:  When you start learning guitar side of Rush (or any
of the other two instruments) you become unable to listen their integral
music which is an unwanted situation.  Of course individually all 3 are
perfect but as a whole they forge the best music I've ever heard.  It's
the most integral music modern day warriors have ever produced.  So I
developed a way to catch that integrity over the years.  (I learned a
lot from my king H.R.H. Alex so by now when I listen to a new album I
learn the songs very quickly, my style is melted in his style which is
perfect but dangerous so I consciously learn other great
instrumentalists' styles to find my way back home  of individual
style).  Now when I listen to a Rush song I try to focus more on vocal,
bass, drums, it really helps to capture the unique Rush integrity just
like in the old days before we started playing guitar.
    Rush's mystery or magic lies in their integrity, so cleverly layered
frequencies generated by bass, drums, guitar, vocal, so beautifully
shaped integral noise that we call Rush.  Of course, producer's
understanding of what this 3 guys are about plays a big role but they
had this integrity all those years before anyone.  Yes, I accept the
fact that there are really excellent instrumentalists out there, but
musicianship is a completely different thing and no other band even
comes close.  Rush's music is so integral like a perfect alloy just as
Rearden Steel.

    Second one:  This is about Alex's solos on some (in fact many)
particular songs.  For example, take the second segment of guitar solo
on "Available Light".  When you listen to that solo -just like many
other Alex solos- it is a solo that makes your eyes water, especially
that melody part played with lowered volume, I want to ask him "What
were you thinking when you played that solo?"  It makes me think that
melody bit plays in his head during a concert while he is playing a
completely different song at a very intimate moment on stage shared with
Ged and Neil surrounded by fans, lights and that burbling electric
sea...  "What was on your mind, Alex?"
    Another solo with lots of wonders is the one on "Between the
Wheels".  Whenever I listen to that solo (since 1984) it makes me think
of a winter decorated woodland, a candle lit wooden bungalow with a roof
covered with thick snow, it's snowing and a few kids are at the window,
looking outside and wondering...   I want to ask him "What was on your
mind, what were you thinking?"
    My question goes to Alex for Time & Motion' solo, the Analog Kid'
solo.  In some interviews, he rarely says "Red Tide is an angry song so
the solo had to be angry too".  The only time he ever shared his
personal visionary thought on one of his solos was during his first
Guitar Player interview, June 1980.  He talks about "Different Strings"
solo.  What that solo reminds him of is a completely different thing
from what that song is about, yet at least as deep as it is.

    Do not ask him what pickups he uses on his new PRS guitars or which
Eventide or that Digitech unit.  Instead ask him what made him play that
solo on Time & Motion.  We already know why he prefers bolt-ons or
rosewood fretboards or tc electronic units.  Let his guitar tech talk on
the king's outboard gear.  His ultimate gear is his vision of life, his
eyes, his heart and mind, his hands and his fingers.
    Someone out there who may accidentally be reading my post may also
be a friend of Alex, his golf friend or tennis friend or whatever,
please go & ask him at right time & place --I wish I could but I am a
little far 5000 miles away-- and let everybody know what Alex was
thinking...

My best wishes to Alex and to people who admire Rush

Hi,

Sorry mate, I own a vinyl HyF, and have seen  ASOH, Presto and CP Lps.

BTW, I met Alex Van Halen, he's a nice guy and IMO a good drummer. As is
Steve Smith, or Rod Morgenstein, or Roger Taylor. They serve different
purposes, that's it.

Does anybody know of Jeff Berlin's album 'Champion' for sale? My tape is
wearing out and I love it. ORC: NP plays on 2 tunes. Also, anybody willing
to part with their Dexters tape or CD? Can't get it here (Holland) and would
love to hear it.

Road story: Last friday I took the long way home, just for the heck of it.
Well, that and wanting to check out  a BMW converible in Germany. So, having
done that I still had to drive about 2 hrs to get home. In friday afternoon
traffic. Sounds tedious, but not with Temples of the Syrinx on the tapedeck.
I now know my car tops out at an even 190 km/h (118 mph, of course in
Germany and with no cars around me) and I still can sing along to Natural
Science at the same time.... great fun.

sorry for the WOB!!

Was flipping through channels late on Saturday night and tuned in 
MST3000.  There was some cheesy(of course) horror movie on.  There was 
a kid on the movie working as a rent-a-cop late at a factory and he 
was listening to his head phones and air drumming.  Now I cant 
remember word for word what was said, but it went along the lines of:
"Looks like he took lessons from Neil Peart"

It was pretty cool, even though it sounded like they pronounced his 
last name wrong.

Beers to listen to RUSH to:

Rush: Budweiser (The working man's album needs the working man's brew. The
beer's cheap and does the job)
2112: Hempen Ale (For APTB and TZ. Made with real hemp. Too bad it tastes
like shit!)
Hemispheres: Black and Tan (Self-explanatory)
Moving Pictures: Pete's Wicked Winter Brew (Has a subtle raspberry flavor.
Reminds me of the crowd gathered outside the studio in the middle of winter
recording the mob scene for Witch Hunt)
Hold Your Fire: Samuel Smith's Pale Ale (This was the last album I
absolutely loved from the first listen. Same with the beer)
Counterparts: Hammer & Nail

For any Yes fans out there I'm going to see them tonight at the Oakdale in
CT. I'm expecting an awesome show. Hope it doesn't disappoint. Now the only
thing I need to do is somehow get RUSH and YES to tour together.

<A NAME="2065008">Subject: RUSH Sighting : The Forest & The Trees In Win NT 5.0</A>

Aaaalllooo RUSH fans!!!

Interesting RUSH tidbit I witnessed first hand at the Win NT demo for 5.0 &
NT server 5.5.

Let me start by saying it really wasn't much of a demo and had me dieing of
boredom at some points....

HOWEVER.....

Within the demo, there came the topic of a new feature in Windows NT, that
being the concept of there being The Trees & a Forrest of The Trees.  The 
guy giving the demo mentioned that there is a bit of a problem with the 
Forrest, it's that all The Trees can't live in harmony, and he mentioned that 
RUSH fans would understand that point....and there was a slight rumbling of 
mild laughter....as well as some non-RUSHes' lookin' around saying to each 
other..."Rush Limbaugh???"  He then had to clarify the band, and not the man.

It's a RUSH thing, they wouldn't understand.

Anyway, it leads me to my most harmonic convergence of the past five minutes
anyway.

Now if RUSH, long ago proposed the obviousness of Neils observations of The 
Trees through public media, as brilliant as it is, with all of it's endowed 
and charming insight into oppressive situations.  And if Win NT is also 
discovering these sorts of problems in the techno world.  I, a mere earthling 
beg of you all to make this a new thread of much theoretical discussion, but 
I ask, What does it all mean????

Personal feeling on this, like if the trees can't get along in the real
world, nor in futuristic cyber ventures, like where will we be down the road 
ehh???  Certainly, much discussion on The Trees is needed.....as I sit here 
pondering an American President in China trying to reform an oppressive 
government, and yet sway them into a different type of oppression fueled by 
capitalistic fire.....mmmmm?????

 By hatchet, ax, and saw!!!"

Hiya!

We've had a vote on what were our favorite tv shows, but let's put the
thermometer in where the intellect of Rush fans can truly be measured --
radio shows.

What radio shows do we listen to?  I don't mean who is your favorite
disc jockey, we could all name Don Imus or Casey Kasum or Howard Stern
or Roy Otis or whoever.  I also don't mean music shows like King Biscuit
and other music countdown/concert shows.  I mean the intellectual side
of radio, Larry King, Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura, Michael Medved, Click &
Clack, Ken Hamblin, Wayne LaPierre, Tom Leikis, etc.  Also include news
shows, McLoughlin Radio Hour, NPR shows or whatever.  

Even the entertainment side of radio is fair game:  A Prairie Home
Companion, classic radio shows like Fibber McGee & Molly, The
Untouchables, The Shadow . . .  Locally produced shows count too.

What radio shows are popular with Rush fans?

My Red Barchetta is a red '85 Ford Escort Wagon with a Rush Limbaugh
bumper sticker, how's that for covering two threads with one tome?  :) 
I used to listen to the CBS Radio Mystery Theater, but I can't find
where it's on in Seattle anymore.  Also Ed Hume (from Gardening in
America tv show) has a radio show on 570 KVI in Seattle on Saturday that
is great if you're into gardening and want to talk to The Exalted Grand
Poobah of Petunias himself.  We frequently catch A Prairie Home
Companion when we go out camping.    

I understand that Ted Nugent has a talk show, could someone who listens
to it please give me a review?  If it's available via RealAudio, that'd
be even better!  Thanks in advance.

Thoroughly Pointless and Silly Rush Sighting:  At the Ivar's Fish &
Chips just off of Highway 99 in Federal Way, WA (between Seattle and
Tacoma) they have a burglar alarm.  The city requires a permit for the
burglar alarm, and the permit is posted in their window.  Their permit
number?  2112, what else!  Attention all bottomfish that swim in Puget
Sound . . . we'll serve you with tartar & chips, we'll serve you with
tartar & chips, we'll serve you with tartar & chips . . .

Hey gang..
It was written:
<<<3)  I Think I'm Going Bald (I double dare *anyone* to stand up for this
song.)>>>>
Personally, I love the song. When I was Young and just getting into Rush, (
I started backwards, listening to MP and Signals first,) It was one of the
"accessable " songs to me on CoS. I still love it today. Is it out of place
on the album? Sure, but that doesn't mean it's a bad song..

heya rush fanz:

Just a quick note: my radio station here in st catharines, ont canada (yes...
Pratts AND THE Lakeside Parks hometown:) said this morning they would have 
the first single from the new live Rush cd (no title given) at the end of 
August. (I presume this is the "Animate" track thats been talked about)

Also, I understand Rush has one of the, if not THE, biggest MUSIC presence 
on the net. (Somebody, correct me if I'm wrong) "The Record" magazine here in 
Canada states Rush gets the largest number of hits to their websites (imagine 
TNMS is THE major one:) more then ANY OTHER BAND PERIOD! Supposedly, we also 
have the largest mailing list of any other band also. I don't know where 
they get their numbers from, but, if true, that means WE have ALOT of power!! 
I think maybe <evil grin> we should start tracking down their American and 
International record companies to push them more....BOMBARD radio and empTyV 
to play Rush (such as a direct mailing from EVERY TNMS subscriber...shit..
theyd go nuts!) I know Rush fans were pissing off the people at Rolling Stone 
by leaving all sorts of messages on peoples voice mail, and blasting them 
with comments/requests.

Why should we stop?? Who care if it pisses em off. Eventually, they'll get the
message. RUSH IS NOT DEAD. They've got the new live cd's comming out..perfect
timing..plus Rush remix on Small Soldiers....and all those Rush fans behind the
scenes everywhere from NBC to Microsoft.

Let's "Power to the Rush FANZ!!". It's about time these boys got some MAJOR
respect. Here in Canada..it's kinda cool..because over the last few years, 
they've been recognized (Order of Canada (seeing them on the front page of 
our national paper made my day:)..Juno hall of fame...etc)

If we have this much power...then dammit...lets do it. Say, rush-mgr, for iss#
2112, can we have this full of our comments and have it forwarded to every music
oriented source in the country??? (ie. empTyV, all the music rags....record
companies, music web sites..etc??)

Anyways...we HAVE the power folks...LETS USE IT!!!!

true.  SOCAN covers Canada, and most countries have their own version of
this system.  We respect theirs, they respect ours.  Otherwise, no one

playing the Tom Sawyer remix. I though it was great. It sounded cool. I
yelled for my dad to come and see but then, after they showed it for
like 6 seconds, it turned off and they started playing this other stupid
song. What a bunch of cheap bastards. They couldn't even play it for 20
seconds. 
	Anyway, who the hell cares about Alex Van Halen drumming. He's a loser
at drumming. I still say that Neil Peart is the best percussionist of
all-time (like the Jimi Hendrix of drumming.)

Greetings from Central Texas fellow Rush Fans.
I have been lurking about TNMS since about #1400 and have enjoyed most
of the discussions.  While I'm not so much on the "How did they get this
sound" side of the house I have enjoyed the philisophical arguments such
as "What did they mean here?"
But this is not why I'm writing today.  I'm writing because I've have
been trying (off and on) for the last few years to collect a Power
Windows promo poster (24x36 or 24x24) and have had no success whatsoever
in acquiring one.  I think have tried every commercial site and then
some on the Internet and was only able to purchase a Moving Pictures and
Signals poster from an auction.  I almost even purchased a 48x48 PC map
plotter copy of the album cover, but decided that wasn't the answer to
my quest.  So I am asking TNMS readers out there for
ideas/sites/collectors that might have a frameable copy of PoW promo
poster. Email me at editor@texasrails.com if you have a lead.
Sincerely,

Hey everyone out there in NMS land!

We've gone through these "skipable" tracks threads for years now and I somehow 
always feel obligated to point out that one mans dog poop is another mans gold. 
<my comments are in <>  >

Michael writes...
        I physically feel pain listening to the better (or worst, in this
case) half of the last 5 or so tracks on RTB.  It's not that I haven't given
it a chance.  I *have*.  But I just can't stand Neurotica, and therefore, I
put it as numero uno on my list.  So here's the bitter fruits of my labor:

1)  Neurotica
   <Am I the only person who likes this song!!!!!!>
2)  You Bet Your Life (Is it just me, or did Billy Joel do this exact song,
but it was called 'We Didn't Start the Fire'?)
   <just you babe. :) >
3)  I Think I'm Going Bald (I double dare *anyone* to stand up for this song.)
   <can't really argue this one, although various NMSers have over the years>
4)  Virtuality ('Put your message in a modem...'  Give me a f*cking break.)
   <I like this one also.  Guess Michael and I won't be a compatible computer 
dating match - mainly because I'm straight and married, so is Michael for all I 
know>
5)  Dog Years (Dog Poop)
   <I really really really love this song.  Maybe because Rush (esp Neil) didn't
take himself too seriously.  Also has the most raw energy since Tom Sawyer> 
6)  Everyday Glory (Yes it's inspirational, but this isn't music, it's muzak.)
   <Got to disagree here also.  Great ending>
7)  Carve Away the Stone (Zzzzzz...Huh?  Oh, wake me up when I don't have to
listen to filler tracks anymore.)
   <warming up to this one and Color of Right a alot lately>
8)  Speed of Love (Bleck.)
   < ok I skip this one too>
9)  Take a Friend (Not god-awful, but easily skipable)
   < I couldn't even tell you how this one goes (bad Rush fan! Sit!)>
10) Ghost of a Chance (Good guitar work, but Rush *cannot* write love songs)
   < I wouldn't say skipable, but not a fav >

I would add Prime Mover, Heresy, Cygnus X-1 (gasp!) sorry folks, I like the part
that they teased us with on the TFE tour, but I think Ged's vocals are 
obnoxious.  

Bottom Line: Different Strokes etc.

Now if only we knew what Neil meant by "Christ, what have you done?"  :)

Hiya Rush Fans : )

This is my first post, so I just wanted to say how much I enjoy reading your
responses about Rush and other related subjects.

I would also like to share with you some of the other bands that I love to
listen to . . 

Along with Rush, these are my other favorite bands:

  Led Zeppelin
  The Beatles
  Pink Floyd
  Metallica
  Guns N Roses
  Dio & Black Sabbath (w/Dio)
  Stone Temple Pilots
  Alice in Chains
  Nirvana
  Triumph

No suprises here  . . I am pretty much the classic rock fan with some 90's
alternative/grunge thrown in for variety.

Favorite Alex solo:

"Between the Wheels."  I love the emotion he puts into the final dozen
bars of this solo especially.  It builds like a sunami wave and then
crashes right at the top.

Oh, and whoever wrote that "Everyday Glory" is muzak must be on crack.  I
love the riff in this song.  Sure, it's simple, but it has a lot of energy
and it easy on the ears.  I like this song a lot, actually.

Hello all!
	It's been a long time since I have posted. Hope that you are all
doing well. I saw Hobgoblins over the weekend and liked the Peart
reference. Ann Sutton had mentioned that Mike had talked about Mike
referring to the year 2112. The was in the Deadly Mantis Episode. In
that episode the band was also referred to about 25 minutes into the
show. Two pilots in an airplane were searching for the Mantis. Mike
looks at the one pilot who is apparently sleeping and says, "I'm so
baked...You have to here this Rush tape!" It was classic. I know of a
few other episodes where Geddy is referred to. Talk to you all later!

OK Rushians, if I have to read one more post about how Alex Van Halen licks 
Neil's Toms, I'm gonna' puke blood on someone.  It's time for a new thread, 
and I'm going to take a stab here, so play along if you like.

All righty then.  So here we go.

Tonight, after watching a rerun of "Blossom" on TV, you unfortunately die 
in your sleep.  When your soul arrive at the pearly gates, St. Peter sees 
your Rush shirt and naturally assumes you're a Satanist (don't even THINK 
about going there!).  Alas, you are then sent directly to Hell.

At first, you realize that it isn't such a bad place.  The weather's 
brutal, but on the bright side, most of your friends are there.  When you 
get to your cell, the trollish prisonkeeper, his skin boiling and seething, 
informs you that you are to be chained to a pointy rock to rot for all 
eternity.  But, your one concession is that you get to select one song to 
listen to as your innards slowly fester.  But, you only get ONE song, and 
you have to listen to it over and over and over and over . . . . . forever.

So, what song do you pick?  Dare I volunteer that it doesn't even have to 
be a Rush song, but it would  be nice . . .

Sleep well tonight, and for God's sake, turn off Blossom.

Hello, Rushians!

It's been few and far between with posts from me over the years,
but here goes:

I don't know if this has been mentioned yet, but there's a new
remixed version of "Tom Sawyer" on the soundtrack for the new
movie _Small Soldiers_.  It's remixed by someone named DJ
Z-Trip.  It has some scratching and drum-and-bass flourishes
thrown in the mix, but much of the song remains intact.  For,
the record, though, it is billed as being preformed by Rush, re-
mixed by DJ Z-Trip.

Basically, if you're a fan of modern electronica, you'll think it's
pretty cool.  If you're a rock purist, you'll think it really sucks, so
take a listen to see which camp you fall into! ;)

Cheers,

<A NAME="2065027">Subject: Comparison Guidelines</A>

All right, enough of the AVH/NP comparisons.  But I ponder; What are the
guidelines for comparisons on this mailing list?  How long did the AVH/NP
rivalry go on before the flamming began?  A couple weeks? One month, tops?
And how long does the Metallica/Rush comparison go on?  ETERNITY???  Come on
guys, what's the time limit for this?

Many people don't like the comparisons because of the apparent fights that
break out.  In moderation, I kind of like them.  They are informative,
educational, and more often than not, down right humorous.  But maybe there
should be a limit.  I suggest a  couple comparisons I haven't seen much.  Rush
and Triumph.  Power trios from Canada.  Or Rush and Queensryche.  Now that I'd
like to hear comments on.  

Naturally, I already liked Queensryche from the first time I heard Jet City
Women.  But what piqued my interest was the fact that, at least one album,
"Empire" was produced by none other than; Peter Collins.  Peter has co-
produced no less than four Rush albums: PW, HYF, CP and T4E.  Thank about
that.

I have traveled all accross the U.S. and can confirm that Rush radio play is a
bit lacking.  But I just want to confirm that it is alive and kicking in the
South.  At least four radio stations in the Fayetteville, Raliegh, Greensboro
NC area readily play at least 1-3 Rush songs a day.  Typically the standard
Freewill, Limelight, Spirit of Radio and Closer to the Heart. But it is Rush.
Also, both B107 in Fayetteville, and WRDU 106.1 in Raleigh are consistently on
top of the Rush new releases.  

Finally, nothing gives me a warmer fuzzy than to hear "John Boy and Billy in
the Morning" endorsing Rush as "that legendary band from Canada." Ranks right
up there with NASCAR and Professional Wrestling.  Gives me renewed
appreciation for the term "Redneck." 

Ahoooah, ahoooah, ahoooah.

<A NAME="2065030">Subject: In Defense of Dog Years</A>

I've seen a lot of slagging of Dog Years in the past few issues.
I guess I feel obligated to defend it seeing as it's a personal
favorite. I think we all know that Neil would not put on an
album a song that is transparently foolish. Ok, yes he wrote "I
Think I'm Going Bald" and "Speed of Love", but give him the 
benefit of the doubt. I don't weigh his words lightly and during
the premiere on the radio of TFE, he called Dog Years "a feast."
We all know Neil has a penchant for word play, and DY is a fine
example of it. I admit, when I first read the lyrics and saw
"Doggie Heaven" I got queasy, but the simple fact is this song
is meant to be *fun*. And that includes silliness. Rather than
launch into a 5 page thesis detailing every chunk of word play,
I would challenge you naysayers to listen again to some of the
phrases you may be taking for granted in the song, namely my
personal favorite "with his tail between his ears". Letting go 
of the standard Peartian seriousness that one usually needs to 
listen to Rush is necessary for this tune. 

The joy of DY comes from not being serious even though it has a 
serious message, which may arguably be the point of the song 
itself. People look to Sirius.

(BTW, I can't stand the tortoise from Galapagos section myself
but mostly because it goes totally out of character from the
otherwise fun song... not to mention the metaphor is rather bland)

I've been thinking about A Nice Morning Drive by Richard S. Foster
(kindly transcribed on the NMS website).  I always assumed that the
"gleaming alloy aircar" was driven by the local constabulatory.  In the
