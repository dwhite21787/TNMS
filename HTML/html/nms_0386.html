A mass vote for RTB on mtvs most wanted???  Sounds good!!
But make sure you post the phone #, and the time when they
would play the video, assuming we get enough votes in.

And, hey Kevin Wolfe!!!  Haven't heard from you. Lost your
email address, sorry I missed you at the show! Drop me a line!

Anyone else heard of the What's My Thing? US Promo Pic CD single?

Just an aside -
Let us have a moment of silence for Freddie Mercury.  May he rest in peace.

hi
if anyone knows when the tickets for oakland on the 29 and 30 of january go on
sale please post it to the board. i would really like to know so that i won't
get surprised on a sunday morning. most ticket places around here are handing
out line passes on sarturday. the line passes determine where you are in line s
so...

thanks in advance.

	Recently, I walked into a local record store here in St. Louis.
To my suprise there were two Rush imports.  One was called Rush in Vogue
and the other Fly in the Night.  Both of them are live discs.  Fly in the
Night was recorded in Montreal in 1980.  It has the following songs on it:

	Xanadu
	A Farewell to Kings
	Closer to the Heart
	Something for Nothing
	Cygnus X
	Working Man
	Fly by Night
	In the Mood
	Cinderella Man

The sound quality is not great.  I do not remember the list of songs on the
other disc.  However, the sound quality is much better.

	I was wondering if anyone else has run across either of these discs.
Also does anybody know if there is anything else like this available?

First, I have tried and tried to download your gifs from the FTP sites.
under rush.images.*
I >Type L 8 them, get them, re-enter my account, set the block size to 256
IBM intelegable files, copy them via DECnet to an IBM disk and they won't
work.  On the VAX account, I recently got a program that allows you to
view the GIF files on a VT340 terminal.  Same thing.  No dice.

What gives?  How is it that every other ftp site with gifs seem to work
yet the gifs on syrinx.umd.edu dont?  Anyone else encounter the same
problem?

Long time ago someone told me that the Syrinx was part of the cranium (sp?)
he was wrong... it is a part of a bird's vocal chord.  Made me angry to find
that out so late... Still holds symbolix reference, tho....

'Nother thing. Some people had been talking about rush and trek... well,
remember that the poll is taken from a subset of rushers who use computers...
not only that, but computer users who have had some experience with their
network (where I go, only serious people ever learn about list servers and
mailing distribution sites... actually, very few have ever heard of the term
"echo mail" and even few people who have heard of that term know that it is
basically the same thing).  *sigh* so, suppose it is because of a combination
of these two absolute variables - that we use computers, and listen to rush -
that perhaps we are by nature intrigued with logic and thought, which are
tackled in science fiction, namely star-trek.  Perhaps we should take a poll
to find what other common interests all 1200 (??) of us have in common.

A note to all guitar/bass players.   The December issue of Guitar For The
Practicing Musician contains a transcription of the entire 'La Villa
Strangiato'.

I never thought I'd see that!

It is obvious that MTV is running the RTB video in what they call
"light rotation". If the video gets a lot of good response, they MIGHT
shift it to heavy rotation, but from past experiences with Rush vids on
MTV, it is far more likely that they will drop it entirely after a few
weeks. Since it has been on for about 3 weeks now. I strongly suggest that
anyone who is interested in catching it on tape get very serious about it
ASAP. I probably taped 30 hours of MTV before I got it (That was in the
first week, and it may not have actually been on the first few days.)

Buy a TV Guide and look at their schedule, so you don't waste taping time
on all their BS segments. Tape 6 hours of vids, scan through it, and if
you didn't get it try again! I was able to tape 18 hours of MTV in one 24
hour period without getting up in the middle of the night and without
taking off from work. If they are still running it, you should get it in
less than 2 days with this technique, and with a little luck you'll catch
it in the first or second taping session. Don't wait or it'll be gone.

   For those of you who didn't cathcch the last post I had here...I'm 
proposing
as many people from the NMS as possible take one day and call MTV's "Most
Wanted" and request RTthe video for RTB, that way those of us who haven't
see it, can do so and tape it, also breaking the Hammer/Michael Jackson
monotony that is always on.

   EVERYBODY who is interested mail me at the address below and request what
day you'd be most likely to do this.  And 2 days before we go into action,
   I'll post the day that is best to the most of us ...

   I've already gotten several responses...so let's tkeep them coming!!!
   What's 65 cents when it transforms the MTV into makes MTV show what WE 
want to see for one night!!
   Thanks...
