A clarification for the live album:

THE SETLIST HAS NOT CHANGED.
Although the promo sampler *DOES* have Analog Kid & The Pass, these two songs
are *NOT* on the live album. (Like the New World Man single w/"Vital Signs"
that didn't make ESL).

Hello there everybody...
	I was just wondering if anyone out there might have some good
snapshots from the November 1, 1996 show at the Bradley Center in
Milwaukee, WI.  If so, I'd like to purchase some reprints from you at a
reasonable price.  Please contact me at this email address if you do.
	I also have some comments and questions about the "Time to Roll"
CD.  It is a collection of live performances from Rush's 1992 "Roll the
Bones" tour.

	1.  Why is "Freewill" cut short?
	2.  As for the "Spirit of Radio"/"Anthem"/"Red Barchetta" medley
at the end of the CD, was this the way Rush performed it, or was that a
medley invented by the makers of the CD?
	3.  It is kinda interesting to hear the clapping in "Spirit of
Radio."

That's it for now, L8r on.

   I had the opportunity to catch DT in concert 2 weeks ago at Great Woods 
in Mansfield, Ma. They were part ofa three band concert along with ELP and
Deep purple. It seemed that a great many in attendance were unfamiliar with 
the band and were there to see either of the other of the other two bands. 
DT opened up and it didn't take long for people to quiet down and get to 
their seats and witness what was a very impressive performance by this 
unknmown band. They played a few from their recently released album, 
Falling to infinity, and a few from their impressive break through album, 
Images and Words. By the time they had finished with their short set the 
audience was very much in to it and it set the tone for the remainder of 
the concert. DT reminds me of early Rush in that they are relatively 
unknown but winning new fans at every show they do They sounded very true 
to their studio sound but weren't afraid to mix things up a little and 
improvise on occasion.
  Overall I was very much impressed with both their musicianship and stage 
presence and thought they were the best band at the concert. I would 
encourage any Rush fan to give DT a try. A good place to start would be 
with their studio album called "Images and Words".

Sorry for the lack of Rush content but I think there is plenty of Rush 
influence in DT's

I thought the red star on the cover of 2112 was supposed to be given the
appearance of being projected over water. Someone stated earlier
that it was too have the look of being on fire.  Any thoughts?

Also, what is the offical symbolism of the naked man against the star in
the classical 70's icon they used.  I had the impression it was the
nakedness
and purity of mankind resisting conformity and oppression of self opinion.
Any offical explanations? And why is Red used so much in many of their
songs?

   [ Hm, hasn't this come up before. Straight from the NMS web page (on the 
     page for 2112), here's Hugh's quote:

     "The man is the hero of the story.  That he is nude is just a classic
      tradition ... the pureness of his person and creativity without the 
      trappings of other elements such as clothing.  The red star is the evil 
      red star of the Federation, which was one of Neil's symbols.  We 
      basically based that cover around the red star and that hero.

     "Now, that hero and that kind of attitude about freedom of expression 
      and the band having that kind of feeling ... at the time, it never 
      ready occurred to me, to be honest with you, that they would adopt it 
      quite so seriously as a logo.  Because it's appeared just about 
      everywhere, thereafter."  -- Hugh Syme

                                                                 : rush-mgr ]

This is the same sound someone previously thought was a kazoo.  It is a
guitar massively distorted through a Fuzz Face distortion and a stack of
Marshalls, then overdubbed on the main riff.  By clipping the peaks of
the waveform, one gets a raspy, voice-like effect. It can be done with
any instrument or voice by using lots of distortion.  all you are
hearing is fuzzed harmonics.

ANTHEM - A TRIBUTE TO RUSH 

I saw Anthem, a Rush Tribute band, perform Friday night at Pinky's in Tucson
Arizona, What an incredible experience!
This three man trio put on a show that would give goose bumps to even the
most avid Rush fan.

I went to the show skeptical yet very hopeful. I had never heard or seen
Anthem perform. I had heard they were good but I was a pretty tough critic,
especially when it comes to covering Rush tunes. I was very anxious to see
what songs they would choose to do. Being a drummer myself, I was also very
anxious to see how well the drummer would play and how accurately he would
follow Neil's complicated drum riffs. 

The band played everything from Dreamline to Workingman.  I couldn't believe
how awesome each band member played. The guitarist was incredible, he
sounded so much like Alex it was crazy. I mean note for note, he nailed
it!!!!!!! 
The Bass player was great too, like Geddy, he sang and played the keys too.
His vocals wailed and sounded pretty damn close to Geddy's, and what a great
bass player he was, his fingers were flaming.
I kept catching myself becoming nostalgic about past Rush concerts. At one
point I closed me eyes and I swear it was just like I was listening to Rush
themselves play. That's how great the band was playing.
The best part was the drummer. He played so amazingly well. I think Neil
himself would have been impressed. When the band played YYZ and he broke
into a drum solo, I thought I was going shit!  He wasn't trying to play
Neil's drum solo, it was his own but you could definitely here strong Neil
influence.  What a performance! 

The songs they choose to play were great. Here are the songs they played:

Dreamline
Big Money
Anthem
Spirit of the Radio
Freewill
Closer to the heart
Analog Kid
Passage to Bangkok
Stick it Out
Lakeside Park
Something for Nothing
Side one of  2112 (in its entirety) 
Zanadu
YYZ (with drum solo)
La Villa Strangiato
The Trees
Natural Science
Red Barchetta
The Camera Eye
Half the World
I think I'm going bald
Test for echo
Vital Signs
Working Man/Finding my way
Subdivisions
Limelight

What a set list! If you ever have the chance to see these guys, do
yourselves a favor, check them out!!!
Anthem is truly a great Rush tribute band.

lot of people at first. 

I'm aware of this but never understood it.  How is a keyboard less of an
instrument?  How is Geddy less talented a composer by nature of the
instrument he uses?

>First, I don't think Geddy Lee has ever been much of a keyboard player, 
well, he's not Rick Wakeman, but he ain't bad and is getting better.

>and he was just experimenting with keyboard based compositions at the time. 

I disagree--this was when the keyboards came into their own.  AFTK and
HEm were the experimental era.

>Secondly, sequencers weren't too sophisticated at the time, and since 
>the band's philosophy has always been to produce music that can be 
>faithfully reproduced live, Geddy Lee often put away his bass in order 
>to play keyboards. The loss of bass fundamentally changes the feel of 
>the music. 

I've heard this, too. but there is no lack of killer bass in
Subdivisions, AK, NWM, among others.  And the Synth bass is pretty
heavy, too.
Now RTB was lacking in bass.  Who was that producer?  the tone-deaf one?

>With Alex Lifeson's switch from his more traditional lead guitar 
>approach to the 80's U2/Simple Minds "atmospheric" approach, the sound 
>of the band was transformed to something a lot of people weren't used to 
>or prepared for, especially following MP, which was a "classic" hard 
>rock album.

there were hints of that, and it was hard to hear on the original mix. 
So go back, crank up the CD or remaster, put on headphones, crank it up
until your eyes bleed, and play AK and the Weapon.  Hear that?  That's
distortion, son!  That's a guitar wailing.  Listen to the outro of Sub,
listen to the verses of Chemistry, listen to Digital man.  PLENTY of
guitar, and it's one of my favorite albums.  I think it has a nice
balance of components.  Washes of textural keys, booming bass, screaming
axe, oddball drums.  

On another note, finally listened to Victor.  Anyone else think that
"Shut Up Shuttin Up" compares well to Stu Hamm's "If You're Scared, Stay
Home!"?  A duet with Al and Stu?  That would be cool.  And Strip and GO
Naked is very Parsony and Floydy.  COOOLLL!!!!  A very versatile album
from the most underrated guitarist in rock.

I have early ABBA.  Before they committed the unforgiveable sin of
creating disco, they did some really decent guitar-screaming rock. 
Bjorn Ulvaeus can wail.  The only problem is, they were aiming for the
radio market.  None of the songs are long enough.  But "Eagle" and "Hole
in your Soul" and "Marrionette" come to mind as good guitar bits, with
bass that I can't identify--probably synth, but really cool.  

And then the eighties hit.  sigh.  But Anifrid Lynstadt had a good solo
album produced by Phil Collins.  Agnetha Faltskog did something tht I've
never been able to find, and Benny and Bjorn did a soundtrack for
"Ches," which I understand was a lame movie, but the music is a hoot.

that one cannot be a devil worshipper without belonging to the only

Do I sense some possible additions to many of your "skippable songs" lists?
Possibly Different Stages' "Tom Sawyer" and "Closer to the Heart"?

Remember that a live album must have something for everyone, and many buyers
of that album will love having those songs on there.  Also, don't be too hard
on the band and remember that they put that third disk on there for US, the
lifelong fans!  Celebrate!!!

Of course, I can hear "Analog Kid" and "Cold Fire" on some great boots I have,
but that's another thread.....

denimking@juno.com said "my opinion on rush haters is that they haven't heard
the right songs to get them started."

I can vividly remember listening for the first time to a 90 Maxell tape of
Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures, the first dupe my Rush "benefactor" duped
for me (hey kid, check this out, and pay attention!).  To this date, those two
albums blend together as a perfect double album.  Anyway, "Freewill", "Jacob's
Ladder", "Witch Hunt" & "Red Barchetta" epitomize Rush in my mind.  Those four
songs have it all, besides incredible musicianship and song writing, they
include Neil's sermon on freewill (obviously), the tapping our dreams, the
danger in blindly putting our faith in others, and one of their classic
science fiction tales.  

Anyway, those songs were my hook, and I swallowed it whole.  Just a suggestion
for your friendly neighborhood Rush haters.

funny.  that's what they said about Rush in '75.  Of course, the same
people raved about Buns n' Poses.

   [ Read the late '74 article from the Los Angeles Times about Rush for
     a good laugh.                                              : rush-mgr ]

Found the following quote while reading the Rolling Stone (no flames please)
cover story about country/pop artist Shania Twain (again, no flames):

When talking about her high school years in Canada she stated, "But I was so
high on music, and the music was so good - Supertramp and Rush and Pink
Floyd".

Something for us to ponder I guess.

actually, they have total creative control.  That's why they split with
mercury.  perhaps they like the refinements they've made to the songs. 
Or maybe it's a bogus setlist to appease the masses and get
attention--the record company might do that, now.  I can't say I'd be
impressed by another version of Tom Sawyer--between the videos and discs
I think there's 4 of them out there.  GUP video, ESL, ESL video, and
maybe ASOH video.  c'mon, guys!
and this retrospective effect with old photos--are they trying to act as
old as the joint-Rolling Stoners or Yes ( a good band that is gradually
losing focus)?

1) the album will be on the shelves by then, so Y2K can't affect it.
2)  I've been listening to Y2K paranoia for months--some idiot is even
claiming 60% of the world will die.  since less than 20% use any form of
computing system directly, that is obviously silly.  My programmer
friends aren;t worried, and I've been running 01/00 credit card
expiration dates through my terminal for months.  they've all cleared. 
The only danger in Y2K is the people who are hoping for masochistic
vindication by its occurence.  I wouldn't put it past the
conspiracy/Y2K/UFO/Ancient Astronaut types to CREATE a problem or six.

And I think Neil knows it, which is why he selected that date.  As far
as there not being another album, let's look at the record:

1974:  Rutsey quits, the band breaks up
1975:  COS flops, the band breaks up
1977:  they get arty, and use synths, the band breaks up
1980:  Geddy Lee is rumoured to have throat cancer, the band breaks up
1981:  With the prophetically titled "exit...Stage Left," the band
breaks up.
1983:  They seek a new producer, it is rumoured the band is breaking up
1984:  2 years after the typical radio listening moron hated Signals,
the band has yet to release another album, because they broke up
1985:  Neil's friend Robbie Whelan dies, the band breaks up
1986:  Ged and AL start producing other bands, because Rush has broken
up
1988:  Al talks about a solo album, because the band is breaking up
1989:  With the new live album prophetically entitled "A Show of Hands"
the band breaks up
1996:  Alex releases Victor, because the band has broken up
1997:  There is a death in Neil's family, the band breaks up
1998:  There is another death in Neil's family, the band breaks up
1998:  With the release of the prophetically titled "Different Stages"
and retrospective pictures, the band breaks up

I've got 50 more, but the clue-by-four should be apparent.

sorry to take up so much bandwidth--I've been gone for 6 weeks  National
Guard, Pennsic, Gencon, Worldcon, Michigan Shakespeare Festival.  I can

<A NAME="2088018">Subject: Setlist, Jackie, Neil</A>

I couldn't help but wonder if Neil didn't WANT some songs (eg Ghost of a
Chance) on the live album.  Live.  Alive.  Or perhaps wanted some songs
on it because of a positive connotation.  Rush has always been a
democracy and doubtless Neil had the opportunity for input, or at least
veto power.  They may also feel that the "new live" versions have
something to offer, to better themselves, than the older versions, and
may want us to have what they feel is their best recorded rendition.  I
agree, I'd have liked to see more not-yet-released-live stuff, but hey,
at this point you gotta hand it to Geddy and Alex.  Alex has always
loved music and recording, never taking a break up til now, and I think
Geddy is really stepping up to the plate in a much more cerebral and
active role in the band's business to get this record out.  My  heart
goes out to Neil because I too have suddenly found myself lower than I
ever thought possible and I don't see the light at the end of the
tunnel.  The ache doens't stop.  

Every song Neil has written must have a thousand memories based on when
and where it was composed -- what was going on in his life then -- maybe
songs which were particular favourites of his family's -- and these he
may not want included or may want included.

I'm just curious what form of cancer Jackie had -- because I'd like to
give money to that group.  Breast cancer took Linda McCartney this year
too.  I'm sure Jackie's will to fight must have been taxed by Selena's
death and I myself was wondering if they might have another child ...
she was not too old to do so.  But if she couldn't due to the cancer...
And I wonder if Selena might have been distracted thinking about her
mother and at the same time wanting to leave the nest on time and start
college.  I'm sure Neil is rethinking or thinking about his beliefs in
many things right now -- these are times that trust one's faith, whether
it's in a higher power or in yourself or both or neither.  There are
some who would be devastated to die childless without their spirit or
genes or whatever carried on through their children -- this is what has
happened to Jackie, and may happen to Neil.  These are all really
powerful things here that no one even wants to consider hapening to
them, must less have carved in stone the way they'll react.  When I say
"I'll pray for Neil" I mean I will, in my own way, include him and his
family in my contemplation in a focussed way.  I prayed for the TWA
flight victims, the Oklahoma City bombing victims, etc.  and I don't
know them and they will never be famous.  It ain't about just that,
folks.  "Every man's death diminishes me..."  

I haven't written in quite a while due to Life sucking so badly for me
since lsat year.  No one died or anything, but still, life has taken
some rotten turns.  I wouldn't be offended if you want to pray for me
in whatever way you cared to do, despite the fact that I have definite
beliefs in place.

With love to my Rush family, remembering and celebrating the music,

Made me think.  I've read Hit Men and if you're a musician, you may want

Live CD:  Yeah, I'm kinda bummed about no PRESTO representation on 
"Different Stages", but remember it is NOT a greatest hits album.  It is a
live album that has songs chosen for a reason, including "Tom Sawyer" 
"The Spirit of Radio" because it has to appeal to more than hard core
fans.
It needs to be enjoyed by the casual RUSH fan too.

     I have always dreamed of seeing Rush from 
the 1st row but never could get those "Row A" 
tickets even when camping out all night.  During the Roll The Bones tour
I again got 20th row tickets to see them in Madison Square Garden;
close but not the first row...About 30 minutes into the show the only
usher in my aisle walked
passed me; now was my chance, should I cut to the chase and go for the
first row?  I ran down the aisle driven by forces unknown and grabbed
the wooden plank separating Rush from me.  The seats belonged to these
two pimple faced kids next to me and they realized I was now their
permanent neighbor.   Everybody was on their feet and when they started
playing Xanadu
I was jumping so high I almost touched the ceiling!!!  Alex was making
eye contact and  knew I was a diehard and he seemed to enjoy coming over
when his solo's came up.  Was this happenning to me ?  It's still hard
to believe to this day but afterwards I did think that should be the
last time I ever saw Rush.  I skipped the Counterparts tour and I had
been a regular since Signals.  I had to catch them on  T4E to see 2112
and was in total awe seeing them do it from start to finish along with
Natural Science. Every Rush Fan's dream, being in the 1st row,
who says your dreams never do come true?

I have to agree with all the opinions I've read so far on the poor song
selection for Stages, at least as far as hardcore fans are concerned.
We've all played these songs to death and we're craving something new
and fresh.  For most of us that does not include a new version of TS or
CTTH.  In the event that someone with influence may read this.  Please
change the setlist!!!

To take an optimistic look at this situation, this album does live up to
it's title of "Different Stages".  If you have all the live albums (like
anyone reading this doesn't) then you can truly hear the stages the band
has passed through since so many songs on Stages have been on past live
albums.  However, I would gladly forego this wonderful educational
device and live eternally in ignorance to hear something new.

<A NAME="2088028">Subject: live album</A>

a few things on this whole live album uproar

1. is the setlist a joke?
i don't think so. i have the promo disks, and the songs are in a different
order than the setlist our peerless rush manager listed, but the songs are
all correct. they might change one song off the promos, but i doubt they'll
even do that. i believe the setlist we have is the one we're going to have
to live with.

2. should we be ticked off?
i'm disappointed, particularly about the absence of analog kid and half the
world. how in the world could you leave off half the world? the new versions
of the "repeats" are good, but not significantly different than what we've
heard before. however, to be ticked off does nobody any good. let's count
our blessings: an absolutely spine-tingling version of bravado-extended, a
great opening version of dreamline, a 20-year old concert boot that most of
us couldn't afford otherwise, their best-ever version of 2112 (great work,
alex!) and natural science. if somebody told you 10 years ago that rush
would put natural science on a live album in 1999, you would have told them
they were nuts.

3. what were they thinking with these repeats?
i don't know. they was probably record company pressure for the old
stand-bys, but i think a more likely explanation is that they wanted to
follow the theme "different stages," and they couldn't possibly illustrate
their different stages without including those repeated songs.

i think the boys have done us too well to be ticked off at them at this
point. they're coming off a tour where they played without an opener so they
could play for over two and a half hours. they're planning another studio
album. let's get over it. there is three hours of music on this release.
THREE HOURS. if you don't like the repeats, you're left with two hours of
music. use your "program" mode on the cd player and enjoy the show.

Yep, you spend hard earned money going to these last 4 Rush tours and buy
every album, spend $$$ on the t-shirts, the whole thing.  When the time
rolls around for the new live album, you would hope that you are a little
rewarded and get to hear A LOT of your favorite songs not yet available
live (Bravado, The Pass, Cold Fire, Scars, ...).   But no, you get CTTH for
the 3rd straight time.  I really like the song, but COME ON!  And I refuse
to lecture you guys with this dribble: "Well, you people should just be
glad that they're putting out another record..."  Screw that.  These guys
are making tons of money because of us: the die hard Rush fan. 

So here's my idea:

Why not make the live set 4 discs instead of three?  So what if I have to
spend an extra 10 bucks?  I'd gladly pay it to get songs like Double Agent.
 Do you really think that the casual Rush listener is going to pay $25-$30
for a 3-disk live set anyway?  Stop kidding yourself.   Put anything and
everything you can from Presto on there, everyone on this list would
probably buy 2 copies.  Now that I think about it, Atlantic Records
probably knows that they're going to sell at least 500,000 copies anyway
(thanks to us), so why bother?

I also heard a rumor (I think from RushMgr) that a boxed set may be in the
works?  Great, another attempted money-maker.  This MUST be a Mercury
records idea (would you buy a remastered copy of the Scorpions' "Lovedrive"
album?)  I'm so tired of seeing boxed sets that  contain 95% previously
released material.  I refuse to buy this crap anymore! The best $55 I've
ever spent on a boxed set was for Bruce Springsteen's 1975-1985 Live 3 disc
set.  I believe this contained ALL previously unreleased live songs.  I can
tell you that it was definately released for the fans.  If Rush would ever
do this, maybe I'd even buy 2 copies.

Hello all,
Long time listener, first time poster (if u will).Anyway, I have a hunch 
that this 'possible' Rush boxset is going to come out sometime in 1999. Why, 
you ask? I think it's to commemorate (did i spell that right??) there 25 year 
anniversary as a band. I also think that this is where you will find the T4E 
concert video. Think about it. Add a disk or two in there of live songs that 
didn't make it on "Different Stages", along with some rare photos and maybe 
even that CD-ROM we keep hearing about, and you have marketing genius! (not 
that we wouldn't buy ANYTHING that Rush puts out anyway!) It does make sense. 
Just think how awsome that would be! I just hope that Red Barchetta makes it 
on there (some GREAT geddy bass playing on the end of that classic tune!) 
Anyway, this is just my humble thought. What do you think?

Actually The Hip has already been on tour right across the US for a number

they'll be playing in Ohio and then have a show in Maryland on the 24th. At

Let's face it the list is getting kind of stale, and the Rush-Mgr must be
getting tired.  Consider it a fitting time to end ?

okay, my thoughts on the new live album setlist.  i agree with all the 
"(fill in the song)  again" and "closer to the heart for the 3rd time" 
comments (except 2112, which will be a very evolved interpretation of 
epic material and quite different from the version on ATWAS).  2112 
notwithstanding, i couldn't be more disappointed with this setlist if i 
tried.  and the notion that this will be marketed as the best of rush is 
asinine.  if the forthcoming album is really "the best of rush" then 
where the fu*k is la villa, barchetta, vital signs, witch hunt, camera 
eye, ladder, passage, lakeside park, in the end, finding my way, 
subdivisions, new world man (the highest charting rush song in the u.s.), 
distant early warning, red sector a, big $, mystic rhythms, project, 
presto, the pass, show don't tell, hand over fist, superconductor, 
available light, time stand still, mission, turn the page and force 
fucking 10?????  GIMME A FREAKIN' BREAK SRO!!!! 
this album is missing an entire era of the band, signals-presto are 
absent from the setlist and your telling me this is the best of rush?  we 
smell the dung you're shoveling.  it stinks.  that says a lot about what 
they think of rush in the 80's.  moving pix (released in early 1981) is 
represented and roll the bones (released september 1991) is represented.  
10 years of rush is missing--40% of their career, and this is going to be 
marketed as the best of rush?  i guess we know who this album is being 
released for--it's not the real fans, as we have been led to believe with 
the inclusion of this so-called bonus show that is more or less a carbon 
copy of ATWAS.  this album is for the pussies who will only buy a 
compilation album and recognize songs like ts, sor, and ctth.  the fact 
that they are including a gift for the fans who have stuck with them for 
all the years is a joke.  come on geddy, the fans that have stuck with 
you already bought the best of rush when they bought archives, atwas, 
esl, asoh, chronicles, retro 1, and retro 2. and along with that, the 
real fans have all the albums and the remasters.  we have closer to the 
heart on aftk, aftk remaster, esl, esl remaster, asoh, asoh remaster, and 
retrospectives 1 (7 times already).  and now we're getting it for the 
eighth time, not the 3rd time as many have stated.  even if you eliminate 
the remasters, retrospectives 1 is still a best of compilation that 
counts as a separate release for closer to the heart (so at least 4 times 
already ctth has been released).  if anyone cares what the real fans 
really want on the live album then keep reading.  we just want the 
standard "here is our latest stuff live every fourth studio album" like 
we've gotten in the past.  i respected the balls it took to ditch sawyer 
and spirit on asoh.  where are those balls now???  we want the pass, cold 
fire, double agent, show don't tell, superconductor, virtuality (i 
guess), half the world, time and motion, where's my thing, scars, and war 
paint.  we also want the old shit that was played live that never made 
the previous live albums like the body electric, countdown,  lock and 
key, the enemy within, chemistry, digital man, new world man, grand 
designs, territories, middletown dreams, red lenses, hemispheres, camera 
eye, vital signs, ladder, between the wheels, and goddammit we still want 
the fucking ANALOG KID!!!!!  i'm sorry for the rant here, but i am so 
pissed off, i just had to get this off my chest.  i apologize for missing 
some songs that were played live that we want on a live album.  but i 
just feel like the real fans are getting SCREWED BIG TIME on this live 
album, and rush is selling out to the mainstream which is something we 
have loved them for not doing for the past 28 years.  please post your 
thoughts on this matter.

"Mike Bahr, where the hell are you?  I'm still waiting on my copy of
Virtual Songs.  It was sent out over a month ago according to your
webpage.  I've sent three e-mails in the last month and haven't heard
from you.  Please write back. "

in case you didn't know, prism is closed.  but that's no excuse for the 
lack of attention this guy is paying to his emails.  he runs a business 
and is blowing off everyone.  his website updates are full of shit.  he 
has not sent out almost all the orders, or people like you and me would 
have gotten them.  it's been six weeks since i ordered and mike says he's 
sent basically everything received outside 2-3 weeks ago.  NOT!  i've 
been emailing him for 2 weeks with no reply.  i'm quite upset about it, 
and i have good reasons for emailing him, but he just doesn't answer cuz 
he's wrapped up in his new game store.  it's a sad affair.
just thought i'd let you know you aren't alone in getting dissed by 
prism.  later.
