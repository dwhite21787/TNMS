I'm very sorry that all the news is coming so late (about the benefit concert).
I'm also trying to sort through all the rumors flying about on the upcoming
live album. I've heard it's 3 cd's, I've heard 4 cd's, I've heard a tour
is in the works for November (yeah right). I would go on what Rob posts below,
hearing it from Andrew. That's about as close as we can get to the band for
now...

I don't remember who started the stereo thread, but I'll toss my system into
the ring:

Harman/Kardon 8340 5-disc CD changer
Theta Digital Cobalt 307 D/A converter
Audio Alchemy Digital Line Controller
Acurus A80 amplifier
NHT SuperOne loudspeakers
Grado Prestige SR125 headphones

It's a good budget system as far as audiophile gear goes. A little punchless
in the bottom octaves (the NHTs drop off HARD after 60 Hz), but it's about as
good a system as you'll find for $1500 (and you could do it for less if you
bought
the stuff used). It images exceptionally well -- I can pick out the boys'
places in
the soundstage with ease -- and although I can't get the system above 105 dB,
within that limit, I rarely find myself suffering listening fatigue. The Grado
SR125
headphones are criminally good, although at $150, people who are used to
cheap Sony earbuds may cringe at the price. But when your neighbors are
complaining (that's life in a college dorm), they're absolutely the way to go
for kick-ass rock.

interesting stuff. You just have to look CLOSELY.

> A little late for April Fools, eh?

Hmmm. I'm not sure what to make of a *possibly* serious reply to an  
*obvious* joke. But I'll take it as an invitation to expand upon my
ludicrous premise, and for flame-prevention (thanks, Danny) I will hang
up the following billboard-sized sign:

THIS IS A JOKE

Rush's decision to go with a "Victor"-type marketing strategy was a
clever one, devised by the band themselves but inspired by none other
than Bill "B-Man" Banasiewicz, who in a last-ditch effort to restore
himself to the good graces of Rush resorted to an ingenious hypnotic
technique (over the phone, no less) called "auto-suggestion". Details of
*how* this ruse will benefit B-Man are unclear at this point. 

Nevertheless, the most original feature of this marketing strategy was
the decision to go with no name or album title *whatsoever*, resulting
in mass confusion for record store stocking clerks everywhere. Where to
file it? How to order it, for that matter? (Well, in the case of Tower
and other large chains, it was "auto-shipped"). 

Since there is no identification outside, the product must be opened in
an attempt to determine it. Hugh Syme was enlisted to create a unique
3-D "swirling pentagram" on the back of the front sleeve that will
*instantly program the viewer's mind* to hum out loud the bass riff of
War's "Low Rider" at approximately 37-minute intervals. The significance
of this is currently indeterminate. However, the CD ends up being filed
at random in the bins.

Obviously, this will end up being a popular purchase choice because of
its very mystery. It will spread like wildfire by word-of-mouth that the
new Rush album is out. Zero marketing/promotion dollars spent, yet...
you get the picture.

On the touring side, the guys have simply tired of the grind of
rehearsals and lugging all that gear around. By touring separately, they
can cover more ground in less time. The stock disclaimer when people
discover only one member is playing at any particular gig will be that
"Geddy/Alex" etc. were indisposed for personal reasons, and we
apologize". Given a chance to see just one of them (accompanied by local
talent) at your neighborhood bar, would *you* complain?

The repertoire will be richer and more varied, of course, with a
hitherto unheard of (for Rush) looseness. Sets may contain covers of
non-Rush material and even Grateful Dead-like extended improv jams.
Bootleggers will cream their jeans, being guaranteed incomes for life.
Bottom line: Everybody wins.

Sources close to the band reveal that a special treat for select
audiences will be the (aforementioned; unclear if it relates to further
diabolical mind-control schemes) Low Rider/Vital Signs/Red Lenses/On
Broadway medley.

I hope this answers your questions.

Subjunctively yours,

Sean Carroll

>I am extremely upset at Mercury/ PolyGram for following

>mastering information on the sleeve.

I understand your recording query, but what do you mean by mixdown and
mastering?  Today, nearly all nationally released CDs are digitally mixed
and mastered, even if not digitally recorded.  The quality of analog
recording today probably beats 1980s digital efforts.  It's all in the
mixin' anyway.  At that point it's turned into 1s and 0s.

I agree, it would be cool if they still listed the ADD or DDD, to satisfy
curiosity.  But I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between an ADD
and DDD on anything recorded since 1990, anyway.

     Hi fellow Rushians:
     
     I'd like to thank Greg for pointing out that Rush is played on the 
     house system at The Elm Street Rock Cafe in Oslo back in NMS #2049.
     
     My wife, Kristin, is a native born Oslonian.  We visit Oslo every 
     summer, and in a few weeks we plan on sippin' some Norsk Ol (Norwegian 
     Beer) and listen to some Rush.  
     
     If there are any of you that will be in Oslo in July, please email me! 
     Or, if there any Norsk Rush fans that read this, let's get together 
     for a cald Ringnes!

<A NAME="2052009">Subject: U2 AND RUSH THREAD...</A>

U2, Rush and the Police once played together in the Isle of Wight, I
believe.Maybe '81,'82. Back when U2 was still good. As far as Rush
lacking in emotional content, have you listened to "Totem" or "Resist"
off of TFE? Or "Red Barchetta" or "Freewill" or "Marathon" or "Something
for Nothing" or "Bacchus Plateau",et.al.? Point: Rush plays with
conviction, and a firm belief in the subjects they choose to sing about.
They don't rely on cheap histrionics to convey a point; they just
believe that their own convictions will sell the song to the listener.
Has U2 made an album with firm convictions, beliefs, and GREAT
musicianship since The Unforgettable Fire? I think that would be the
response of most NMSers regarding U2 today. Not to say that they weren't
once a good band. But even comparing them integrity-wise to Rush is
shameful. Try to listen to the songs above and see if you don't get
goosebumps or feel uplifted. I know I do.

<Maiden is good, Rush is better>

One important thing to remember is that this is your opinion. I love 
Rush , but my all time favorite band is Led Zeppelin. But I don't come 
on here saying that they are better than rush or vice versa. Everybody 
likes something different. I'm definitely not against rush though. I'm 
listening to YYZ as I type this :)

Please don't everyone start typing in Zep-Rush comparisons now, that was 
not the point of this posting.

One last thing, Does any one know any thing about Rush's next release?
Thanks for your time

Well, anyways, on with the thread pulling...
FIRST OFF, I can't stand country, no yodels for me, please... I also 
can't stand celine dion. Don't even yell at me. I can express my 
opinnions just like you can.
>Now to my main point.  For all you Madrigal fans out there, does the

>go "in vain to search for Order, or i v t s f Honor?  The lyrics say
>order, but listening to the song, it sounds more like honor.

Really? The lyrics sheet says order? I've sung it Honor since I was 
eight. In fact, I have the lyrics typed out in fancy font with a border 
around it on my door, (it being one of my FAV rush tunes) I've had it 
for a good five years up there! It was printed out on my old dot matrix 
tractor feed..... (it's still sitting here)
>>>And on that note, I'd like to say that IMHO, AFTK is the most 
underrated album, well along with RTB. Those are my two favorites and to 
me those seem like the ones nobody really cares for! It's sad. AFTK 
being the first Rush CD i got into heavily, RTB becoming more meaningful 
as the philisophic deep reveals...
YOU'RE WELCOME to those of you who liked my YYZ story. I have another 
one, also funny, I love high school.
>Our high school football team made it to finals this year, so in order 
to celebrate our school had a "Spirit Week" Kinda stupid, one day was 
blue and gold day (our school colors) spirit tatoo day (kids passed out 
blue and gold tatoos with our beloved mascot- the blue devil *lol*) PJ 
day (wear your pajamas to school) some other day I can't remember, and 
HAT DAY. I wore my Counterparts hat which I discovered at the local 
Value City for five bucks! I'd worn it and finally, during fourth period 
some one said, "Do you know you have a f@!#ing symbol on the back of 
your hat?" I turned around, slightly confused. "A f@!#ing symbol... on 
your hat." I took the hat off (stupid me) and looked at the counterparts 
symbol on the back. I had to agree, so I just smiled and nodded, not 
really wanting to explain that Rush doesn't exactly mean it in the f@!# 
sense....(at least that's not the way I take it to mean... New thread, 
perchance?)
>And there was at the Mighty Mighty Bosstones concert in Loretto. (i am 
a huge bosstones fan!) They had two openers, I didn't remeber what the 
first was, the second being "Clowns for Progress" then the bosstones. 
Well, after clowns for progress filed off stage, the sound guys played 
some filler music... suddenly what do I hear? The few electronic 
beginnings of Tom Sawyer. They didn't play a whole lot, but I picked out 
the few bars.... I went over to the sound guy and said, "Hey, in that 
mix you just played, did I hear Tom Sawyer bu Rush?" the guy I asked 
didn't know, but the other sound man in earshot  siad, yes, indeed it 
was. We started to talk about rush, we both agreed that Roll The Bones 
was our favorite album, and that we both liked the older stuff better, 
and T4E wasn't the greatest, (no flames... just opinnions, as previously 
stated) then I mentioned that my one goal in life was to go to a rush 
concert. he says to me, "Well, when you do look for me. I'll be standing 
right here." (meaning the sound console) "Yeah, I know rush. I'll take 
you back to meet the guys. You are the youngest rush fan I've ever met, 
so I bet I'll remember you." then he went on to say that they probably 
wouldn't tour again for about three years or so, and with luck, he'd 
remember me. My dad gave him one of his business cards.... (Phil Reigh 
Sound! YEAH!!!) and I stood there, by the sound console, watching the 
bosstones show, excited..... (about rush, more so, but excited none the 
less) Just thought I'd pass that along to you... Plus, I don't have a 
car, but thanx to all of you on the "Red Barchetta" thread, I think my 
first car will be a very powerful red Ford (exact type not yet 
determined... probably old and used)

<A NAME="2052015">Subject: super 2112</A>

ok, y'all, i constructed a "super 2112" using 2112 and both Cygnuses. I
have, in essence, created one song that is a little more than 49 minutes
long.... to do this, you will need to find out how long the "fader" on your
CD player fades for, because the times I give are for the final pause at the
end of the fade. for example, if your CD player has a 5-second fade, and i
say to stop at 21.12, press fade at 21.07. you get the point.

ok, break out those 100 (110 for buffer) minute tapes and here we go:

instructions for 2112-Special Edition:

1. PLAY "2112"
FADE out ending at 15.53
2. PLAY "Cygnus Book II"

3. PLAY "Cygnus Book I"
STOP at end of song
4. PLAY "Cygnus Book II" fading in starting at 11.59 or so
FADE out at 16.45 (I don't think The Sphere fits in with the story somehow)
5. PLAY "2112" fading in starting at 15.54 or so

do y'all understand? if not i'll clarify it.

ok, so, ultimately, here's the song:

2112-The Special Edition
I. Overture
II. The Temples of Syrinx
III. Discovery
IV. Presentation
V. Oracle - The Dream
VI. Hemispheres Prelude
VII. Apollo (Bringer of Wisdom)
VIII. Dionysus (Bringer of Love)
IX. Armageddon (The Battle of Heart and Mind)
X. Cygnus Prologue
XI. Astral Door (my name for part one of Cygnus Book I)
XII. Siren Song (part two)
XIII. Sound and Fury (part three)
XIV. Cygnus (Bringer of Balance)
XV. Soliloquy
XVI. Grand Finale

there! now all I need to do is somehow tie in by-tor, necromancer, lamneth,
xanadu, la villa, the trees, natural science, and the camera eye... hmm what
a story that would be! of course, i think i would need to use VHS tape to
hold all that....

that reminds me, does anyone have any experience recording to VHS tape from

Hello all!
     I stopped into Media Play Sunday afternoon to buy the
"Trainspotting" soundtrack (the movie is fantastic too). While perusing
the racks, I hear 2112 Overture and Temples... over the CD sales' area

As a longtime subscriber to the NMS, I'd be interested to know if there's
any other graduates of Bob Jones University (Greenville, SC) out there.  If
you know anything about Bob Jones U., you will understand my curiousity.
Bob Jones is probably the strictest, religious liberal arts college in the
world.  For starters, no rock music was allowed (hell, contemporary
Christian music wasn't even allowed).  As such, my friend and I had to sneak
off campus to listen to ESL, Signals and P/G.  After three years, I
graduated in '84 to get on with my life.

I even remember Rush playing just two miles away in Greenville in December
of 1991.  I, of course, was forbidden to go.  I'm still bitter thinking of
all the Rush shows I missed during college.  It was sweet revenge to go back
and be in the front row at the Presto tour opener in Greenville.

Anyway, just curious.  I'd be interested in hearing from any other BoJo's
out there.

well, there are only 3 stations here (just outside fargo, nd) that play
rush, solid rock Q98, 95.1 the Zone (oooh....), and 107.9 the Fox.  95.1
used to play only "alternative" music (as 95X), but then changed their
image to 95.1 the Zone.  that was all crap all the time (hanson, etc.). 
then they decided to go up against Q98 (30 year old veteran, still the
best) and play good music, strangely, 95.1 plays MORE rush than the Fox
(classic rock) and Q98 (solid rock).  i've heard subdivisions, tom
sawyer, spirit of radio, closer to the heart, freewill, and maybe one or
2  others.

i was quite disappointed in the people of fargo & moorhead when Q98 did
their top 500 artists on memorial day weekend.  people went to northwest
audio (stereo equipment) to fill out a little contest form and name a few
favorite songs.  i only remember hearing rush ABOVE 300, 325 i believe...
roll the bones.  of course i didn't listen to the 200's that much, but i
listened to a lot from 200 down, and guess what... no Rush!!

the #1 song... Alice in Chains, the man on the box!!  granted, it's their
only good song, but what happened to the best stuff?  foreigner, yes,
journey, rush, u2, aerosmith, r.e.m., foghat, grand funk?  JIMI HENDRIX?!
 the people of fargo really need to start listening to good music (there
are only about 10 fm music stations, and 4 are country!)

any opinions?

Whenever you guys have questions about lyrics, you must ask me, as I know
everything, whch will save you all the time while you meander on the subject
in ignorance.

In "Kid Gloves" everybody wants to know about "Anger wear a crown of thorns,
Reverse the golden rule."  You see, Geddy has a friend named John Anger, who
happens to be a really rich civil engineer.  John is also a clumsy gardener,
and one day tripped and fell head first into his rose bush, hence the crown of
thorns.  He then decided to make a fence in front of the bush to prevent
himself from falling into it again, as he was measuring it with a yardstick,
he realized he was using the English side instead of the Metric side, so he
turned it around, hence "Reverse the golden rule." And all of John's tools
were very expensive, that's why they were golden.

See, I could have saved you all lots of trouble.

Anyway, not that anyone but I care, but I listen to:

"Force Ten" - whenever I go driving on the highway
"Analog Kid" - when I need motivation
"Limbo" - when I need to think about something
"In the End" - when something is ending

So there.--Armen

Ouch!  I must ask, how old are you?  Your comments lead me to think you missed

As a 28 year old raised in the Borough of Schmeng, I must submit that Tempest
was once the King of video games.  During a time when all games were still
emulating Space Invaders (i.e. Galaga, Galaxian, Centipede), along came
Tempest with the first 3-D graphics available (albeit lines on xyz planes) and
those ooh-so-cool sounds.  Next came Battlezone, the 3D tank game, but Tempest
was once the undisputed king (at my local 7-11, anyway).

   When you listen to a Rush song you have the benefit of both great music 
and great lyrical writing to help portray what the band is expressing to 
it's audience. With this in mind what would be the Rush song that best 
paints a mental picture based on both the music and the lyrics in 
concurrence.

For me it would be "Witch Hunt" because whenever I hear this song I can 
picture the mob gathering to lay judgement on those that don't conform to 
the laws of the day. I can picture the incensed mob carring out it's 
pre-ordained duty while justifying it's actions without any sense of 
remorse. This may come off sounding over dramatic but this is exactly the 
mental picture that I get when listening to "Witch Hunt".

Anyone else have a defining song which best paints a mental picture ?

In NMS #2050, "Chris Palo" <double_agent54@hotmail.com> told a story
where his co-worker made the remark that Rush was (were?) "F%$#ing
Satanists!" because their albums were "Pentagrams and naked people."

When I first joined the NMS, I looked through the FAQ lists to find out
about that idea/rumor/thought, because I had been told that myself.  So
what's the story behind those images?  Is it the character in 2112
trying to fight against the government oppression of the "red star"?  Or
is there something else to it?

Personally, I think if Rush were directly connected to Satan, their
music would be more of the "sex, drugs, & rock-and-roll" ilk that comes
from bands more strongly associated with the devil.  (Of course, if you
don't have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, you've got an
indirect connection to that evil one...)

Tues June 9 was the White Ribbon Benefit Concert.  

The lineup were as follows, The dexters were the band..
Singer/guitarists from Wide Mouth Mason
Singer/guitarists from Tea Party
Edwin  
Colin James
ANd Alex Lifeson..

It was amazing, one of the best I have ever seen Alex perform.
I was against the stage, so listen to my story.

My buddies and I got to  the Pheonix Concert THeatre here in Toronto pretty 
early.  We were the first ones there.  ABout 6pm Alex and a friend walk up 
to us and said hi etc..
He looked really good, all dressed in black, all tanned... Ready to rock.

We got in and we went right to the stage.  As the show went on, one by one 
artists would be announced until ALex was.  The place went nuts, he played 
two songs with the dexters and he was just wailling on that guitar, it was so 
amazing, you had to see his expression on his face.  He was on fire.  Blew 
every guitarist that evening out of the building.   A guitar solo, awsome.  
Then at the end of the sets,  every artist came on stage and played two songs 
together.  You had at least 6 guitarist including ALex.  But you can see Alex 
was the man.

Then one of the singers, you have to remember that all the other quitarist/
singers were good looking, lots of woman that evening.
Trust me I  know...  SO one of the guys, I think it was the singer for Tea 
Party, grabs this girl from the croud and starts danicng with her.  Then Edwin 
goes over and jumps in. 
Then she runs away from them, embarases them and runs to Alex, we went nuts.  
She was all over ALex, his face turned red like an apple..

She takes out two Rush cover Cds out of her Bra.  And shows them to ALex, he 
couldn't stop laughing.  I was also dying of laughing.  The other "good 
looking guys" were just there doing shit.  Then she left and went back into 
the crowd.  The place started chanting ALex Alex Alex...

What an evening, I love this CITY.   I really wish you guys were here to see 
the amazing ALex do his stuff, from 2 feet away.  I have  never seen him so 
pumped in my life.
