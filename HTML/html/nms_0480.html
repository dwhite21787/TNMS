Wow,  Just seen two rush shows at birmingham UK.

Firstly I know I'll get flamed for this but, here goes :
  PRIMUS WERE CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (any flames to my address - not the nms)

(sorry it's just my opinion)

As for Rush they were excellent.  Geddy's voice seemed to be standing up well,
Neil didn't drop a single stick on either night and lifeson thinks he can play
keyboards with his nose.

The first night I had a seat which was a bit to the left of the stage, and
found it a bit difficult to see.  The second night I was bang in the middle
and so could see perfectly.

As with any show there are a great list of songs I would have liked to hear, 
but
I wouldn't want to have missed any that they did play either.

They boyz seemed more relaxed on the second of the two nights.  Alex had a go 
at
singing lead vocals towards the end of closer to the heart.

Any way I won't bore everybody with all the details.

Cheers

TJM

In issue 472 Dan was commeting on what Geddy sings on ASOH during in the Mood.
It is easier to pick up on the video especially if you can lip read a bit.
It is diificult to make out because it seems like Geddy and Alex sing different
things:
   Alex appears to sing "Hey Geddy"
   While Geddy sings "Hey Alley"
Just a bit of playing around at the end of the show?

Also I believe Geddy's wife is (was) called Nancy according to the book
Visions. Whether the band are still married to the parties mentioned in the
book I don't know, but there are pictures of Nancy Lee from the earlier days
up to more recently in the afore mentioned text, not to mention a note of
thanks from the author for helping to provide cuttings.

        A long time ago I encountered a record like the bootleg described,
but only as a Mad magazine novelty.  You never know what you're going to
hear when you play it.  There were at least 5 different grooves cut into it.
        Anybody have info on Indianapolis IN shows this summer or late spring?
     Also, since when does Rush work in the summer?  I thought that was
the last thing they would ever think of doing.  It will be EXTREMELY
weird to see the boyz in May or June or (god forbid) OUTSIDE!!!!

Rushppl:  Well, bear with me if this is a weird format or anything, but
  the results of the instrumental poll follow....  Thanks to all who
  participated in this (I got a bit of a surge of responses at the end).
  Even if no one else finds this interesting, at least I do! :)

The Question:

  What is Rush's best instrumental song?

The Songs:

  (OVE)  2112  I. Overture
  (GrF)  2112  VII. Grand Finale
  (LVS)  La Villa Strangiato
  (WMT)  Where's My Thing? (Part IV, "Gangster of Boats" Trilogy)
  (YYZ)  YYZ

Results:

  LVS 37.21% [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
  YYZ 30.23% [][][][][][][][][][][][][]
  OVE 16.28% [][][][][][][]
  WMT 11.63% [][][][][]
  GrF  4.65% [][]

Comments:

  Well, La Villa Strangiato edged out YYZ... and Where's My Thing? did
a lot worse than I was expecting.  I can't quote everyone's reasons, of
course, (for those who gave reasons, anyway) but I'll quote a few....

"I think that La Villa's more interesting and challenging -- they even
 had to settle for the final Hemisphere's version as dubs from 3
 different takes."   [that was news to me...]
  Thomas J. Julien  <tomj@orl.mmc.com>

"[LVS is] a great musical work with ideas that are not only developed,
 but actually intertwined with other ideas within the work!"
  Glenn I. Simon  <RMATHIAS@ucs.indiana.edu>

"It's [WMT is] a great tune, with one of the best melodies the band has
 ever come up with, and I really like the tight and restrained playing."
 [This was just a comment... his vote went to LVS....]
  Robert Piercey  <rpiercey@kean.ucs.mun.ca>

[Here's my favorite comment, in response to my question of "What about the
 overture to 2112?"]: "Oh yeah... I forgot about that." [sorry, Josh :)]
  D. Joshua Chapman  <chapman@pecan.cns.udel.edu>

Well, that's about it....  I at least hope that SOMEONE found this as
  interesting as I did.  For some reason, I really didn't expect LVS
  to win at all, but then again, what the hell do I know??
Hey... does "What's Rush's best instrumental?" get to be put on the
  FAQL now??  Heh... naah, no one else will bother asking a stupid
  question like that again.  Anyway, thanks again to everyone who
  participated, and thanks for not screaming at me to stop posting
  about this....

O.K.  here is the scoop on the Rush 'n Roulette thing (I think).  I
am an RTVF major, and have gone through houndreds of archives.
Around 1981, Mecury Records sent out a promo pacage to various radio
stations to increase Rush's airplay.  Now that I think about it, it
may have been a few years earlier.  Anyway, it was called Rush 'n
Roulette and subtitled "Everything your listeners wanted to hear from
Rush, but you were afraid to play".  The cover was white with a black
roulette wheel on it.  The failure of this attempt to market Rush,
however, was (here you go with the answer) that the stupid engineer
that was selected to put the thing together set the record up so that
when the needle was dropped, the stylus could follow any of five
various paths - sheer insanity for programming minded directors!!!
Since the album included selections from 2112, COS, & ESL, the poor
d.j. could end up playing an eleven minute song without knowing and
how would you announce it, "Here's something by Rush"?  It is very
rare and the stations I have found that still have a copy, will not
let it go!  I HAVE seen it at a convention once, but it was like
$75.00 - yikes!!!There is also a two record boot out that is called
Rush 'n Roulette with the promo cover on it and it is a boot of the
Chicago Ampitheatre Moving Pictures show. I think in December od 1981,
and is pretty good quality if you can find it (it's in a box).

Now, about Rush Profiled, it came to stations with a cool blabk
pencil that says "Rush  Presto" on it in gold lettering.  The pencil
has a tophat where the eraser should be, oh yah, the tophat has a
bunnies head on a spring popping out of it.  It came with station
promts, so that d.j's could pretend like they were talking to the
boyz themselves.  I have a copy off CD of it in its entirty if anyone
wants it (couldn't get the real thing).  Just mail me your request at
moliva@gab.unt.edu - and do it quick, School's winding down.  See ya
soon!

P.S.  Anyone want to trade?

>>>And re "Didacts and Narpets," since it's come up (again) ... I've
said it before and I'll say it again: The lyrics are almost
certainly deliberately ambiguous. You pretty much hear what you
want to hear, which is probably the idea. And if "one of the
boyz" really did say in an interview that the lyrics are along
the Adult/Child theme, I sure wish the specific interview and
specific quotes could be cited - that would be the most
definitive answer yet to this enduring mystery.
<<<

I have with me the October 1991 news release from 'The Rush Backstage Club'
It's "From the desk of Neil Peart" dated June 18,1991

Lisa Gabriel asked...."What are the words to the song "Didacts And
Narpets"? I have listened closely but the majority of the words are still
a mystery."

Neils responce was.....
Okay, I may have answered this before, But if not, the shouted words in
that song represent an argument between Our Hero and the Didacts and
Narpets - teachers and parents. I honestly can't rememer what the
actual words were, but they took up opposite positions like: "Work! Live!
Earn! Give!" and like that.

I have to admit that a few of those parody songs were pretty good.  I
still think that "Mobile Homes", Matt's Roll The Bones paroday is one of
the best I have ever read (I guess I bias, I wrote the rap section), that
last RTB parody didn't cut it for me, oh well.

I read in some article about Rush Alex is of Yugoslavian descent, not
Russian. Whether he's Kroatian or Servian or whatever, I don't know.
Yugoslavian used to be accurate enough... Lifeson is indeed the
translation of his name, Zivojinovic.

Just a quick note:  since tix are being sold through Ticketbastard this
Saturday (supposedly), I called them to find out the price.  Well, they
don't know anything.  Twice they said that the price, the time the tix go
on sale, etc. ad nauseum is labelled "TBA".  I am calling them again
now...

[Later]...Okay, after a talk with a very helpful lady, she gave me an
information number, where no one is answering at this moment.  For anyone
in the NY, NJ, or Connecticut area, the number is (516)-221-1000.  If
anyone can find out how much the tickets are, I would be MOST grateful,
since I have to buy 4 tickets and need to know how much money to bring.

In reference to the post about the random play album, I too have seen it.
A guy I used to work with had one.  As I remember, he got it from a local radio
radio promo.  It was a regular Mercury release and contained 6 songs on a side.
The same 6 songs were repeated on the reverse side.  When you looked at the
album it looked like it was just one song on the side ( no shiny gaps between
tracks).  I would have seen it around '83 or '84 but I think it was from the
Moving Pictures time frame (hard to remember that long ago).  All six tracks
started at the beginning and it was totally random which one you would hear.

May I have that pop can when you're through?

Oh, I'm waiting for next payday

Hard to drive with just 3 tires
And I see the dog through very hungry eyes

One more week
Until I'm paid
Then I'll buy a can of Raid
Next I'll eat a hearty meal
And give Grandma a proper burial

Ok- here is the ticket information on the show at Spac which as you all should

usal means of the Ticket master.

Rush has been confirmed to play Alpine Valley on Saturday June 27.  I do not
think tix are on sale yet, but maybe some of you Mid-westerners can shed
some light on that.  I believe that this may be the last night of the tour.
