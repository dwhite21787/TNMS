Well, since I won't be around for the next two days, I figured I'd send
out this special Thanksgiving edition.  This is mainly a vehicle for the
new and improved tour list, but I figured I'd also send out those mail
items that had come in already today.

Enjoy,

<A NAME="108002">Subject: "The drill" and BB&B</A>

Greetings everybody!

I just want to bring up a little fact about "the drill" that no one
has seemed to bring up yet. I was at the show at the Shoreline Amphi-
theater on June 27 (26?) this past summer. This was the fifth and final
Presto show I would see on this tour. During this show they had a little
extra treat that wasn't included in any of the previous shows I attended.
Because the place is big, and it is outside, they decided to set up three
giant screens. So everybody could see, they filmed the band while they were
playing and projected it onto these three screens. It was really neat! It was
like watching another ASOH video, but done Presto style. (BTW if anyone got
a copy of this video please let me know!) Now onto "the drill" part. During
"In the Mood" Mr Big came on to the stage and started playing with Rush.
During this time, Alex runs off stage and grabs ... you guessed it!..."the
drill!" He then starts playing the In the Mood solo with the Makita drill!
It was a very funny thing to see. They showed a nice closeup shot of the
excellent "drill" work on the giant screens! I was almost in tears laughing
as was most around me. I think this antic topped Alex's "Wipeout" moves
toward the end of the show!

I had another small question about the BB&B lyrics.  In my song book at
home the line reads:

"Beneath the noble BIRTH.."

Someone else (I forgot who) says that the original lyrics in the jacket
notes read:

"Beneath the noble BIRD.."

Which is right? They both make good sense to me. Being beneath the noble
birth is being under the English rule. But the noble bird is the eagle.

Anyway that's just something I thought I'd bring up...

Until later...

{Flame retardant clothing on}

At the risk of starting a heated debate here, many of Christianity's
"evil symbols" came from pagan symbols originally, including the pentagram.
The pentagram was (and is still) used in white witchcraft; it's used in a
positive, healing way.  (In the tarot deck it stands for knowledge.)

Pagan practices had been around for thousands of years before Christianity
came onto the scene.  In their fervor to convert everyone to their way of
thinking, they used this symbol (and others) and attached terrible meanings
to them as a way of converting the masses to their way of seeing things.

Their method was to eradicate any previous religious influences (and un-
fortunately the underlying culture) and impose their own beliefs.  This has
sadly led to the loss of many cultures (Mayan, Aztec, Hawaiian, Polynesian,
etc.).

If you want more information, or to flame me, please feel free to e-mail me;
this is too tangential for this particular forum.  This is not meant to be
an anti-Christian flame!  I strongly support the right for anybody to believe
what they want, just so long as it doesn't hurt others.

Yes, I think Tolkein influenced both of the songs.  There are strong paralells
that can be drawn between "The Necromancer" and 'The Hobbit'.  It's obvious
that "Rivendell" is directly from 'The Hobbit'; in addition to the name, it
specifically  mentions the Misty Mountains, the Loudwater (river), and also
alludes with "where the dark lord cannot go" (Sauron could not penetrate
Rivendell; in the event he did assume total power, it would be one of the
last two good places to fall), "Elfin songs", the fact that "Time will
never touch you" (time didn't seem to pass in Tolkein's Rivendell), and the
lines "This is the place to grow old till/I reach my final day" allude to
Bilbo's last days there.

Howdy all, would you believe that this is my first post, even though I have
been on this list for nearly two months?  I guess I just haven't had anything
to say until now.

Someone mentioned that the little tale in The Necromancer seemed similar to
information in The Hobbit concerning Gandalf's excursion to drive the
Necromancer out of Dol Gulder (sp?).  I have to say that I agree with that
person slightly, although Willowdale is actually a place in Canada, is it not?
And I can't help but wonder just how much Rush was influenced by Tolkien's
writings?  A big example of this is the song Rivendell, which pretty much fits
the description of the Middle Earth Rivendell, with the Misty Mountains on
one side and the ford on the other, etc etc etc.

Does anyone know about any other Tolkienesque lines in songs, aside from
The Necromancer and Rivendell?

Leaving near Canada really has it's advantages....

Last night was the induction dinner for the Canadian artists of the decade
thing (Bryan Adams, Rush and kdlang).  The Toronto station Q107 was broadcasting
live from the place, and they interviewed Mr. Lifeson for about 15 minutes..
The gist of it was the Presto went extremely well, it really renewed their
love for touring... now there's some excellent news!!

They are currently in the pre-production stages of the new album... they have
4 or 5 five songs mostly together.  They enter the studio in February or
late January.. with a release date of June!!!!  Then they take a few months
off and crank up the tour in early fall.

There you go, right from the horses mouth..

In many cases where dates were questionable, I have included (?) to
state so.  Some dates gotten from various sources claim more than
one location played on such a date, I have included (?) to mark
these as well.  Cases where the band played more than one night at
a location but where I only had 1 date, I have marked the other 2
dates with (?) to indicate this.

There are many missing gaps still (especially from the early tours
and from overseas dates) and through time, I will add them to this
list and re-send revisions as I see fit.  Please, if you find any
drastic error(s) in the listing or have evidence to a date contrary
to one listed, please send email to:

jlang@ucsd.edu  or jlang@sdcc13.ucsd.edu

Updates will be mailed as I make revisions.  Thank you.
