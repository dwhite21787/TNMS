Well, I'm back after a much-needed weeks vacation to the Outer Banks, NC.
It looks like there was nobody to send out any mailings last week, so this
is the first for many in over a week.  I hope you didn't suffer withdrawal
too badly... :-)

Let's see, just a couple of things, then on with the Digest.  First of all,
there is a new redistribution at CMU beginning this this edition.  If you 
are reading this from there, please drop me a line at the administrative
address (at end of the Digest) with your name and e-mail address, to let 
me know you're there.  Otherwise, I have no real idea of how many of us 
there are!

On a related topic, at latest count, we've broken the 400 barrier for 
subscribers!  I estimate there are about 415 of us out there, but there
could me more, as there are a few redist. sites out there also.  Who knows,
there may be 500 of us!  No wonder my poor computer has fits trying to send
the mail out...

I'll be posting to the two general music newsgroups in the next week or two
to try to drum up 'new business', so membership could jump another 20-50.
I delayed this because of my vacation, and also to let new students get used
to their computer accounts & get to usenet.  Feel free to pass the adminis-
trative address around to friends if they want to join; the more the merrier!
NOTE: I will only accept additions from the actual person/userid - I won't
add somebody 'for a friend'.  Sorry, but I've been burned (not badly), but
it put the 'fear of God(dess)' in me.

Last, but not least, I felt wordy today, so I interjected a few comments
more than usual amongst the postings.  I hope I didn't annoy the individual
posters...

Hey guys,

About a week ago, I requested info on getting the Rush rasters.  Since
then several people have sent email to me asking me to send them the info
if i got it.  Also, several other people have posted to the digest in the past

few days with the same request...

So come on, someone out there has to know where the rasters are...

The references to Zion and Babylon were discussed a while ago as being
space stations in Gibson's _Neuromancer_. (Excellent Book)  Someone asked
if anyone knew if a Peart/Gibson connection.  I don't remember a reply.
I think the book came out after the album.  This started me thinking
about the possibility of a some kind of classical reference to Zion and
Babylon.  I'm pretty sure from the song and the book that they are
used as opposites like the different brain hemispheres (See _Hemispheres_
by RUSH, 1978 :-) ) one for civilized and regulated and the other more
loose and carnal.  I've always planned to go look up some references.
Anyone know off the top of their head?  Instant revelation: Maybe
there is an Avalon/Cygnus connection...

[ oooh, sign me up for the 'loose and carnal' side!  ;-)      :rush-mgr ]

Black Sabbath is thought by many to be a rip-off of Led Zeppelin. And in
the beginning, to have ridden on the coattails of their success.  This
is not my opinion, I have just seen many comments like this over the years.

I'm not sure why people think Rush is Heavy Metal.  For want of a better
pidgeon hole I guess.  I'm not sure I consider Led Zeppelin to be Heavy
Metal even though the term was coined in reference to Black Dog.  In fact
I remember when Van Halen was considered pop. I still don't think they are
Heavy Metal.  Maybe the advertisers or the industry need labels in order
to target the hype.

[ Led Zeppelin (Page/Plant) didn't consider themselves 'Heavy Metal', 
  rather they considered themselves 'rhythm & blues'.  Check out their
  first few albums; the non-pop songs were excellent R&B tunes!  :rush-mgr ]

This list does not create enough traffic to warrant a newsgroup.
It's that simple.  Heck, I'm a *huge* Rush fan, and I wouldn't
vote for a newsgroup.  Do you realize that, right now, most of
the "full feed" sites have over 600 newsgroups?  At UK, we have
over 800!  We have a very high degree of quality postings; let's
keep it that way.....

   Religion, man.  It's all religion.  Having been brought up in the
Catholic church, I feel I can safely say that I know all about
darkness and depression.  I don't know if Ozzy Ozbourne was also
brought up Catholic, but it certainly seems that way.  Regardless of
the times, and despite their denials, Catholicism gives you a negative
view of the world.  After 20 years of being told you are a worthless
piece of shit who doesn't have a chance in hell of making it to
heaven, you tend to believe it.  It's taken me years to realize this,
and I've still not completely exorcised it.
   While the times were certainly bad when Sabbath was first starting
out, I don't think that can fully explain the internal strife that is
apparent in Ozzy's lyrics and Iommi's guitar work.  It's my feeling
that one or both of them was brought up in Catholicism or a similar
religion, one in which the individual is made to feel worthless.
   Early Black Sabbath is/was a personal favorite of many a young
Catholic lad.  First of all, parents, nuns, priests, and teachers
hate it.  But mostly, B.S. put into words the feelings of the
listeners.  By God, we could *relate* to what Ozzy was saying, on a
primal level.  The song "Black Sabbath" has to be about oppressive
religion.  It just HAS to.

Did anyone attend the Celebrity Tennis Tournament in Malibu this past weekend?
I'm eager to get a tape of that and the concert, also.  The last I knew, Geddy
was searching for a drummer so that he and Alex could do Closer to the Heart.
Does anyone know if they performed it?

Also, did anyone catch 2112: Overture the other night on TV?  I think the show
was one of those tabloid shows, maybe Hard Copy.  They used it as background
music for part of a story.

I'm not sure if anyone out there has noticed but the reason Neil named
the song "Anagram" is because every single line of the song has an
anagram in it.  Examples...

1.	There's no SAFE SEAT at the FEAST
2.	Take your BEST STAB at the BEAST
3.	The NIGHT is turning THIN
4.	The SAINT is turning to SIN

In line 1 both SAFE and SEAT can be seen in FEAST etc...  The neat thing
is that every single line of the song is an anagram.  Do ya think Neil
is getting a little bored or something?

The RUSH Fans Digest Frequently Asked Questions List:  Updated Sept. 29, 1990

   This file contains questions that seem to crop up frequently in the Rush
Fans Digest.  It will be posted on or around the first of each month.  If
you received a copy of this file in email, other than as a part of a

knowledge, but I'm not perfect.  If you have an answer to one of these
questions that doesn't match the one given here that you can verify, let me
know, and I'll put it in!

[ Many, many thanks to Dan for his effort on this!!  This is an excellent
  list of questions, and may become part of the introductory material

   Alex Lifeson       August 27, 1953

[  How about original names?  Neil's is the original, but Alex and Geddy

   like that; Geddy's name is Gary Lee Weinrib, if I'm not mistaken.  The
   source for this was one of our list members, but I can't recall who or
   when it was posted.  Hinano, can you help?                    :rush-mgr ]

What is Battlescar/Max Webster, who plays on it, what is the label/catalogue
number for the Universal Juveniles CD?  Where can I write to get it?

   Max Webster is a Canadian band that used to open for Rush.  Battlescar
   is a song from their _Universal Juveniles_ CD that was done as a duet
   of the 2 bands.  To my knowledge, this is not available in the USA.
   {If anybody knows an address to order from, send it to me, and I'll
   include it in this posting.}

Does anyone have a copy of "A Nice Morning Drive", the Richard Foster
piece that inspired "Red Barchetta"?

   Yes, this file was posted to the Digest once.  I would rather not
   include it in this FAQL, due to it's length.  It originally
   appeared in Road & Track  Nov,1973  pp.148-150.

Can anyone list everything else that the members of Rush have ever appeared
on?

   This is not a complete list.  Please send me your additions!

   Bob & Doug MacKenzie: _Take Off_ (Geddy)
   _Modern Drummer_ Sound Supplement:  Pieces Of Eight (Neil)
   Max Webster: _Battlescar_ (Geddy, Alex, & Neil)

   Platinum Blonde: _Alien Shores_ (Alex)
                    {I'm not sure about that title.}
   Northern Lights: _Tears Are Not Enough_ (Geddy)
 [ Beyond Borders: Alex and Rick Emmit (sp?)               :rush-mgr ]

I just bought the CD of {Exit...Stage Left | All The World's A Stage} and
it's missing a track!  Is there a complete version of this CD available?

   No.  But if you absolutely have to have everything on CD, the 2 missing
   tracks are on _Chronicles_.

What does (for Mongo) after "Anagram" on the PRESTO album mean?

   It's a joke from the movie _Blazing Saddles_, referring to the
   "Candygram for Mongo" scene, according to Geddy on Rockline 12/4/89.

What is Alex saying during the "censored" section of the Show Of Hands
video?

   According to Geddy on Rockline, he was just sort of babbling into the
   microphone.  (which he did when I saw them on that tour, as well.)
   Unfortunately, that wasn't recorded, but they really liked the shot
   of Alex babbling into the mic, so they put the "warning" stuff on
   the screen as a joke.

Does anybody have the lyrics to (song)?

   The lyricserver at lyrics%umass.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu probably does.
   Send a message containing the word HELP to that address for
   information.

[ Also, since many sites may have problems getting anything from the server
  (me included), many people on this list have the complete lyrics also.
  Try the Umass server first; failing that, post to the list.  You might
  mention that Umass attempts failed, or you'll get the above blurb again.
                                                                 :rush-mgr ]

What songs make up the "Fear" trilogy?

   The "Fear" trilogy consists of:
      Part 1: The Enemy Within (Grace Under Pressure)
      Part 2: The Weapon (Signals)
      Part 3: Witch Hunt (Moving Pictures)

Has this trilogy ever been performed live?

   Yes.  It's on the "Grace Under Pressure Tour" video.

Why do the songs appear in reverse order?

   "It's really kind of strange how it turned out, and it's not meant to be
   as mysterious and clever as it looks.  It was more accidental.  At the
   time of _Moving Pictures_, I had actually sketched out each of the three
   songs in my notebook and talked to the other guys about them and what I
   was going to go for, but the easiest one for me to clarify in my mind
   and in words was 'Witch Hunt,' because it was the simplest concept to
   deal with, and then 'The Weapon' came next because my thinking led up to
   that point, but in fact a couple snatches of lyrics and even both of the
   verses for 'The Enemy Within' were written as long ago as that, and all
   of the titles and everything were fixed on, and what I wanted to write
   about, but 'The Enemy Within' was the most difficult one to deal with,
   so it ended up being the last one done, so they happened to go in the
   order 3-2-1." -- Neil Peart, in an interview on KGB (?) 101 FM, San
                                Diego: 10/2/84

Where does the name 'Rocinante' come from?

   It was the name of Steinbeck's motor home in _Travels With Charlie_.
   It was also the name of Don Quixote's horse.

I read that "Xanadu" was based on a famous poem.  Does anybody have a copy?

   The poem is "Kubla Khan" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.  Your local
   library probably has a copy.

Where did the story of _2112_ come from?

   2112 is very loosely based on _Anthem_, by Ayn Rand.  Much of
   Neil's early work was influenced by Rand.

Is that crackling noise about 10-20 seconds into "Distant Early Warning" on
the _Grace Under Pressure_ CD supposed to be there, or is my copy
defective?

   It's supposed to be there.  There is a rumbling at that point on the
   _A Show Of Hands_ CD and on the _Grace Under Pressure Tour_ video.

Near the end of "The Camera Eye," there are some mumblings that I can't
quite make out?  Does anybody know for sure what is being said?

   No.

Who says <phrase> in <song>?

----------------------------------------------------------

<A NAME="56314">From: a!</A>

    Alex says "That's nice" at the end of "Chain Lightning".
    Alex says "Subdivisions" in the song of the same name.
    The deep voice at the beginning of "Cygnus X-1" is none other than
      Terry Brown.
    Neil does the "Attention all planets of the Solar Federation - We have
      assumed control" bit at the end of "2112".
    Neil does the narrative during "The Necromancer".

   {Can anybody confirm or deny any of these?}

In "By-Tor And The Snow Dog" By-Tor is the bad guy, but he's a hero in "The
Necromancer."  What happened?

   When asked about this on Rockline, Geddy said something along the lines
   of, "He saw the light."

What building is on the cover of _Moving Pictures_?

   The building pictured is the old Parliament building in downtown
   Toronto.  It is several blocks South of the Toronto Planetarium
   surrounded by a park.  There is a multilane road that splits into two
   multilane roads to run around both sides of it and joins up again on
   the south side.  The entrance on the cover is on the South of the
   building.

Why was the headline on the newspaper on the cover of _Permanent Waves_
blocked out?

   "There are always the inevitable last minute crises, such as the Chicago
   Daily Tribune being still so embarrassed about their "Dewey defeats Truman"
   error of more than thirty years ago, that they actually refused to let us
   use it on the cover!"  -- Neil Peart, in the _Permanent Waves_ tourbook

   { To clarify this:  When Truman ran against Dewey for President, he
   lost in most of the states with early returns.  So, it looked like
   Dewey was going to win.  The _Chicago Tribune_ released an early
   morning paper the next day with a "Dewey defeats Truman" headline. }

     I'm sorry to do this but I have deleted the issue that contained "A Nice
Morning Drive" and I would really like to have it back.  My BITNet address is:

     Does anyone confirm or deny a rumor about Rush releasing a video for
Chronicles?  It sounds kinda far-fetched considering how they don't like the
idea of the album, but who knows what Mercury will do?
