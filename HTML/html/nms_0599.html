Greetings all,

	I'm writing in response to Bruce Holtgren's post about the rush laser
show is Cincinatti. I live in Minneapolis and the show has been through here
already. I really didn't like it much. I went to see the Pink Floyd: welcome...
show before I saw rush, and the lasers (NOT the music :) really left something
to be desired at the rush show, compared to the Pink Floyd show. The rush show
consisted of mostly spinning "spirograph" type patterns and left my girlfriend
and I feeling rather ill. So I guess what I'm saying is if you aren't impressed
with the rush laser show, go see a different one, because in all likelyhood
it WILL be better. ...off the soapbox now...

Howdy all.  Just thought I would mention that the DJs at local station here in
Seattle have officially spotted Geddy at an espresso stand.  We knew they were
coming, now we know they are here.  Let the countdown begin...

Hi kids,

   I was flipping through my "Presto" Tour Book the other day and found
something that I wasn't too sure about.  There's a page towards the back
that has a bunch of pictures from backstage and the tour buses.  One photo
has Alex on stage and the other has Geddy being escorted backstage.  In
each of these photos, they are wearing a long black robe with the letters
"G.F.O.S." on the back in Gothic lettering.  Either I'm missing something
kinda obvious or I have no clue what the letters mean.  Can anyone help me
out?

   I think the idea of giving credit in the NMS CD to the contributors is
a good idea.  Also, I'm not sure who mentioned this in yesterday's NMS,
but I like the idea of a sort-of-collage for the cover.  I'd say not too
junky though.  ESL is a great cover, but is does push it a tiny bit.
Also, that much info on a cover is better for the age of LPs.  One graphic
that I've always liked is the "egg in a C-clamp" from Grace Under
Pressure.  Very clever Hugh (Syme, that is).  So, if you feel like it,
there at NMS Central, consider it, it's a great and lesser known graphic.
I also like the idea of a black hole on the cover.  Those things fascinate
me.  Maybe (brainstorm), with the star being prominent on the one side and
the black hole being in the opposite upper corner, symbols and/or logos
from the albums could be getting pulled into the black hole!  That way,
they could be small enough that they won't crowd the cover but big enough
to show off the great works of our beloved band!  Maybe you'll like it,
maybe not.

   NEXT...In the booklet for the Chronicles CD, I noticed that the author
of the passage gave the source of the title _Exit...Stage Left.  He said
it was from a "Huckleberry Hound" Cartoon when in fact Snagglepuss is the
actual character that uses the saying!!  "Exit Stage Left...Right, Even!!"

Atmospheric changes make it sensitive again....OUCH!!

Hi all.......
Just wanted to say thanks to all those who have been getting in touch with
me about bootleg stuff.  My life is so much more complete!

Just in response to the complication of Geddy's bass stuff.  Has anyone
ever listened to Hemispheres????  Gee Wizz.........that's some of the most
complicated stuff I think.  You really have to listen closely, but once you
start singling it out, you'll realize that it is really cool.

Just thought I'd get my two cents in!  Let me know what you think.

Also, being a new NMS subscriber, has there ever been a "RUSH FAN'S FAVORITE
ALBUM" survey done?  You know, just to see what the top five albums are among
Rush fans?  Just a thought.

Lastly, does anyone know of any kind of Email newsletter for Ramone's fans?
If so, Email me at once!

Howdy Folks!
	A week or so ago someone (I lost your name :( ) posted about the
	Spinal Tap New year's Eve concert, specifically about some RUSH-
	like lyrics, similar to the "The more that things change, the more
	they stay the same" line of Circumstances.  The song they were
	singing at the time is "The Majesty of Rock" off their new album.
	The line comes from an almost rush like verse (stress the almost,
	as I do not mean to imply connection), and is
	"The more it stays the same, the less it changes".  Well enough
	about the peripheral RUSH content.

	I am looking forward to the NMS CD.  If it is anything like the
	shirts it will be wonderful!  Thanks Meg & Crew!  Also, how
	about "ROCINANTE" as the name for the CD?

	Well, gotta run,
	-Brian

Well, it sounds like you already have the cover set, so my suggestion is
probably too late.  (BTW, it does sound good.)  But maybe you could use
this idea if there is a volume 2. :-)  Anyone ever seen Jethro Tull's
_Thick As A Brick_?  How about an NMS version, with humourous articles,
etc. (maybe even a crossword puzzle) written by members of the list.

  [ Actually that's not a bad idea for inside the booklet. Anyone feel like
    taking that on?  A crossword puzzle? Mail any comments to 
    meg@syrinx.umd.edu						 : rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="599007">Subject: Xanadu on CD</A>
Date: Tue, 19 Jan 93 9:38:16 PST

I've known for a while that Xanadu on _A Farewell To Kings_ is indeed
at a different pitch than standard A=440Hz and I don't know why since
the other songs are at the correct pitch. This is evident on both CD
and vinyl. As for live playing, many bands do play at a lower pitch to
either help the lead singer or help the lead guitarist (the strings
are much easier to play at E flat .. a la Van Halen), but that is NOT
the case for Xanadu on _Exit ... Stage Left_. All the live playing is
at correct pitch, and I would expect any deviation on a bootleg to be
due to the mastering and not the band. This of course still doesn't
explain the pitch shift on the studio version.

Also, I've noticed on _Grace Under Pressure_ during one of the latter
choruses of _The Enemy Within_ that there's a slight static 'pop'
after the words "experience to extremes ..." when Alex is playing his
muted, staccato rhythm part. Anybody else hear this? BTW, I got this
copy when it first became available, so it's made in West Germany.

Radio station KXRX reported this morning that Rush is in Seattle recording.
One of the DJ's said he saw Geddy at a latte stand on Sunday.  They also
implied that Geddy and Alex might show up at the opening of a new club this
weekend.
