Hey there, fellow progressive rockers.

Here's a lead on a neat album put out by Magna Carta not too long ago,
the guys who put out the "Working Man" tribute to Rush.  Its called
"Liquid Tension Experiment" and features Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci
of Dream Theater (at least one of them also played on "Working Man"),
Tony Levin on bass (he's worked with just about every prog. rock act -
Peter Gabriel, Yes, Anderson Bruford Wakeman and Howe, etc), and some
other keyboard guy.  Its mixed by Kevin "Caveman" Shirley, the guy who
worked as engineer (I think) on the Counterparts album.  All kinds of
little Rush connections here.

Its almost all instrumental and is of the progressive vein - not for the
faint of heart, but great if you're into this stuff.  I really like it! 
The first song will blow your socks off, the second song is reminiscent
of some Peter Gabriel-esque stuff, and most of the other songs just vary
between softer and harder.  The final 5 (of 13) songs (which are all
really just one big long song) are kind of like one big jam session
going in and out of various styles inside of one continuous song.

Check it out!

RE:  David_Berg@stream.com's post asking about Geddy's bass solo in
Driven.

David-
I was at the Meadowlands show in December '96, and I distinctly
remember Geddy doing a bass solo in Driven that was very similar to
what's on DS.  Of course I can't remember it EXACTLY, but I do remember
hearing him do the "echoing" notes which are on the CD starting at 2:00
minutes into the track.

As for the guy yelling "Shake it off Alex", I think it may have been a
reference to the fact that Geddy was doing a solo instead of Alex for
once... Could be???

Now, about the second NS guitar solo missing, I didn't even really
notice it until you mentioned it...probably because the song is towards
the end of the 2nd cd, and by that time I'm usually just letting the
music "wash into my subconscious" instead of really "concentrating"
on it.  I guess there's NO telling what will happen when a Rush fan
gets into "The Zone"....   :-)

<A NAME="2151004">Subject: How to make ClusterWorks respond to DS</A>

Brian Andonian asked how to make ClusterWorks, the program on the enhanced
CD part of "Different Stages," work with the music on the DS CDs. I had the
same question, and I'm sure others do, too, because of the weak
instructions that come with the program.

Well, after conferring with David Snedigar, who posted to the Apple
EvangeList mailing list about DS and ClusterWorks, this is what I figured
out:

First, this feature only works on Macs. Sorry, everyone with Wintel
machines, but that's how it goes. If you have a problem with it, take it up
with Hisashi Hoda or the people at www.wonderlab.com. At least you all get
cool games like Dark Forces II and Rainbow Six.

Second, I'm running QuickTime 3, but this probably works under 2.5.

Here are the steps for making ClusterWorks respond to DS:

1) Put one of the DS CDs in the CD-ROM drive.
2) Without starting ClusterWorks, start the audio part of the CD. If you
have the control strip for the MacOS, you can just click on the CD-ROM
module and select "play." Or you can go to the AppleCD Audio Player,
probably located in the Apple menu, and play it from there.
3) Once the music starts playing, start ClusterWorks.
4) After you've clicked on the splash screen to start ClusterWorks, hit
command-I. The command key is the one with the little Apple logo (or "open
Apple" for those of you who recall the days of the Apple II-series) and the
cloverleaf-like symbol. That should make ClusterWorks start reacting to the
music that is playing.
5) Then hit the escape key (esc) to mute the ClusterWorks sound.
6) You can then move the mouse to the bottom of the screen to bring up the
pop-up menu where you'll probably want to fiddle with the "speed" and
"delay" settings. These will vary depending on the kind of Mac you have.

That's about it. You can then change the patterns ClusterWorks is using to
react to the music, just like if you were not having it react to Rush.

I just wish the ReadMe file that came with ClusterWorks was more clear on
how to do this.

Later, David

<A NAME="2151005">Subject: Positive notes on Rush future and Victor..</A>

Hi folks:

I have a couple of interviews that everybody should be interested in.
Qucikly, it appears that their WILL be a decision fairly soon as to what
Neil wished to do with Rush(from the ALex interview)plus words about
Victor II(there may likely be one), and the DS Video(is being worked
on); and secondly, Geddy just reinforces that the band HAS NOT broken
up. This first interview with ALex, I am reposting from a newsgroup
article, and I had heard the interview this past Friday on 97.7 Htz fm
here in St.Cathairnes. The second interview is with Geddy from the
Toronto Sun this past Sunday. Hope this helps give a little more "light"
and clears the air for some Rush fans:

First Interview:

>  Alex was interviwed last night on 97.7 out of St. Catherines.   The
> interviewer at first was very interested in Neil's progress,  Alex
> basically said that Rush has no plans for a new album at this time but
> that Neil is slowly making progress and a decision will be made sometime
> in the near future.  The interviewer seemed to push the Neil questions a
> little too far because Alex eventually asked that they just talk about
> Different Stages.
> 
> When asked about a new Victor project Alex stated that he is right now
> renovating his home studio and that it is something he wants to do again
> but still there are no definite plans to do anything.  When asked about
> a video to accompany Different Stages he said that it is being worked on
> as we speak and one will be released.

Just as a side note, this interview wil be aired again on 97.7 htz fm on
their "Music Notes Week in Review" on Sunday morning (starts at 8 or
9am, not sure...better check at 8 just to be sure). There is also
supposed to be an interview with Alex in the next edition of "Network"
magazine here in Canada, and supposedly he sheds a bit more light on
Neil and Rush's future. "Network" is available free at all Sam's Music
Stores here in Canada. Supposedly, I was told, "things are looking
positive..". This is all that the editor would comment on though.

Second Interview (In Toronto Sun w/ Geddy):

What's the Rush?

               After 25 years together, the veteran
               Canadian rockers take stock of their
               careers

                    By KIERAN GRANT -- Toronto Sun

                  As Rush releases its latest album, Different
               Stages, the band finds itself in a different, and
               difficult, stage. 

               Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart just
               recapped 25 years together with the double live
               CD, which has gone gold since hitting stores two
               weeks ago. 

               Next year will actually mark 30 years since
               singer-bassist Lee and guitarist Lifeson hooked up
               to play as teenagers. 

               But, as Lee confides in a recent interview in the
               downtown headquarters of Rush's own label,
               Anthem, it's "an anniversary we're not really
               celebrating." 

               Rather, Lee's thoughts are with drummer-lyricist
               Peart, 46, who suffered a double dose of tragedy
               when his daughter was killed in a car accident a
               year ago and his wife died of cancer last spring. 

               It's a painful and personal topic that Lee hesitates
               to discuss. 

               Questions of another album and tour are moot,
               though judging from a recent string of inquiries
               we've received from Rush fans, there are concerns
               for the band's future. 

               "My concern is for Neil and that's it," says a cool
               but sombre Lee. "My heart breaks for him in what
               he's gone through, and I can safely speak for all of
               us that we're all concerned for him as a friend, and
               that's it. This is my friend, and he's hurting. We're
               all hurting. To think about anything of a practical
               nature is inappropriate. 

               "There's been a lot of support (from fans), but the
               most anyone can do for Neil is give him the time he
               needs." 

               A graceful dedication to the drummer's family inside
               the Different Stages CD package captures Rush's
               feelings best: "Suddenly ... you were gone ... from
               all the lives you left your mark upon." 

               As Peart recovers privately, the album goes a long
               way in celebrating the remarkable interplay that
               makes him, Lee and Lifeson famous. 

               Lee compiled and co-produced the disc, honing
               hundreds of hours of live recordings from 60 shows
               on two tours into a cohesive document of a
               latter-day Rush concert. 

               A limited edition version includes a third disc,
               recorded live at London's Hammersmith Odeon in
               February, 1978. 

               All told, the collection is a musical signpost -- a
               way for Rush to take stock of a prolific career. 

               "A live album represents a lot of opportunities," Lee
               says. "It's an opportunity to record new music. It's
               also a chance to re-evaluate, in the context of all of
               our music, the old favourites. 

               "It raises the question, 'If this was the last live album
               I ever did, would this song be worthy of it?' You
               learn a lot about your own writing. That's a real
               benefit." 

               Rush have no doubt learned more about themselves
               than most bands. 

               Different Stages comes as part of Rush's "weird
               habit" of releasing a live disc every four albums. 

               According to Lee, the tradition started by accident.
               In 1981, the band narrowly decided to release the
               studio album, Moving Pictures, before the live Exit
               ... Stage Left. The former record went on to spawn
               the classic Tom Sawyer and sell four million copies
               -- their biggest-ever hit up 'til then. The latter was
               seen as a good-luck charm. 

               "It was a pretty good decision, in retrospect," Lee
               deadpans. 

               Then again, the virtuoso bass player has a lot of
               Rush experts to answer to when it comes to making
               a record. 

               Rush's vast following stretches back through many
               stages: Their days as a cult band fusing complex
               progressive rock with mystical lyrics, an era
               captured neatly in the tight grooves of Stages'
               Hammersmith Odeon set; their graduation to an
               uncompromising and sophisticated trio capable of
               great -- some would say surprising -- commercial
               success and musical influence. 

               "It's hard to put us in context with the rest of the
               music world," says Lee. 

               "We've always floated along on this separate kind
               of slipstream. We were never really aware of how
               weird we were. In our early days we were naive,
               and in our later days maybe blindly impractical. 

               "And thank goodness for that. It's been a key to
               our sound that we can do these things under the
               mantle of hard rock and make it still accessible and
               viable." 

               Lee says the best way to please the fans with an
               album like Different Stages is not to try too hard. 

               "If I ask 10 Rush fans what songs they want to
               have in a set, I can almost guarantee there would
               be 10 different lists. 

               "I just compared my own wish list with a reality
               list." 

               The result features staples like Tom Sawyer, YYZ,
               2112 and a rare improvisational run at Closer To
               The Heart alongside tunes from later records, like
               1996's Test For Echo. It works, but Lee knows he
               stands to be second-guessed. 

               Where is Subdivisions? New World Man? 

               "There's no winning," he answers with a laugh. 

               "Sometimes you just have to do what you want to
               and let the chips fall where they may ..." 

               And move on to a new stage. It's all part of the
               work-in-progress that Rush continues to be. 

               "This record is about what our personality as a
               band has become, and all those various parts good
               and bad," says Lee. "We're so tied to what we've
               become as a band, and a family. And most of what
               we have become we owe to touring 250 days a
               year and being on a different stage every night." 

               THE RUSH FILE 

               Then: 1969 -- 15-year-olds Alex Zivojinovich,
               aka Lifeson, and Gary Lee Weinrib, aka Geddy
               Lee, form a band in Toronto with drummer John
               Rutsey. 

               Neil Peart replaces Rutsey and brings his
               songwriting skills on board in time for Rush's 1974
               self-titled debut. 

               Now: When Lee belts out that "all this machinery
               making modern music can still be open-hearted "
               on The Spirit Of Radio, he still means it. "It's
               relevant," he says of the 1980 anthem, which took
               aim at the inherent lameness of commercial rock
               radio. 

               "Maybe even more so, because we live in a time

<A NAME="2151006">Subject: UK DS thoughts</A>

Hi you ;-)

Well I've had DS for a week now, and here's some thoughts:

Packaging excellent - I don't generally like these cases but this one oozes
class (of course).
I had to take it back though - no booklet in my first copy.  I heard this
happened to some of you across the big pond too.  I was really pissed off,
having paid an extortionate £24.99 for the CD to get home and find it
incomplete.  This is more Atlantic's fault than Virgin Megastore's though.
And it's Atlantic's fault that it was delayed in Europe.  Oh, and it is
_also_ their fault that there was virtually no promotion, with Virgin
Megastores 'new release' section being full of a load of MTV crap (and even
sub MTV crap).  Does anyone agree that Atlantic are a bunch of tossers?

(rant over)

And now, the music.  As expected, it is really excellent (as you have all
pointed out already).  The sound is a good mix between polished and dirty,
if you get my gist.  You can hear all of what is going on, and it always
sounds emotional and energetic.  They wrote these songs for themselves - it
just so happens that we like it too.

They are always trying to get 'the moment'.  And 'the moment' comes a lot.
I always thought Dreamline by far the best song on RTB, and what a great
concert opener it is.  I love the melodies in that song.  And it sounds much
heavier live.  (RTB is probably my least favourite album production and
songwriting wise - does anyone out there like this album the most?)

Limelight and Driven - both great.  Bass solo in Driven is wow.  The sound
at the end when Geddy plays the riff alone is phenomenal.  Bravado good -
another studio version I didn't particularly like.  Animate - different
story, loved studio version but it is a little slow here.  Show Don't Tell
is good - I really love the song, it's very dramatic with amazing arpeggios
(Presto is _full_ of amazing arpeggios).  The Trees is really good, they
really keep the old stuff interesting, changing little bits here and there.
I just miss Xanadu and Force Ten, for that matter.  Nobody's Hero is a
little better than CP, IMO.  CTTH is another anthem, and again is kept
interesting (but Xanadu? Force Ten?).

2112 sounds really good, much better than ASOH.  (Although in the video,
when Alex is late and Ged points the blame, that is a GRM (great Rush
moment).)  The downtuning was a great idea, the end of the song really
sounds AMAZING - one of the best endings ever, IMO.

TFE is good, but it seems hard to reproduce the layered guitars well.  But
the song is really original, and the "Some kind of drama" bit sounds
incredible (even if I used to think he said "Some kind of drummer"!).
Analog Kid is rocking too, well worth campaigning for.  Freewill is good,
this is an underrated song, the jamming is unbelievable.  RTB I can take or
leave (Force Ten instead??).  Stick It Out sounds really intense, the riff
is soooo good.

But from Resist on, the album is one of the best I have ever heard.  This is
where it's really at.  (And don't get me wrong, the album up till now is
amazing!)

I love Resist.  I would stick it in my top 5 Rush tracks.  The "surrender
without a prayer" bit is one of the best things Rush have ever put onto
tape.  It reminds me of a traditional folk song that has been handed down
for years - a la "Whisky In The Jar".  LTTA is a great showcase for
instrumental prowess and Geddy jamming at the end is incredible.  TRM is
also pretty good on the old prowess ;-).  Wow.  This guy is truly one in a
billion.  Absolute genius.  I really like the sound of the "other" kit
(drummers - does it have a name?) - it is actually inhuman.  Does Neil use
sampled drums, because I'm sure four limbs can't do that?  Just as you are
reeling from that, along comes NS, I'll say it again, NS.  Surely one of the
greatest songs ever, and more than done justice here.  The playing is
powerful and fluid, and Geddy puts in one of his best vocal performances
ever (just him and Al at the start sounds fantastic).  Neil drives the song
on, but can also play around the beat so, so  well.  (I play guitar - any
drummers agree/disagree?)  TSOR is another classic, and sounds really
heavy - wow.  TS, whilst I know why a lot of us didn't see the need for it,
I think it sounds really good, and suitably different.  What a fucking
anthem that song is.  What an underrated band.  YYZ - again a great tune,
played with real venom.

In closing, WOW.  Metal Hammer wrote that this album should be made
compulsory listening in schools, and whilst I wouldn't go quite that far, I
am really pleased.  When you look at the career of Rush, no other band has
been able to go on for so long, and still constantly evolve, and to always
write good music from the heart.  And what more could we ask for?  (Except
Force Ten ;-) )

Sometimes I think this is not a band.  More a way of life.  Have a great
one, and thanks for listening.  I'd go on about Disc 3 as well but I've got
to got to bed - 5 hours sleep - what a mare.

cheap, and there's a new empty warehouse!  frankly, i don't see a
downside to this idea, unless it's going to be held before may, the
weather tends to be unpredictable.  sometimes 50+, sometimes -50, you
never know.  but the snow we've gotten so far (we had to wussy blizzards)
is almost gone already.

consider fargo more extensively.  95.1 is pretty good about playing Rush,
they play them AT LEAST 2 times a day, and not TS both times, of CTTH. 
but 3 stations here play Rush, just 95.1 is very good and plays more
Rush.

Hi Folks,

So how about Different Stages ? Can't stop listening to it. I'm
particularly fascinated by 2112. That was just meant to be played in D
tuning. Much stronger. Discovery's new "discovery" is beautiful and when
Presentation kicks in , that has to be the most powerful piece of ass
being kicked I've ever heard. The priests must have been on steroids
that day.  The tonal changes on Alex's guitar, from the distortion to
clean, are so cool cuz they  permeate in to the verse.It seems to be 2
sound changes,actually. Ged's vox are excellent ( "these things just
can't be true"). I love how he says that line.

Did ya notice that he got the words right this time? "Chords that build
high like a mountain...'' as opposed to "Sounds..." as in the studio
version. That's one of the things I was interested in finding out about
when I first heard that they were doing the entire suite.

When I hear that analog keyboard intro to Overture, and then, when the
band kicks in, it's obvious that the key is changed, but the sound
effect between the light and heavy parts of Oracle:The Dream doesn't
have that same "difference" in sound. I wonder if it was altered.

Al's solo in Soliloquy is almost as heart-wrenching as the original. I
still give it an A+ . And Ged's got those evil minor seconds on the go
in Grand Finale. Gotta like it!

More questions: Is Al using his Les Paul on that tune? What other tunes
does he use it on?  For those of you who saw many t4e shows, was there
any pattern to which songs he used his different PRS's on?

Keep on Rushing,
Jon Lane

Hey!

I was just totally freaked out, let me explain.

Limited Rush Content

I enjoy sim games, more specifically the type with resources / goods / 
marketing / government / science (civ II rules). Anyway I went looking to 
download a game and ran into one called "Industry Giant". I downloaded, 
installed and restarted my pc. Monday Night Football is on the tube, boring,
but still on.

I use the startup menu (win95) to start the game. It goes thru the usual 
software company stuff and then goes the the game main menu screen. Now this 
is where I almost lost my cookies, so pay attention. At the precise moment 
the main menu screen popped up, I hear over my pc speakers nothing other than 
the beginning of Limelight, crowd and all. Many questions seemed to cross my 
mind all at once. "Is whoever made this demo version a Rush Fan?", "are they 
on TNMS?", "maybe that Hiroshi Hiroda dude made this game..." WAIT (looking 
at the cdrom light), disc one is in the rom. Okay, but why did it start at 
the same, coincidence? By itself?

Closed the game tried it again, same thing Limelight. Okay, try again disc 
two, Analog Kid (notice I dropped the The) and of course disc three, Bytor. 
Well, just for the record, a non DS disc, Das Hip-Trouble at the Henhouse, 
you guessed it (then again, maybe you didn't) Springtime in Vienna.

So if a music cd is in the rom drive, the main menu activates track two for 
the intro music? I think that's pretty nifty. Has anybody ever heard of this, 
or did I catch a freaky virus?

later,

Haven't seen this mentioned yet - there is reference to Xanadu in the new
Metallica CD booklet.  It is listed as one of the songs they were
influenced by in terms of their liking to write "epic" songs.

Wouldn't it have been cool if they would have covered that song on their

G'day all,

Sorry if this is old news, but Rush is mentioned in an article in the
October issue of "Icon" (don't know if this is an Aussie magazine or if
mail is a bit slow from the USA....).  It's about Progressive Rock, and
Rush is mentioned a few times.  Check out pages 157-159 (?).  There is even
a picture of COS !!!  The issue has "       " (insert symbol for that
"formerly the artist known as Prince" shite) on the cover.  The article is
interesting, but not worth paying for...unless you are REALLY dedicated.

BTW, saw "Chef:Behind the Menu" episode of South Park last night....who was

They ring a bell (or is it a crotale?), but they certainly don't mean
much to us in the UK. 'Unfortunately a member' is also the term I would
use...

DS: I can't get over Geddy's voice on the Hammy Odeon disc - you can tell he's
got a cold, but he really nails some of those old dog-whistle notes. Like in CX
1 at the end, the control on that last note is unbelievable.

     -> Somehow I doubt that CHUM-FM would air anything by Rush anymore.  
     They are strictly "adult-oriented top-40" (Celine Dion, Elton John, 
     Eric Clapton, etc.), and moved off their rock format around the time 
     Signals was released.  I think the last time I heard CHUM-FM play a 
     current Rush tune was "Nobody's Hero", but that song was a bit 
     different for Rush, as it appeared to break their classification on 
     radio.

Okay, I've been REALLY paying attention to the digest in the last week or
so, waiting to see if anyone else caught this, and so far nobody else has
mentionned it...

After South Park last week, Comedy Central did a "mockumentary" (in the
fashion of VH1's 'Behind the Music') on Chef, the most ubiquitous man in
showbiz. The man has cooked for everybody: Ozzy, Meat Loaf, Primus, Red Hot
Chili Peppers, Ike Turner, Elton John, Rancid... the list goes on and on.
Anyway, there was a recording engineer that kept going on about Chef's
preparation of little potatoes; he had on a Starman shirt! I know that Trey
Parker and Matt Stone have poked fun at Rush in the past (i.e. Orgazmo),
but putting that nutty guy in the Starman shirt seemed to me to be honoring
the band in a way... I mean, after all, it could have been an Iron Maiden
or Def Leppard shirt!

By the way, everyone should give a listen to "Chef Aid: the South Park
Album". It has some really great songs on it, from a wide variety of acts.
My favorite so far is Perry Farrell and DVDA's rendition of Chef's "Hot
Lava"... I got it the same day I picked up "Different Stages", and couldn't
be happier with my two most recent musical choices.

This one is for UK NMS'ers primarily.  Here's a review of DS which 
appears in this month's Q Magazine:

Whopping triple CD live bonanza from still sprightly Canadian threesome.

Having never at any stage of their career been fashionable - although 
Geddy Lee and Placeob's Brian Molko are vocally interchangeable - Rush 
have still never lost their fan base.  Unnoticed, they still make a very 
respectable living and legions flocked to last year's American tour 
whence comes most of this hefty package.  The set lists judiciously mix 
newer Rush - essentially a slick modern rock trio as evinced on Animate 
and Nobody's Hero - with the pyrotechnic conceptualists of yore; 2112 is 
performed in its entirety and the FM radio hits Tom Sawyer, Spirit of 
Radio and Closer To The Heart are included.  A juicy extra comes in the 
form of a CD of a 1978 London show when they were a very hot ticket and 
proving that a) Xanadu is a 70's pomp rock classic up there with 
Stairway To Heaven and b) never in the annals of rock have three blokes 
made such a formidable racket.
*** (3 out of 5)

Personally, I thought this review was quite a pleasant surprise (UK 
popular music press are not known for their love of the band) - at least 
the reviewer is fairly accurate and intelligent in his appraisal.  Rush 
also get a mention in this snippet about Placebo's new album:

Old people enjoy him singing like Geddy Lee out of Rush.  Anyone under 
40 goes for the upfront sexuality and knowing lyrics.  The twain meet at 
the point of fantastic songs.

Well, I thought it was quite amusing...

Adam's right.  Having grown up in Jamestown (look it up:) I wasn't able to
see Rush until I went to college in the Twin Cities (Presto) even though I
was a fan for a few years prior to that.  It sucks living in a state whose
population has decreased every decade from a high of 681,000 in 1930!
According to the Unofficial Tour Dates listing, Rush was fairly close
several times on the Signals tour (although I was only 11 at the time):

September 7, 1982       Sioux Falls, South Dakota (Rory Gallagher)
September 11, 1982      Rapid City, South Dakota
September 12, 1982      Bismark, North Dakota
September 14, 1982      Billings, Montana
September 15, 1982      Casper, Wyoming
October 5, 1982         Winnipeg, Manitoba
October 7, 1982         Duluth Arena. Duluth, Minnesota

I know they've been to Winnipeg and Duluth on other tours as well but I
don't think they've played in any of these other cities on any other
occasion.  Casper, WY?  Weird.  (Nothing personal intended toward the other
2 Rush fans in Wyoming--I like Casper!)  But what strikes me as most bizarre
is this date:

May 1978                Civic Center. East Grand Forks, Minnesota (Uriah
Heep)

I just can't believe Rush played in this town of 8,000 truly in the middle
of nowhere.  75 miles north of Fargo, Grand Forks (N.D.) has less than
50,000 and in 1978 I'll bet it had closer to 30,000 people.  

Rush-mgr, do you have any other info about this date????  (And BTW, Bismarck
is spelled with a "c"--as deprived as us North Dakotans are, we sure are
picky:).

Anyway, I did my part in Berlin on the RTB tour by writing "North Dakota
loves Rush" with my finger on the back of one of their semi trucks, but I
guess the boys know better from their experience in the early '80s.  Bummer.

P.S. To whoever wrote about the Bloomington vs. Minneapolis date in 1978,
they gotta be the same thing.  Bloominton's a suburb and Rush often played
the Met Center (before it turned into a shopping mall parking lot).  I don't
think they would have played the two cities separately.
