Seems that there was a digest sent out on Saturday which was a repeat of
Friday's digest. That was NOT supposed to be #668, it was merely a glitch
where the digest was not removed, and the cron job on Sat. spotted it again
and mailed it to everyone. This is the real digest #668. That's what I get for
thinking satanically... :)

The new FAQ has been sent in by Dan, if you would like a copy send e-mail to
the rush-mgr account, or you can get it via anonymous ftp to syrinx. If you
want/need it split up (it's a little over 100k in one message) please tell me
in your message.

And there is a "small list" set up now for people who's mailers can't handle a
single message bigger than a certain size. If you are getting the digest
truncated because of this, send me mail and I'll put you on the special list.

Due to low turnout (Like 20 deposits) I've decided to extend the
deadline for the Rush Convention to May 1st.  This is FIRM.  If I don't
get at least a total of 80 I can't afford to run it.  I've included a
copy of the original convention announcement below  Remember, May 1st is
the new deadline (and YES you do get your money back if it doesn't
happen)

*******************************************************************************
    O F F I C I A L   N M S   C O N V E N T I O N   A N N O U N C E M E N T
*******************************************************************************

The First Annual NMS Rush Fans Convention is being held this summer in
Toronto.

It will be Friday - Sunday, June 25-27, 1993 at the Hotel Ibis in
downtown Toronto (couple of blocks from Massey Hall).

Aside from hanging out and partying with fellow fans of the greatest
band in the world (and maybe taking a side trip or two to Danforth and
Pape or somethign like that), there will be a few main events.

1) Picnic at Lakeside Park.  Transportation to and from the park will be
provided, as will food.  This will happen Saturday morning/afternoon.

2) A Rush tribute band, Rushour will perform a three hour (actually
closer to four) set of Rush material.  This set will contain songs from
every Rush album to this point (and maybe a few special things).  I've
seen them myself and they are quite good.

3) There is a decent possibility of a Guest Speaker.  I've spoken with
Anthem Records and I just have to iron out some details with them.

Registration for the convention is as follows:

A nonrefundable deposit of $85 dollars (per person) is required and the
deadline
for deposits is May 1, 1993 (but only the first 200 people so get 'em
in quick).

This deposit covers all convention overhead, specifically the picnic,
the band, and some miscellaneous expenses.  This also includes an
official NMS convention t-shirt (Meg is working on this and I trust that
they will be extremely cool)  I have tried to estimate prices as closely
as possible to ensure the least possible surplus, but since I can't get
a firm head count ahead of time, and the fact that the Canadian/American
dollar exchange rate is not fixed, there may be leftover money.  *ALL*
leftover money will be donated to the Rush fanzine A Show of Fans and a
charity specified by Anthem records speaking on behalf of Rush.  I will
personally make *absolutely no profit* on this venture.  Detailed
financial accountings will be made available upon request.

I realize that some people live in the Toronto area, and may be able to
make some of their own accommodations, however the only thing that may
be any different is tranportation to and from Lakeside Park.  Thus for
anyone local to the area, I am willing to make a $15 reduction on the
deposit.  This reduction covers transportation.  All other costs are
event specific and I will not be able to reduce things further.

Payment of this deposit allows your name to be put on a list of people
attending the convention. This list will be sent to the Hotel Ibis, and
will allow you to call them and make reservations at the convention rate:

    This rate is $62 (canadian) a night for a single/double
                 $72 for a triple
                 $82 for a quad

I am NOT responsible for hotel reservations.  I will, however, be sure
that upon payment of deposit, you name is added to the list for the
reduced hotel rate.   As far as people grouping up to share hotel costs,
feel free to do so, however a deposit is still required one each person
attending.
Transportation from your home city to Toronto is the responsibility of
all individuals as well.

We are limited to 200 people due to the size of the hotel facilities.
This means that all space is on a first come, first served basis.  The
first 200 people who get their checks in to me get to go.

I realize some of the details are a bit sketchy, however until I get a
firm head count based on this deposit, I can't finalize a lot of the
details, such as what kind of food the picnic will have, or a detailed
time schedule.  All of this will be determined later and will be sent
out to everyone attending.  Realize that I've volunteered to do this for
free, and to be honest, I never done something of this magnitude before,
so please give me a little consideration as far as some of the official
details and stuff.  I expect everything to be worked out well before the
convention.

Disclaimer: This convention does not condone illegal live recordings.
Anyone wishing to trade such materials at the convention does so at
their own risk, and  that the convention, and the NMS will NOT be held
responsible.

Please make out all checks ($85 deposit) to John Santore
and send them to

1071 Morewood Avenue.
Pittsburgh, PA 15213

(receipts WILL be given and any deposits in excess of 200 people will be
returned)
Deadline is April 17, 1993 and there are only 200 available spots, so
first come first served.

Please include your T-shirt size, whether or not you will be staying at
the hotel, and if you wish to provide your own transportation to
Lakeside Park.

I dredged up my Great White North tape and sampled in the backwards section
just after "Black Holes."  Here's the exact text:

Bob: Good day, I'm Bob McKenzie; this is my brother Doug.
Doug: (yells) Take off!
Bob: No, how's it goin'?
Doug: Oh, sorry, eh.
Bob: No, you take off!
Doug: YOU take off!
Bob: You blew it.
Doug: Oh, sorry.
Bob: This is the backwards part.
Doug: Alright, start over.
Bob: Forget it.

Hello, Rushians.
     Well, that time of year has come around when every teacher you has stops
beleiving you when you tell him or her that you have other classes besides
hers or his.  I have found perfect teachers:  I havn't got anything else major
due until the week of finals, and then only one a day.  I find that this has
left alot of time on my hands.  Therefore, I will be conducting, formally,
a poll to see which of your covers is your favorite.
     I will list results like this:
     1)  A ranking of all albums according to total number of votes.
     2)  A list of the top five albums for each of your first, second, and
         third favorite albums.
     Therefore, please rank which is your 1st, 2nd and 3rd favorites in
your responses.  If not specified, I will assume that the order corresponds
to the first being your favorite, and so on.  I will send the results in to
the NMS on Thursday, May 13 (My 17th birthday, BTW!).  So get all your entries
in to me before Wednesday May 12.

<A NAME="668005">Subject: Rupert Hine and his background....</A>

Hi folks....
Have you sacrificed enough  blood yet to satisfy the lords from
Willowdale?  Remember, Satan is watching who is naughty and nice...
If you are insufficiently supplied with ritualistic demonic blood for
either parties and jam sessions, you can be supplied by ftp'ing
to the syrinx site and by looking in the newly created pub/rush/satan/misc
bank for all your dining and dancing pleasures.  :>

Anyway, back to the subject at hand in the subject line (provided by the
Department of Rendundancy Department - Ministry of Silly Walks -
Honourable John Cleese - Minister).  Ahem.  Rupert Hine _is_ a real person.

Rupert Hine did _not_ do "If you like Pina Coladas..." as a song.  Only
drinks them, thank you very much.

Rupert Hine does not sacrifice to any of the satanic forces, but we are
trying to get him to co-operate and see the dark.... ah, light.

Rupert Hine _has_, played in several bands in the past.  His first known bak
(spelling, Neal, spellink) band that I am aware of was called oddly enough
_Quantum Leap_, which was an Anglo-American band that put out at least
3 albums.  Rupert played synths and other keys with some backing vocals.
The style of the bands music was a cross between Ultravox and Alan Parsons,
with a China Crisis sense of pop thrown in.  I remember hearing this stuff
back in '83, with one of the guys on my Reach for the Top team, who was
really into Hine as a keyboardist.  He played some of their material for me
when he found out I was playing keyboards at the time and wanted to
infiltrate my mind with new material.  Hine was/is a great keyboardist.

I also remember back in 1985 or so, Hine was also fronting a band called
enigmatically, _The Project_.  It was made up of Hine and 3 other studio
based musicians heavily leaning on the most modern electronic equipment
of the day.  A lot of portable synths, electronic Simmonds drums and vocoders
for processing the vox.  Sort of new wavey and cold, but intriguing.
Sort of progressive, with a dance edge.

Hine could easily adapt himself to the symphonic and highly orchestrated,
layered sound of Rush.  He could contribute his acquired acclaimed skill
behind the engineering and production board with Rush, as he did with
Stevie Nicks, Saga, Tina Turner and dozens of other groups.

Hard to pin down the style of Hine's hand in production, but a very
modern electronic basis, with a lot of keys and signal processing to the
music.  Probably Aaron Silverberg, our resident NMS sonic specialist, can
more cogently comment on RH's touch at the sound, far better than myself.

Anyway, sorry rush-mng, for my spewing onto the NMS with Hine stuff.  Just
thought I'd contribute a little history to one of Rush's producers.

Merry Satan Day....to all, and to all a good dip into a sulpherous pit of
flame and lava.....

Cheers....
and Robert Heinlein essentially put it best that Hell is just misunderstood,
and had a bad public relations group on its retainer.  It really is a large
hotel complex, with air conditioning and great parties.

<A NAME="668006">Subject: Why Talk About Rush on the Radio?</A>
Date: Fri, 23 Apr 1993 22:06:46 -0400 (EDT)

I've been ignoring the "Rush on the radio" thread for the most part, hoping
you guys would get tired and quit it.  Then in the last digest I saw
something that puzzled me.  Something to the effect of: "we all know that
it's best to hear our favorite band on the radio."

I don't get it.  Since I have every record made by my favorite bands, why
would I want to hear them when I'm listening to the radio?  I listen to the
radio to hear music that I _haven't_ heard before!  Unfortunately, this
attitude seems to have taken over rock radio programming in the form of
innumerable "classic rock" stations.  Rock listeners are bombarded with the
same stuff they have in their record and CD collections, while deserving
new acts struggle to get attention.  It stinks, and I don't see why we want
to encourage it.

There is one occasion when I love to hear my favorite bands on the radio--
when they've released a new album.  If I'm lucky, some stations will even
play the albums in their entirety at night, so that I can tape them and
sustain myself until I get out to purchase the things.  Of course, that
fits in with my insane theory that radio should stimulate the sales of _new_
material.

I've noticed a few Research Triangle natives posting here lately.  In case
<A NAME="668307">you missed my From: line, I'm a Duke student, too.  What do you figure the</A>
chances are of a Rush date at Walnut Creek next tour?

Hey all!
    First, I would like to thank whoever came up with the idea for the
'Satanic' NMS.  Sorry I can't remember your name.  Issue 666 was thoroughly
enjoyable.
    Second, I was wondering why Rush couldn't do an Unplugged set without

(oopsie) redoing their songs.  I realize that acoustic and electric guitars
do sound different, but since they're both still guitars, shouldn't they
sound at least somewhat the same?  Or at least close enough that they shouldn't
have to rework everything.
    Third and last, I'm not sure whether or not I said it in my other post
about the poll, but I am only interested in tabulating Rush album covers, and
not other groups.  Also, please don't send names of bootlegs as they are,
after all, not designed by Rush.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be bootlegs!
     This is Mike Miller, saying the opinions expressed above are not
necessarily those of Western Illinois University.  BUT THEY SHOULD BE!

<A NAME="668009">Subject: Donna!?</A>

Well,
I was reading the NMS for Friday and stumbled across the discussion of
Donna. Now if this Donna Lee is the same song as Donna, then I have the
writer as being Jackie McLean. He was the sax player for Miles Davis from
the early fifties. I have some Miles and on his version of Donna it lists
McLean as the composer. Coltrane might have covered it, since he did play
with Miles starting about 1958(I think). Donna came out of some jam
sessions Miles's band did in '52. Charlie Parker was Miles's mentor for
awhile as well. So all of these guys are certainly conected together! If
this is a different song, forget what I have said. If you don't have and
Miles Davis in your collection, get some!!! He is awesome. Since we're on
jazz, I've noticed some talk about Jaco in the past. I'm suprised none of
you bassists have mentioned Stanley Clarke. Talk about a fusion bassist. I
would highly suggest his first album, self titled, School Days, and
Romantic Warrior by Return to Forever. If you've never heard this band,
it's comprised of Stanley Clarke, Chick Corea, Al Dimeola, and Lenny White.
Quite a foursome. (Besure to give us your two cents worth about
jazz, Skyhawk!!!) Oh well, sorry for the lack of rush content, but good
jazz is always fun to talk about.

This is a parody of 2112 writted by My friend Woody and I (Voodoo Child) and
distributed thru our online humor group "DigiT.W.I.T. (Digital Tea With
Intensive Toking). It took us along time to do this one because we are MEGA
Rush fans and we considered it "sacreligious" to parody Rush ... anyways ...
ON WITH THE PARODY!!! :)

I: Overture...

(Groovy instrumental -- 2112 Overture)

And the TWITS will screw up the Earth...

II: Temples of Smeggage

>... the massive laughs of the TWITS rise from the heart of every JPL BBSer.
I have always been enjoyed by them.  To think that every single shread of
JPLness is caused by them ... all is kewl and neat with the TWITS...

We've screwed just 'bout everything
The par'dies you read
The songs you sing
The stories that give pleasure
to your mind
Read em all and get your gun
Smeg off
All in fun
Never need to know
how or why

we are the TWITS
of the temples of Smeggage
Our smoking modems
Fill the dusty halls
We are the TWITS
Of the temples of smeggage
Our gift to life
Held within your guffaws

Look here at what we've made
Humor is
Our stock in trade
C'mon and read this stuff
oh man
What a nice contended user
Let the sysops
be undone
Get the users proudly
high on spam

we are the TWITS
of the temples of Smeggage
Our smoking modems
Fill the dusty halls
We are the TWITS
of the temples of smeggage
Our gift to life
Held within your guffaws

III: Discovery

>...behind my computer desk, In that little cubbyhole, I found it.  I brushed
away the spider webs and wondered what it might be.  And then I realized.
It was the number to a CLINK BBS.

>...I learned to navigate the myriad of CNet Amiga, and hit my keys to type
out my feelings.  As I found, you could make signature files.  How different
it could be!  I can't wait to tell The Guru Crew!

What can this strange board be?
When I call it, files forth be unbound
It's got users that call it, and leave messages
What can this board be which I've found?

See how it's pfiles call apart
And users leave mail in hate
CNet is hard like a mountain
CLINK is easy, with no pain

I can't wait to share this new network
The users will all see it's light
Let them make their own sig files
The sysops raise cain on this night....

IV: Presentation

>... In the silence of chat mode as I finished typing.  I looked at the
monitor to see a grim and expressionless taste.  The Sysops rose to their
feet and threatened to delete my account ... instead of the joy I had
expected, they were words of angry rejection!  I watched in shock and horror
as they deleted my precious mega-big sig....

I know it's very weird
to page you so
But I've found this rad sig file
I thought that you should know
Look at my sig file, and see what it can do
The MCI here spells out "Lame is life"
I know that it will annoy you...

The Guru Crew:

Oh yes we know it's nothing new
It's just a waste of lines
We have no need for lamer ways
Our net is doing fine
Another ploy that helped destroy
That AR Race of man
Forget about your silly whim,
it doesn't fit our plan....

The Users:

I can't believe you're typing
These things just can't be true
Your net could use this beauty
Just think what we might do!

The Guru Crew:

Don't annoy us further
We have maint to do!
Just think about the users
What sigs have they for you?

V: Oracle: The Dream

>... I guess it was a dream, but even now it seemed so vivid to me.  Clearly
yet I see the beckoning of the twits as they stood on the roof of the Inn.

>... I see still the incredibly lame humor of their text files, and the spirit
of laughter revealed in the lives and works of this board.  I was overwhelmed
by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way of BBSing
a way that had been driven underground by the CLINK Guru Crew long ago...
I saw now how meaningless BBSing has become with the loss of JPLness...

I blundered on though silent mail
And fell into a fitful sleep
Dreamt  reigns through the night
CLINK ... can't you get less uptight?

I call up a trial lair
H/AI confronts me there
Sysop leads me on ... boards fall away
Through cool users ... JPL ways

I see work of weird people
who grace this strang and wonderous board
I see the hand of humor arise
With twisted mind and open flies

They left AR boards long ago
DigiTWIT still learns and grows
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the network ... where they belong

Back to CLINK, AR down
Home of change ....

VI: Solioquy

>... I have not called out for days now, my home is my last refuge in
my total dispair.  I only have the music of Rush to comfort me now.
I can no longer BBS according to the rules of CLINK, but there is no
other Amiga network to go to.  My last hope is that with my HD crash,
I may finally pass into the board of my dream, and know JPLness at last...

The board is still in my directory
The board is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
For my term is dead

I wish that it might come to pass
and not fade like all my dreams
Just think of what sigs might be
If CLINK would only be like me!

I don't think I can carry on
This cold and empty sig
Activity is low ... I'm watching Dirty Pair
My hard drive ... crashes over....

VII: Grand Finale

	DigiT.W.I.T. has returned to lead a revolution through humor and
JPLness.  Although their battle is a long and bloody one, it is ultimately
a victorious one...

Attention all Sysops of the CLINK network!

We have assumed control!

Date: Sat, 24 Apr 93 09:53:14 EDT

Hi there.  I am a very devoted RUSH listener and will probably always be. It
seems rare to find true artists like Neil, Alex, and Geddy. I will also come
right out and say that I am a professing Christian. Study of Christian
Doctrine as well as Philosophy were two great loves of mine in college.  I
will also come right out and say that RUSH is not satanic, does not teach
satanism or even wastes time with lyrics of such low commercial
acceptability.
As someone with a Bachelors degree in Bible, I find it to be very embarrasing
when I read these kind of articles that try to include the band RUSH as being
satanic.  These other so called Christians  really do give Christianity a bad
name when such fanatical and unsubstantiated claims are made.  These are
usually the very self righteous type of individuals who strut around like a
peacock thinking they are better than anyone else (especially if ya dont
believe exactly the same way they do). Quite often idiots like this usually
have their own opinions and ideology made for them by someone else.  They
also seem to self qualify themselve as judge and jury without any real
evidence to condem others.  You know who I am talkin about.  These kind of
people make great cult members and you can usually find them demonstrating in
front of just about any abortion clinic. It sorta reminds of the song "Witch
Hunt". Excellent Stuff.  Oh well, I have rambled on long enough.  The 666
issue hade some very creative and funny stuff in it.  Cant wait for the new

<A NAME="668013">Subject: Rushians in Greece too...</A>

Greetings from Thessaloniki, Greece to Rush fans all over the world

I joined the mailing list two days ago and this is my first post to NMS.
One day, a few years ago, I listened to a 3-hour Rush-special on a local
radio station and this is how I became a Rush-addict.
I like older albums (before EXL) more but I think that the band is
moving with its last albums towards a different but very interesting music
direction. Therefore I will not agree with all those who expressed objections
about Presto.

The only complaint that I have is that the guys never gived (and
probably will never give... ) any gig here in Greece.
Well, there aren't so many Rush fans here but there are many
people who respect good rock music. In fact the opinion that most
Greek rock fans have about Rush is that they play an "eccentric" kind of
music. I think that they have this opinion because Rush's music is not
very widely spread in Greece and generally in Europe ; in fact
the radio stations and even MTV - which is seen in every Greek house -
rarely play a song from them.
Nevertheless there are many people here who love Rush and therefore
I think that Greece should not always be excluded from Rush's European
tours.

Anyway, as I understood by reading the FAQ, the band will not be coming to
Europe at least for this year, but anyway I 'm looking forward to listening
their new album.
I really enjoyed some wonderful material that I found by doing ftp's at Syrinx
and I want to congratulate all of you who work or contribute in any way to
make this site so complete. Keep up with the good work...
I have read the NMS No. 665 and 666 ( WHAT AN ISSUE!!! ) and I will soon read
some of the older issues too. For the time present I only have a few comments:

To (Bruce Holtgren) <70724.1622@CompuServe.COM> - If your lists are correct
then I must be the first person from Greece that joins this mailing list.
I also hope that I won't be the last, in fact I am looking forward to meeting
more Rush fans from my country.

To cdean@gmuvax.gmu.edu - My favourite album cover is AFTK ( Well I was always
a pessimist...)

To (Steven Rush Fennell) SRF6200@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU - I loved this amazing
story of coincidences about Rushsylvania.

- Nick

P.S. 1 - I have an objection about something that I found in the FAQ file :
I believe that I know enough about Greek mythology and I have never
heard before that Rosinante was the horse of God Zeus (that's written in the
FAQ file ). Are you sure about that?

P.S. 2 - Since I am a newcomer could somebody give me the answers
( by mail - if you think that nobody else is interested ) to the
following questions:
i. Well, since I obviously don't watch Canadian TV could somebody
explain to me what "The National Midnight Star" has to do with Rush ?
ii. Who is this Rush Limbaugh and what's his connection to Rush?
I have also seen a newsgroup with his name (I think it's called
alt.fan.rush-Limbaugh) but I don't know anything else about him.

<A NAME="668014">Subject: Thanks for the survey</A>

Hi,

   I wish to thank the guys (especially Chris) for starting this dicussion
about the diversity of Rush fans. I am an Asian Indian and am really proud
to be a Rush fan and a subscriber to NMS. In fact, Rush is the one thing
that I spend most time on compared to any other activity during a day,week
or month. I am not a native speaker of English, but I am glad that my
vocabulary is good enough to appreciate NP's lines.

The thing I like most about Rush is the outstanding quality of the lyrics
 and the ability of AL and GL to produce music which conveys the depth
 of the lyrics in a fitting manner. As one among numerous examples, I would
 quote Witch Hunt.

  The thing that surprises me is that groups that write absolute trash get
more recognition than RUSH. I don't mean to criticise anybody's taste, but
it does'nt make sense to me why RUSH is'nt the most popular group in North
America, at least among white Americans. Correct me if I am wrong. And I
think is is rather sad that non-white people don't listen to RUSH as
much. Somebody mentioned that this may be due to the fact that RUSH is
from the great white north. I know that rock music itself is not very
popular among non-white people. But does anybody out there think that
Rush's popularity among other races is limited because it is from a
predominantly white country.

   In all the articles about this subject that I have seen so far, fellow
RUSHians have been extra cautious with their words. I appreciate. But
I think we should'nt be over cautious and avoid dicussing something just
because it deals with issues of race.

P.S. My apologies to the RUSH-MGR if I have exceeded the
 80 characters per line limit. I will be more watchful
 in future.

  [ No, your post was fine. If it happens again though, I might have to take
    some serious action against you... :)			: rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="668015">Subject:      Presto</A>

Hello, Rush fans!

     Let me start by saying that this is my first posting to this list.
Many of you are discussing Presto, so I'll add my two cents too.  Since
Presto was the first Rush album that I bought, I suppose that it's only
appropriate that it be the first album that I comment on here.
     Sometime around the fall of '89, when Presto was released, many of
my friends who are Rush fans were running out and buying it.  Of course
I'd heard of Rush before, but I was only familiar with songs like Tom
Sawyer and Closer to the Heart, and the other handful of songs that ever
get any radio airplay.  I decided to buy Presto, and to say that I was
impressed is a major understatement.  I've since bought all of the other
legitimate (as opposed to bootleg) Rush albums and I like most, if not
all, of them more than Presto.  Imagine my surprise when the album that
led me to buy more Rush albums came out near the bottom of my list.
This is not to say that Presto is a bad album (not even close), but many
of the others are so much better.

     I guess what I'm trying to say here is that if you're discussing
whether or not Presto is a good album, it is.  If you're discussing
whether or not Presto is a good album FOR RUSH, well, that's different.

     It'd be hard for me to pick a favorite Rush album, but if really
pressed to do so, it'd probably come down to either MP or FBN.  I only
wish that radio stations would give more airplay to songs like Anthem
and Red Barchetta, but I guess that's a different topic, huh?

          Looking forward to Critical Mass and a tour next winter,
               Jason Isner

I happen to have the a pair of sticks which Neil used durring the RTB
Centrum show.  These sticks are the ProMark 747 STYLE sticks, but are
NOT the exact sticks which you might see in the stores with his
signature printed on them.   They seem to be a prototype of the 747
stick, probably somthing he may have been testing, or and old pair of
the trial signature sticks which ProMark sent him.  I beieve they are
ProMark, but there is no model number writen on them.
	IN ANY CASE. That was not my point.  The interesting thing is that
these sticks were supposedly used durring his drum solo.  he used the
opposite ends of the sticks, perhaps for more power. He also put a
criss-cross pattern on the 'tip' end of the sticks.  Seems like he used
some tool to imprint a grip on the wrong end.  Unusual.

The two major FM stations here in Newfoundland (OZ FM and VOFM) play quite a

Okay, folks, here it is:

    As promised, the truly last word on this simply DREADFUL subject
(I know, I kinda fuel'd the thread...this is penance). Okay? Okay.
BACKWARDS SATANIC LYRICS DON'T WORK PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY'RE BACKWARDS.
As any student of the occult can tell you, reversing things is thought
to be satanic, because reversing "undoes" whatever was reversed. Thus,
the Black Mass involves reading the Lord's Prayer backwards as a way
of perverting and "undoing" it. So including lyrics to the effect "Go
ahead and kill yourself because God hates you anyway" will only cause
suicide if they're recorded FOREWARD. Put them on your album in reverse,
and everyone listening to it will start going to church and whatnot.
What a relief, huh?

Evenin' folks,

I was noticing the dissection of Anagram and thought I'd put in my two
cents.  In addition to every line being an anagram within itself, there
is a theme based around that: it talks about how so many things are
hidden within others, or how some things stem from others.

It is truly a work of genious...IMHO.

I used to have a radio show at WSBF-FM Clemson entitled Focus where I
would look at the music and history from one band a week.  I did a
special two part episode for Rush.  We went into the studio and recorded
all the readings on reel-to-reel and then slowed them down considerably
before converting them to cart.  (These are the readings for 2112 that
are in the album liner, by the way.)  I then played them at the
appropriate points in the song over the air.  The result is somewhat
like the Necromancer.

Mail me if you'd like a copy.  I also played Neil Peart's drum solo he
recorded at the Buddy Rich Memorial concert.  It is neat to hear him on
a four piece jazz kit.

Spin that wheel...

<A NAME="668021">Subject: covers</A>

in NMS 667, someone (i can't remember who; i'm sorry) suggested that Rush play
covers in the live shows, and suggested (half-jokingly i believe) that they
should do so to prove their talent.  a) Rush isn't the type of band that needs
reassurance--they're going to play whether people think they're good or not,
and since we think they're good that means more concerts for us.  regardless,
they won't cover songs to prove their talent.  and b) Rush probably won't play
any covers anymore.  if they wanted to, they'd have been doing it for the last
twenty years.  thus i guess i'm being a half-empty guy, but only realistically,
since i'd love to hear them play covers, and make other songs "Rush" songs, by
which i mean perform them in their distinct style.  if i had my way completely
(which i don't, but people have been giving their fantasies, all of which i've
had too, so hear goes one of mine) they wouldn't play just normal covers.
since LVS is based partly on cartoon themes, i'd love to hear them play it, and
then in the middle of "Monsters" play a few bars of the looney tunes theme song.
or perhaps they could go classical and play fur elise.  (i think it'd be great
to hear beethoven with a drum beat--that piece was built for a rock trio.)
or if they decided to get really crazy, they could cover something like "take
me out to the ballgame."  certainly Geddy would have no problem with the words.
but, alas, this is but a fantasy, and we'll never hear Rush cover anything.
which i guess is good, because i want to hear Rush songs played live, and Rush
is the only band that can do it properly.

 Hi  RUSH Lovers

           666 issue was an interesting one. But I can't help
feeling that it is an injustice to Peart who has written profound
lyrics whether it is science or social problem and there can be no
comparison with other music groups whose lyrics are nothing
but crap without the music. All the same How about an
iisue like 666 which dealt with satanism we have one purely
devoted to the contributions of RUSH to science and humanity!!

Ok,
	So lots of people *claim* to know all the anagrams in "Anagram
(for Mongo)"...  has anyone actually solved them all?  And would someone
please list the permutations thay've come up with?

	(I know, I know, no one wanted to admit that they only came up
with a few because they'd feel excluded from this elite group who know.
Well, luckily, I have no pride. . .)

This could be the ultimate radio story regarding Rush.  Those of you
in lower Michigan may already know it.  Radio station WRIF (101.1 FM) played
the entire Rush catalog, from A to Z, last weekend.  They started at 6 pm
Saturday and finished Sunday morning.  The station followed all that with
the 3 live albums.  I started with "A Farewell To Kings" at 6 pm and made it
until 2 am or so, before dozing off to "Middletown Dreams".  I've been a
Rush fan for only a little while (4 years) and I was completely amazed with
both the size and depth of the band's work.  Only Rush could pull off a
radio program like this.  It was definitely a treat.  BTW, the radio station
is making the playlist available, and I'm trying to get one.  I'll pass it
along if anyone's interested.

Later Days,

George

I can now honestly say that every Rush song has been played on one of the
local radio stations here.  WRIF in Detroit continued its "A-Z" series by
playing every Rush song, "A-Z" on Saturday.  Every single Rush song ever
performed, including 2112, Cygnus X-1 Book II Hemispheres, etc. was played.
After that, the stationb played all three live albums in their entirety.
Eat your hearts out!

Oooops!

Appologies folks, my post in #667 contained a goof:

I said the bootleg I had was Entitled live at St Louis, and Geddy says
"...Wembely"  this is in fact *the other way round*!! ie: its Entitled Live at
Wembley and Geddy says "Let me hear you St Louis!".

Rupert Hine
-----------

Another artist I've spotted Rupert Hine getting his claws into (sorry folks but
the two Hine albums are my least favorite Rush albums IMHO) is Stevie Nicks, as
in the ex-lead singer of Fleetwoodmac, Hine produced her album _The other side
of the Mirror_ and its typically Hine like. So much so when a mate of mine said,
"Have a listen to this" and put it on the turntable (it came out between
 _presto_ and RTB, I think) - the first thing I said was - "Rupert Hine
produced this!"

Thats all for now folks

Hey Guys (of all sexes), it's Me again!
	Everybody seems to have enjoyed the 666 special edition so much, and
because of finals keeping me too busy to add to it I have had a Good Idea;
Let's make a TNMS #666 special edition that is released (like) every month or
so.  A place where we can poke fun at those who believe in the satanic Rush.
Or, maybe make a standard section of each TNMS issue devoted to this cause?

Just a tiny tidbit --

   I've noticed that the character "Vivian" in "The Young Ones," a british
sitcom (would that make it a brit-com?) occasionally wears a Rush t-shirt (
from 2112 I think.)

   If you haven't seen "The Young Ones," it used to appear on MTV, and it can
currently be found on video tape.  It's strange, occasionally violent, and
funny in a beer-bottle-bashed-on-your-head, kind of way.

I've got one.  When Rush played Dallas on the HYF tour,  I went with a group
of five friends to the concert.  One of my friends (I'll call him Sid,) got
really (I mean REALLY) drunk *before* the concert.  Here we were, two of us
dragging a semi-consious Sid through the parking lot and up to the entrance to
Reunion Arena.  Needless to say, the security guard at the door wasn't about
to let us carry Sid inside, ticket or no.  Everybody else went inside while
we took Sid back to the car.  When we got there, I realised we didn't have the
car keys!  Neither of us was about to go back and get them from the owner, so
we slid Sid *underneath* the car and left his ticket in his shirt pocket.  (By
this time, he was fast alseep.)

When the concert was over, we returned to the car to find Sid still snoring
away under the car.  We woke him up and hauled him into the car and headed for
home.  On the way home, we convinced Sid that he went to the concert, had a
wonderful time, and got laid at a party afterwards by a beautiful blonde.  To
this day, that was Sid's favorite concert!  We just don't have the heart to
tell him!!
