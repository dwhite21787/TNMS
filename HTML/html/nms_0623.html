Rush Fans......

        I have an excellent story to tell...it might be a little long, but
it's definitely worth telling...I pulled an all-nighter last night (2-14)
in order to study for a big physics test today, and I happened to have the
lounge tv on eMpTyV.  As some of you might know, Steve Isaacs does a morning
show called "Rude Awakening."  "Who cares?" you ask?  Well, at about 6:15 am
EDT, the other guy in the lounge with me yanked my headphones off of me (I
was enjoying my latest RUSH mix) and told me that something was on about RUSH.
I hit the stop button just in time to hear Steve say something like this:
"...Freddie Mercury had to die before Queen got the respect they deserve...
does someone in Rush have to die before they get the respect they deserve?...
So, I've decided, being the *HUGE* Rush fan that I am, I'm going to spearhead
the movement to get them the respect they deserve around here. (To studio
crew) What do you say guys, let's hear it for RUSH!" This was followed by 
lots of cheers and clapping from the cameramen, directors, etc.  It actually got
pretty loud...  I was all set to *FINALLY* see a RUSH vid on MTV (I have yet
to actually see one on TV, not counting a taped MTV spot), but then Steve led
out to five minutes of commercials and a shitty Whitney Houston song that she
ripped off from Chaka Khan.  I suppose there's still some hope that the
general MTV viewing public will get around to finding out about RUSH...but I'm
not holding my breath.  I did see Geddy on "The Week in Rock" once, it was
just a "Happy Birthday to:" thing, but he was on there.  A friend told me that
he was actually interviewed on the show once right before the RTB tour, but
that's just a rumor.  Anyway, did anyone else see this this this morning, and
do you know how Steve got to talking about the trio?  By the way, I just got
my copy of OtE, and I can't get over the quality.  Excellent, and thanks to
all that recommended it to me.  Later!

Look, Ma, I got a .sig!

Has anyone notices a large influx of Permanent Waves posters suddenly
appearing in music stores? I have noticed at about every "independent"
music store and poster shop that Permanent Waves posters are being sold. This
is similar to another "wave" of Grace Under Pressure poster about a year
ago. Does anyone know if some company has the rights to produce Rush
posters, and every now and then, they simply make a poster of a different
album?

PS: Does anybody have any info on the band Dream Theater? I know
nothing about them other than what's in the liner notes of their album.
ANy additional info is much appreciated. (e-mail, not in NMS)
Thanks!

Hi folks:

   For those of you who have "Rush through time" and "Fly by night"...
I had RTT some time ago, and I remember that the version of 'In the End'
had an extra verse played with acoustic before the drums come in...
Is this true, or am I just going nuts? (I hope not)

  In response to whoever wrote about some mumbling noises about 7-8
minutes into the Camera Eye:  I know exactly what you mean.  Some friends
and I listened to that part for almost an hour one day trying to figure
out what they were saying.  We never came to a definate conclusion (and it
was a while ago, and I haven't listened to it in a couple weeks), but I
thought it sounded like someone (who??) was saying "hello" and then
"goodmorning prof".  Of course, I could just have got that idea in my head
and made it stick.  I have no idea WHY that's there, though.

  These goofy little things that no sane person would care about are
EXACTLY why I got on NMS (this is my first entry).

howdy all

	About that "glitch" in The Camera Eye at 8:54..this was
discussed in previous NMSes, and here's the best explanation of
it that I've seen:

Alex: " 'allo! " (long and drawn out)

Geddy: " Mornin' Gov'! "

	These, I guess, are popular ways of greeting in England (with
the strong English accent, of course).

	Just my views on this.

I heard the "Glitch" in Camera Eye a few years ago when listening to the CD
through earphones, and it never sounded like a glitch to me.  After a few
careful listens, the sounds came through clearly as " 'ello"  with the
response of "Mornin' Guv"  both spoken with an accent.  As an American from
the South, I won't even attempt a guess at where the accent was from.  I only
know that the speakers (I assume Geddy and Alex) were speaking English, and
neither of them belched.

Oops.  I had a feeling that would happen, after seeing Jeremy's post.
At first I thought that this was that same old thing coming up once
again.  Then I saw the way he signed it, but I still had a feeling that
most people wouldn't get that, and this would happen.  Yup.

He wasn't serious, guys.  This has been rambled on about incessantly

I agree.  Definitely not stale.  How can anyone say that about a song

Hey all-

I spent the weekend on a road trip through Kansas(west to east and back) for a
wedding in KC, Mo. In doing so I was surprised by the amount of Rush I heard on
the radio. In very little time of actually listening to stations that might
play Rush(most of the rest was spent *finding* said stations), I heard
_Something For Nothing_, _Subdivisions_, _La Villa Strangiato_, _Digital Man_,
_DEW_, and _The Spirit of Radio_(*in* KC, so not so surprising). One DJ claimed
to have played _Finding My Way_, but I didn't get to hear it. Granted, these
are stations whose emphasis is on older rock, or even rock by older players,
but I found it refreshing. After my wife's comments about Kansas radio being
abominable(though she typically skirts the KC area), I was concerned that all
the recent music on the airwaves in Kansas came from Nashville.

Hi kids,

   Someone mentioned that the Juno Awards are going to be on soon.  Since
I'm all the way down in Delaware (Ah, yeah, Del..ah..ware, OK Garth), I
was wondering if anyone in the Canada area that can get it on their TV
would record it.  I would love to see it.  I've never seen it and besides
Rush, I am a fan of a lot of other Canadian musicians (Triumph, Frozen
Ghost, Honeymoon Suite, Max Webster, Loverboy, Kim Mitchell, Tom Cochrane,
Bryan Adams.......).  So if someone would PLEASE tape it, I would be more
than happy to pay for the tape and postage or whatever.  Let me know!!

   Oh yeah, and Dan.............Because we're here.

  Well, even from the front row, about all you can see of Neil is arms and 
legs..... they just move too fast...:)

  For the Presto tour here in Charlotte, I sat 1st row, right side, but in the 
center (figure that..).  Simply put, I sat right in front of Geddy Lee for the 
majority of the concert.  You could get a decent view of Neil because of the 
gap on the left (his left) side of his set.  Had a great view of Ged, even 
made eye contact a few times. The only bad part was that Alex stayed on the 
other side most of the time, but I guess you can't have everything.

  I don't think the floor is the best place to see Neil though.  Probably the 
seats just to the right or left of the stage would provide the best view, IMHO.

Regarding license plates:  A friend of a friend, both of whom are Rush
fanatics, has NY plates that say YYZ - 2112, or the other way around.

Now for the fourth member thread (sorry I am coming in late, I was on
Vacation for a week.  New Orleans.  WOW!)....

Look in the liner notes for RTB, I believe it credits another keyboard
player on a few of the songs.  I am also fairly sure that Rush had a mystery
fourth player for the keys on some songs during the RTB tour.  I am not
positive, but I heard that from more than one reliable source.  It would not
be a big surprise.

I am a stagehand, and one of the sound guys that I work with loaded Rush in
Connecticut.  He gave Rush's engineer a lot of shit about the amount of
equipement that they have,  Especially having two consoles in the house.
That would be 60 to 80 channels or inputs in the sound system!  He gave the
engineeer a good ribbing about that many channels for three guys!

I will try and find out of they did indeed have a fourth player in the
wings!

Yes, Margaret Atwood is Canadian. Why not be distrustful of authority?
I think one of the reasons that the members of Rush and other Canadians
are distrustful of authority is that their families moved to Canada in
order to escape totalitarianism.

I guess you're so adept at finding anti-capitalist propaganda that it
only takes a few minutes to recognize it when you see it. Did the book
have a name? Are you sure you were confusing the author's ideology with
that of a _character_? Sure Dos Passos didn't endlessly praise capitalism,
but neither did he endlessly praise socialism. Many of the characters
in his books are socialists because socialism was sweeping America (and
the world) during the times he wrote about. I find him a deeply insightful
writer never committed to writing propaganda for ANY ideology. MOST
importantly Dos Passos has no more in the way of grammatical problems
than James Joyce or many other great writers. If you had difficulty
with the punctuation I wonder how you were able to _tell_ that what you
were reading was propaganda?

The only thing remotely resembling propaganda that Neil has ever used
as inspiration is Ayn Rand's writing, and he even sometimes seems to regret
being as straightforwardly "pro-capitalism" as he up until a decade ago.

Another Rush-related license plate sighting: Tucson, AZ; corner of Mountain

& by the (IMHO) politically-correct bumper stickers on the van, the license
plate was *not* in support of Rush Limbaugh.....    ;-)

& speaking of Rush dreams!  I had one last night - me & 4 of my high school
friends were driving from Houston up to Dallas to see a Rush concert. It
was rather strange since I've never done that before (gone to Dallas for
something fun) & since at least 2 of those particular friends despise Rush.
Maybe this means they'll change their minds soon!! I can only hope...

bomb inside.  This is one of the most obnoxious practices I have ever seen in
rock music.  Think about the logic of this, hiding a performer offstage for
whatever reason.  I find it to be rather insulting.  Image before substance.
Think about how it would feel to play in a concert but be forced to stay
offstage!
	I was thinking the other day on an unrelated topic and I realized just
how much a good keyboardist can add to a rock band!  I do mean GOOD keyboardist
as opposed to a few block chords or fillers.  A lot of bands have keyboard
bits like Rush does without really bringing them out front.  Background
keyboards are what is stale.  They can add a little bit but sometimes take
away when they don't really fit the song.  Bands with a good keyboardist, and
I am talking here specifically about rock music,  have an extra dimension that
an extra guitarist just cannot add.  Keyboards are the most versatile of rock
instruments(i.e., there are more things you can with all the technology that
is available today) and really open things up.  Where are the Jon Lords and
Ray Manzareks of today?  Thank god that Wakeman and Emerson are still around!
Roddy Bottom of Faith No More and  Kevin Moore of Dr--m Th--t-r(there!  are
you happy now?) give that added dimension to their bands' sounds that I am
talking about.  I will give credit for filler keys to T-Ride, however:  Their
drummer actually reaches over and plays them while drumming!  It's really wild,
as his drumming is none too simple either.

"All right!" or something like that.  I haven't checked for it on the CD,

OK: I saw something that was TOTALLY ridiculous in the last NMS.
Someone (I forget who...) basically bitched at Neil for being arrogant
and selfish, and that "Neil OWES us some insight".

I say WHY? He doesn't owe us SHIT.... Ever listen to Anthem "Yet it was
for me not you that I came to write this song".  He doesn't write music
for anyone but himself.  His 'job' is to write Rush songs, period.  He
isn't required to do a damn thing else.  Be thankful he does ANY
interviews at all.  Plus... since when is a poet, author or anyone else
was required to interpret their work.  He has the right to do anything
he pleases.  Are you a Rush fan because Neil is a cool guy or because he
makes good music?  Neil could personally tell me to fuck off, and I
might be pissed, but that doesn't make his music bad.  The emphasis is
Rush's music, all else is periphery, and unnecessary.  Be thankful
there's any interviews at all.

	[ Get ready.  I smell the makings of a flame war :) :rush-mgr ]

Additional note: Everyone I know who claims to have met Neil ALL said he
was REALLY cool and friendly.

Women RUSH fans:
	good for you.  seriously, not many women that I know of have
progressed up to rush, I really don't know why, but I'm very glad to hear
that the lyrics, in appealing to both genders, transcend yet another
boundry!

RUSH's fourth member:
	Yes, that are lots of other people who have influenced the lyrics
and music.  One could almost claim that the unofficial forth member is the
producer of each album.
	No, it just wouldn't be RUSH.

Rumors:
	or speculation?  it's a fine line, eh?
	bitching about them doesn't make it better, either.
	In the spirit of RUSH's great and virtuous effect on all our lives
why don't we just can the bitching in favor of discussing how great this
common thread of ours is!

Neil:
	The one thing I've always gotten out of his interviews is that he
writes what he wants to write, not to satisfy a pop audience (or even his
fans) but because he feels it (has to be written or he is expressing
himself).
	I think with RtB we're seeing for the first time Neil really
expressing his feelings about world politics and people and such, more of
an expressive "beyond oneself" sort of approach that adds yet another epic
quality to the music.  Hey these are songs that will be around for
generations after you, I, or the "boyz" are!

A great gift:
	Whether you agree with some/most/all of it, it's an amazzing
collection.  I have every record up to HyF and then started on CDs.  This
will be my gift to my children (boy or girl) and I anticipate they will
get passed on through the family as the great works of art/philosophy that
I value them as.

	I second whoever in yesterday's NMS said that Neil owes us fans
his explainations of older lyrics.  I remember in an interview last
summer (published as a special edition of the NMS) when asked about
something in the song "Fountain of Lamneth" Neil replied "That was 15
years ago...get a life" or something to that effect. This is just plain
rude of him! I can understand why he may not want to do detailed comm-
entary on every obcure lyric from "Madrigal" or something, but when asked
a simple straightforward question, he should answer it. Who cares if something
is 15 years old.
He wrote, he can answer questions about it!

I recently purchased a Rush interview CD (Actually it's just Alex) called
_The Story Of Kings_.

Since the CD doesn't give much information, I was wondering if anyone knew
anything about it like: Who is the interviewer?  What magazine did this
interview appear in?  Where was the interview conducted?  (I'm quite certain
that it was in a restaurant, because there are several dishes and the like
being clanged about throughout the interview, and since the interviewer has a
British accent and the CD says 'Made in England', I assume that the interview
was conducted in England.)  When was the interview conducted?  (I am guessing
that it was done around 1988, because Alex mentions their most recent album
as being _Hold Your Fire_).

If anyone could give me any information about this CD, I would appreciate it
greatly, and if there is a transcript somewhere, that would be great!

   [ The interview has been transcribed and is on syrinx.umd.edu via anonymous

Hi. Is this fourth member rumor for real? Where/how did it begin?

I have heard Geddy in numerous interviews (Rockline comes to mind) that
 adding a fourth would never happen. Why would anyone question this now?

It would be a bad idea, period. They have gained all their success as a
trio over the last 25 years; they should remain as such until the day
they decide to pack it in.

Triumph tried this stunt on their Sport of Kings tour, by adding a guitarist
keyboardist named Rik Santer. On a 12-87 Rockline interview with Rik Emmett
and Mike Levine, they both said that they would "never do it again", though
they enjoyed and appreciated Rik's contributions. If Rush were to make
this mistake, and I don't think they will, they will most likely look back
on their decision the same way.

Just some facts and my opinions.

Date: Tue, 16 Feb 93 11:44:08 EST

Hey, everybody:

	Well, boil me in oil if I spell anything wrong (just kidding to
whoever posted that...)! Reading last night's post was a great experience,
and the discussion was very lively, so good work to all the contributors of
#621-622.

	Anyway, I wanted to respond to a couple of the posts. Jeremy
Brinkman said that he believed Rush should have quit after the Hold Yor Fire
album came out. I don't want to flame him or anything, but I would really
like to defend Presto, mainly because that was the album that got me into
Rush. I really think it is a good overall album. Obviously, some of their
older material is better and they may never match it again, but I feel that
Presto had good direction. I really like many of the songs on that album,
such as "Show Don't Tell" (which I think is one of the best opening songs
for any of their albums except PoW's "Big Money"), "War Paint", "Presto",
and "Available Light". I really enjoy popping that album into the cassette
deck and cranking it. I think Rupert Hine and Rush put together a great
collection of songs. I think that it is tough to find a theme for the album
like they usually have, although maybe there is one that I am just missing.
The only guess I can venture is the passage of time. You want to slow down,
step back, and look at life; you think of your past and the "scars" that
have left their imprints on you. You see how one action leads to the next
and that the spark never really dies... I don't know. I'm just rambling
here, but I really think that everyone should take a good listen to it
again. I can't say that their last album was one of their better works, but
I think that Rush has plenty left in them to continue on. I mean, they
couldn't possibly produce "Roll the Bones" and end it on such a mild note.

	Also, in response to "elmo:" I definitely (is this spelled right?)
agree that the live version of "Passage to Bangkok" from the Exit, Stage
Left album is better than their recorded version. I kind of find the studio
version a bit cornball (flame all you want, but it is...), so I think the
live version definitely makes up for it. I mean it is really a great song,
but it took a live version to make it so.

	Nothing else to say here. Rush on, y'all...

The studio version is better because right before the solo, it has that

<A NAME="623026">Subject: percussionist or drummer?</A>

	This is in response to Steven G. White's entry about the conflict
between Neil and Tommy.
	First of all, in reading your letter, I was truly dissapointed to
read that you think Neil Peart is above and better than any marching band
drummer.  Well, well, well, let me tell you something.  I've been drumming
for about nine years, and I personally love no other drumming than that of
drum corps.  In my opinion, it is the hardest and funnest and most
rewarding type of playing.  Now, I love rush, and Neil is one of my
favorite drummers, next to Charlie Benante and Larz.  This is not to say
that these three are by any means equal in playing, I simply love the way
all three play.  When it comes to drum corps, the things they are playing
is just amazing.  When you try to put twelve different guys on a snare
line and have them play flammed fives and cheese doodles, you start gettig
into some pretty serious stuff.  Now, I love Neil Peart, but I really
don't think he could stand in a Blue Devil line up and play clean, and
this probably goes for any other rock drummer out there.  So, don't even
compare any of these rock drummers to drum corps material, because there
just isn't any competition.
	Now as far as Mr. Meza's comments go, I simply think he was trying
to state that Neil Peart has good whole hearted talent.  Tommy Lee and all
the other fag drummers out there are making most of their money because of
their beautiful hair.  Of course, Tommy can play good drums, but none of
those guys can compare to Mr. Peart.  I don't think Mr. Meza was trying to
compare them, because of course Neil blows them all away; instead, Meza
was simply showing how good a drummer can be (Peart) and how fake a
drummer can be (Lee).
	Think what you want, but that is what I think!!

I'm not sure how appropriate this is for the NMS, but there seem to be

They usually invite 35 for each seminar and they have them at UVa,

They have classes in the day and discussions in the night (always lots

die hard Rush fans would love DT and that the fans would be as
awestruck as they were when Geddy Lee discovered The Police....?
Now this is something I'd never heard of....Geddy Lee discovering
The Police? I mean, they do have a similar setup (singer/bassist,

anything to do with one another.
So tell me, is this old news or a new piece of info.? If anyone has
