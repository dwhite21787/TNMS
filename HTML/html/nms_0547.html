_Red Barchetta_ is supposedly an "unauthorized live recording". It's
identical to the disc named _Red Stars of the Solar Federation_.
Unfortunately it's a direct ripoff of the ESL video soundtrack, so you
probably won't want to buy it.

I own a copy of the disc; I'll trade copies of it.

<A NAME="547004">Subject: Re: The NMS quality.</A>

I agree somewhat with Randall Haskin in that the "quality" of posts here
has gone down, but then again, I agree with every response our esteemed
manager gave him.  I know what a news brief is, and frankly, not a lot
has been happenning lately.  But what is "an intelligent post"?  Maybe
you could give an example of "an Intelligent post"?  The fact is, we
have a very detailed FAQ that answers a lot of questions, and most people
here are quite familiar with all the topics therein.  So what is left to
discuss?  Probably the lyrics and music.  That is why you've seen the posts
you have lately.  People are grasping at straws.

On the other hand, those "other" lists have a lot of boneheads in them.
Those same groups have a lot of fans (Pink Floyd, Genesis, etc...) who
are and have always been big flamers of Rush fans on the net.  Therefore,
what do you expect?  Now, if they are fans of both groups, and are just
comparing news letters, fine.  However, instead of whining, why don't they
make a post which THEY feel is "intelligent"?

I've tried.  I noticed a great similarity between the lyrics of Rush's
"Working Man" and Guns & Roses "Mr. Brownstone", and made a post on it.
As far as I know, it was ignored.  Therefore, what I thought was
interesting was either boring to most people, or they agreed completely and
decided there was no appropriate respone. :^)  Anyway, what I'm getting at
is what is interesting to some people is not to others.

Sometimes some topics can be interesting at first (like old Rush vs. new
Rush - aaaack, whumph!), but they get so many responses that they become
tiresome.  That just happens.

So Randall, and anybody else who agreed with him, please grace us with 1 or
2 intelligent topics.  I am more than willing to read & participate, as are
many of the rest of the NMS readership, I'm sure.

<A NAME="547006">Subject: It's a rap + Environmental show</A>

I have a possible answer to give and a question to ask in this post, so
I'll get to it.
First of all, someone asked about 'It's a Rap Part 1'. I have Parts I and
II also, I believe, which appear on the import hologram cd and the 7"
shaped picture disc of Roll the Bones. (I meant parts II and III) Part I
appears on the _regular_ British CD single, which was available at the
Music Machine just outside of Baltimore, MD last time I checked. It is
also included in the compilation of the three interviews that appears on
the B-side of the Ghost of a Chance American cassette single. So if you
can't get it anywhere, e-mail me and I could get you the CDS next time I
pass through Baltimore. Hope that helped some. :)
Secondly, I started to think about something today, and I have no reason
why. In April, I believe, there was an environmental special that ran on
98 Rock WIYY in Baltimore, and on many other rock stations. It was a Sun-
day morning program, possibly airing around Earth Day, but I really don't
remember. The reason I'm asking what it was here is that Neil Peart was
one of the major interviewees in the program, which combined environment-
ally conscious rock with interview segments of some stars, including Peart,
Eddie Vedder and Don Henley. Does anyone have this on tape ? If so, please
tell me. I'd like to hear it in its entirety. I taped some of the Peart
segments, but I have no idea where the tape is now. He said some interesting
things on such topics as recycling and electrically powered vehicles, if
I recall correctly.. Well, that's all I have to say.

	I always thought it would be neat if Rush would take
Olivia Neutron-Bomb on as an opening act, and they could do a "Xanadu" duet
with her -- perhaps her performing the Rush version and the Boyz doing her
song.
	Take a second to imagine in.  It will scare you.

<A NAME="547010">Subject: The origin of Xanadu</A>

This is an (attempted) serious reply to Mark Miesch, who asked in a previous
post about the origin of Xanadu.  My very first exposure to Rush was in my
high-school English Literature class, where a devout Rush fan convinced our
teacher that since we were reading Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Xanadu" we
ought to spend eleven minutes of class time kicking back to listen to, what
else, Xanadu.  (Though it definitely beat listening to eleven minutes of Lit
lecture, it was another 3 years before I got permanently hooked!).  But
anyway, Coleridge's poem is definitely the inspiration for Xanadu; we
actually compared the words and they are very similar.
     If your question was actually asking what Coleridge's original inspiration
was, here (from the VERY back corners of my mind) is what I remember reading
about it in my Lit book: Coleridge was a confirmed opium addict, and he was
smoking (or whatever one does with opium) it one day while reading a travel
book about the Far East, which was the original source of the words Xanadu and
Kubla Khan.  He fell asleep in the middle of it and woke up filled with this
incredible inspiration for a poem.  He got down about 75 lines or so of it and
then someone completely inconsequential, the 19th century equivalent of a
Jehovah's witness I guess, knocked at his door.  He spent like half an hour
getting rid of the guy, and when he went back to finish "Xanadu", he had
forgotten everything.  This is why the poem starts out incredible and then
suddenly grinds to a halt.
	I am not an English major by any stetch of the imagination, so any
Lit-type people out there, please correct me if I've confused the facts: this
little Coleridge story seems to be one of the favorite anecdotes of academia.
I guess it illustrates the nasty way real life has of intruding on genius, huh?

*Really! I was writing the next Pulitzer Prize winner the other day, but I had
to get my clothes out of the dryer!*

P.S. This is my first NMS post so hi everyone! I'm a new subscriber and think
it's really cool.  Repetition doesn't bother me; I've never seen any of this
before :)

After he'd done so, his life was
meaningless, he had no 'dream to give his life flame'. As a result he
either topped himself, or died of boredom. Right at the end of the FOL,
there's a fading away of the music followed by a sudden whooshing noise
as it builds up again, then stops. That could be the suicide stroke, maybe?
Or maybe it's just his last breath? Any ideas?

I always thought that the "whooshing noise" at the end was a recap of the
whole song.  The song is about a guy's life, from birth to death, and the
whoosh says to me, "yeah, that's your life, come and go, a brief moment of
time, thanks for playing."   Pretty cynical, I know, but hey, that's me.

Also, since we're on the topic of starting new threads, I have a couple of
suggestions:

1)  On _Signals_ there is the ANALOG "Kid" and the DIGITAL "Man"?  Is there a
connection?
2)  What the hell is Madrigal about?
3)  What the hell is The Big Wheel about?
4)  What the hell is Neurotica about, and has anyone else asked you if the
song "Erotica" is dedicated to Madonna?
5)  Which band member would win in a free-for-all? (No, instruments are not
allowed)
6)  Does Neil still smoke, and if so, how does this sit with his 100-mile
bike trips?
7)  Let's speculate whether one of the band members has leprosy or not.
8)  I'm working on a 500-1000 question RUSH knowledge/trivia test.  Talk
about what a great idea this is and how the guy who thought this up is so
cool.

That's it for now; I hope this helps with new thread development!

While much of what you said is most likely true, I would also like to point
out that they really don't write music as a team. I get the distinct
impression, from all the interviews and such I have heard, that Neil works
on lyrics in an attic/barn/office somewhere while, nearby albeit, Ged and
Alex work on the music with the assitance of a drum machine. They get back
in a room and compare notes.

There is a lot of teamwork but it is not like bands like Queen who would
rent studio time and write in front of the mikes. There is an obvious
chemistry between Alex and Geddy, Neil has always seems distant to me, in
the context of the three of them as a band. In the Roll The Bones preview
Alex jokingly stated that they fax'ed music and lyrics back and forth. Not a
tight seeming bunch to me. It is rare anymore you see other than "Lyrics
Peart and Music Lifeson & Lee" I think the only song where all three are
attributed lyrical credit was "Chemistry."

Anyway it may indeed have something to do with it all. Or not...

<A NAME="547014">Subject: Concerning the move to Atlantic Records</A>

Ju know...

I was thinking about this awhile ago and thought I'd ask all of you
wise owls out there.

That business with Rush moving over to Atlantic Rec. has got me
confused (a bit late, I know, but better late than never).

Rush said they were tired and burnt out and weren't even sure whether
they'd even want to continue the band -- all of this after the HYF
tour and the mixing for ASOH.  But, during one Rockline interview with
Geddy and Alex right after ASOH came out, one guy asked about the move
to a new label and Ged said, "No comment at this time", basically
indicating they WERE moving to a new label (hence the 'the talks aren't
done yet and so we can't say anthing about it', mode).  Now, if they
weren't sure about whether the band should continue, why were they in
the midst of switching labels?  I know I'm kind of jumping around with
this, but I know there are interviews, etc. in which this whole thing
is discussed.  I think even Neil mentions something about it in the
'Presto' Tourbook (or somewhere), about the band not being thrilled to
death about the band anymore (at THAT time -- ASOH).  But there's also
some stuff floating around suggesting that they were in the
midst of contract negotiations at the time of ASOH.  So why bother
changing labels if you're, "most likely", not going to continue
with the band?

Am I missing something?  Am I misinterpreting something?  I'm sorry
for not having exact sources, but they are there, and if anyone
really cares, i'll look them up.  But can anyone shed some
light on this?  It doesn't seem to make sense.  Am I making more out
of this than there really is (most likely, eh?!)?...

He is unfortunately a new talk show host in America. He is pro-Rebublican,

He thankfully has nothing to do with RUSH. Besides the obvious, that is!

In response to the message about the boot called Red Barachetta and It's
a rap part one - - -

	It's funny how several weeks ago, I posted the same message saying
that I just bought the Red Barachetta boot and picked up all three of the
It's a rap promos.  And no one responded. . . oh well.  In any case, it's
a good recording, and I like the boot over all.  Russian Roulette and
Temples of Syrinx have better recordings, but it blows away any taped
boot you would ever find.
	As for It's a Rap Part One, I have it on picture disc.  I haven't
even listened to it because I don't have a record player.  The picture
disc is supposed to be some sort of limited edition, but who knows how
limited.

It is my understanding after listening to The Fountain Of Lamneth that it
is simply the story(or outline) of a ficticious characters life. He is
born, he finds a goal or dream to achieve, partys heavily along the way
and then realizes that the whole point of his journey is not to
arrive(Prime Mover), but the journey itself. I've read that "Bacchus" is
the god of good times and celebration(Party dude!) and that explains the
"Draw another goblet from the cask of forty-three..." part. Along the way
, the nameless character experiences love, loneliness, the hardships of
growing up and adjusting to the constant changes in his life. He feels
alone and deserted at one point(No One At The Bridge) as I'm sure we all
have. I think that Neils inspiration for this story is from his own
experiences when he was younger. The time he went to England seems to
echo this story a lot. Simply, The Fountain Of LAmneth is about somebody
who is born, lives, and dies.

In the last NMS, someone mentioned that during live concerts Alex's
backup vocals sounded like Geddy. What I have learned is that when Alex
sings backup on certain songs(especially from RB, Bravado specifically),
we are hearing a combination of pre-recorded Geddy vocals and Alex's real
voice. I have heard many live recordings of recent concerts and I find
this to be correct. The songs just wouldn't sound fully reproduced live
if Alex's vocals were the only source of backup. I don't think they use
vocal harmonizers at all because they sound really creepy and cheesy.

Well, that's my input for now.....
Patiently awaiting the next album from RUSH!!!!!

Re: "Remember Death"? Yes, I'd noticed it, I reckon they're just
winding up people who read morse code - any other ideas?

About "It's a Rap pt 1", in the UK it was the B to the RTB weird 7"
(is that 10" or 7" shaped - it was a (physically) square record anyway)
I think, that might not help as I know at least some US singles were
different. Sorry!

RTB liner notes, "Now it's dark" - what's it from?

'bout the "quality" post - hey, I like NMS as is. It's a great idea, well
executed!

Is this an oldie - what track was the first heard by you Rush-ians out
there - for me 'twas "fly by night"...

Off to "change my life again" I s'pose,

Ok, I saw this and couldn't help but respond.  Randall is right about one
thing, the "quality" of the NMS posts does wax and wane.  We've heard this
thread before (is there one we haven't? :-) at various times.  Usually it
comes between the end of a tour and the pre-hype from the upcoming album.

On the other hand, you have to look at all the factors.  I don't know about
the distribution of the aforementioned lists, but I do know for a fact that
the NMS is distributed to 1400+ addresses, several of which are redist-
ribution points to other groups or nets.  This makes the potential (almost)
daily readership of the NMS close to 1500.  With this much potential for
input, you are bound at any time to have people who are unfamiliar with
what has gone on before.  Many aren't willing to go through the long process
of reading 500+ issues to catch up on all the themes, so they jump in.  Also,
what is important to one person is banal to another.

Another by-product of our large subscriber base is that we have a large
volume of mail coming in every day; at times >50M in 24 hours!  Sure, a lot
of this is "fluff", but we feel there needs to be a forum to present their
views.  When the list started, it was felt we shouldn't censor posts on
ideas, just on personal flames and stupid content-less posts ("Rush rules,
dude!").

While not familiar with all the lists mentioned above, I do have experience
with a couple.  The Jethro Tull list started as an offshoot of this very list
(you out there, Roger?), and uses the same software this list does.  That
mailing list comes out once a week at best, and twice a month at worst.  I
don't think this is from heavy culling of the incoming posts (although feel
free to correct me if you know differently), but rather from a smaller
subscriber base.  The Yes list, Notes From the Edge, comes out even less
so, roughly monthly, has a "real" editorial staff, and is treated as more
of a fanzine than a mailing list.  This is a nice format, but you don't
get the up to the day information that the NMS can give, useful during a
tour or before an album is released.

To make a short point long, let the subscribers of the other lists feel
what they will about the NMS.  It serves a function apparently enjoyed by
1400+ people, and fills a different niche than other lists.  To be different
is not necesserily to be worse.  At times you have to wade through more than
others, but keep some boots handy and you'll be ok.  Besides, it's not worth
getting too bent out of shape about ... it's music, for christsake, not
international politics.  Repeat to yourself "it's just a band, I should
really just relax."  :-)

I'm sure the people at the other Band's mailing lists are going to Sh*t
on this post!  (Who cares.)

    I was at the radio station earlier yesterday and heard a rather
pop-influenced song coming from the speakers, but suddenly, much to my
dismay (or surprise, as it may be) the song ripped into Tom Sawyer.
(And then back again, but that's a different story.)  Needless to say,
I was interested in who it was.
    I talked to the jock on duty, and asked what song it was.  He said
it was "Grade 9" by The Barenaked Ladies.  I only mention this because
I know some people are interested in hearing things like that, and also
because I think I remember someone saying that Tom Sawyer was
"Sampled" into a rap song.  I'm positive this wasn't sampled, but I
believe it may be the song that person was talking about.
    I investigated further to find that they are from Canada, they
mentioned the Rheostatics in their credits (no Rush surprisingly), and
that the album was recording (the bulk of it) at Le Studio.
    So, submitted for your approval.  (Or you could just page on
by...that's okay too.)  Oh, yeah.  And I'm not against improvement, I'm
just against egotists who believe that they know what's best for
everyone. IMHO that's why it's our list and not theirs.  Scorn, scorn,
scorn and flame away.  I don't care.

First of all I would like to start a new thread......

Since we are on the video age, maybe its appropiate to start reviewing all
the Rush concert videos that are out there.

First some history...
        Concert videos have recently become very popular, Rush has gone from
just having a few ones, to at least 60.  The earliest concert video that
I'm aware of (this ofcourse is talking about Audience recordings) is from
1983 in Montreal.  This is supposed to be a very good concert indeed.  There
are also ofcourse many earlier videos, shot by the band itself.  Some of
these are available to the public (thru friends), but there are many that
have not been release (they need to be!).  The live video industry on
Rush did not really started taking off until the Power Windows tours where
maybe as many as 20 videos were shot, some with excellent results.  Ofcourse
the HYF tour has also many shows.  There some awesome Presto shows available,
but since the tour was so short, there aren't as many.  It was not until
the last tour, RTB, that things really took off.  During the RTB tours 
basically every major city where Rush played got recorded (this is awesome 
for the people that want to remember the particular show that they witness).

To start things of to a good start I'm going to review the Montreal 1988 show.

This video was shot from the right side of the stage (Where Geddy usually 
plays) This shot was not shot from the floor sits, but from the sit that usually
are above the floor.  This show has ofcourse they Hold Your Fire set lists
>..  The picture quality is good, with the entire show recorded except for
parts of the Drum solo cut out.  The sound quality I think is just good
but nothing to blow you out of the water.  Overall this is an ok show,
 soon I'm going to be getting some more shows including a show from
Japan, and one from Paris (1984 and 1992 respectavily).

If you don't have any videos, but you are interested in getting some I can
pass you on some information on how to acquire them.  I DONOT sell any videos
, so don't ask me to sell you anything, but I do know a few people, and the
cost are extremely reasonable (usually 20 bucks including shipping!)

Happy viewing, and please review the videos that you have!

Here's a perfect example of how things can be improved.  How much longer
are we going continue to allow DT posts in the NMS, rushmgr?  The last
time I brought this up, you said that you weren't going to allow them.

IMO, if anyone has some non-RUSH information to post, post something
RUSH related and then put a little one-liner at the bottom like

  Send me email if you want some Dream Theater information.

If you don't have something RUSH related to post, tough.  It's high time
we cracked down on these and make people adhere to some guidelines.  If
I wanted DT information, I'd look for either alt.music.dream_theater or
rec.music.misc or something along that line.  I subscribed to the NMS
for RUSH information.  I'm tired of wading through non-RUSH stuff.

   [ I agree, it's just that sometimes the digest is done in a hurry to
     have it ready for the cron job to pick up. With school I don't always
     have a close look at all the posts but I try. Please discuss Dream
     Theater in e-mail, or put a one-liner like is suggested.	: rush-mgr ]

I dont understand what kind of new information you are looking for...
Rush isnt in the studio, we have no word on new songs, we can only speak
of things in the past most of them being rehashed because we have discussed
them all before.  The conversation may evolve, but as far as new information
goes, NMS is on the cutting edge.  I dont know any other source of getting
this quality of up to date information at this speed.

The other groups that you listed are on tour, or have albums still on the
charts, or about to come out..  When Rush enters that category, then the
list will grow but until then, we can only discuss old topics and possible
new bootlegs..   and as for the Rush-Mgr getting in trouble for the discussion
of these boots, it is completely legal to discuss bootlegs in dept for as
long as we want..  they are illegal to record and purchase, they are not
illegal to own or discuss..  You figure it out..
