Hello, all.
     There seems to be some question as to the "Brought to you by the 
letter..."topic.  In the FAQL, it says that NP noticed on Power Windows that 
half of the songs began with the letter M.  So they included the Brought to 
you... line.  Obviously they had fun with the idea, and they put B in Presto 
and D in Roll the Bones.
     I think NP has been watching too much Sesame Street.

     By the way, could someone please tell me how to create and use a sig file?

Later.

Had a good laugh today --
While walking by some magazine racks, the word RUSH caught my eye - one
of those Guitar-type magazines has "The Spirit of Radio" transcribed!
Interested, I open the magazine to look at the transcription, and it
says at the top: "SPIRIT OF THE RADIO" !!! I was wondering how you could
try to transcribe a song if you can't even get the title right!
     Reminds me of this time I heard a DJ introduce a new song by Rush
called "DREAMTIME" (i.e. Dreamline).  Anybody have some other screw-ups
they can share?

Also - Didn't a couple bands do songs called "The Twilight Zone" besides
Rush? I can't think of the bands. . . Anybody know what I'm talking about?

Adios, o my brothers . . .

Seem to remember that the Friday Rock Show played it a few times. It was on
the Hemispheres Tour I believe and was a recording of a Rush show at the
Pink Pop Festival (I think that's the name) in the Netherlands. Haven't
heard it for a while and unfortunately lost my copy of it, but I think the
details I list are correct.

        I don't see what all this talk about who is the "BEST" bass player
in the world.  Geddy is great, sometimes amazing, but there are people out
there who can play with Geddy note for note, no matter the song or the
speed.  There are also people who can do things so few others can that they
are labeled  "one of the best".  IMHO, I feel that as far as sheer
tachnical ability and speed go, Les Claypool is by far the best bassist I
have heard.  I would rather listen to Geddy or Sting, but Les has it all
over them as far as ability is concerned.  Just my humble opinion.

P.S...if anyone knows of a source whereby I might be able to come across a

P.P.S...on My college station, WUTS, we have a weekly two hour show devoted
entirely to Rush...two albums a week all semester, baby.

Hi there..

Just thought I'd add what I can remember about the boys on radio and TV.

On Radio 1 (National "Pop and Rock" ,but really dance!! station) a week
or so before the release of a new album we would get a couple of tracks
on the Friday (and now Saturday) Rock shows...e.g., Big Money and Territories
from PoW, Available Light and The Pass from Presto, and Face Up etc,
On local Radio in Reading (210 FM?) the Saturday Rock show would also
play tasters from a new LP..Daytime Radio one has played Spirit.,
on The Golden Hour. Simon Bates has also played Time Stand Still.
Saturday afternoon (AOR show) played LP tracks when they are touring.
The singles review program (Fridays at 5pm.now no longer) played
Roll the Bones, and got a favourable review,
can't remember who the guest reviewers were
though...think that's it.

As for TV, can only remember Tom Sawyer vid on Top of the Pops, and an old
college gig (circa COS??) that lasted 30min-hour played late
one staurday night..my memories are fading now though.

That's a wrap....

Somebody in the Sting - Geddy discussion said they have never heard
Geddy play a fretless.  True, this is NOT the instrument of his choice,
but listen closely to "Different Strings."

I never noticed this until a bassist/friend of mine pointed this out to
me.  Yep...it's a fretless.

Date: Thu, 1 Apr 93 18:20:52 PST

Someone mentioned that the title, "Wavelength" sounds a lot cooler
than "Permanent Waves," but I think Rush aptly chose the latter. Back
in 1979, the term "new wave" was being tossed around a lot, as well as
punk and other stuff. I remember in an interview somewhere that Neil
said that the punk movement and its demise was self-fulfilling -- that
it was destined to fade and die based on why it had come about -- as a
bad reaction to Steve Howe of Yes! If you think about it, this is
pretty funny and true about many of the talentless bands that formed
during the punk movement, though not all of them fit this category.
In England at this time, Steve Howe and Yes reined supreme, with Howe
winning best guitarist in the US 5 times in a row. I'm sure many young
aspiring musicians were frustrated by their lack of talent, yet desire
to be a "rock star." And Steve Howe only magnified this frustration.

In any case, Rush's view was that they were creating music of more
permanence, perhaps because it at least had an interesting musical
basis and not some image or fashion basis, or some style based on some
musical inferiority complex. And nearly 14 years later, there aren't
any punk bands left intact from that time, and the title "Permanent
Waves" was indeed prophetic.

Hey Rush fans,

Bein's this is my first posting to NMS, I'd like to start with an
opening-type idea.  Every year before the next Rush concert, my friends
and I have a bit of a pool--a contest to see who can guess what the
opening song will be.  Actually its not so much guessing, because we
put songs like Big Money and Spirit of Radio into a hat and have
drawings.

Anyone have any good ideas besides these two and Force Ten?  I'd like to
know what they opened with on tours besides the last two and the ones on
video.

And does anyone think it to be just a TAD BIT wierd for them to open
with Bastille Day on AtWaS?  I love the song but can't figure it as an
opener!

"Thank you very much, good night!"

<A NAME="654009">Subject: Album Title</A>

please don't consider me rude, and please, no flames on the NMS, but i think
it's pointless to discuss what the title _Critical Mass_ means without
having seen any of the lyrics to the songs yet.  perhaps it simply means that
there will be a song entitled "Critical Mass," much like _Presto_ and RTB, or
maybe "critical mass" appears as a lyric in one of the songs, like HYF, or
maybe Neil just liked nuclear physics when Geddy and Alex wanted a suggestion
for the title.  (anything to keep the album from being called _Gangster of
Boats_.)  either way, it means something, but whatever it means will be
spelled out when we read the lyric sheet.  certainly there are good guesses,
but don't spend too much time analyzing two words--there's just not that much
there yet.

I'm new to the list but I can help out on the Hear'N'Aid album.  It is available
on CD.  I saw it at the Peaches Records store in Richmond, Virginia(W.Broad)
in December.  I'm not sure if it was an import or not, but I know that it
exists on CD.

Also, I believe that the new album will arrive in stores on the Tuesday after
Labor Day.  Why?  Hold Your Fire and Roll The Bones both were released on that
date.  I believe that Power Windows was also released at that time, but I'm not
positive.  If the new album is released on that date, I am going to cry foul.
Because of the Labor Day holiday, most of the record stores get their shipments
either late in the day or on Wednesday.  I know this happens at all of the
stores in my area at least.  Is this some kind of plot by powers unknown to
keep the album out of the hands of Rush's US fans so that the rest of the world
gets first listen?  Since this has happened for the last two albums, I predict
that it will happen again.  Oh well.  See ya!

I think I remember what you were talking about.  Ged was in the "In
the Listening Room" column of Guitar for the Practicing Musician.
This response had to do with his SLAMMING "First Blood" by AC/DC.  He
said it was boring, cliche, uninteresting, and that the bass was
nowhere to be found.  He went on to say (presumably so he wouldn't
sound anti-metal) that he loved Metallica.  "They're real musicians,
too.  Some of that stuff is wrist-breaking at 500 mph.  That feels
close to me."  Come to think of it, this article may have been old
enough to have been released before _Puppets;_  d'ya think that maybe
this was what Met were referring to in the liners?  Nah, probably
not, considering that Alex and Neil were also mentioned.  It actually
seemed logical for a second, though.

'Northern Stars' was the name of the Canadian answer to USA for Africa,
and the song 'Tears are not Enough' was included on the We Are The World album
(and yes, Geddy DOES have a line or two in the song.) Hear n' Aid, on the
other hand, was worldwide.

Hi there...

	I'm sorry to hear the convention is in danger of not
happening...I might go...if it was here in Maryland!  I'm sure we all
really appreciate all the hard work John has put into this, but
everyone needs to keep in mind that it is pretty expensive to go to
Toronto and sit there going:

"Hey, have you heard.?.."
"Yeah"
"How about.?.."
"Yeah"

"Well, then there's that song.?.."

"Yeah"

	The whole idea is nice, and I don't mean to rag on it, but
this is a lot of money!!  I don't want any flames from this...I'm
merely trying to offer a little insight into the low signup for it.

Oh, really.

I do believe that they would get equal, if not top, billing.
Now, don't get yer knickers in a bunch. I say this because they've been
around (much) longer than Rush. Kinda like Yes and Pink floyd. Geez. I saw
the MB in Erie PA about a 1/2 dozen years ago when I was 15. I was by far

I have a tape of a radio show/interview called "Up Close".  The title
for this particular show was "Rush Up Close" even though it was only
Alex and Geddy in the studio with the host (there were a few quotes
from Neil during the show, too).  The show was mostly music with some
interview questions between songs.  It was almost 2 hours long and was heavy
on songs from Roll The Bones (because it was done to promote RtB, no doubt).
It also contained "Take Off".  I taped it off of Digital Cable Radio.  At
the end of the show the host said that the show was available on CD.  Does
anyone have this show (on CD or tape)?  Has anyone else heard of it?

   [ I know you can get this (and other) radio shows from several places that
     advertise in _Goldmine_ -- just keep in mind though, that they tend to 
     charge an extraordinary amount of money for such CD radio shows. "Up Close"
     goes for around $150.					    : rush-mgr ]

also, my login/passwd arent rush-related but i named my node Syrinx

as far as weddings go, i definitely plan to have Rush played at my wedding,
whenever that might be. I figure by the time i actually get married
 i will have found an appropriate song too!
definitely have to have Ghost of A Chance......
And if the DJ hasnt heard of Rush, I will just bring my own cd's...... ;-)

Hi everyone, especially people who sent me reports of Rush on the radio.
Here's the final tabulation of what people sent me, in response to my poll
for what Rush songs are played on the radio:

Tom Sawyer -- 35
The Spirit Of Radio -- 33
Closer To The Heart -- 29
Freewill -- 27
Limelight -- 26
Fly By Night -- 24
The Trees -- 21
Subdivisions -- 18
Working Man -- 15
Dreamline -- 11
New World Man -- 10
The Big Money -- 7
Roll The Bones -- 6
Ghost Of A Chance -- 6
Time Stand Still -- 4
THREE REPORTS (7 songs): Circumstances, Entre Nous, Red Barchetta, YYZ, Red
	Sector A, Turn The Page, Show Don't Tell
TWO REPORTS (6): Bastille Day, A Passage To Bangkok, Xanadu, Jacob's Ladder,
	Distant Early Warning, Bravado
ONE REPORT (27): Finding My Way, What You're Doing, In The Mood, Anthem, In
	The End, Lakeside Park, The Necromancer, 2112, The Twilight Zone,
	Cindarella Man, La Villa Strangiato, Natural Science, The Camera Eye,
	Witch Hunt, The Analog Kid, Digital Man, Countdown, The Body Electric,
	Between The Wheels, Marathon, Mystic Rhythms, Prime Mover, Lock And
	Key, Mission, The Pass, The Big Wheel, Where's My Thing?

There were 330 total songs sent in.  I'd imagine these results are slightly
skewed towards the more infrequently played songs, since quite a few people
sent me things like "In addition to all the usual songs, I heard X (uncommon
song)."  Still, I was amazed to see some of the great songs that are played
out there -- I've never heard much except the usuals on the radio.  I think
if I ever heard something like Entre Nous or The Necromancer on the radio
I'd die from joy.  Another interesting thing (at least to me) was the total
lack of reporting Force Ten.  True, I've never heard it on the radio, but
I thought it was kind of a popular Rush tune.  OK, I think I've beat this
whole subject to death, so that's it for radio talk from me.  Later!

<A NAME="654019">Subject:      Tai Shan</A>

Greetings from a new subcriber to the NMS. To say the least, I am glad to be
a part of such an impressive network of RUSH fans. In addition to the analysis
of the band, the individuals, the lyrics, and almost-inside information (ie:
the new album title), I've noticed all sorts of obscure, though worthy,
tidbits. I thought I would contribute to this by typing out a sign that is in
both English and Chinese at the base of Mount Taishan (one word on the sign).
I climbed Taishan last June while in China (up the 6,000 odd stairs) and spent
the night in dumpy room at the summit. For the Chinese, it is a religious
experience of sorts to watch the sunrise atop the mountain and it really is an
amazing thing to see. Neil's lyrics capture the experience of climbing and
being atop the mountain so incredibly well (as you all would expect) that
even if you should never see it in person, know that there really is a serene
Buddhist temple at the summit, writings carved in gold (and red) into huge
slabs of stone and into the side of the mountain, clouds surrounding the
summit, etc. The emotions described in the song are equally accurate.  Anyway,
to get the full idea of what it's like for a foreigner to read this sign that
you see after exiting the train station in Taian, imagine you are being
swarmed by eager taxi and bus drivers wanting to take you to where you begin
your ascent up the mountain (and wanting your money!).  It reads:

MOUNT TAISHAN IS THE MOST FAMOUS OF CHINA'S FIVE SACRED PEAKS. IS SITUATED NEAR
THE EAST OF NORTH CHINA'S (something) IN TAI AN CITY, SHANDONG PROVINCE. IT HAS
AN AREA (something) 426 SQUARE KILOMETRES AND THE MAIN PEAK RISES 1545 METRES
ABOVE SEA LEVEL. IT STANDS LOFTY AND GRAND AND HAS NUMEROUS HISTORICAL RELICS
ACCORDING TO HISTORICAL RECORDS. 72 EMPERORS OF VARIOUS DYNASTIES OFFERED
SACRIFICES TO THE SACRED MOUNTAIN. ANCIENT SCHOLARS WERE AND PRESENT SCHOLARS
ARE DELIGHTED HAVING VISITED MT. TAISHAN SINCE ANCIENT TIMES. IT HAS BEEN KNOWN
TO BE THE FIRST AMONGST THE FAMOUS MOUNTAINS IN THE WORLD. MT. TAI WAS NAMED
WORLD NATURAL CULTURE RELICS BY U.N. 1987.

LOOKING AROUND MT. TAISHAN YOU WILL SEE PICTURESQUE SCENRY EVERYWHERE ALONG THE
40 (CHINESE MI) WINDING PATH FROM DAI TEMPLE AT THE FOOT OF MT TAISHAN TO THE
AZURE CLOUD TEMPLE ON THE TOP EVERYWHERE THERE ARE HISTORICAL RELICS AND
SCRIPTS OF BOTH ANCIENT AND PRESENT SCHOLARS. FROM THE SUMMIT YOU CAN SEE THE
18 TWIST AND TWINING TRAILS CONSISTING OF A THOUSAND STONE TIERS HANGING IN
THE AIR LIKE LADDERS TO HEAVEN AND THE SUDDENLY APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING
CLOUDS AND MUST SEE AMONG THE HIGH AND STEEP MOUNTAIN TOPS MAKE YOU FEEL
AS THOUGH YOU ARE IN HEAVEN. YOU WILL BE CHARMED AND CARRIED AWAY BY THE FULL
MOON ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP, THE NIGHT VIEW OF PARADISE STREET AND SUNRISE.

TAI'AN CITY AT THE FOOT OF MT TAISHAN IS SITUATED ON THE TIANJIN PAUKOU
PATHWAY. IT HAS CONVENIENT TRANSPORTATION CONNECTIONS AND A WEST-EQUIPPED
HOTELS WHICH GIVES EXCELLENT SERVICE. TOURISTS CAN REACH THE SUMMIT IN AN HOUR
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION BY VARIOUS TRAINS AND CARTE CARS. MT. TAISHAN
WELCOMES YOU.

Aside from some punctuation that I added, this is how it reads. Note that if
one chooses to climb Mt. Taishan, you can take a bus to the halfway point and
climb upward from there.  The above sign says that you can reach the summit of
Mt. Taishan in a hour from the railway station, but this isn't possible if one
chooses to ascend the mountain using the paths and stairways which lead to the
summit.  I'd be interested in hearing from anyone else out there (via email)
who has also "stood at the top of the mountain."  RUSH RULES!!!  Signed,

                                                                D. Adams

shouldn't those checks have been sent already??......

Greetings fellow Rush-heads!
I hope all of you are getting your daily dosage of Rush...no day would be
complete without it. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knew the meaning
to the song Prime Mover. I know that the phrase "prime mover" is often used
in reference to God, but what do the lyrics of the song mean. Please someone
help me! Prime Mover is hands down my favorite song from Hold Your Fire but
for the life of me I can't seem to figure out what the song is specifically
about.Please, could someone give me an answer and help put an end to me long
streak of sleepless nights.
On a lighter note, since Collins is producing this new Rush album and he did
produce Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, is there any chance of Rush playing
more songs in concert from these two spectacular albums?
Well that's all I have to say. Take care of yourselves and enjoy the weekend.
Also, I would like to say hello to Pete and Daryl. Adios!

<A NAME="654023">Subject: Critical Mass, Etc.</A>

Not to get too overspecific on nuclear physics (mainly because I know so
little about it) but Critical Mass is the minimum amount of uranium (or
insert your favorite fissionable material here) required to support a
*chain reaction*.  It is called a chain reaction because the splitting of
one uranium nucleus releases 3 nuetrons.  These *three* (anyone see any
kind of trinity connection here) nuetrons go on to split other nuclei
releasing three more nuetrons, ad nauseum.  When enough material is present
the system can continue to produce its style of energy without any outside
help.  (Hence chain reaction.)  This creates a situation where
a great amount of energy is released.  It is also when things begin to
get interesting.  Hopefully it is from this latter observation that this
'working title' has been chosen.  Hey, Geddy did say that the songs were
intense.  Of course one can read in any kind of interpretation that they
want to, I am just letting everyone know that I think the title is cool.

The reason that the June/Sept. rumor for the album and tour respectively
started is that Alex was heard on 97.7 FM out of St. Catherine's ONT, saying
that this was going to be the case.  Obviously this source of information
that was aired was relatively old, but it was reported by a disc jockey on
that radio station.  I know that it is more likely a Sept./Jan. combination
but I did hear the other 'rumor' from a respectable source.  I hope that
helps to clear up where this info did come from.......

                                            Lew
   [ What?  Your statement that the reason for the June rumor is because
     Alex said this on 97.7 FM out of Ont. is wrong.  Never once in the
     interview did Alex say "June", it *IS* mentioned that the album
     will come out in Sept/Fall 93.  NOTHING about June.  The June rumor
     can be traced back to alt.music.rush in which a poster relayed he
     talked to a friend (BC Brandt) who told him the album is coming out
     in June.  Regardless, rest assured the June rumor and the frequent
     postings to USENET on the "upcoming releases list" that say June is
     wrong.						:rush-mgr]

<A NAME="654028">Subject: My big fat geek session on criticality</A>

Hi.

I'm not a member of this list, but, on rare occasions, I pull a copy of the 
digest down, just for kicks.  Because I am now bored, I thought I might share 
a few choice tidbits of information on the term "critical mass", in eager 
anticipation of the new album.

I, alas, am a nuclear engineer.  A dying breed.  Spurned by humankind.  Oh 
well.  Please don't throw rotton fruits and vegatables.......

My specialty is, drum roll please... nuclear criticality safety!  The formal 
definition of that being, "The prevention or termination of inadvertent
nuclear criticality and protection against injury or damage due to an 
accidental nuclear criticality." I've done a pile (ha ha!) of this type of 
thing, from commercial reactor fuel storage pools, to nuclear weapons 
decommissioning/disassembly operations.  Generally cool, if somewhat nerve-
racking, stuff.  The penalty for screwing up can be rather serious.

The critical mass of a fissile nuclide is the mass of that nuclide for a given 
material composition, geometric configuration and temperature distribution,
that yields a "multiplication factor" (often called "K") of one.  What that 
means is the number of neutrons produced in fission is perfectly balanced the
number of neutrons that are parasitically absorbed or leak out of the system.  
That's right, the famous self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.  There is not
a single number that represents the "critical mass" of say, Pu-239.  Some 
examples:

A sphere of alpha-phase Pu metal at 300K:  10.2 Kg

The above sphere surrounded by 12" of water (the addition of water serves to 
"reflect" back neutrons that would have, otherwise, leaked out of the sphere 
of Pu):   5.43 Kg

A sphere of Pu-water solution at 300K and 35 g Pu/liter concentration, 
surrounded by 12" of water:  0.53 Kg

A sphere of Pu-polyethylene solution at 300K and 37.5 g Pu/liter concentration, 
surrounded by 12" of water:  0.36 Kg

An infinite expanse of Pu-water solution at 300K and less than 7.8 g Pu/liter 
concentration (This is the "minimum critical concentration of Pu in water.  No 
matter how much total mass you have, you can't achieve criticality at 
concentrations below this.): infinity

I realize that this was some prime geeking, and I owe the whole lotta you a 
round of drinks for such a violent breach of etiquette.  I just thought I'd 
pitch in my 2 cents worth.  Maybe someone was interested.  Maybe NOT.

I don't expect that Mr. Peart gives a rip about any of the above trash.  He's 
probably talking about the mass of Tequila that it takes to get Alex really 
flyin'....  that's it!  The first RUSH beach party album... co-produced by 
Jimmy Buffet!  Bonus!

                                          -Chris Gesh
PS:
The album will probably be renamed "Lerxt in Tequila-ville"

Hey just thought i would add a couple of interesting tidbits to the NMS.
One quick question<?  Did any of you get a chance to see the last concert in
Tinley Park(a.k.a.)The World Music Theatre.  It was the last show of the 
RTB tour(I think it was June 28, 18992).  If you can remember that far back.
Think about the oncore, yes that huge neverending wet dream of a Rush Medley.
And they were coming into the Gituar forom Finding My Way.  Neil Stands up and
does a great Pete Towdsenish Windmill.  And then to top things off he takes off
his bandana and sports his MOWHAWK!!!!!! YES MOWHAWK!! UYes I know it had to be
fake but I never thought of Neal as that 'flamboyant'  But I liked It. 

   [ Actually I really don't think the mohawk was fake, I was at this show 
     and judging from the shocked look on Alex's and Geddy's face I would 
     tend to think the mohawk was indeed real.  Anyone else have good
     confirmation on this? 					:rush-mgr ]

Just a thought from SIUC

<A NAME="654036">Subject: ged's bass</A>

Myabe not everyone will agree with me on this one, so I certainly
don't mean to speak for all rush fans, but here goes:

Since there seems to be at least a couple of people on this list who
have some sort of contact with the band, I think that one of those
people should mention to Ged that he should drag out one of his old
basses for part of the new album.  Granted, the Wal is a great bass,
but most rush fans that I know agree that the Rick and/or the Fender
Jazz were some of the best sounds ever put on album, and I personally
dream that Geddy would use them again for songs that demand that
overdriven bass sound from the old days...

Granted, some of Rush's newer stuff doesn't call for that type of
sound, but picture "Show don't tell" with the Fender Jazz used in MP.
The difference it subtle, but IMO would bring a much better sound to
their "heavier songs".  And I'm personally hoping that Peter Collins
can bring out (at least in a few songs) some of the "power trio" Rush
that alot of us thrive for...

Again, this is just my opinion, but if I ever met Geddy, I think that
one of the things I would ask him is why he doesn't appreciate that
ol' Rick for what it's best for, and just try it out with some of
their new stuff.  Maybe he has, and just doesn't like it...

--Rob

PS - not trying to start an "old vs new" flame-fest, but there is a
definite contingent of us that still melt at the sound of that old
bass, even if we appreciate the Wal and its place in the newer Rush
material.

Rushians,

Several people have emailed me about my posting in the (late) April Fool's
edition of the NMS about the "information" I posted about the new album...

Well, I think it was a halfway decent attempt to fool people, and not too
bad for having been written off the top of my head at 4am (the Ian Anderson
guest artist was courtesy of my listening to Thick as a Brick at the time :P )

And, to the nameless person who actually believed me and jotted down 14 Sept.
in his calendar, dude, NEVER EVER believe anything you read/hear on 1 April!

On a similar note, what happened to the other postings this year?  Last year
the NMS had a whole special issue for April Fool's Postings (I still have this
issue and pull it out every once in a while to get a good laugh), and I'm
somewhat suprised that no one else felt like making a good joke, especially
in this period of collective ignorance while waiting for news on the new
album.... I'm sorta disappointed that no one else decided to make an April
Fool's posting, but what can I do, I did my part :(

As for the sending the FAQL to new subscribers, I'm all for it... Oh, and by
the way, did you know that 1001001 is ASCII for "I"?  :)

Slainte mhath,

Mike

Hey there,

I just wanted to make a posting (it's been a while) to remind all of you who
have access to IRC that there IS a channel there for Rush fans to congregate
and discuss the Holy Trinity (not to be confused with the Holy Trilogy, the
three Star Wars movies, but I digress)...

The channel is called #p/g! and in the channel is usually on invite only
mode (to keep out hackers and other 'undesirables'), but just /msg anyone
on the channel with a '@' next to their nickname, and they'll invite you on
in...

While we don't always talk about Rush, we do talk about them a lot, and
we like to talk about related topics, like other bands and hockey... We also
are blessed (?) by the presence of the hallowed rush-mgr(s) occasionally,
and John Santore (aka Slythex) is a #p/g!-er, so he can answer any questions
you might have about the awesome convention he's organising for Toronto this
summer in real-time, not the horrendous delays that email can produce....

Well, that's it out of me... My nickname, by the way is Jvi (don't ask about
it's origin, eh) and some of the Rush related nicknames that our friends use
are:  Snow-Dog, Rocinante, Rush, Lerxst, Signals, Bytor, etc (If I forgot
someone, sorry!  It is 7:15am now guys!).... We also have an awesome bot for
our convienience and enjoyment (RushServ) so that's another way to get on the
channel when it's invite only...

If you have any questions about #p/g!, not about IRC in general, please, my
email adress is mweintr@american.edu and my IRC nick is Jvi

See you on IRC,

Mike, aka Jvi

p.s. Pavel Bure for Prime Minister.... The Canucks will win the Cup!

<A NAME="654039">Subject: Funkin' to YYZ</A>

I have a very unusual story to tell.  About six years ago, I was spending the
weekend with my girlfriend at her dorm at Eastern Michigan University.  On
a Saturday night, I looked out of the window and saw a band setting up in
the Quad below.  Later that evening, the band started playing.  They were a
funk style band that played music like Prince, The Time, and other godawful
stuff.  Well, much to my surprise, between sets I heard the band shift gears
a bit and cut loose on YYZ.

I don't think that I'll ever see a Moris Day and The Time clone band playing
YYZ again.  By the way, they were pretty good.  The bass player ever put some
slappin' and poppin' into Geddy's bass lines!

    I am responding the to recent post "Is Clinton the New World Man?".
There may be a few similarities between NWM and BC if loosely
interpreted.  However, the posting was not appropriate for the NMS.
    The number of bboards now accessible is quite large.  Political
discussions can be conducted in a multitude of more suitable places.
Although some of Mr. Croix's claims may be a bit comical, slamming the
President is simply not within the scope of this mailing list.
    Speaking for myself, I subscribe to this list because I enjoy
listening to Rush, not reading tired Republican rhetoric.

   [ While the rhetoric is debatable, you are correct.  Take the
     discussion to email folks.  			:rush-mgr ]
