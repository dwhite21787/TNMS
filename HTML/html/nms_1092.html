     Hi fellow posters,

     Please forgive me for this question because I'm sure it's been asked a
     thousand times on here. But can somebody help me out with the meaning
     of the Man and Star.  People always ask me what it means and I have a
     hard time trying to explain it to them.

     The Alex Solo that brings out the most emotion in me = "LIMELIGHT"

     For misinterpreted lyrics:  My 7 year old sister thinks that in Fly By
     Night, Geddy sings: "Chicken McNuggets I just can't resist" instead of
     "My ship isn't coming...."  I've never told her different.

<A NAME="1092002">Subject: Synths and Literature</A>

Greetings fellow readers!
This post has a two-fold topic.

1) I've been listening to the albums from MP through RTB quite a bit lately.
I've also been reading the tourbook transcriptions from RushInfo for Windows
(get it if you haven't and can!). I've also read some of the interview
transcriptions from the syrinx FTP site. I've taken quite a bit of interest
in the synthesizer work of Geddy and how its progressed through the years.
In doing this, I've determined, for myself alone, that the best use of
synthesizers in the Rush catalog has got to be Hold Your Fire. When I say
"best use" I mean, composition, performance, and mixing. There is a steady
progression in Geddy's proliferation of synth playing that culminates with
his work on Hold Your Fire.
  Your thoughts?

2) People have been batting back and forth the literary influences of Neil
in his lyric writing. I think we can all agree that they are Legion! But I
was especially interested in the different literary devices that Neil uses.
A while back I pointed out the device of story telling bringing about a
reality (in Hemispheres). BTW, thanks for the person who pointed me to this
same device used by R.A. Heinlein in The Number of the Beast - I hadn't
really noticed it the first time I read it, I'll be re-reading it again soon!
My question is:
  Has anyone else notice other literary devices that Neil has used in his
lyric writing?

Please remember that with a new album not on the near horizon, the list
topics tend to get very varied! (as well as quite silly sometimes!) Other
lists would shut down in the time period between new material, so we can
count ourselves quite lucky to have so much to talk about in the lean years!

Later,

<A NAME="1092003">Subject: Selections for Rush tribute</A>

As a continuation of a thread started by Will Collier, I offer my selections of
artists and Rush songs for the "ideal" Rush tribute album.

I listen to most of these artists, but not all. I'm also caught between wanting
the artists to do a faithful reproduction of the original songs as Rush did
them, yet I yearn to have the artist improvise and interpret the song in the
manner they feel appropriate.

1. Queensryche: Natural Science /or/ Cygnus X-1
2. [That Japanese Drum Troop]: YYZ
3. Megadeath: Spirit of Radio
4. Melissa Etheridge: Closer to the Heart
5. Alice In Chains: A Farewell To Kings
6. Eric Clapton: Working Man
7. Toronto Symphony Ochestra: La Villa Strangiato (!)
8. Tori Amos: Tears
9. Sound Garden: Anthem
10. Pearl Jam: Between the Wheels
11. Metallica: By-Tor & the SnowDog /or/ Cygnus X-1
12. Garth Brooks: Cold Fire

     Last night I dreamed that the entire cast of the "We Are The World"
     video was singing "Subdivisions".  I didn't actually see Rush there,
     but some Geddy-ish looking girl was singing the lead, and everyone
     else sang along (James Earl Jones did the "Subdivisions" voice).  It
     was beautiful, except that most people couldn't keep up with the 7/8
     parts and ended up dropping out or mumbling along.

     I'm weird.

And to whomever mentioned a short section of "Bang and Blame" sounding
like SoR - that to me is the most Rush-like section of any non-Rush song
I've ever heard.

Hi y'all,

I have two questions that you fellow Rushites can most likely answer for
me:

1)  Is there any way I can obtain the "Take Off" single which Geddy Lee
sang for Bob and Doug MacKenzie (John Candy and Dave Thomas) on their
comedy album?

2)  Is Alex's last name pronounced "life" or "leaf" in the first
syllable?  My friend says it's "leaf" but I think it's "life".

Please post your responses on the next TMNS. Muchas gracias!

That first album is so distinct from any of the others, it's almost like
listening to another band.  So was that how Rush got started, playing
a lot of Led Zeppelin stuff?

Then on the second record, the Led Zeppelin sound is history, replaced
by many of the trademark sounds that you can still hear on
Counterparts.  I've always been a bit surprised at how abrupt that
change was and how consistent the band has been ever since.  Any
comments?

Hey dudes (and dudettes!)

(Apologies if this is a repeat topic)

How many of you have snagged the ultra-disc of 'Signals'.

Listen to 'The Weapon'.  There is a section of the song that starts at 3:15
and ends at 3:25 (just before the middle 'interlude' section of the song)
where normally we hear the a section of the chorus that goes 'And the
things that he fears, are a weapon to be held against him'.  However, on
the Ultra-Disc version, that vocal seciton is GONE!  Is this a rare thing,
or did Mobile Fidelity just screw up?

Inquiring minds want to know....

Time for a new topic everyone.

List your favorite keyboard work by Geddy.  I like anything off of
Signals, my favorite being  "The Weapon".

I would also like to know how many of you out there think the Necromancer
is possibly Rush's best song.  Alex's guitar playing on that song is amazing.

And to Donald Dintamin (I forget his E-mail address), please do not put
inside jokes (Paw Paw Raw Paw's?) on the NMS.  No one knows what you are
talking about and I don't want to read it.  Thank you.

Red Tide uses a line simialar to the title and a line in a
poem by Dylan Thomas called Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night

Rocinante is mentioned in both parts of the Cygnus epic.

oh, and to Chris at York College, Lock and Key was indeed played
live on the HYF tour.  i'd love to see it again though.  keep  your fingers
crossed.

oh, and i think the Camera Eye was also based on/inspired by something or
another. i'll have to check Visions.  unless anyone can help.

how's this for a cover: Pearl Jam doing Rivendell?

that's it for now.

Hey, how come no one has mentioned John Petrucci in this thread?  Truely,
one of the (if not THE) greatest living rock guitar players.

Actually, Rush has used Rush as bumper music MANY times, including songs
like Bravado, Distant Early Warning, and Subdivisions.  He's also spoken
about them on the air briefly (after using one their songs for bumper
music).  It wouldn't surprise me in the least if he was a Rush fan.

Hi
  This is a response to the post on April 18th by kbreiner@hopper.unh.edu.

  WHO ARE YOU KIDDING!!! Van Halen immitates NO ONE!!!

  1) The drum solo on Balance, all be it a decent one at best, in no way
     sounds like or immitates *any* Neil Peart solos. Just because Alex
     uses a drum machine for some sequences does not mean he is trying
     to be like Neil.

  2) Second, the song Pleasure Dome by Van Halen, which sucks by the way,
     is nothing like Xanadu, in sound, lyrics, or anything else.

  3) And finally, Eddy does not even listen to other music, instead he
     prefers to constantly write his own stuff.  In an interview on MTV,
     Sammy Hagar made a point of this because he thought it was odd that
     everytime he would hear a good song and ask Eddy if he heard it, the
     answer would be NO.

  My first love when it comes to music is RUSH, but I think Van Halen is
  cool as well, in fact, I am looking forward to seeing them on April 29,
  in good old wocester Mass.; after all, we all got to do something while
  waiting for RUSH to tour again ... Take care.

Well, since everyone is posting their favorite guitar solos...  Here is my
two cents worth.

        Natural Science: HyperSpace - very energetic, and raw sounding.
        The Spirit of Radio - excellent tone
        The Camera Eye - Another that has an excellent tone
        Working Man (ATWAS) - I think that Alex a couple too many daquiris
        Witch Hunt (ASOH) - Hey, that should've been in the studio version
        And of course all of the others...

See Ya, and Rush On?!!?

        Well...sure Geddy and Alex can write song lyrics, and they're OK,
really they are, but I'm sorry, it just does not compare to Neil.  And it's
not just a matter of philosophy, his song lysics are simply *well written*.
Content aside, the phrasing, the imagery, the meter, by whatever standard
you which to use, his lyrics are high quality.  Most of his song lyrics
would read very well as poetry (think of the Spirit of Radio or Witch Hunt)
or prose (Red Barchetta, e.g.).  Personally I would rank Neil up with Mark
Knopfler, Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon and Roger Waters as the greater gods of
rock lyrics. If I had any criticism about Neil's lyrics, it's that they are
generally short on insight; he's a keen observer of people and their
foibles (i.e. fuckups for those of you not studying for the SAT's) but not
one to spark a revelation.  IMHO.

        I've actually called this phenomenon the Tom Sawyer Syndrome:
hearing a fantastic song so many times you begin to forget just how good it
is.  Other songs in this category, to me, are Pearl Jam's Jeremy and,
currently, Live's Lightning Crashes, an absolutely first rate song that I'm
beginning get sick of simply because I'm hearing it three times a day on
the radio.  On the other hand, there are occasionally songs that never
sound stale, after hundreds of times through.  Personal examples to me are
Born to Run and Light My Fire, two songs that for whatever reason I just
never get tired of hearing.

    All right.  I wasn't going to say anything.  I was going to bite
my tongue (for once).  But I have to say that the references to
Hitler on TMNS have been very off-color, and very offensive.

"Why did Hitler kill the Jews?  b/c he did, Roll The Bones!"

Excuse me?!?  Hitler commited mass murder of over 7 million Jewish
people, because he was a very sick and disturbed man bent on world
conquest.  He had a very distorted view of the world, thinking that
all of Germany's problems were caused by the Jewish population.  I
don't remember who wrote this quote, but I find it very tasteless.
Secondly, another person commented on why there are no (good) bass
players left, and it was because Hitler killed all the Jews
(following the Geddy is a good bassist, Geddy is a Jew, all Jew's are
good bassists, Hitler killed most of the Jews, so Hitler killed most
of the bassists?).  Once again, EXCUSE ME?
    Hitler's massacre of the the Jews during WWII is a very serious
topic, one that shouldn't be trivialized by silly comments like the
above mentioned.
    This a respectible forum for discussing/parody/trashing of Rush's
music.  I enjoy most of the discussions, but this stuff just leaves a
bad taste in my mouth.  To the folks who wrote this trash:  try to
stay awake in history class...you might learn something.

P.S.  I'm NOT sorry for the lack of Rush content.  This is just

     Hello,

        Your Rush DJ back on the air asking for more suggestions.  Please
     e-mail your favorite Peart drum work list so that I can play it on my
     radio show next week.  Make the list however long you want.  Thanks!

        The other day in my Flight Sciences class we started talking about
     black holes and my teacher mentioned the closest black hole to earth
     is Cygnus X-1.  For the rest of the day I could not get both the
     Cygnus songs out of my head.

        In the November 1992 issue of Communication Theory (scholarly
     journal that I was using for a paper) I came across a section on the
     use of Distant Early Warning (DEW).  page 298.  Here is what it said:

        "When we say the exception proves the rule, we mean the exception
     makes us attend to the rule more than we would have if it had not
     happened.  (sound familiar?).  In an example from the Cold War, in the
     1960s the Distance Early Warning (DEW) (yes, distance, not distant)
     line of radar screens and computers in Northern Canada announced a
     Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile attack on North America.
     The computer system misread the radar signals bouncing off the moon as
     an attack because the programmers had not prepared the machine to
     anticipate such an occurrence.  This break in the list produced an
     organizational story, and there have been many similar, almost annual,
     stories about DEW line radar since then."

     Thats all folks.  Thanks for caring.

Hello everyone.

I'm unsubbing momentarily because my school's Internet link shuts down to
all but authorized summer students on May 5.  Sorry I'll have to miss
some worthwhile stuff, but maybe when I return, the Trees debate will
have been replaced by some more intriguing point to argue over (oh nooo,
don't get her started again!)

I have to say...Considering how high the male/female ratio here is, I was
really expecting more guys to flame me on what everyone has probably
guessed are some radical, feminist views.  Much to my surprise, the only
really abusive missive I got was from someone going by a female name.
(Although it could have been an alias for a sick pervert who
cross-dresses, or for a zit-faced 15-year-old loser who got pissed when
his fake ID was confiscated at the door to some strip joint...who
knows.)  In any case, regardless of whether anyone here agrees with my
views or not, there's no sense in getting uptight over it.  I don't need
the grief, and you don't need to hear my sharp retorts.

I'll be rather busy, as I start a new full-time job Monday; I'll be an ad
copywriter, entry level (naturally!) for a German-language newspaper.
But I hope to get back on again in a few weeks time.

The world ain't perfect yet, but there's a little more hope in this
corner of it anyhow.  Many thanks to the guys who've been chatting with
me privately; I'll keep in touch and try to send my freenet address as
soon as I get one.  I'm taking down addresses from all those I'm
currently chatting with.  In case I miss you, post a brief notice here in
a few weeks, say a month to be safe, just to remind me of where you are.
Discussions are fun; flaming is not. So: Hold Your Fire!

Finding My Way -- Aerosmith
Rivendell -- Rob Wasserman & Emmylou Harris
Scars -- ClockDVA
Red Tide -- R.E.M.
Mystic Rhythms -- Sarah McLaughlin
YYZ -- Weather Report (YYYYESSSS!!!)
Analog Kid -- The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
Ghost Of A Chance -- Eric Clapton
New World Man -- Sugar
Tai Shan -- Kate Bush

Jacob's Ladder -- Laurie Anderson

I had an idea for a cool way for Rush to open a show.  Those of you
who would like to hear Presto live would probably agree.  They open
with clips from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons.  In every show
Bullwinkle would say "Hey Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of my
hat... nothin' up my sleeve... PRESTO!"  At that point, the lights come
on and they start into Presto.  They could even show a snippet or two
between songs with Rocky saying "Now here's something we hope you'll
really like."  It would be silly but fun.

        In #1087, somebody was saying that Boston brags about not using
computers in studio or live.  I think this is incorrect.  I own "Boston"
and "Don't Look Back" and I believe that Scholz used alot of computers on
both releases.  The band drew much criticism for doing so and, therefore,
on "Third Stage", which took 6 years to produce, they did not use any
computers or synths.  But they are still a cool band, and I plan to see
them in Cleveland in June.

     as it flows through more than two hours of set

In issue 1087, David Panian wrote of Boston:

        I know Tommy Scholz is a mech-e grad of MIT, and having lived
        with a couple engineers in college, I know they can be picky
        about exactness . . .

Yeah. I read once that he liked to walk up and down the rows with a
frequency analyzer and white noise blaring through the speakers at
each venue in preparation for the shows.  His reason: fans pay so
much for tickets; they ought to get their $s worth.

David also mentioned the liner notes where Scholz condemns computers
et al.  Scholz is quite adamant (read: pretentious) on this issue.
I quote the following liners:

DON'T LOOK BACK: "No Synthesizers Used        No Computers Used"

THIRD STAGE:  ". . . Boston sound is powered by old, straight ahead
rock-n-roll equipment, as opposed to midi-interconnected-computer-
sequenced-synthesizers."

And finally, WALK ON:  "Boston doesn't take along sampler/computer/
tape stored studio recordings of vocals or other parts to fake it when
we perform on stage.  We actually bring instruments and play them."

This condemnation is enough to make the average Rush fan cringe with
a sudden pang of insecurity, followed by rage at Scholz for putting
the Boys down (indirectly, of course) with such strong words.  One
wonders when we will see "Save the Tube Amp Fund" next to "The Fund
for Animals" and all the other noble causes in the Boston liners.

Keep in mind though, that although Scholz is a purist, so are Alex,
Neil, and Geddy.  Their standards are different, that's all.  You
might even say that musically, Scholz is the "Analog Kid" to Rush's
"Digital Men". 8^)
