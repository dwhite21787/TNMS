Nothing too exciting today... ;-)

I found a place in the UK that's selling a TON of Rush stuff (mainly singles
and magazines, a few european ticket stubs, and two or three tourbooks).
All the prices are in UK pounds, to get *APPROXIMATE* US dollars multiply 
by 1.6. I don't have any money at the moment (been buying up Live singles 
*heh*) or I'd get a few things. 

If you buy a magazine or ticket stub from this place all I ask is that
you scan it in for the web page if I don't already have them!!

Here it is...

   http://www.rockofa.demon.co.uk/stock/rush.html

Have fun spending money! 

Oh, I also got a bunch of photocopies of magazine & newspaper articles (thanks
Ray), one of which has a ton of info on Rush's crew (even a picture of their
COMPLETE!! stage set-up) from the GUP tour. Hopefully one of these nights
I'll put my scanner to good use and get working on OCR'ing these guys...

<A NAME="2015002">Subject: The cool memories thread</A>

Hi everyone,

I've been off the list since the beginning of the T4E tour, and have =
recently re-subscribed.  What a time to re-subscribe, I absolutely love =
the memories thread. I think that's what's at the core about why after =
so many years most of us feel the way we do about RUSH. With that I have =
to add my 2 cents to the thread with my fairly recent memory of the T4E =
tour, the NMS, and the great people I met at the Landover MD show.

This all started around the time T4E came out. I'd been recently =
transferred to a new job outfitting a brand new Navy Ship (I was a Navy =
man) and was enjoying a summer/early fall season in San Diego, going to =
various schools and usually home by lunch everyday, enjoying the beach =
and mountain biking at Lake Hodges, and Penasquitos Canyon. T4E came out =
and I was very pleased and at the same time discovered the NMS while =
surfing the Net. I was looking forward to the San Diego show and =
carefully watched daily as concert dates showed up on the list, and was =
genuinely psyched for the late Nov show.  Then came the curve ball. I =
was needed in Bath, Maine 2 months ahead of schedule to help prepare =
various systems for delivery to the Navy.
What this meant was that on Nov 1, 96 I was sent packing to Virginia to =
attend yet another school, and then proceed to Maine just after =
thanksgiving. The dillema I was now facing was I could not attend the =
San Diego show with some longtime friends and bandmates ( I'd been in =
various bands in S.D County). What was I to do?  Well I decided that I =
was not going to miss the show, and I picked the Nov 7 show in Landover =
as the perfect show to attend due to it's proximity to my upcoming =
school, and I haven't really seen D.C before.=20

I'm usually not in the habit of going to large events all alone, so I =
tried to hook up with people via the NMS with mixed results. I actually =
coresponded with many NMSer's but when I arrived in Landover on the 7th, =
the pre-arranged meetings didn't materialize. So making the best of the =
situation I headed to the Hotel Bar (the Landover Hampton Inn). I sat =
there for awhile and had a couple Gin&Tonics, and I noticed some people =
strolling in and overheard them saying they were going to the show to =
the bartender. I struck up conversation with the couple and we quickly =
found out we saw each others postings on the Homepage.  We talked, =
discussed the show and were quickly joined by another couple who came in =
from Jersey.  We talked, laughed, and got well lubricated and walked to =
the show together. What a great feeling! Here I am all alone in a =
strange city getting hammered with some total strangers who make me feel =
right at home! We walked to the show and agree to meet after the show =
back at the Bar.  Cool, but the bummer was they weren't seated anywhere =
near where I was. But that turned out not to matter either. I get to my =
seat, and really young couple was seated next to me. We start talking =
and I find out that they are really young, 18. (I'm thirtysomething) I =
also find out that this is their first RUSH concert. They were =
fascinated by the fact that I'd been a fan for about 18 years and didn't =
realize that the band had been around that long. They were really nice =
kids, and were very interested in the band history, my history, why in =
the hell I was in Landover from San Diego...ect...ect.

The show starts and thier eyes lite up, we spend our time enjoying the =
show, singing, air drumming, air guitaring. It was a great time. Here we =
are: three concertgoers with a little more than a generation between us! =
The bottom line is, it doesn't matter how old or young you are.   RUSH =
fans are RUSH fans.  We're not bound by age differences, ethnic =
backgrounds, politics....whatever.  We all share the common bond of the =
love of three guy's who put out some incredible music.
It doesn't matter where you are, what city your in, you can always be =
sure that if in your travels you catch a show, you'll never be alone!

Sorry for the lengthy thread.

Kurt and Katie if your out there, let me know, drop me a line!

O.K. All you brain teasers, I'm searching for the actual movie that was
used during the backdrop footage on the big screen for the song 'Driven.' 
Our boys used portions of this footage from an old Sci-Fi film.  Remember,
it had a motorcyclist with of sort of Mad-Max feel to it, only older (I'de
guess 1950's or early 60's maybe.)  Geddy chose this particular film for
the second leg of the tour, to give the song a different feel.  It was not
just created for them, it was in fact from an old vintage film (Like the
1932 film 'The Last Mile' was used for "Lock and Key" on the HYF tour)  Any
Rush experts out there that can help me shed some light on this one?

Saw in #2014 that David Hubert had a PerWaves ticket stub for a cool
$8.50.

I still have my Signals ticket stub (and in good condition) which cost
$11.50. 

[Hey rush-mgr, if I can find a way to scan it, you want it?]

   [ But of course! Any ticket stub scan is always welcome on the web
     page!                                                 : rush-mgr ]

As a matter of fact I have all of my Rush stubs. About 14 total. I
presume you're looking for older stubs.

   [ I'm looking for ANY stubs I don't already have a scan of (that goes
     for dates where I have a stub, but you have one that looks completely
     different -- I have two different kinds from the Montreal Counterparts
     show)                                                       : rush-mgr ]

I am sorry, but i believe it was: 

"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great
civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so
dedicated, can long endure. We are met here on a great battlefield of that
war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it as a final resting place for
those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is
altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense
we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow this
ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled, here, have
consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will
little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but can never forget what
they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the
unfinished work which they have, thus far, so nobly carried on. It is
rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us --
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for
which they here gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this
nation shall have a new birth of freedom; and that this government of the
people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. "

I hope your not a DR. of History.....

Personally I reckon that it's a "sense o'clock news" type slip of the

Received my BMG catalog yesterday and noticed that they have Bob and Doug

for this album for both "Take off" with Geddy and for the "12 days of
Christmas" takeoff (heh).

Good day, eh?

<A NAME="2015009">Subject: Sorta new...saying "hi"</A>

I am sorta new to this list, but not really. My husband has been on for a
while, but I am the one who really takes the time to read it (most likely
because I have more time on my hands). Anyway...I just wanted to say "hi" to
everyone and let y'all know that I have a few decent RUSH .wavs that I would
be happy to share. I set up the computer so that whenever I get an error
message, Geddy sings "red alert". The only problem is (and this might end up
being a major problem) that I am getting fed up with Geddy singing "red
alert". I suppose I get too many error messages (I use AOL and Win 95...is it
any wonder?) and am experiencing a Pavlovian response!

I do hope that RUSH comes out with their live album and then does a major
tour. I would like to take a few weeks vacation and see a few shows around the
country (talk about a dream vacation!). Our 8 year old son would really love
this. He saw RUSH last year and had a great time (it was an outdoor concert so
it was not too loud for him). Are there any other parents on this list who
have little RUSH fans running around?

This thread about Alex's funny antics on stage made me think of one.

Saw the boys in Atlanta on T4E. I believe it was during the beginning of
the jam part of "Closer to the Heart" where Geddy was playing his licks,
I looked back at Alex and he was standing behind all of the memorabilia
on Geddy's side. If you remember, they have the caricature cut out of
the Three Stooges on Ged's side and their 3 heads are in very plain
view, making funny faces. He takes his head and puts it right next to
the head on one of the ends of the cutout and makes the most hilarious
face - he had his mouth open, it looks like he's crying. He made it look
like there were exactly Four Stooges and he stayed there for what seemed
like an eternity - I WAS BENT OVER LAUGHING!!!

Anybody else in Atlanta remember this? Did he do this at any of the
other shows?

<A NAME="2015011">Subject: Literature in Rush</A>

Hello all!

Just thought I would post something about references to literature in
Rush songs.  This, I'm sure, is a well researched, documented, and quite
possibly, an overly discussed subject in the past, but I just thought it
shows how well read and scholarly Neal can be (not bad for a high school
drop out).  It really didn't surprise me when I heard he had a Phd in
percussion, even if it's a falacy.

Here goes:

My girlfriend, who is very well read and also a high school english
teacher, was telling me some things about all the references to lit in
Rush.  I knew of some, like "all the world's a stage and we are merely
players, performers and portrayers" off of MP is from Shakespeare, but
she told me of some others that I had no idea about.  For instance,
Carve on T4E is a greek myth about a man that Zeus punishes by having
him roll a stone to the top of a hill and every time he gets it to the
top, it rolls back down.  He has to do this for eternity.

"If we burn our wings, flying to close to the sun" from Bravado on RTB
is in reference to a boy named Icarus who builds some wings out of wax
to fly with.  His father warns him not to fly to close to the sun or he
melt the wax.  Being a kid and an idiot, he doesn't listen and flies to
close-his wings melt and he crashes to earth and dies (Bummer!). 

If you ask me, this is a far cry from the mindless drab that most other
bands spew out.  I'm sorry, but "Baby I miss you.  You're everything to
me.  Come back!" just ain't goin' to cut it for me.  

I can slip into my own world when I listen to Rush and learn a
tremendous amount while I'm there too.  Pretty amazing!  

I'm glad they don't get a ton of exposure because that translates into
more for the faithful followers to enjoy.  I'd much rather attend a Rush
concert of 500 pure, passionate fans than some freak-fest of 50,000
babbling idiots who drool over bands who's most thought provoking lyrics
are "She's my cherry pie!".  

TO ALL FELLOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF RUSH:  Who gives a damn what
others think! (MTV, VH1)  Stay pure and passionate about what you love
and don't ever lose sight of what is important in life.

Stay strong!!!

Regarding my post on an instrumental release (2-Triple Aught) and the
ensuing discussion about sampling and sequencing on Hemispheres:

I was making a lame attempt at writing an amusing post about the
possibility of an instrumental album.  My reference to "sampling" was
not a technical reference as much as it was using an example of taking
a sample of their music and using it in a new way.

It's just a shame that someone can't write a gay little post and not
have the wording all misunderstood.

Pantera's or Metallica's guitarist as a member of Rush?  Man Oh Man.  I
think what we would have there would be Working Man Part 2:  The Death
Metal Tribute.  Of course they would all have to be instrumentals.  That
way, they wouldn't have to worry about us not being to understand what
they are screaming.

The first Working Man was enough, thanks (especially that metal version
of Natural Science.  Who was that "singer" who growled the whole time).

Maybe we should all bombard the rush-mgr(s) will a relentless flood of
posts. Think of it.

We could reach issue #2112, say, by the weekend.

;-)

P.S to rush-mgr(s):  Ever find someone to update the web page over at
Syrinx? I remember you once asked for someone to design a new format for
the site (something different but no frames). If your still looking, I
have some free time coming up.

Hello Rush Nuts,

I have spent a great deal of time lately debating on whether or not
to go and buy A Work In Progress.  I am not a drummer and I don't
know a whole lot about the technical elements of playing the drums.
I am just your average fanatical rush fan who thinks that Neil Peart
is awesome.  Is AWIP for me?  Would I still enjoy it even though I
probably won't understand most of his drum related lingo. Is it
mostly just an instructional video, or is there a lot of information
about Neil Peart himself.  How much Rush content is there? Do these 
videos show lots of old concert footage or does he just play the 
parts from T4E. Please fill me in on what AWIP is all about.
Thanks for your help,

Hello loyal Rush Fan from N.E. area. Yes, I'm too from the Boston Area
(actually grew up in Chinatown) and I think Rush has always performed their
best around here. From GUP through TFE (Yes, both shows.) They 've always
kicks ass. I remember in the Middle of the PW at the Centrum, lee shouted
out, "Look at all the healthy people!!!" They al3ways jhae a loyal fan base
here and the reason why, I think, is we New England has a rich musical
heritage. From the classical genre like the BSO  to the grindy and
sometimes dangerous Rat,N.e., esp.  Boston is known for original music and
premeires, not the cover bands of other areas in the country. What's my
worst experience of Rush? One: Cincinatti, 1991. THe Riverside Colloseum
really sucks in acoustics, maybe because it's a concrete structure built in
the 1940s isn't made for music( But somehow, it becomes a main venue in the
area. (It still bemuses me why.) And the fans there are really dead,
uninvolved in tunes. Man my friend and I felt we're the only ones dancing
and singing!!! Lighten up Ohioans, get with the program!!! Anyway, alll the
shows after that dead experience were realy great, esp. at Great Woods.

So N.e. Rush fans, we are very fortunate to have excellent musical tAste
for Rush to Roll the Bones here for a very long time.

Also saw VH1's special on Ozzy Ozbourne. Very good, but if they could do
one on that foul-mouth Maniac., they should do a special on Rush, right?

Peace, mann.

    Yesterday i went to a bookstore and read a book about guitars and i
found out a little more about the roland guitar synthesizer that Alex
used on the Hemispheres album.That Roland guitar Synthesizer was
invented in 1978 as a prototype for new guitar effects, so Alex in
hemispheres album was almost a pioneer in guitars effects, and it really
shows in the hemispheres song, there is a solo (don't remember the part)
that the effect is really cool that goes from one speaker to the other.

 hope that the info interest you guys

Sorry if this isn't a closely Rush related post, I'll make it short. 101
KGB is rolling around a 8ft.(2.5m) x 8ft. sympathy card for Paul for
people to sign. The thing is, they're bringing it along on a promo
tour(to a businesses where they give away tickets, broadcast live,
etc.). In and of itself I think the idea is a nice gesture. But, as I
mentioned to a co-worker today, I couldn't get these words out of my
head: 
"...glittering prizes and endless compromises
shatter the illusion of integrity."
As in maybe a mega-corporation(Jaycor, in this case) once again tying
itself to a tragic story for it's own good? I'd like to hear your

   [ Yes, please use email. And FYI, KGB is a "classic rock" station here
     in San Diego. They used to play all sorts of new and old stuff (much
     like KLOS in LA does now), but a few years back they decided not to
     play anything older than 1983 or so... (they do play Rush, but we only
     get the standard "Tom Sawyer", "Closer to the Heart", etc)    : rush-mgr ]

I don't know if this is what you meant by "obviously," but the line regarding
the flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond did seem to refer to a
divorced marriage.  That is to say, the diamond ring pawned to the pawnbroker,
still containing the new "flame" of love that would go along with the purchase
of such a ring.  That's all :)

Hey!

What's up everyone!

Ted:
>penta means 5
>pentagram means " a figure of a 5 pointed star usually made
>with alternate points connected by a continuous line..."
>(Webster's 10th Collegiate Dictionary) meaning you can draw
>the star by drawing straight lines back and forth from 5 points
>without redrawing any lines.
>That's it! that's all there is to it! ALL five-sided stars are
>pentagrams! and all pentagrams are 5-sided stars!

I think you've made a mistake! This is a correct definition, and
the one I have always subscribed to. You'll notice the Red Star
on the album cover *does not* have one continuous line drawn
back and forth from 5 points. The reason the definition holds
true for penta is *not* because of the five points of the star,
rather the five sides of the penta-gram created by drawing the
star as you suggest. The 2112 star does not form a pentagram,
thus it is *not* a demonic symbol.

Ted, no flame intended, just the facts as I see them, using the
definition provided in your dictionary.

Hmm...haven't we had this discussion already?  I believe we discovered:

Kashmir rocks
Orchestral Maneuvers (orchestral Pink Floyd) isn't too bad
and...
orchestral Rush is possible, but it probably wouldn't sound all that
great for most tunes (like Tom Sawyer, The Analog Kid, Roll The
Bones...the list goes on and on and on....)

Now...can we talk about Neil's religion, or how 2112 = 666?  (insert
malicious grin here)

Regarding this talk about replacing Alex: I can't see it happening; I hope
it never happens. I love the guy's playing. He's irreplaceable.

But, just to play devil's advocate: What if Joe Satriani or Steve Vai was
the replacement? Can you imagine the mind-blowing quickness and precision,
the interplay between either of those guys and Neil and Geddy? My head
spins at the thought.

Like stated in the last post I read the pentagram does not state debil
worshiping. It does stand for the pagan religion mainly Wicca and other
Old Celtic religions. Which it seams that Members of the band may or may
not follow! It does not matter if they do or do not. They do have songs
that makes us that are Pagan belive they do because our full belifes are
based on Nature and Helping others. 
	On another note I am a Theatrical Electrition and Lighting

again. I am looking for anyway to get in touch with anyone that has a hand
in the tours and or Lights for the tours. If you have any info for me

Such a wonderfully nice picture here I believe. very well done. I'm
truly enjoying the few remasters I have. Fly by Night is by far the
best, followed by Caress of Steel. Yum.:) I need the rest. soon.
Have to mention *really* getting into "Moving Pictures" the otherr
evening whilst working-to my shame :( I haven't got this gem out for
awhile. I think the only reasoning being that radio play had, to be
frank,  tired me of the first "side" of of this disc. Very enjoyable.

Good Job, Managers:) Thanks for your work:)
Rock on!

<A NAME="2015030">Subject: Pentagram or cool logo?</A>

In reply to Ted Gudermuth,
I see your point, but before announcing to the galaxy how right you "might" 
be--study things a little more.
If the dictionary meaning of Pentagram says that you can draw it without 
redrawing previous lines and the star in enclosed in a circle, then our 
beloved Rush-logo-naked guy-thing is NOT a pentagram nor a satanic symbol.
First of all, it is said to represent the pure of spirit or innocent (hence 
naked) going against the aggressor and higher power whom controls what "he" 
thinks and feels.
Secondly, most importantly, if you looked at the damn thing you'd notice 
that all five points, no matter which way is up, protrude slightly from the 
circle. Therefore if one who had the ambition enough to explore the 
possible satanic background of Rush, would have traced their logo and saw 
for themselves that you do indeed redraw your pencil/pen marks as you 
complete it. Believe me, I'm an artist and a Rush fanatic. I draw that logo 
quite often and have studied it because I am nit-picky. Thank you though 
for the info. I never knew the "real" definition of it.
Peace.

When someone was asking me about Rush recently, I reflected on my first
conscious encounter with the group.  I'd love to hear other people's
stories.

Mine:  At age 14 (roughly) I rooted through my older brother's LP
collection.  As a budding drummer I stood in awe as Moving Pictures played
over and over and over.  Next day required an immediate run to the record
store where I picked up the tape of Hemispheres.  Further jaw-dropping drum
ideas.  Hooked ever since.

I apologise for getting the opening to the Gettysburg address wrong.  
As a historian I should know to check my sources first.  I thank 
those of you who had the good grace to correct me privately.  You can 
be sure I won't make that mistake again!

As to Rush content: someone asked about the boys doing whacky stuff on 
stage.  Back in 1981, at Wembley, on the MP/ESL tour, during Neil's 
drum solo, I swear Geddy read War and Peace and Alex played three 
rounds of solitaire.  I may be mistaken, but I certainly went to the 
bar.
