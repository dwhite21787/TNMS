<A NAME="662001">Subject: unplugged</A>

this is in response to russell holt's post on NMS 660, concerning a
possible unplugged.  as i argued a few months ago, and will argue
again and again, i think Rush unplugged would be great, because they
make the songs good, not the electronic instruments they play the
songs with.  yes, "The Big Money" would not be suited to acoustic
instruments.  maybe not "Dreamline" or "YYZ" or "Tom Sawyer."  and
not all of "La Villa Strangiato" or "2112."  but russell (and don't
take this as a flame) Rush has more songs than these.  i would love
hearing "Mystic Rhythms" done acoustically, perhaps just with Alex
playing a twelve string behind Geddy.  or "Losing It" on a grand
piano.  or "The Trees" that includes an extended version of "Broon's
Bane."  or how about "Bravado," "Subdivisions," or "Different
Strings"?  play these songs acoustically, and you'd get a remarkable
amount of emotion.  especially "Subdivisions."  slow it down a bit,
tone down the drums, take away the keyboards, and you'd find it's not
about teenagers trying to rebel, but teens crying out for someone to
understand them.  as for "2112" and "La Villa," i think "Discovery"
and "A Lerxst in Wonderland" are more than suited for acoustic
treatment.  and i don't think that Rush unplugged would be a sign
that they've gone commercial.  they're too smart for that.  it'd be
an extension of what they've begun to do in concert already--free
themselves from the constraints of studio versions.  let's be
honest--listen to ASOH.  great stuff, but with the exception of CttH
and the drum solo, the songs sound almost exactly like the studio
versions.  so i say, unplugged is a damn fine idea.  let's hear what
the songs sound like at their essence.

	Dominic Binks was wondering about a sampled part of The Spirit of
Radio, and I think the part is the opening riff.  While I was looking
through a few CDs to buy at a sale here, a friend and I noticed that the
entire background for the rap tune that was being played was the constant
repetition of that opening riff!  Even if it was rap, it sounded REALLY
funky, I thought.  I didn't get a chance to see who the artist was
though...could it have been St. Etienne?

	In reference to several comments lately regarding MTV's unplugged,
I recently saw a bit of Pearl Jam playing some of the "unplugged" material
and I do believe that their bassist was using and electric bass and amp.
Then again I could be wrong as I only saw about 2 seconds.  I am not sure
what the other members were playing, but I think I am right about the bassist.
Can anyone verify this?  Personally I believe this takes much of the benefit
of doing the songs accoustically away.  Oh well...

Much of Led Zeppelins fourth album contains lyrics that appear to carry 
Satanic meesages when played backwards but if you copy your own vioce and 
musicians playing the same music and play it backwards...you will get the same

About a year ago, a local DJ (on WRIF in Detroit, for anyone who cares)
recorded the sentence "Jesus loves me" and played it backwards on the air.
It said "We smell sausages." And I think Led Zep (or Rush, for that matter)
has about as much to do with Satan as Jesus has to do with sausage sniffing.
I can't believe that so many people put so much stock in backwards messages!

As far as opening bands go, Eric Johnson was opening for Rush when RtB was
in Detroit, and I must say that whoever (sorry, I can't remember the name)
thought he'd be an ideal opener knows his guitarists! But I saw a Dutch band
called Bettie Serveert open for Superchunk last month and I think they'd be
awfully good openers for Rush. They have a CD out on Matador called _Palomine_,
check it out!

P.S. The date following the RtB date in Detroit was in Cleveland, and I can't
     imagine *any* band on an American tour skipping *all* of Ohio!

A couple of things here.  First my fantasy which along with many other people,
is to somehow get Front row seats and go back stage and converse with the guys.
I think that this would be a common one.
#2)  I'm not a Bass player, so please excuse my ignorance.  What is Ged doing
in the first part of Neurotica is it a monster cord or what. also what does
a fretless bass sound like(suggestions for listening).  Plus what does it look
like.  That is about it except for a last question.
In a second part to the Money question(last couple issues).  I saw Rush at
Ill. State, and I was wondering("Pink"")  how much does it cost to get Rush
to play???  I'm sure that a place like Alpine Valley has more cash then the
Student Concert Counsel(or what ever it's called).  Just a couple of ?? for
content.

Good day to everyone!

Firstly: Talking about groups with longevity, you could maybe include Neil
Young and Crazy Horse in that vein.. they have been playing together since
1969, although not exclusively with each other.  (And he's from Winnipeg,
which of course means that his music is vastly superior to anyone else's.
Of course.)

About the backwards satanic messages in Led Zeppelin:  "Right!  And pigs
MIGHT fly out of my butt.."  (I'm going to test this out with my
four-track and see.. )

My secret Rush fantasy:  Geddy, wearing nothing but his 2112 kimono.  (Is
that the kind of fantasy you mean?   OH, oh, oh, .. I see.  Right then.
<cough>)

(That, of course, was a joke: everybody knows that Alex is much more
attractive, and his kimono has a much nicer pattern to it.)  <cough><cough>

Obligatory Hockey Whinings (in point form, no less):

 - Selanne is king.  The best rookie ever, and there's no disputing that.
 - I feel sorry for Vancouver - when Winnipeg meets them in the playoffs
   (if they don't catch Los Angeles for third) they're in for a rough ousting.
 - New Jersey is going to trounce the Caps.

Thank you..  that will be all.

Hey Rush fans!
     Just thought I'd offer a little insight about Andy C.'s question about
the Anagram chorus.
     First, Satan is sometimes refered to as 'the beast'.  This could be what
Neil is talking about.  It could also have something to do with the corruption
of the church.  After all, those of the Catholic religion are often taught to
trust their priests.  However, we have often times heard of children being
molested by priests, hence there is 'no safe seat'.  and that particular saint
is definitely turning to sin.
     This is just my opinion, though.  Personally, I think the song is mostly
a free-style experiment in Anagrams, as the title itself is a joke.
     I am not one to try to get symbolism out of songs.  However, I thought
this might help in further discussions.  And to avoid flames:  I have nothing
agains the church myself.  Any of them.

Later.

In response to Earl:

Whoever mentioned the fact that "In the Mood" predated Rush as a song title
was, I believe, referring to Glen Miller, not Steve Miller, as you mentioned
in your post.  Like you said, "In the Mood" is a "big band" song, and Glenn
Miller was one of the original "big band" dudes. (I think, it's before my time,
and not really my type of music anyway)  Anyway, Glenn Miller wsa one of the
most famous "big band" leaders, to the extent that there is a ballroom named
after him here at CU.  (The fact that he attended CU might have something
to do with that as well :)

Not a flame, just trying to clarify.  I've never personally heard the song by
Miller, so I wouldn't know if he wrote one called "In the Mood" or not.

ps: Rockies are working on yet another record: most rain-outs in a season.
They are well on their way (2 rainouts in the first five home games)

I never thought I'd contribute to a back-masking discussion - but I figured
I'd comment on poyart@rdc.puc-rio.br (Eduardo Ribeiro Poyart)'s stuff from
yesterday. <on Led Zep's "Stairway..." - There's still time -> My sweet
Satan)

>You have to work with the phonemas, not with the letters themselves.

Phonemas = phonemes. & You're right - you gotta deal w/ the sounds (the
phonemes) & *not* the letters in the words.

>And the 'l' at the end of 'still' sound something like 'u': 's t i u'.

The i (/I/) is just "l-colored", not u-ish - but your interpretation will
work for this.

>If we observe that a noisy 't' backwards resembles an 's', we have <by
>inversion> something very close to 'meea sweet sreyt'.

That noise of the 't' is just (English) aspiration backwards...

I agree to a certain extent, but the explanation of back-masking given by
the sound guy (I forgot your name! Sorry!! But thanks for going into gory
detail about the process!!) last week seems more plausible.

Although I'd love a semi-linguistic explanation, I think the prosody of the
situation in this example & countless others works against it. It'd be
easier for someone to plant extra sounds in the signal to create these
messages than to find the perfect 'forward' phrase WRT vowels & consonants
*and* WRT stressed/unstressed syllables to do it. If these things were
created on purpose, they were probably done with a fancy editing jobs &
subtle addition of sounds; if not, it's all pure coincidence. I don't care
either way - anything to get a bee in these fanatics' bonnets is cool by
me.

And now the Madonna thing! (I've been saving this for weeks cuz it wasn't
enough for one post!)   I was watching TV one night and after some show on
ABC, during the credits, the lady from Good Morning America (or whatever
the ABC equivalent is) was giving previews of the next day's show. I wasn't
really paying attention (who does during credits anyways?) when she said:
"And tomorrow, Rush's answer to Madonna..."

Or, at least, I thought that's what she said! It took me a while to figure
out that she really said "Russia's answer to Madonna" - it's amazing what a
little reduced vowel will do!!   But it makes me wonder what Rush's answer
would be....Neil in a bullet-proof bra? Ged singing really bad lyrics? Alex
playing really stupid music? I don't even wanna think about the sex stuff....
<Although I agree w/ Puanani about Neil...>

Hello friends,

A short note to a fan in Kenyon, Ohio.  Rush tours certainly include stops
in major Ohio cities, as well as neighboring states' cities.  I have seen
them in Cleveland as well as Cincinnati, but they have played in
Lexington and Indianaopolis too.  You can easily make a trip up to
Richfield Coliseum in Cleveland to catch them.

said during Closer to the Heart at the 5-3-92 Rotterdam show recorded on Over
The Europe:

>G:                     Come on, big boy.
>A (still singing):    Closer to your heart
>Now he starts doing weird voices:
>Alex in low voice: I like you to meet a friend of mine. Hello baby, meet
>                   Mr Geddy (Mr Peppy??) O look, he is such a handsome
>                   man, he's very beatiful long hair??
>Alex in high voice: May I go to kiss him?
>Low voice: You may go to kiss him. Come, go to kiss him. [Kissing sounds]
>           He is so handsome, I love him.
>High voice: O okay, Mr Geddy, goodbye.
>Low voice:  Goodbye
>Geddy: That's why we love him.

Call me crazy, but I listened to that section OVER AND OVER again, and I
could not figure that out for the life of me.  Perhaps the Atmospheric
recording is not the same as OTE?  Here's more what I hear:

Geddy: Closer to your heart...
Ged, Alex, and Les Claypool (?): Closer to your heart...
Geddy: Closer to your heart, all right.
Low Alex voice: [random - can't understand]
High Alex voice: Hello?  Hello?  Who's there?
Low: Oh, no, no no no..
High:No, no no no
Low No no no, oh, oh no
[ a fight perhaps? sounds like some yelling between the characters..]
Alex:Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! [gunshot-type sounds - 11 of them]
High voice: AAAAGGGGHHHHH! [bloody murder scream]...Ohhhhh!
Low voice: [more mumbling]
Geddy: Did you get all that?

Then later in geddy's bass solo:

High Alex voice: Oh, Oh, Oh, you missed - you missed.  You missed me!

   [ Perhaps this was when the ever-present stage-hand wound fire Nerf arrows
     at Alex.. I saw this at several of the shows during CttH.	  : rush-mgr ]

Perhaps this has been discussed before, but can we try to decipher this?
It's DEFINITELY not what was posted above.....

Also, to whoever was talking about the German Roll the Bones CD single
with Tom Sawyer and Spirit of Radio live on it, those two live tracks are
directly from Exit..Stage Left, as evidenced by the credit to Terry Brown
in the liner notes, and the fact that they are a 1981 copyright.....

This is my first post so bear with me.

There was a show in the Meadowlands Arena (New Jersey) where Geddy used
the fretless bass but it wasn't by choice.  During the second song
(freewill if memory serves me correctly) the string broke and he had to
yell to the stage hands for a new bass and when the person ran out he
handed Geddy a fretless bass.  I believe this was during the "Presto"
tour.  It was pretty funny to see Geddy standing there with the bass with
a broken string flopping around in one hand while trying to keep up with
the song.  Once he got the new bass it sounded like he didn't miss a step.

Good idea.... either in the FAQ or more appropriately in the trivia file.
Here's certainly something that should be in it....

Listen to it again.... there's also a bit from "The Spirit of Radio" in
that song as well. The Barenaked Ladies are from Scarborough, Ontario, and
in an interview just before the recent Juno awards they said tht they are
big Rush fans and have been disappointed that Rush has neither received
the awards they deserve nor played at the Junos. Check them out, they have
some good opinions. :-)

About the possibilities of Rush doing an "Unplugged" album:
	Interesting as this may hypothetically sound, it would involve redoing
old music acoustically, and Rush has always moved on to new ideas. I don't
think they're likely to be rehashing their old stuff.

Anyway, fantastic as it would be for the rest of the world to realize how great
Rush is, I don't think they'd tour much more than they do now, so it would be
extremely difficult for us to get concert tickets. And then we'd be surrounded
by large numbers of people who are only there because Rush would be "popular".
The last concert I went to was bad enough, as the people behind me wanted me to
sit down where I couldn't see properly.... :-) We would hear them a lot more
on the radio, but most of us don't need radio to hear Rush anyway. So I
rather like things the way they are, at least for practical purposes.

G'day folks.

Being a performer, I look for new ways to play music that is already
established as much as I write.
Some of Rush's songs could be great unplugged.

1) Bravado (I have done this one, and it was well received)
2) In the End
3) Different Strings
4) Red Barchetta (I have not played it live, but have worked on it.)
5) Afterimage (I know of a version done)
6) Kid Gloves
7) Grand Designs (The keys could be played on piano)
8) Time Stand Still (Another I have worked on...)
9) Presto
10) Available Light

That sounds like a set to me.  Any other ideas?

Jello!

I'm enjoying -- does that concept still exist? -- a brief respite from
Hell so I thought I'd ask all you boys and girls about this --

How *exactly* does Moon Records, Anthem Records (a.k.a. Entertainment
Group) and Atlantic all fit in together?  What are the responsibilities
of each and how do they interconnect?  Anyone know?

  [ I thought that Moon Records no longer exists...		: rush-mgr ]

Just wondering.

Hi Rusheads 'round the globe,

Back in TNMS #655, I asked you to vote for the Rush song(s) you'd like to
see me play at my wedding -- I'll wait a couple more days, but right now it
looks like "Poll called due to lack o' interest."  Everybody all polled
out, I assume??  >:/   Anyway, take a minute and send your votes to:

Thanx,

Re:  Acoustic Songs

	Some older Rush material ie. from 2112 and Fly By Night was done 
acoustically.  Fine.  But any otheir material, In My Honest Opinion, would
sound slightly anemic if it were performed as such.

Re:  Satanism

	Give it a *@#%*##-ing break already, wouldja?  Save it for issue #666 
and be done with it!!

   [ Speaking of which, if you have any 'satanic' ideas for issue 666, send
     the post to the rush-mgr account, with a small header on the post saying 
     it's for that issue (I'll remove it of course).		   : rush-mgr ]

Re:  "Take Off"  on Great White North

	I have a cassette copy of this.  It was released (I think) in 1981.  
Anthem Entertainment in Canada.  I can't remember all of the dialogue from 
that skit but the lyrics that Geddy Lee sang are:

"Take off!  To the Great White North,
 Take off!  It's a beauty way to go!
 Take off!  To the Great White North!"

Then in closing:

"Hey you guys!   TAKE OFF!!"

	Anyone wants a copy can E-mail me for my address, then send a tape.  
I'll copy the entire album if desired.

Re:  2112 on the Radio

	I live in Victoria, B.C. (Canada).  I listen mostly to 100.3 fm (106.5 
if you've got cable) otherwise known as The Q.  They overplay top-20 stuff 
like you wouldn't believe, and usually it's for that reason that I tire 
quickly of listening to it.  GREAT reception, though, since I live a block and 
a half away from the studio.  Anyways, one night the D.J. said that on his way 
to work in the car he was trying to decide what he would play first.  Something 
with an "atmospheric theme", he said.  Whether or not this has to do with the 
epic, he chose 2112 in it's entirity.  That just about made my decade.

	B.T.W., When I get my car (I still bike & bus everywhere, saving 
thousands each year and causing me less guilt for polluting the air), I shall 
put in it a killer stereo, whenceforth I shall cruise into the downtown area 
on an early summer's evening blasting "Overture" hither and thither, followed 
by "The Big Money", "Subdivisions", and possibly "Anthem" as I leave downtown.  
YES!!!  That's just what I'll do, see if I don't!
