First of all, there are two new files at the ftp site.  They are:

    dreamline.voc   and    dreamline.sb

The first is a Soundblaster VOC file, and the second is another Soundblaster
compatable file.  Interesting, the .sb file is the same size as the .au file!
Ken Renard provided them, but says credit Lance Norskog (thinman@netcom.com).
Thanks to both!

I've also been informed that you can play the "dreamline.au" file on a Sun
using soundtool in Sunview or x_soundtool in X windows.

Secondly, seeing as how only a few lucky ones have gotten copies of the new
album, or even heard songs on the radio, it might be a Nice Thing (tm) if we
toned down discussions of them until they're more widely available.  I mean,
it's kind of cruel to say "it's an excellent song" if 80% of the folks around
can't find out for a month.  I dunno, call me what you will, it was just a
thought...  As usual, I won't prevent you, but your karma might suffer in the
long run.  :-)

However, I haven't. :(
I seem to recall someone saying Boston radio was playing it..what station?
I live in MA, near Amherst, west half of the state--I can pull
in WAAF 107.3, but rarely do, since they play lotsa trash in my humble
opinion. I called my standby radio station (WAQY) and they said they
would not be getting Dreamline for TWO WEEKS. *sigh*
Oh well, I'll just sit tight and wait for September 3rd. Day before
classes start, my first day of..college. Back to being a Freshman.

I can't wait.

Everyone seems to be asking for a program to convert the
Sun audio files for the PC and/or Mac. I have a program for
my Atari ST that converts Sun audio files to ST files. And
I believe the ST files are the same as those for a PC since
I can play all the PC files. Also, these may even work on a
Mac since I can play the Mac files, but I don't know how to
transfer the file to a Mac. Any volunteers? I will try to
convert the Sun files for the PC. The programmer told me
the results aren't the greatest, so don't expect a perfect
conversion.

There is only one problem. I don't have ftp access, so
someone is going to have to send me the Sun sound files.
Can someone send me the smallest Sun sound file you have so
that I can test this process? If it is sucessful, I will be
happy to convert all the Rush files sent to me.

<A NAME="315004">Subject: Bay Area Bash - initial planning</A>

We've seen a few "yes" votes for a Bay Area party. I'm going to try to
be a catalyst -- I am *not* taking charge (trust me, I'm not usually a good
organizer of events...)

We need:

1. A place to play. Garage, barn, etc... who's willing to host?

2. Musicians, so far I've seen a drummer say yes, and a guitarist friend
   of mine here would like to play (he just came by to hear Dreamline).
   I'll play rhythm.

3. A date. Before/After we Roll The Bones? Perhaps later, during the
   tour? I'll be in Davis then, though. Hello.... Davis/Sacramento area....
   anybody out there? What's the ticket situation like up there?

4. A backup. If we can`t have a band bash, we can still get together and
   meet fellow Midnight Star folks, and (optionally) drink generous
   steins of ale...  Is anyone willing to host?

My place Labor Day weekend (sat/sun/mon - choose one) is a possibility
for a small gathering (not over 20ish) we have a garage. Livermore, though.

	I don't even remember who said it, but someone decided
(as I asked for) not to flame on my "religious reference" when
I referred to RUSH as the "Holy Trinity", but on my fanaticism.
	I agree that idiot-like worship of anything is undesir-
able, but I really didn't intend to imply that I think that way.
I love RUSH's music, that's all.  I simply enjoy coloring my
writing style with things that some may take the wrong way. Sue me.
I think I know how Neil feels now.........

[ The problem with using words like "holy trinity" is that some people out
  there do it in all seriousness.  I don't think you were flamed per se, 
  more like that fanatical school of thought was flamed.  Those of us who
  have weathered Usenet music groups know about worship/flamage...

Hey all you guys in the Virginia/Maryland/DC area who tune into DC101 ...

I *finally* managed to get through on the DC101 800 line, and had a nice
chat with the DJ there.  He sez that he hasn't seen hide nor hair of the new
RUSH album around the station, but the minute he got it in, he would play
it.

Just to see if he was messing with my mind, I tried to pressure him by
saying that "other stations were playing it" (too true, unfortunately for
me), and once he decided that it wasn't just being played in the Boston
area, he got serious, and said he would definitely check into it.  He
sounded pretty hyped by the news, too ...

On a humorous note, he asked me if I drove around the country asking people
if they've heard the new album.  I started explaining TNMS to him, but he
just got confused ...  :)

So, if you're in the area, call DC101 (1-800-33-DC101) to get them to play
the album as soon as they get it!

Thanks, Sean, for the tale of your woes.  While we're begging our local
stations for airplay of the single, we might also put effort into educating
our stores about the release.  I went to Tower this weekend to fill in some
CD collection gaps (no, I've already got all the Rush ones!) and stopped to
check their coming-releases clipboard.  It had entries dated all the way
through September, and .... NO RUSH!  I asked the guy behind the info
counter, and he looked confused and clueless.  If they don't know about it,
how can we expect them to order it in time??!!

I would enjoy hearing the single on KOME.  But I'd much rather have the whole
disc in my hot little hands.  Bug your local store managers!!  This area is
supposed to be one of the country's hotbeds of Rush fans.  Wouldn't it be a
shame if we had to spend a week listening only to the wild exclamations of
pleasure from the rest of the net, while we wait for our stores to get their
late orders in?

Still waiting.... to ROLL THE BONES.

<A NAME="315010">Subject: The Bay Area Dreamline wait</A>

Hello all, Here's some info on the reason why us Bay Area fans haven't heard
Dreamline. I just got off the phone with KOME. The DJ said that the stations
over on the east coast , or the rest of country, are playing Dreamline and
other songs illegally. He would not tell me for sure if he had a copy of the
single at the station. However, he said they have not got authorization
from Atlantic to play it even if they did. He went on to say that the station
has a very good relationship with Rush, ie they are always happy to do inter-
views with them and have been good to them in the past. He told me that if
they were to play this single illegally then it would be a real slap in the
face to the band and they just would not do that because it wouldn't be fair.
Anyway, he didn't have an exact release date for playing the single though
he expected  to get it by next week. So hope this may clear things up!

Also, has anybody heard about any videos for the new songs? I know this
sounds kind of early but I remember that the video for The Big MOney
was played on MTV before the album was officially released.

Until later....

It's taken from the end of Sesame Street where they announce
"This show was brought to you by the letters Q and L, and by
the number 7". Hey, does this mean the credits on RTB are going
to end with "brought to you by the number ..."? Hmmm...

couldn't agree when to do the inteviews in

Well, I just got off the horn with 54 Rock here in Ottawa (540 AM) and

So there you go.  All you fellow Canajuns out there will have to

Hello-
        Yesterday, 96.9 WOUR (Utica,NY) held an auction of miscellaneous
musical collectibles to raise money for a fireworks display.  One of the
items, and an item of great interest to me, was an autographed copy
of the Chronicles CD.  I at least got to look at it.  The signatures of all
of them appeared on the cover and were signed in a gold fluid ink pen.  It
was nice and donated by Rush to boot.  Bids were up to $100 when I got disgusted
and left.  There were two hours of bidding on the thing left as well.  So
who knows how much it finally went for.  My other peeve was that they claimed
on the station before the auction that they had three of these CD sets.
When I got there, there was only one so I asked about the other two.  Noone
seemed to know anything (conveniently).  Oh well, another missed opportunity.
        WRT Dreamline, the above radio station said they had it but couldn't
play it yet.  Hopefully that will change soon...

Greetings to everyone in Lerxst-land!

This is my inaugural post to this fine journal and,
as such, I have more than just a little bit to say.
First, and of course least important, is a list of
the recordings in my current non-Rush rotation:

LF : Yes - Union
2B : Marc Cohn - Marc Cohn
3B : Stu Hamm - The Urge
RF : Temple of the Dog - Temple of the Dog
1B : Sidewinders - Auntie Ramos' Pool Hall
SS : Eric Johnson - Ah Via Musicom
 C : REM - Out of Time
CF : Queensryche - Empire
 P : The Replacements - Pleased to Meet Me

[ Nice 'Signals touch' there...                              :rush-mgr ]

 Having purged myself of the "need" to do that, I
 can move on to more pressing business:

 1) Dreamline - a buddy of mine has uploaded the audio
    file from the ftp server, and I got my first taste
    of it yesterday.  I am disappointed (wait, wait, ...)
    that I can't hear it in a little bit better format,
    because it sounds incredibly promising (gee, big surprise
    there)!  I guess I should start listening to the radio
    today, huh?

 2) Bay Area Rush Extravaganza (I love that word) - Being
    located in Livermore puts me well within reach of this
    kind of, pardon the reference, "Gathering of the Tribes".
    Count me in.  And, for good measure I'll bring my guitars
    and do my best at laying down some of Big Alex's easier
    (they must be easy if I can play them) licks.  Are we
    talking about something celebrating the release of 'Dem
    Bones' or a party that coincides with the bay area concert
    dates?  Or, hang on Martha, both?  Oh, now I'm gettin'
    excited...

That's about it, except to say that I'm damn happy to have
found about this 800 member well-kept little secret and I'm
ready to Roll the Bones!

After bugging the radio stations here in San Antonio (96 ROCK and 104 KZEP)
for over a week you would think they would at least call up their contacts
up north and see about getting at least an early copy of RTB.  They still won't
even acknowledge that they know about the single/album much less when they
will be able to play it.  I guess it should be no problem to wait till Sept.
3rd and that I should scroll past all the messages from everyone that has
heard/taped/uploaded/downloaded/played backwards, (yes I'm jealous), the
album.  Till then I will tinker with the Tabs to Dreamline and imagine what
the song would sound like (Thanks for the Tabs by the way), and hope by some
freak of nature, RTB finds it's way to our heavy-metal-less rock stations here
in the Alamo City before the 3rd. (Sorry Z-ROCK).

P.S.  If anybody would like to plan a RUSH party here in the Austin-S.A. area
      in the future (RTB tour 91-92), feel free to E-mail me.  THX

any of you fans in the NC/SC/VA area interested in party/concert shindigs when
they tour around here?  drop me a line (cfabrams@eos.ncsu.edu) maybe something
will work out...They should play Hampton Coliseum, right?

there are a few things i would like to say about alex being the "emotion" of
Rush--to me that's an inaccurate description...i find a LOT of emotion in
neil's drumming, no matter how structured or "precise" it may sound--i think
all three add to whatever emotion the music has.  the music itself IS emotional,
and i can't attribute that "emotion" solely to alex...for example, take "Losing
It"--i can point to the vocals and say "That's e-MO-tion!" just as much as i
could point to the percussion in "Red Lenses" or the guitar in "La Villa..."
>..i guess all this leads me to say is alex is Rush's guitarist--the emotion
comes from all three.  but "emotion" can mean different things to everybody, so
i'm probably very wrong in the eyes of reviewers or people majoring in music
theory or most of the people in music today...

anyway, this is what i think about when the boss-man's out of town and it's my
last day of work...

later

Called KRQR last night. Using Sean's (I think it was sean) format:

"Hi. KRQR"

"Hi. Do you guys have any of the new Rush that's been going around?"

"The new Rush won't be out for another two weeks."

"Yeah, the album. But the single's out now"

"We're legally not allowed to play it for another two weeks"

"But they've been playing it back East in Pittsburgh and Boston"

"They must've gotten a special disposition to play it, we're not allowed to."

"Is this for you, or all of California"

"All of California, Bye"

Seeing that other stations have already said that they'll be playing
it soon, the DJ's been misinformed.

19 days and counting...

So if anyone in the Denver Metro area hears that a local station is playing the
new tune(s), could they please post or e-mail me and let me know who it is. I
just can't bear the same music I heard five years ago and ten years ago over
and over without knowing I'll hear something really new...

Just druming my fingers in 5/4,

I just read over the last TNMS, and found out that many of you can't hear
new Rush on your radio stations.  Oh well, so it goes.  WDVE here in Pgh has
been saying it's "exclusive" to them, and can't be heard on any other Pgh
station.  They just played "Limelight" and are RIGHT NOW following it up
w/"Dreamline".  The DJ said he'll try to get "RTB" in later for me...

Anyways, so far I've managed to tape 1/2 the album from the radio:
"Dreamline", "Ghost of a Chance", "Heresy", "The Big Wheel", and
"Neurotica".  Still haven't heard Where's My Thing or that Rushrap...

Someone said that only station with a lot of metal are getting the new
Rush.  That's possible, since 'DVE is the most metallic station in Pittsburgh.
Well, so far I haven't been able to win the CD...  Especially without a
touch-tone phone line!  And I don't even have a CD player, but that won't
stop me from accepting it...

I feel sorry for you w/o RTB at your stations--there is some really good
music in the songs I've heard.

Hi Everybody,

I liked reading Neil's 'post' the other day (thanks to the one who
provided it!!!). His comments on `Where's My Thing?'' jogged my
memory to provide a possible `explanation' of the title. His
statement was it is derived from a situation where one just
can't think of the word one's looking for to describe something.
I recalled a recording I have (somewhere! I can't find it in all
my stuff -- it may or may not be (though I think it is) an
official Rush release recording -- where Geddy's talking to the
audience of a concert and he's introducing `La Villa' and instead
of saying 'This is Mr. Alex Lifeson on acoustic guitar -- this
is La Villa Strangiato' he says (paraphrase) `Here's Alex on
the thing... the thing... This is La Villa Strangiato.' So
we have Geddy saying `the thing' while introducing an instrumental.
Hmmm.... Maybe this incident became an amusement associated with
an instrumental? I can easily imaging Alex coming back with
`Where's my thing?' pretending he can't find his guitar.

Just a guess!

Gregg
