<A NAME="471002">Subject:    Back to the roots...?</A>

Yo,

   Every now & then the question is asked as to why Rush don't
play more of their older stuff, or go back to their old style
again. Although I prefer their older style, I think it would be
a big mistake to regress. Music as in everything, has to progress.
Without progression there is stagnation, and we end up with groups
playing the same songs or types of songs again & again & again
(mentioning no names...).
   The best example I can give of a group going back to their roots,
and failing dismally are Iron Maiden. They started out as a purely
Heavy metal band, singing songs about sex, drugs and R&R. Their
album covers proudly proclaimed 'No synthesisers used on this record'.
And what they did was very good, fun heavy metal.
   But what set them apart from the majority of HM groups was that
they were relatively intelligent. Steve Harris is very well-read,
and Bruce Dickenson used to be a History teacher & has a degree.
Consequently their music gradually matured, they tried new influences,
their songs became more imaginative, and classier. As time went on
they produced better & better albums, until they finally peaked
with the classic album '7th son of a 7th son'. This album not
only addresses deep issues such as the meaning of right & wrong,
but also approaches the subject in a thoughtful and intelligent
way. It is a deeply philosophical album, which I think is almost
worthy of Rush!
     However it wasn't as heavy as their other albums,
and includes synthesisers (shock, horror!). Consequently it
didn't sell as well to the hard-core HM fans, who didn't
understand it, or get any radio airplay because it was still HM,
right? Despite this album being one of the best rock albums ever
made (non-Rush albums, I mean!), the group decided to go back to
their roots for the subsequent album (No Prayer for the Dying),
and make one about sex & drugs & R&R. Needless to say it was crap!
It was such a disappointment hearing a group that I knew could
make classy, intelligent, meaningful rock music, instead make
drivel aimed at 12 year olds. They sold more records, but in my
opinion they lost their integrity doing it.
     So what's all this got to do with Rush? Well, I believe that if
Rush went back to their old style, their heart wouldn't be in it.
Any 'back-to-the roots' album would be a cop-out. We would know
it, and so would they. The album would sound like a parody of
their earlier works, whether they intended it to or not. If not a
parody, it would certainly feel self-plagiarised. That's why
Rush don't do it. That's why I don't want them to do it either.

Hello Out There,
        I was thinking about a post from a few issues back that had some
humorus suggestions on how to make RUSH more mainstream, like hiring
Mutt Lange, getting Jason Priestly in the band, having Slash as a guest
soloist.  I thought all that was really funny.  So I have my own suggestion
for Alex, Geddy, and Neil:

        Have KRS One do the rap section of "Roll the Bones"

        Hell, R.E.M. did it, why not RUSH? (grin)

I am almost 100% certain that RUSH will be playing in Pittsburgh at
Star Lake Amphitheatre on June 21, 1992.  I am not sure about when
tickets go on sale, but I will let you know when I hear...

<A NAME="471005">Subject: Questions and rambling</A>

     Hello, just a few questions and some rambling.

1.   I was visiting one of the local music stores with a friend.  At the
     time he was busy looking for something, so I started to look through
     those books that tell every album, single, or video that a group puts
     out.  I noticed, for the videos under the Rush titles, a video I've
     never heard of.  It was called _Stooge's Rock n' Roll Christmas_ or
     something of that nature.  Can someone tell me what this is?

2.   Here a question for those who have the _Chronicles_ video tape.  In
     the video _Mystic Rhythms_, there a scene were a blond haired person
     is sleeping in a bed and a large-unknown-thing is coming out a
     cabinet.  Under the bed is a plague that reads "The Dream."  Does
     this scene have anything to do with Alex's bad dream or does is have
     something to do with _2112_ Oracle: The Dream?

3.   There is no number 3.

4.   For those of you who play guitar or are good at electronic, can
     someone find me the schematics for active electronic for a guitar?
     The schematics I have are old and has many mistakes ( The guy at the
     local Radio Shack said that a resistor that the schematics stated
     would be as big a hump-back whale, I might as well play the resistor.)

                                                                 - John

Well, it's final...Rush will be coming to Pittsburgh at the Star Lake
Ampitheatre on June 21 (at 8:00 or 8:30 in the evening).  I just saw it
in the entertainment section of the Pittsburgh Press today.  This will
be my first Rush concert (hopefully not the only one either).  See 'ya

    I completely disagree with the person who said that 'Ghost of a
Chance' was written strictly for top-40 as well.  It doesn't even make
much sense to assume that they even care about the top-40, due to the
fact that they haven't had a single up there for years.  Sure, they
rode the album-oriented rock charts for a while with a couple of their
songs, but never in the top 40 of the Billboard Top 200.  As far as I
know (which may be incorrect), they haven't had a 'top-40' hit since
Tom Sawyer, or possibly Subdivisions.  With so much lack of support, it
stands to reason that Rush gives as much of a sh*t about the 'top-40'
as they do about the grammies.  Just because a song is different
doesn't mean it's a sellout.
                                Trav.

Hey everyone.

I was at a mall here in Pittsburgh over the weekend and I found and bought a
Rush poster.  It is the same as the tour shirt designed by Pushead.  The poster
is pretty cool looking, but I would much rather have the album cover or picture
of the bones "rolling" through the window -- like on Neil's bass drumhead.
Has anyone seen any other RtB posters????  Let me know.  Thanks!!!

BTW, has anyone heard when Rush tix go on sale here in Pittsburgh.  It is f
finals week and I haven't been listening to WDVE much as of late.  Thanks.

Greetings and Salutations!

I am presently taking a sci-fi appreciation course here at American University
and I am planning on doing a paper on the effect of science fiction in the
genre of rock music...  Of course, Rush came to mind, especially 2112...

What I need is for other Rush tunes, or other rock bands (I'm already using
Voivod and Queensryche) who have an obvious science fiction influence, and if
you know of any, and can send me some lyric quotes (via E-mail!!!), I would be
greatly appreciative...

Thank you, and Rush on!

My girlfriend called the Dayton radio station this afternoon (I assume WTUE)
to see what they knew about Rush at the Nutter Center on June 23.  The person
she talked to was extremely surprised that she knew and had this to say:
"Yes, they are going to be at the Nutter Center on June 23.  However, you 
didn't
hear that from me.  Officially, no one knows yet."  Also, a call to the Nutter
Center box office yielded no clues, but then again they never know anything.

What this means is: Yes, the Boys will be at the Nutter Center on Wright State
University campus on June 23.  No, tickets have not yet gone on sale, and at
present no one officially knows anything about when they will.

Hello Joe, whaddya know?

Well, another roundtable rush-a-thon, here:

1) Geddy-ism's, eh?  I think one of my favourites is the way he sings
	"Vital Signs" on the GUP video.  Especially at the end.  What a
	voice!

2) Someone also asked about the RTB CD singles.  I don't know if they're
	rare or not (anyone know?), but I do have a copy of each -- found
	completely by accident at a used record shop (altho the CD's
	themselves weren't used).  Pretty cool.  But, if I'm not mistaken,
	the CD interviews are the cut-up versions of what's on the GoAC
	cassette single.  The cassette single, I believe, is really the
	master and then they took Neil's stuff and stuck it on one CD, and
	the same with Ged and Alex.  However, the RTB CD w/Ged has one extra
	tidbit that isn't on the cassette (are we all sufficiently confused
	now?  :-).  One interesting tidbit -- Alex's version of all this is
	only available on LP, not CD.  Go figure that one...

3) A question for all you Continental States folks (commonly known as the
	Mainland  :-) -- if I wanted to buy tickets for a show, be it Rush
	or whatever else, and I had to get them from Ticketbastard or Bass
	(are those two the same?) can I call them from here (Hawaii) and
	reserve tickets with a credit card?  I'm looking mainly at a show
	in L.A.  Is it possible to do that, or does one have to be in that
	particular area to get tickets for that particular area?  If anyone
	can let me know any info. on that, or how to get info., I'd really
	appreciate it.  Thanks!

[ I don't think they care if you call long distance - once that charge goes
  through on your card, they've been paid.  You just might want to make sure
  on the arrangements for actually getting the tickets - do they mail them,
  or do you go to Will-Call?                                       :rush-mgr ]

And that's all folks!  Ho-hoo!

Well, I waited approximately 10 years for this ( last time was Moving
Pictures I think ??? ) and it was well worth it. They were just as good
( better ? ) than I remembered.

The lights and lasers were superb - I couldn't see the back projection 'cos
of the overhead speaker stacks :-( but then if I'd wanted movies, I'd have
gone to the cinema.

Didn't bother with Primus, but they sounded pretty awful from outside.
Judging by the number of people who came out for a beer during their set,
I don't think I missed much.

I can't remember the whole set list, but it sounded pretty much the same
as others posted here.

High points were the closing medley, and the professor - being a guitar
dabbler myself, I expected to spend the evening watching Alex and Geddy, but
Neil just grabbed my attention almost from start to finish.

Slight low points were the severely truncated Xanadu and La Villa, but
what the hell !

Couple of cockups - In Closer to the Heart there was an almighty noise just
as Alex switched from acoustic to electric. Maybe someone triggered something
they shouldn't, or did the roadie whack the electric with the acoustic as he
was lifting it off ?

Mayhem at the start of 2112 in the medley ! I almost thought they would stop
and start again they were so 'out of phase'. I think it was trying to go
straight into it from the previous part of the medley. Still, it only took
them a couple of bars to get back in sync.

All in all, Bunnies, Bandanas and Pete Townshend impersonations were great.
Hope it won't be another 10 years ;-)

P.S. To the guy who was asking about Gary Cherone taking Freddie's place
at the Mercury memorial - Extreme did a ~ 20 minute set of Queen songs
plus 'More than Words'. Gary Cherone did a very creditable Freddie
impersonation, and Nuno sounded a lot like Brian May. Gary Cherone also came
back on stage to join the rest of Queen for one song in the second half.
IMHO he was the best guest vocalist of the night.

Sorry for the non-Rush content in the PS.

Review of Wembley (London) concerts, 17 & 18 April:

Seeing a concert front row may be overrated.  Its not so much the seeing, as
the hearing; the sound is not mixed for the front row, especially off to one
side.  I saw the Friday night show front row at extreme stage right (in front 
of
Alex, or more accurately, a stack of amps) and for much of the show I could not
hear the guitar!  There he was, playing a few feet from me: I saw his fingers 
on
the fretboard, I knew every note, but I just couldn't hear it, aside from an
occasional echo from somewhere in the back of the arena.  Geddy and Neil
sounded good, though, and its always nice to see them up close, but I
probably enjoyed the following night more, when I sat in the risers stage
left and the sound was infinitely superiour.  The same thing happened in 1981,
when I saw them front row in LA and thought the sound was bad, but it sounded
fine in the risers the next night, and I have never been sure if they just
had a bad night, but now I am pretty sure that the sound in the front sucks,
plain and simple.  Anyone else know anything about this, or can anyone who saw
both these shows say if one night was noticeably better than the other?

The show itself was very good, although I was a bit disappointed that some of
the newer stuff didn't seem to work that well live, particularly Ghost of a
Chance and, to a lesser extent, Roll the Bones.  Did anyone else notice this?
The show jumped around a lot in terms of which period the music was from, and
consequently wasn't as cohesive musically or thematically as on other tours; I
remember the Signals and GUP tours, for example, sounding very much like
Signals and GUP for large portions of the show.  But I suppose they can't
really win on this; if they didn't play the old favorites,  many more people
would be disappointed.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed "Anthem",
however.

Also, I really liked Primus, making me one of the few in the arena who did.
Everyone around me, both nights, were very negative about them (although they
seemed to get a bit more sympathy the second night).  I heard someone describe
them as playing "really bad music amazingly well", and someone else sitting in
the back had the theory that they were Rush making a joke.  I was mesmerized by
the bassist, although I wasn't too keen on his vocal style.  I may get a disc
of theirs if someone can recommend which one (e-mail please).

Overall, they were good, solid shows, if a bit uninspired.

<A NAME="471020">Subject: 2112</A>

I am writing a report on 2112 for an english class.
I was wondering if anyone out there could get me or get
me information regarding the original story line of 2112.
I heard that it is included on the inside of the record
album, but I have no access to that.  Additionally, is
it retrievable from the syrinx files?

[ Yes, the full text is in the file 'rush/lyrics/04.2112' at the ftp site
  on Syrinx.  This includes the "author's thoughts" at the beginning of
  many of the songs on side 1.                                  :rush-mgr ]

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

	What is "The Fly" -- a new Rush live album?   Can someone please
enlighten me?

[ Refer to the review by Michael Silverman <cubsfan@camelot.bradley.edu>
  in NMS #462.  It's available at the ftp site and mail server.  See the
  tail of this or any NMS for details.                            :rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="471022">Subject: Lyric Correction, Merriweather Post, and other Stuff. . .</A>

First of all, I would like to point out a correction that needs to be
made on the Rush lyrics database at Syrinx.  The lyrics for 02.fbn read
the fourth line in the song Fly By Night as:

	I want to be king now, not just one more pawn.

But if you listen to the album, I could swear that the line goes:

	It's time I were king now, not just one more pawn.

[ Hmmm, I'll have to get out the old FBN album w/lyrics and see what it
  has.                                                             :rush-mgr ]

Secondly, Merriweather Post Pavillion in Columbia, MD. has confirmed the
June 16 tour date for Rush, but they refuse to release information about
a date for ticket sales.  Please E-mail me if anyone hears about these
tickets going on sale.

[ I've heard Rush will not be in a concert series, but an individual show.
  I don't know if this affects ticket sales; will subscribers get first
  crack or not?  Stay tuned...                                   :rush-mgr ]

Finally, I have heard that there is a Rush backstage club around.  Does
anyone have an address and know how much it costs to join.  I think many
Rush listeners would like to know.

[ It's in the FAQL, available from the ftp site as 'rush/special/FAQL.031292'
  or in issues #444 and #446 at either the ftp site or the mail server.
                                                                   :rush-mgr ]
