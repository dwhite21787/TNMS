Well, a couple of weeks back, I had a dream about work.  I'm an engineer
with a computer company, and I do a fair amount of mechanical design
engineering.

Anyway, I was dreaming that I was walking down the hall to where a
draftsman usually works at his CAD workstation, but lo-and-behold, the
draftsman was replaced by our own favorite drummer!

Didn't really look like HIM, but I knew it was anyway...I asked him what
he was doing at our company.  He basically said that he was there on a
contract basis to do some mechanical design work for me, since he didn't
have any recording work to do!

That's about it, as dreams go...

I think that Jacob's Ladder is one of the most underated Rush songs. I

<A NAME="633004">Subject: 2112 Cover Band Review (IMHO)</A>

     I had an experience over the weekend that I figured I would share with 
you.  Please don't hate me for it!   My band opened for 2112 at the Rock Horse 
in Asbury Park last Friday(the26th)  and I had been rather excited about 
seeing them perform.  Unfortunately, for a couple of different reasons, I was 
quite disappointed.
     First off, the singer's voice was a caricature of Geddy's voice.  In
other words, he over-exaggerated Geddy's 'whine' if you will.  He sang
SUBDIVISIONS the way Geddy sang Anthem.  He didn't come out of his whiny
falsetto all night.  (well, I left halfway through)  IMHO, it would have been
more entertaining if he had just used his own voice instead of trying to
mimic Geddy's.  Secondly, they didn't act like they were having any fun.  The
bassist/keyboardist just stood around like a statue with a frown on his face
the whole time.  That's just no fun!!
     I do have to give them some credit where credit is due though.  They did
learn MOST of the music perfectly.  The guitar solos were quite impressive
and the bassist and percussionist had their licks down well.  However, the
songs lacked soul.  All of the drums and bass lines (as I said) were correct
according to musical notation, however each note/beat was played with the
same force rather than using taste by playing either lightly or aggressively.
     I suppose that in the same way, I wouldn't buy a painted Monet copy to
put on my wall, I also can't find pleasure in a copy of something which I
consider to be fine art.  That may have hindered my ability to enjoy this
band.  Certainly other people may have really gotten a Kick out of it.  There
were a lot of people who were really grooving to their toons.  If you are
more of a fan of older RUSH then you will probably enjoy it.  They covered
Anthem, By-Tor, 2112 intro/Syrinx, Freewill and a number of other slick
tunes.
     Again, I am sorry about the format of this post.  There is presently
something wrong with the editor.  It is possible that the errors won't be
transmitted.  Take care, and don't forget to brush your teeth before you go
to bed!!

Did anyone happen to catch Headbangers' Ball last Saturday night?
At about 12:40 (central) the played Tom Sawyer.  Before they played it, Riki
Rachtman was saying something about the fact that he wasn't the biggest Rush
fan and everyone jumped down his throat for it because "Rush fans are diehard
fans."   At last Rush is starting to get some of the coverage they deserve.
BTW, the video was just the Tom Sawyer clip from the ESL or Chronicles video.
The funny thing was, there was no album listed beneath the song title.  It just
said "An MTV Concert."  Yeah right... oh well...

Maybe Steve Isaacs wasn't kidding?

<A NAME="633009">Subject: NP and Alex Van Halen</A>

The articles I've been reading about this Alex Van Halen "Neil Pert Sound-
a-like Contest" has been bugging me.  There is no doubt in my mind that
Neil Pert is the best drummer out there, but there is also no doubt in my
mind that Neil Pert and Alex Van Halen have two totally different styles.

If AVH is going to be copying anyone, it's going to be John Bonham or
Ginger Baker.  One of the main reasons Van Halen canned Donn Landee for
Andy Johns (he produced Zeppelin records) was because Alex wanted his
drums to sound like they did on the old Zeppelin records.  Both drummers
deserve respect for being in the business for so long.

Oh yeah, about the "Pleasure Dome" thing.  Eddie went into the studio
without anything written for "F.U.C.K."  Each song was written one at a
time.  On top of that, Eddie hasn't bought a record since 1980, and he
has even said a numerous number of times that he doesn't even have a player
in his home.  Therefore I don't think "Pleasure Dome" is a rip-off of such
a great Rush classic "Xanadu."

I'm up for any comments.  I'm sure I'll get bashed.

I am fortunate to live in Ann Arbor, MI, which is pretty much equidistant
from Toledo, OH and Detroit.  This means that I have access to a large
number of radio stations, six of which play Rush.  I have heard 2112 in
its entirety 3 times over the past two years.  I have heard tunes you
wouldn't expect, such as "The Trees", "Anthem", and "Hand Over Fist".
Unfortunately, all of these stations are pretty content to keep playing
the same group of Rush songs in general, including CTTH, Limelight, Tom
Sawyer, Red Barchetta, the Spirit of Radio, Freewill, and Dreamline.
I'm sure many of you would love to hear just these, since you are not in
big Rush markets, but it gets very tiresome after 10+ years.

I see that several people responded to my post about the UltraDiscII, but
nobody mentioned the phone number for Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab.  The
number is 1-800-423-5759.  Just ask for a free catalog.  All they ask is
your address and where you heard of them.
About the "II,"  the bottom of the ad says "ULTRADISC II is a new, improved

Greetings once again.  A couple of things before I get to the meat of this post
ySince we've been talking aboiut hearing 2112 on the radio.  I'll tell my story
About 3 or 4 years ago I was helping my grandma move.  We were listening to the
radio(94WKTI MIL.??)and they were announcing a block of Rush.  Well I forget th
e first song but the second was the first two movements of 2112.  Now I listen
to the radio alot but when you hear 2112 on the box you need to stop and relax.
Another instance was this Jan.  Myself and two of my friends were driving out
of Montreal(By the way Neil's may live their but he's not in the phonebook)
(I had to try)  It was about 6:00 am and we werer listening to chom 97
(Good English station in French Quebec)  Well to our surprise we heard
Xanadu on the radio!!!!!! I was excited to say the least.

Well now that I've gotten that off my chest.  I'd like to bring the house down
a bit.  This weekend I was lucky to see the Black Crowes.  All I want to say
is if you get the chance to see these guys, DO IT IT WAS GREAT!!!!!
The song list was great the stage setup was great all around it was great.
Not to mention the opener.  The Jayhawks werer alot better then people had told
me.  I just thought that people would like something to do while Rush labors
away in the studio().

Yo gang,

	I think we should all take a chill and refrain from flaming those
who post stuff we don't want to read(not to mention sPpeOcLiLfSics).  OK
so you might have to take a few seconds to skip over something that bores
you but why bother bugging everybody?  They always seem to spark 800 posts
about "Gee, I like *** so keep doing it if you want"  "No way, ***'s suck
and I don't want to bother hitting space fifty times!"  Let's cut the NMS
brain police act, OK?
	I noticed in the last NMS someone mentioned Frank Beard of ZZ Top
played a drum solo that showed a Peart influence. . .well, I think it's time
to reveal to all of you the real truth:  As we know, the Top has been around
a few years LONGER than Rush (and certainly before Mr. God- oops, I mean
Peart joined in the fun).  I hate to break the news, but Peart's style is
actually mostly based on stuff Frank Beard has been doing since his bandmates
had 5 o'clock shadows!  So put away all your Rush albums, grab a liter or two
of JD and kick back to Rio Grande Mud or Tres Hombres!  FEEL the power of the
drums!  I hope none of you are too heartbroken. . .

DAN - Keep up the polls! I missed a few issues but, on the poll for BEST SONG,
I think you'd get a much more representative view by using primary votes and 2
or 3 preferences (3,2 and 1 point each say). I did this for a Presto 'best
song' poll last year (some people may remember) and the preferences DID make a
difference.

But its your poll, so you may have bette ideas.

What a coincidence!!!
We just read this poem today in my 200 level English class, and as
I was reading through it, I noticed the lyric, and thought the same thing.
I bet Neil had read this poem right before writing the lyrics to "Open

I recommend it to anyone interested in a possible inspiration

N member to the NMS-glad to be aboard.
Some questions about the gold UltraDisc of Moving Pictures have arosen,
thought I'd add a few cents worth.

These discs, manufactured by Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs use the original
master tapes from the original sessions, and are pressed using 24K gold
discs for reasons such as longevity as well as atomic structure.  Gold's
structure allows is to better 'fit' the pits in the disc in such a way
that laser beam scatter and data errors are reduced significantly.
This, combined with the superior quality of the original masters, creates
a sound quality far better than the conventional aluminuisc.

I own several of these UltraDiscs, (Police, Pink Floyd, Sting, MP Next!),
and they're excellent.  The highs are crisp and dynamic, and the bass end
is really gutsy.  I would say it'd be worth the extra few $$ to score
Moving Pictures on UD.  You'll be amazed when you hear things you've never
heard.  And with a group like Rush, hearing more of an excellent perform-
ance can only be more wonderful (whoa!).s

Rush guys and girls,
	I have a couple of commets and questions.
	To start, I remember way back when when I was first getting into our
favorite Canadians, I taped an interview from a local radio station that was
the closest thing I have ever seen to a Rockumentory.  (The tape died long,
long ago :-(  ) Anyway, they mentioned that Rush won a Juno right around the
time the first album came out. It was for the Best New Band or something like
that.  I am pretty sure of this fact but if anyone can refute or back me up I'd
appreciate it.
	And now a question, I want to get the Buddy Rich Mem Video with Neil
playing  i dont know the exact title ad i would also like to know if it is a
set of videos or just one?  I can't seem to find it anywhere and I can't stand
it.  I have got to see Neil pounding it out with others from the drumming
community.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

performed live, it's a great reference guide, esp. for GDead boot
collectors.  I agree, a RushBase would be very nice and handy.

Not as hard as one would imagine, there are people with several hundred
shows that have already said they would help with this project.

Yes, I had started to work on something similar to this a while back but
haven't really done much with it since.  If anyone on the list would
like to contribute, send me email or would like to work on it with me,
we can get the show on the road.

The tour list would provide a good framework as Mike stated for putting
together a big database of live Rush performances.  I've gotten several
offers from people willing to help compile this database, so hopefully
it will become a reality real soon.
