Due to administrative and time constraints, there was no digest sent
out on Thursday, 3/7/91.  This issue is actually yesterdays; there will
be an attempt at another one later today if things go well.

Because the size of the list has expanded so much over the last year,
Syrinx has a bit of difficulty when I initiate the send sequence
(translation: the lights dim).  Until we are able to get any memory
upgrades to ease the situation, the NMS will be sent out at off-peak
hours so as not to bog anyone on Syrinx down.  What I'm going to do 
is set up a cron run to check for the existance of an issue at 17:30 EST;
if it finds one, it will then initiate the mailing sequence.  This means
that those of you in the eastern US and the UK will probably not see the
issue until the next morning.

Hey rush manager! Just a suggestion, out in the open so you won't back off:

[ Well, I could have just removed it entirely and replied via e-mail, but
   I'll keep it in.                                               :rush-mgr ]

How about compiling an issue w. all of Neil's dispatches to the NMS? I'm
sure a lot of us would appreciate having that stuff together to show to our
highly impressed Rushfan friends. Sound Good?

[ First of all, I'm a little confused by "Neil's dispatches to the NMS"  Do
  you refer to the articles with him which have been posted in prior issues?
  Well, you can do this yourself; the FAQL has a list of the "interesting
  issues" by topic and digest number.  This would be a changing file, every
  time somebody sends in a new interview with Neil a new one would have to
  be created and mailed.  Also, what about Geddy and Alex?  Don't they rate?
  Sorry, I just don't have the time to go into this much depth.  Now, if
  you're volunteering...  :-)                                     :rush-mgr ]

There has been a lot of discussion lately about time signature changes,
particularly in "Superconductor".  Another interesting feature of this
song is the key changes in the chorus near the end.  I think this adds
something to the song, makes it more dynamic.  I thought this to be
unusual for Rush, since I can't recall them doing that before.  If anybody
knows of any other Rush songs that do this, please contact me at one of
the mail addresses listed below.

That was Defenders #45. Got it right in front of me here. They used
"Truth is false and logic lost". Not only that, but it was dedicated
to Geddy, Alex, and Neil of Rush on the first page. The story has
an anti-collectivist theme to it. Since it was printed Mar 77 it
makes sense that it would draw from 2112 (however vaguely). Maybe this
is FAQL material?

God, am I glad to see an issue with no Pass-christianity discussions!
(Oh, no! I said god, now we are going to have to debate whether it was
just an expression or was I thanking god for no Pass discussions!
I can see it now: "Well, I think he meant it as God almighty, yes Marshall
is a christian..." :-)  )

	Does anyone have a copy or know anything about a Rush CD with
the title of "Red Star of the Solar Federation?"  I saw it at the last
record convention I was at, and I wondered if it's worth the price
they were asking for it (Yes, it's a bootleg!).  If there's anybody
that can help me out on this, please post something to the digest.
Or, you prefer, email me here at Moravian.  Thanks

[ Isn't this the single record which is half of the "Xanadu" double album?
  I think the quality is less than great, but this is entirely from memory.
  If so, save your money and get the double album, it's a better deal.  What
  say all you "collectors of rarities"?  ;-)                      :rush-mgr ]

Just my two pence on the last immortal man.  Immortality is boring and
likely bound to drive you crazy, even if you have good food and good
drink to eat (honeydew and the milk of paradise).  Immortality simply
means that you are going to live forever, but doesn't mean you are
unkillable.  Perhaps the others took the easy way out of a life lived
past where life itself is worth living?

As to being unable to leave, it could be several things.  One that springs
to mind is that the ambrosia that he consumed to become immortal is
addictive.  Or that your biosystem can no longer support anything other
than this.

Good Morning,

    First, I would like to thank Rush Manager and David for publishing the

[ Umm, that's Dan.                                               :rush-mgr ]

questions list.  IMO, this is the perfect list for people who wanted to know
everything about Rush but were afraid to ask.  I have a question that might
be considered for the next list.  What was the reason behind Rush's move to
Atlantic Records?

<A NAME="187008">Subject: Jack Secret and Cygnus X-1</A>

  I have noticed a few people wondering who that mysterious man
behind the black curtain on Geds side of the stage is.
  That man is none other thatn Jack Secret, or maybe more familiar
to you all, Tony Geranios.  He is Geddy's Keyboard tech and he sits
in back of that curtain every RUSH show surrounded by keyboards,
computers and floppy disks.  His job is to make sure that the proper
sounds and samples are loaded into Geds keys at the proper time.
He does no playing at all, so you can all rest easy, he is just there
to make Geds job a little easier.

  There was also a question a few days ago as to how Cygnus X-1 book 1
and book 2 were related.  I believe that the journey into the black hole
and the battle of heart and mind are occuring at the same time.  The
Rocinante and Cygnus appear at the time in book 2 of:

 "I have memory and awareness, but I have no shape or form
  as a disembodied spirit, I am dead and yet unborn
  I have passed into Olympus as was told in tales of old
  To the city of immortals, marble white and purest gold"

  This is the key, the person that passes through the black hole and
Cygnus the god of balance are one in the same.  As he passes through the
hole, he becomes disembodied, and in the lines quoted above, he is saying
to himself, "What the F*CK is going on, what happened to me?"  I also belive
that is the source of the scream that begins inside of him to silence the
war.

  "But they heard my story further
   And they wondered and were sad"

  He is a new presence in their world, which would also support my
conclusion.

  "They sat a while in silence
   Then they turned at last to me
   'We will call you Cygnus,
   The God of Balance you shall be'

  Of course thats just my opinion.

Just a few words on the concert poll I am conducting...

  I have gotten some excellent responses from a lot of people, keep
em comming.  For those of you who do not think you know enough about
Rush to come up with a whole concert, send in the songs you want to
hear, even if its just one or two songs.  Don't be embarrassed, everyone
has to start somewhere and I certainly won't laugh at you.
  As for those of you who haven't responded yet, what's taking you, this
is purely objective, what do you want RUSH to play live?  What songs
do you have to hear at your next RUSH show???  Tell us!  It doesn't
take more than a few minutes of your precious time, make an impact...

VOTE!!!!

Send your vote to joezete@wpi.wpi.edu

Please do not take up NMS bandwith with your responses, although I have
taken note of the few that have and have added your votes to my list.

Thanx for your indulgence.

Pete

I won the Vaughan Brothers CD, but I already have it.  Anyone interested
in making a swap can e-mail me.  I have pretty broad interests in music,
so if you have something you don't like, maybe I will!

BTW,  I finally found ASOH, after weeks of searching.  It will be inter-
esting to listen to, since I haven't heard any Rush since P/G, except
what's played on the radio (read very little).  Hey I've got an idea!
I'd be interested to see a profile of NMS subscribers as follows:

    Those who picked up Rush:

1) From the begining
2) During the second phase (AFTK to MP)
3) Third phase (signals to present)

   or whatever delineation we could agree on.  Do we have a consensus?

I'd be willing to do a tally of the results after I get some feedback
on the divisions to use.  If that can't be agreed upon, I could do a
tally just by the specific album we all started with.

Waddaya think?
