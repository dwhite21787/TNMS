Yes!  It is confirmed.  WTUE has announced that Rush will be playing at the
E.J.Nutter Center on the 23rd of June.  Mr. Big will be openning and tickets
go on sale Saturday, 2 May.  Hopefully the Nutter Center will not have sunk
conpletely by then.  :-)

<A NAME="473002">Subject: Re: the 'they' in ^Mission^</A>

	Just thought I'd add my interpretation of the Mission...

	If you carefully read the lyrics, throughout the song Peart
speaks about 'they'.  My interpretation is that Peart is talking
about the people through history who have 'held their fire', for
example, Einstein, or any famous inventer for that matter.  They
were special, not because they are famous, but because they used
some of that capacity we all have for greatness.  They are the
one's that are described by 'a spirit with a vision'.  Peart,
in the part about how their lives were 'exotic and strange' is
saying how most people in the limelight usually wish they could
be allowed regular lives, but are not destined for regularity.

	I personally think it's a great song, and it rings true
to me.

	On another note, to the person who was interested in the
Primus disc, I would recommend Sailing the Seas of Cheese.  I have
it and I like it a lot.

	Lastly, is there anyone out there who knows where Rush will
play in Salt Lake City, UT?  I am hoping for the Delta Center.  I've
also heard that Mr. Big will be coming with them instead of Primus.
If anyone knows otherwise, please dispel this rumor; I'd like to see
Primus in concert again!

Well, that's about it...

    How's it going everyone?  I'm new to the mailing list and this is my
first post...Anyway,  I saw Rush play here in New Orleans in February, and
I have to say that the show was really great.  Even the opening act was good-
Primus.
    To get to the point, I only live here during the school year because I
attend Tulane.  And the other day I saw from alt.music.rush that Rush will be
supposedly playing in my home town Wichita, Kansas on the 24th of May.
    I was wondering if anyone can confirm this and if so when the day and
time tickets gon on sale is.  Thanks for any help.

At the risk of being one of many...

"They" in the last part of "Mission" refers to "...the ones without it" in
the first post-bridge stanza.  You know:

It's cold comfort
To the ones without it...

I'm not going to waste your time by analyzing what "it" is, but I hope this
answers your question.  Your own analysis would be more important than mine,
anyway.

To Mike Wientraub,
                Per ur request I couldn't come up w/any other band that
has songs w/a SF theme.  But I did come up with a couple more that Rush
did. U can use Cygnus X-1 off the Farewell to Kings album.  Also u can use
the follow up to that one called Hemispheres on the album of the same
name.  Hope that helps ya with ur paper.  Lemme know if helps.

To Lyda, Mark ALexander,
      Per ur inquiry the "THEY" that is referred to is to all the creative
persons that wish they could change who they were.  Hope that helps u to
understand the song more clearly.

Hey Folks. . .

	A few non-Rush related items(sorry).  The first two are about Iron
Maiden.  To the person who was looking for sf music, check out "Somewhere In
Time."  To Paul May, who mentioned their last album, Steve Harris announced
on MTV the other day that their new album is out in England now, but I
haven't seen it here.  If you could tell me the name of it and whether it's
any good, I would be most grateful.
	Just to get some Rush-related stuff in, sign me up for those T-Shirts!
	And one more thing, to the person who didn't like the sound in the
front at Wembley, I sat in the 3rd row directly in front of Lerxt's spot and
the sound was fantastic(in the New Haven Coliseum).  Oh well.

P.S.  Did anyone else think George Michael sounded really great singing with
Queen the other day?  I think if he toned down his poppy Michael-isms he
would make a great replacement(ACK!  Someone shoot me!) for our dear departed

OK all you concert-attending people out there:

I have never been to a concert of any kind, ever.  I need to know the procedure
for getting tickets to the Star Lake show.  I assume I will need to use a
credit card (that's not a problem).  I know this is a ridiculously naive post
in most people's minds, but before now, I never had the wheels or the dough to
go to a concert, so I didn't bother... Now I want to go. 'Nuff said.

Lyric question:

In "The Trees" whose side is Neil on?  Is he saying that the maples suck
because they bitch too much, or is he saying that the oaks suck for being too
repressive?  I can't tell.

I haven't paid much attention to the HYF album since it
was released (being my least favorite Rush album [PLEASE
NO FLAMES or ONLY TO MY ADDRESS]) but I thought at the
time maybe the song was written about the Shuttle Explosion
(is matt crazy???) originally then modified to be a song
that fit into a more of an observation of life's truth(s)
(where do he come up with this *IBM*???) or the other way
around... ANYWAY like I said OBVIOUSLY I didn't listen to
those songs too many times (sorry NAG {Neil Alex Geddy]).
On to greener pastures...
I am trying to get some of those INTERESTING gifs over to
my Mac at home.  I work in a place which has SGIs, SUNs,
HPs, DECs, TEKs, SONYs, IBM(gasp)6000s, Macs, IBM P(whatevers)
etc and so on.  I've tried every way (except the right way)
to bring them over then grab them off a workstation onto
a Mac on the Net.  But when I bring the files home and try
to load them (using PhotoShop, Giffer, QuickGif Plus,
SuperPaint... whatever) it doesn't *IBM*ing work.  I bet
I can probably load them straight to my Mac by using
ZTerm or VersaTerm, but I'm an idiot! (I think?)
Please mail me with anatomically explicit instructions
regarding where I can put... I mean "how" I can get these
wonderful gifs onto my Mac.

yet (call them on Fridays after 2pm, that's when they load in the

Also, for those concerned/interested about the newsgroup, it doesn't

To all of those planning on going to the Starlake show,
      I am writing to ask if anyone knows when Rush tickets go on sale for
the June 21st show??  Also, regardless of when they go on sale, I WILL
be there along with 8 or 9 of my friends plus 3 or 4 more from Grove
City College will be there.  I am thinking it would be cool for TNMS
subscribers to meet somewhere in the parking lot before the show just to
get completely psyched and to b.s. for awhile.  We would need some sign like a
flag or banner so subscribers know where to go (or wear TNMS t-shirts).
Any ideas?  Any takers?  Let me know (stu890151@gcc.edu) or post something
in TNMS so other Pittsburgh-area subscribers can get the skinny.

     I know... I've heard, and thought, and wondered the same thing, but
whether they're talking about all of the artists they're talking about in
the rest of the song, or the "they" who "don't have it," the song is still
quite lovely and meaningful.  That's the wonderful thing about art:  so many
possible interpretations, so when in doubt, pick the one that means the
most to YOU... Hi ho!  What freedom!  Isn't the best art the kind that's
vague enough for you to plug your own life and interpretation into?
     Well, anyway... sorry to sermonize my own little petty philosophies here..
It's a beautiful song, indeed.

Hi everyone.

Alright -- my buddy up in San Francisco just called and told me thta he
just talked to the lady at the Bass ticket outlet and she told him that
Rush is *NOT* appearing at the Shoreline!  Can anyone confirm/deny this?
Would only Ticketmaster have info. on it?  She said the nearest date to
any May 31st concert is June 1st in Reno.  HELP!!!!!   How was the
original info. obtained?  I'm not trying to jump on anyone for giving
false info. or anyhting, I just want ot find out what the deal is.
Apparently, Bass does not have Rush listed at the Shoreline in their
computers, so I dunno what that means...Does anyone know what the deal is?

[ True, but Merriweather Post in MD denied Rush was coming for two weeks
  after we had the date.  Now they are admitting to it, but have no ticket
  info.  It may be a case of "the peons on the phone haven't been told yet."
                                                                  :rush-mgr ]

Does anyone know the # to Anthem Ent.?  I want to call them and ask about
the schedule.

Any light on the subject would be appreciated!! Thanx!!!

<A NAME="473316">From: larsen@cs.utah.edu</A>

I think to really understand who "they" are, you must take this
stanza in context with the stanza preceeding it:

"It's cold comfort
To the ones(2) without it
To know how they(1) struggled-
How they(1) suffered about it

If their(2) lives were exotic and strange
They(2) would likely have gladely exchanged
Them for something a little more plain
Maybe something a little more sane"

Note the parenthesized number next to each pronoun.  I think that
each number represents a seperate entity with grouping as shown.

(1) represents the people who have exotic and strange lives.

(2) represents the people who long for the same (or some other
    dream).

So, I intrepret the first stanza to mean:

'It is not much of a consolation (to the people who haven't
acheived their goals) to know the people who have acheived their
goals may have suffered.'

and the second stanza as:

'If the people who didn't have exotic and strangle lives (but long
for them) actually did, they might trade that life for something
not quite so "exotic and strange".'

I think in a nutshell they are saying, "be careful what you ask for,
you may get it."

I personally drew a direct parallelization between this message and
the band members known reluctance to occupy the limelight, and a
wish for privacy and a "normal" life.  However, I could be wrong.
I have heard all band members say at one time or another that they
sometimes wish they could have back those earlier days of their
lives that they spent touring.

I love the lyrical and musical composition of this song, especially
these two stanza's(lyrically).  This is definately my favortie song
from the album, and the outro/solo at the fade-out is one of my
all time favorite guitar solo's.  It has sooooo much mood, it's
almost as if it (the guitar) is talking.  I love to put a set of
head-phones on, and just be absorbed by this song.

Of course, all the above is just my interpretation and opinion.

Chau,

Steve Larsen

   The May 1992 issue of 'Guitarist Magazine' has a huge interview
with both Geddy & Alex. They are also on the cover. For the
guitarists & bassists amongst you, there's even a 2-page spread
telling you how to play bass like Geddy, including a musical score

	Well, last night as I was casually going through a shop here in S
Seattle's University District, I came across four items I could just NOT pass
up:
1) Rush, Roll the Bones UK 10" picture disc.  Contains RTB, The Pass, and
"It's a Rap Part 1: Alex Lifeson Speaks"

2) Rush, Roll the Bones UK hologram CD single.  Contains RTB, Anagram, and
"It's a Rap Part 2: Geddy Lee Speaks"

3) Rush, Roll the Bones UK CD single.  Contains RTB, Where's My Thing?,
Superconductor, and "It's a RAp Part 3: Neil Peart Speaks"

4) Rush, Ghost of a Chance UK CD single.  Contains GOAC, Dreamline, Chain
Lightning, and Red Tide.

	Among all this, I also picked up a while ago the US Cassette single of
Ghost of a Chance, and I can clear up definitely the confusion over if the
interview on the U.S. GOAC single is the same as "IT's a Rap" 1,2, and
3:  The answer is.......it's not.
	The US release contains material that "It
s a rap does not have, and the UK releases have material that the U.S. release
doe
does not have.  Mainly, here are the differences:
Lifeson interview on "It's a Rap" contains more; Peart interview contains more,
but lacks the part in the U.S. release where he talks about how and why he 
wrote
"Ghost of a Chance".  Lee interview has more material, also.
	I am thinking about transcribing all 4 of these interviews and 
uploading
them.  Is anyone interested?  Email me if you think it's  a good idea and I 
will
otherwise I won't spend the time.

Good day!

I  just  thought the picture of the elephant was a humourous way to make the
statement:
You see what you WANT to see.   You are in  control  of your perspective.

Then again, that's how I  want to  see the significance of t he picture...
someone else may easily see it differently  (sort of a recursive idea)

Does this rarity exist on CD? Can I get it, and how?!?

I am trying to collect anything Rush on CD format--any suggestions?

Does "Archives" exist as a CD set? What about studio session "boots"?

(Live boots are ok, but I already have a couple)

Help me. I'm on a MISSION.

It is now official!!!!.  Rush will be playing Jones Beach in Wantagh, NY
on Saturday June 20th.  I believe tix will go on sale Friday May 8th when
all Jones Beach tix go on sale.

Get them early because "the tickets (will sell) out in advance!"  According
to my calculations, this is the first outdoor Rush show in the New York area
ever!!!!

Until later.

Date: Thu, 23 Apr 92 17:48:10 PDT

The Sunday May 31st show at Shoreline Ampetheatre has been confirmed by
Shoreline. Tickets go on sale Sunday April 26 at 10am. Reserved seating is
$25, lawn seats are $19.50. Mr Big will be the opening act.

**PARTY ALERT**
I've been jamming Rush tunes with some guys for a few months, and thought
it would be good for us to do a live gig. If we ever "really" play out,
we'll be basically a Rush tribute band as the only songs we play right now
are Rush songs. So I thought I'd host a pre-show
party and set up the band in the living room. My house is in Sunnyvale, which
is roughly 5 miles south of Mountain View. If you are interested in coming
over on Sunday afternoon May 31st before the show to drink a few beers and
listen to an aspiring Rush tribute band, send email to:

laplant@ads.com

At this time I just wanted to get an idea of the number of people who would
want to do this. So, send me mail, and if the interest is there, I'll set it 
up.

For those who collect such things, there is a good interview in the June
issue of Bass Player with Geddy Lee - the "Roll The Bones Interview". He
talks about touring, and their approach to it these days, his stage setup,
and bassists he is listening to these days, amongst other things...

Also, Musicians Institute presented their first annual lifetime acheivement
award to .... yep, you guessed it, Rush!

Why is it that magazines like messing up the names of Rush songs?

First I would like to agree with Dan M.(TNMS #464) that if Rush do become
more popular (lets face it they don't do badly) we would have even more
problems getting seats - I ordered mine within 12 hours of the dates being
released and still ended up half way back in Wembley.

As for the show itself, there is only one word - ORGASMIC

They started of relatively slowly, but after the Pass and Bravado things got
wild - Neil doing his windmill impresion and Alex probably facing beastiality
charges after fooling around with a large white rabbit!

Does anyone have a list of the songs played - I lost track after a while.

Hi!

Here's some nifty info on the sort of microphone (PZM) Neil used
in recording the drum track of ``Vital Signs,'' in case anyone is
interested in how that cool sound came about...
