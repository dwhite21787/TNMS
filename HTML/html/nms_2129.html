The premiere tonight is 2 hours long.
Get those tape recorders rolling!

I don't believe that my station in San Diego is airing tonight, neither is
the one in LA, what's up with SoCal radio? geez... if nothing else I *will*
tape the RealAudio broadcast from one of the radio stations, won't be great
quality but better than nothing. At least I'll be able to transcribe it!

I've also posted the mock-up for the new NMS shirts to the NMS message

I haven't heard anyone mention this yet. With a little luck, I found this
new release. It's the King Biscuit - Best of the Best Cd. It has a cool
version of Limelight on it. On the credits it says written by Peart,
Weinrib, Zivojinovich. Odd huh? I thought they officially changed those
names? There is also a small picture of Rush inside (looks like HYF tour). I
would guess the whole show probably won't be released now. I think it was
aired on the radio at one time. Anyone have it?

Other bands on it are: Kansas, ELP, Blondie, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Foreigner,
Queen, Genesis, BTO, The Kinks, America, Pat Benetar, Billy Squier, Triumph,
Rick Derringer, and The Who.

    Hi everyone,
A guy I work with is repairing a broken neck on a guitar that is owned by a
guy that claims to be Alex Lifeson's nephew. His "nephew" said that the
guitar was given to him by Alex. And that this guitar used to be one of
Alex's own. We have been trying to find some information on this guitar to
check it's authenticity but we haven't had much luck. All that we know is
that is was made between the years 70-74. The guitar is a walnut color, it
appears to be a Gibson SG model with two humbucker pickups. The serial
number is engraved into the back of the headstock and reads 109039 U.S.A. If
anyone has any pictures of Alex's guitars? Or with Alex and a guitar that
fits this description? Or any information on how we could verify this guitar
I would greatly appreciate it. Please let me know. Thanks!

Hey Jerry, Mika did it!!  It was close.  Even with Michael starting 24th

In response to "Alan N's" <alann@roava.net> post:

Thanks for the reply in the NMS #2128 about YYZ.  I'm familiar how Morse
code uses dit's and dah's, but in the realm of percussion we like to try and
mimic the sounds that our conventional drums would make.  It's kind of like
a foreign language.  Thus, "ding da ding ding" would be Neil Peart striking
his crotales* similar to "dah dit dah dah.".  

Other interesting things drummers say:

"Chump-chump-bigada-digada!"  =  "I'm hungry."
"Herrta Herrta B'dat!" = "Where's the bathroom?"
"Chigadat Chigadat Dut Dut!!" = "Hey Baby!"
"CACK!!" = "*&$@!!"

* Crotales are kind of like a glockenspiel but it uses brass disks instead
of metal bars.

Hi.  As you probabaly all know by now, The Rock 103.5 died this Halloween
weekend.  Freak, keep going!  That sucks because Jo Robinson had just mere
weeks ago gone up to TO to do an interview with Rush.  I began to think about
the interview that I so wanted to hear ... might not be aired.  So.  I did the
next best thing.  I called the Loop.  The original total rocker station in
Chicago.  Remember Skye Daniels, Lorelei, the Loop T-Shirt Chick, Steve &
Gary?  The original Chicago Fests?  In 1981 when Iron Maiden played!!!!!!
WHAT a recollection!    That's when you could still hear Green Menalishi on
Chicago radio.  Totally dating myself here, but ...  I will find out this time
tomorrow night when Jo Robinson's interview with RUSH will be aired on Chicago
metropolitan area radio.  IT WILL BE ON THE LOOP -- 97.9.  SO BE LISTENING IN
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS CLOSELY FOR MORE CONCRETE INFO.

10:47 Tues. p.m.  .... Foghat-a-playin, "A FOOL FOR THE CITY," on 97.9 -- THE
LOOP AS I WRITE!

I just bought the new Alanis Morissette CD.  Nice follow up to her supberb
debut. A few tunes had some nice strings that remind me of some of the
brilliant orchestration Rush has done over the years.  

The best part of the CD has to be the picture of her on it....(can you say
nudity?)

       Whoever did the mixing on the DS album did an increadible job.
       
     The songs flow into each other amazingly.  You would never know that the
songs came from different shows. 

     There isn't much in the way of introductions from Geddy at all.  He does
a few but,(Resist).  He also sayo at one point "you're still here?"   for the
most part the songs flow into each other uninterupted.

While looking forward to the new Rush live album (and Dream Theater),I'm
enjoying the new Marillion album "Radiation", Excellent album.It reminds
me of Rush going from Roll the Bones to Counterparts.Lots of loud guitar
sounds,and strategicly placed keyboards.A true rock album from
previously "prog" only band.

<A NAME="2129019">Subject: Musician Virtuosi</A>

Hello all.  Anticipation is building for DIFFERENT STAGES.  More 
immediately, payday is Friday!

Anyway, I have an opinion on the discussion of our boys' talents as 
musicians.  I'm a guitarist and have honed my skills to Rush for the past 
15 years.  I agree that Neil is THE master of percussion.  Examples that 
come to mind:  "La Villa Strangiato," "Subdivisions" intro., "Beneath, 
Between and Behind" on ESL.   How does he manage to keep different tempos with 
separate limbs?  He's the best, period.

Geddy's prowess on the bass is UNPARALLELED in rock.  He is the master of 
clean bass "fill-ins" at several points in many songs.  I'm listening to "The 
Big Money" now; he manages to pluck away, filling in backgrounds to the 
solo, dropping an octave mid-solo.  I've tried to mimic his playing style 
(i.e., without using a pick), and believe me, it takes some skill to pluck 
those things with more than your index finger, and still make it sound good.  
I've never attempted to mimic his stuff in "YYZ."  He's the master.

Alex.  Hmmmm.  Certainly he has his own style and talent for writing and 
playing.  The best guitar player?  Many say Edward VanHalen, Stevie Ray 
Vaughn, Jimmy Page, and even Eric Clapton are better guitar players (my fave 
of those four is SRV).  To me, Alex's strongest talent is in the orchestration 
of his whole setup (i.e., guitar, effects, amps), with emphasis on the 
multiple combinations of effects settings he uses and switches between during 
many pieces (examples of which are too numerous to mention here).  That's a 
significant part of his artistry; let's face it:  no two songs (since ATWAS) 
have the same guitar sound.  Even the "heavier" stuff from CP to T4E sounds 
different (e.g., "Stick it Out," vs. "Driven" or "Virtuality").  So, in that 
regard, I think he stands out from the crowd.  I think he plays more from his 
head than from his heart.  That's OK; that's his own unique style (the 
thinking guitarist in the thinking-man's heavy metal band).  "Heart" players 
would be SRV and Jimmy Page.  They both tended to "zone-out" during their 
oftentimes lengthy solos.  Although I'll buy all of Alex's solo stuff, I 
don't think he'd make it big as a solo artist.  Rush is more like an orchestra 
than a rock group, and his orchestration adds an integral component to that 
mix.  He's awesome.  How did that saying go when they were at Bearsville 
in '96, "Individually we're an ass; together we're a. . .(can't remember).

Enjoy DIFFERENT STAGES.  MK

Greetings fellow UK Rush fans.

Another album release, another day off work to pick it up ! I contacted the
Virgin Megastore in Oxford Street this evening to check on the release
date - 16th November was cited ? ! - I also enquired about the vinyl release
and the Japanese release - no info - is Force Ten on vinyl ? - I think it's
an additional track on the Jap version.
Prices - ?24.99 for standard 3-CD pack / ?49.99 for Japanese release - no
price for the vinyl.
Can anyone clarify the UK release situation. Any more news on the 'enhanced'
CD ROM version + the video release.
Thanks again to Spirit of Rush for the preview hearing during September !

Yours impatiently.

Record it on your VCR if you can. Hi-fi stereo VCR's usually have audio
inputs - excellent quality recordings, much better than cassettes, up to 6
hours without changing tapes, and you can set the timer!
I use mine for audio recordings a lot - the quality of the recordings really
is good - usually almost indistinguishable from the source....

Not so convenient for the car though!

Dear All,

I stand by my admonition that Brave blows.  IMHO it sounds very much 
like third-grade Division Bell-era Pink Floyd.  Normally I would not 
mind, but I'm in a decidedly un-Floyd-y place these days, so I'm afraid 
back to the record shop it went, and along came Alanis instead, upon 
whom the vote is still out.  I'll keep you posted.

Rush content - listened to ATWAS Remaster last night - don't remember it 
rocking like a bastard so much the last time I heard it...

Rolling Bones,

Greg Sanderson

<A NAME="2129024">Subject: Rush sighting in Minnesota politics</A>

As a some of you most likely know, Minnesota just elected Jesse Ventura as
its next Governor.  With no desire to spur a political discussion, let me
simply offer two excerpts from different news sources:

1.
BODY ELECTRIC
The topsy-turvy campaign season was capped Tuesday night with a
late-breaking shocker in Minnesota.  In the biggest win ever for a Reform
Party candidate, former pro wrestler Jesse "The Body" Ventura captured the
Minnesota gubernatorial race.  ....

2.
The chief upset came in Minnesota, where a former professional bad-guy
wrestler beat the two major parties and proved that in America, ``anything
can happen.''  ....

With that, let me offer a non-partisan "Woo-hoo!"  With no new Rush on the
radio up here we take what few snippets we can get.

Jason

<A NAME="2129025">Subject: AFTK on vinyl</A>

Hello..I was recently at a thrift store and guess what I found in front 
of the old LP's. A vinyl of AFTK for that I got for a Quarter!! Does 
anyone know of the actual value this is? The record is pretty much 
scratch free and in good shape. The cover is a bit worn but is in good 
shape as well. Thanks for any help given. 

Because he was human..Because he had goodness..Because he was moral...
They called him insane.  NP AFTK
