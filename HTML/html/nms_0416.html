	I believe I've found the translation of the morse code in
the RTB tourbook.  I asked one of my friends who knows everything
about Rush.  He said it says "Remember Death".  I checked it out,
and sure enough, that's what my translation was!  Hope this lets

``Sir Gawain...'' was the working title for a composition during
the PeW recording sessions. It was radically modified and ended
up as a portion or portions of ``Natural Science.'' The lyrics
planned for SG I'm pretty sure have nothing to do with Natural
Science as the story which is SG's namesake is a _very old_ story
having nothing to do with the themes of NS (except perhaps honesty).
Since SG never made it to fruition I'm sure it was never played
live...

Give me a break!  That kind of idle speculation is exactly why Neil said
TNMS readers should "Get a life." (or something to that effect) when he was
shown a copy.

I've got news for you folks, most artists don't sit around for hours
dreaming up subliminal messages to put into their work.  There is no doubt
in my mind that the artist made the dice that way because he thought it
looked better from an *artistic* standpoint.   And until one of the members
of Rush says differently, that's the assumption the members of this list
ought to make.

Hello,

Just before the NYC shows, the groupie Connie Hamzy appeared on the
Howard Stern show. (Heard in NYC, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington
D.C., and L.A.). She implied that she had slept with Geddy in the
past and was looking forward to seeing the boyz again in NYC.
On Monday's Maury Povich show, she again confirmed her friendship
with the band. Jeez, she isnt that bad looking for 36, but she does
need to get a LIFE!

Oldest bands with the same lineup: Kinks maybe? Up until last year,
Queen was around for about 20 years.

Shawn: Yes I did notice that "Rush" has been used alot lately. A
couple of months ago, I posted this thought on NMS and wondered if
this was a good or a bad omen. Here is another to the list: the
national radio host Rush Limbaugh who has been interviewed quite
alot lately because of his high popularity. By the way, he has his
own account on Internet(thru Compuserve, he has his own forum there!).
And as I have mentioned above, the band itself was mentioned on
Howard Stern's, and Maury Povich's show. All these "Rush" references
are pretty cool.

Welcome back to school everyone!! :-(

I posted this around Thanksgiving and got only 1 reply so I thought I would try
again since the holidays and finals are over.  I noticed that the cover design
for Styx latest release _Edge_of_the_Century_ was done by Hugh Syme.  I also
was told that he did the album cover for Fates Warning's latest.  I was
wondering if anyone knows of any other groups Mr. Syme has done work for.
Thanks!!

In TNMS #414, Keith Ford asked from the Heart of Dixie:

>Although I don't know the exact number, Rush as we know them today
>(musically) has been just the three of them for quite some time. (Since
>Neil joined?)

(Neil replaced John Rutsey on drums in 1974, after the first
album, so it was a three-man band from the beginning.)

>I am curious if there have been any other bands that have
>not changed members in as long?  Although other bands may have been
>around longer than Rush, which had the longest consectutive run with
>the same members, without intermixed breakups?

The hands-down champs on all counts are the Four Tops. Levi
Stubbs, Renaldo Benson, Lawrence Payton and Abdul Fakir have been
crooning the smooth tunes from Motown since at least 1953,
according to the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll.
Assuming they're still at it (which they are as far as I know),
that's going on 39 years, which is as long as at least two-thirds
of the members of Rush have even been alive. It's not only the
longest continuous act in pop music, but also the longest any act
has gone without any change in personnel.

<A NAME="416011">Subject: The Rush B.S. Club</A>

Also in TNMS #414, Adam Coles (obviously snowed in and desperate
for quality reading material in Boulder) asked:

>Can anyone help a poor waif who can't see the show get the tour book for
>it?  After seeing so many postings about it, I'd like to see it for real.

Others have posted queries along similar lines, so I might as
well throw in yet another plug ...

As you may have deduced from the FAQL you've received, the thing
to do is hook up with the Rush Backstage Club. They have tour
books. They have T-shirts. They have posters. They have buttons.
They have patches. They have official Rush handkerchiefs, for all
I know. You got the bucks, the Rush B.S. Club has the schlock.
All you've gotta do is order something at least once a year and
the "club" (actually one apparently amazing woman named Dottie)
will keep spewing stuff to you, including occasional newsletters
featuring original sarcasm by Neil himself.

The infamous address:

             Rush Backstage Club
             1055 E. Tropicana Avenue, #580
             Las Vegas, Nevada  89119

Be sure to fork over $11.95 for your Official Membership Kit,
which includes a number of artifacts you'll probably find really
embarrassing, unless you haven't been out of high school very
long, and which certainly aren't worth $11.95. (We can only hope
that at least *some* of this money finds its way into the pockets
of The Boyz, who are after all the most deserving of it.)

And be happy you didn't have to buy a tour book at a concert.
Mine set me back $12, which is what a decent *T-shirt* used to
cost, for cryin' out loud. They might be a bit cheaper through
the B.S. connection. Or not.

     But we will not count the cost"

<A NAME="416014">Subject: Ticketbastard experiences</A>

Ticketbastard procedures vary with the event. Two situations I have
encountered may help ticket-seekers to some extent:

1. SOMETIMES they purposely hold back the best seats for a few minutes to
try to screw the scalpers. Case in point: the time I got dead center of the
fourth row for Bob Seger on a telephone order 15 minutes after tickets went
on sale. I later read in the paper that the best seats had been held back.

2. Sometimes (maybe all the time-I'm not sure) certain tickets are sold
only at the venue's box office, some are available only by telephone, and
some are available only at a Ticketmaster location. I discovered this a few
years ago when I wanted tickets for the Chicago production of Les Miserables
for a certain date. The telephone sales people didn't have any, but when I
went in person to a Ticketmaster, they did. When I asked about it, they told
me that blocks of tickets were allocated to each of the 3 situations I
mentioned.

I don't think there is any way to always be sure of getting good seats unless
you know someone at Ticketmaster. Good luck!

Re: Gawain:

I had heard a rumor that there was a demo tape of Gawain floating around
in England, but the source is a bit dubious, so I don't know.

Most of Gawain was salvaged to make "Natural Science". Considering that,
I'm kinda glad they scrapped Gawain. Although it would have been nice to
have another epic from RUSH, I definitely don't think it would be worth
sacrificing Natural Science for.
