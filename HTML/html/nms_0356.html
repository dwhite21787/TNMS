Dear Rush Fans,

For the last 2-3 wks, reading the posts of the questions/answers and
facts of the rock band "rush" is very interesting, amusing and fun!!.

There are alot of areas i like to give my opinnion about "rush" and
the previous posts from the past 2wks.......

Everyone is doggin "rlb" saying that they've lost their talent,
energy, getting too sentlemental with age and "rlb" sounds too much
like "presto"....

Well, I have too disagree with alot of you people out there on
their behalf, not saying your not entitled to your opinnion, but
I really like "rlb" because it feels different, and the mood has
energy and is lifting rather than dramatic from their previous albums.....

And as someone said "if your a REAL rush fan, then your like the
change and the flavor of their style of change"

Rlb is different i must say and there are some simularities that
mix in with rlb from hyf & presto, but the result feels different.

I really like the whole album, my favorite song is "bravado",
i just can't get enough of it, it's kinda of like the song
"entre nous, losing it,second nature & presto".......

i love the sentlemental feel of rush's direction, and i don't
think it is directed to mushy love crap songs that you hear other
bands play all the time.. so peart is writing differently, and
geddy is working more with back-up vocals, and lifeson is texture
player than when he was younger... the band has comed along way,
and it seems the band itself has 3 bands in one thats from my
listening over the yrs..

i've been a loyal rush fan ever since mp, and the 3 are directed
towards a promising future of music.....they are true musicians with
heart for music, i guess thats whats motivates me, the energy, technical,
style of change, where they started from, makes me feel good,and the disciplen
in their work.

Mysterious Rapper...

                The only person i can think off hand that would
                be the mysterious rapper is: President George Bush...

                                             ------------------------

I saw Eric Johnson at the Majestic Theater <a really dive>, and
to my disappointment, I didn't enjoy the show at all. The first 1/2 was
great, but the no repeative scale patterns that eric played got boring
really fast!!.. it seems thats all he did the whole time, the same
scale pattern..over and over... otherwise the music is good, the skill
and technical part is excellent.....**Now, I hope that he's alot better
for both nights at the palace in michigan, because I'm seeing the
boys both nights and I don't want to go thru the hell listening to the
same scales that eric is know for!!!....****...

Btw: those aren't dogs barking on dreamline, it's more like a percussion
     or keyboard sound... (has anyone ever heard a dog bark before, I think
                           there's a difference......)

can someone tell me about the gif,sound files, <i just bought a mac ii si>
and what prgm i need to view and listen....

also, does anyone <might be a foolish question>, have all the rush videos
from mtv.. i've knowticed from chronicals, they have "the trees" from
ftk, which i'm sure theirs more out there floating around.. Something i'd
like to build my collection with.....

as for the boots, does anyone have a clear pirated copy of power,hyf,
and presto concerts?.......

please send email to:

<A NAME="356003">Subject: Various Tidbits</A>

Just bought a Mr. Big CD today as I think they toured with Rush (was this so?).
As usual with a non-Rush purchase I looked at the lyrics and was almost
physically sick. They (the lyrics) seem woefully inadequate, but I haven't
listened to it yet. My final decision was determined by the title of the
first song: `Addicted to Rush'.

I have almost gotten all the Rush stuff on CD now (after finally finding a good
importer) but I was wondering about `Rush through Time'. If my memory serves me
correctly it was released on cassette only (?) by CBS New Zealand (?) is this
true as I have a friend going there soon.

[ Nope, it was also released on LP, since I've got a copy of it.  It's a
  standard greatest-hits package sort of thing, with a late-70's era
  concert picture on the cover.                               :rush-mgr ]

Is the woman on the front of `Exit... Stage Left' one of the boyz wives?
I'm glad all the `Presto Book ][: Roll the Bones' talk is over (n.b this is not
an opinion I hold).

The guy who mailed me about `Fields of the Nephilim' - how did you go getting
any of their stuff? What did you think?

I  was told today that only `A Show of Hands' is available on PAL can any
Australians or British confirm this? I can play NTSC but I'd prefer to avoid
NTSC format :(.

Vernon Reid's favourite Rush album is `Exit... Stage Left' (NME)

don't worry about the .sig it changes all the time...

Let me say that Primus played Rush at the Bring the noise tour tonight.  Now
most of you are saying "No kidding, they do an excerpt from YYZ."  Well, not
tonight.  They did an excerpt from "Cygnus X-1", which was quite cool.  I
don't think many other people recognized it.  It was the bass solo part right
after the spoken part at the beginning.  Also, they played "Tom Sawyer" over
the PA between PE's and Anthrax's set (right after O.P.P by Naughty by Nature,
what a song selection!).  Some of the crowd recognized it, some were quite
clueless.  I also heard "Dreamline" four different times on the drive down
and back.  I wish the radio stations around here would discover any of the 
other nine songs on the album!

For myself, I would have little or no motivation to read a Rush
newsgroup.  There are an enormous number of people that seem to
positively *loathe* Rush for some unimaginable reason, and a Rush
newsgroup would be like placing a plate glass window in front of
such a person holding a brick and daring them to throw it.  I
also doubt that such a group would be as well organized and
informative as this list has proven to be.  I'll stay put, thank
you very kindly.

Question: would it be possible for someone who reads news.groups
or rec.music.misc to repost the Call For Votes (if and when it
occurs) here in TMNS, so those of us who would otherwise miss
the vote could participate (with an emphatic NO, in my case)?

And finally... I hope Geddy doesn't put the kabosh on the band's
Minneapolis appearance after what happened to his beloved Jays
in their ALCS home stand vs. our mighty Twins...  8-O

Y'know, I just remembered something. Rush won a couple-o-Juno
Awards(Canadas equivelent of the grammy) around '79-'80 for best 'new'(?)
band or something like that and for best instrumental (YYZ), right? Well,
I don't know exactly what they were for, but I do know that they won the
awards. What I'm thinking, that if this "Juno Award" is like our
Grammy's, then it must've been broadcast on tv, right? Then somewhere,
someone has a copy of this broadcast. What it all comes down to for me
is: I WANT THAT DAMN BROADCAST!!!!
Was it televised? Or did someone just call them up and say, "Hey, like
you guys, come get your award for most promising band."
If anyone knows any thing about this, or has a videotape, please let me
know eh? Alright!

Hold on to your hats,

	During the closing of Rockline this evening, Bruce mentioned that
they have an upcoming special with "Rush Lyricist Neil Peart" scheduled!!!
There were 2 or 3 "guests" mentioned before that, so it sounds to me like
we might be getting Neil on Rockline by early/mid November!  Wow.  I can't
believe that Neil is going to do Rockline.  What are some questions you out
there might like to ask Neil?

	Does anyone know when tickets go on sale for the Buffalo and/or
Albany shows on 12/15 and 12/16???

	My feelings on a Rush newsgroup:  I like the NMS *much* better than
I'd like a rush newsgroup.  The under-payed, highly-esteemed Rush Mgr's
input is priceless.  I would read a Rush newsgroup, but my contributions
would be to the NMS.  Besides, I hate the software I've got to use to
peruse newsgroups -- I'm used to mail.  I wouldn't trade the NMS for
anything!!!

	I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL 10/26 !!!!!! (5th row!)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I just read in the artical on rush in Metal Hammer mag, that rush will
INDEAD head west before they hit Europe. Hell, they can't possible shaft
a whole bunch-O-hearty fans in california. Can they. And I sure hope they
don't decide to pull one of those "Skip the Bay Area" like they did with
the HYF tour! If they do, then they must die.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

And the Signals tour!  If it weren't for those omissions, I would have
seen every Rush tour in the last 10 years: Exit Stage Left at Wembley
Arena, London; Grace Under Pressure at the Cow Palace, SF; Power
Windows at the Oakland Coliseum; Presto at the Arco Arena, Sacramento.

I could easily imagine that RUSH and Bill Graham don't get along, even
though they both believe in Capitalism with a capital "capital".

<A NAME="356011">Subject: woof - woof - woof</A>

I just want to note several insignificant things about the Dogs/Dreamline:
They sure sound like dogs to me, but what would I know, I'm only listening
to a cassette on an old player with crappy distorting speakers.  They could
also be woodblocks.  Woodblocks sound like dogs too.  What does it matter?
It is a dog-like sound and it fits in well with the lyrics at that spot.

Interesting that the new Jethro Tull album came out a week later, featuring
a song called "Sleeping With the Dog", which *also* has sampled dog barks
in it, and it is *definately* a dog (some kind of retriever maybe), it's a
lot more clear than on Dreamline.  And both albums were actually finished
(though not publicly released) during the "dog days" of August.  More than
just coincidence?   [ :-)  :-)  :-)  !!!]

Well, I've had this album review in me the last few weeks, but it would be
far too long and take up too much time I don't have, so I won't.  I will
just say I like the album overall, esp. Dreamline (unusual that my favorite
song from an album would the the single, but true in this case), not overly
fond of Neurotica or Ghost of a Chance, and don't even get me started on
Where's My Thing (oh, they put in an out-of-place 5th beat once, and I
think one of Neil's drum rolls is a measure of 3 : thrill me to death!).  I
suppose a lot of the subtlety and nuance is lost on me since I unashamedly
like their old style (I mean the Hemi - PeW style) better - don't flame me!
I will not deny them their right to do whatever kind of music they want and
explore new territory, they certainly should not stay still stylistically
and I wouldn't want them to, but that doesn't mean I'm so enthralled by
their newer stuff that I listen to it over and over constantly like I used
to the older stuff.  That's just my taste.  *flame off*

Oh, one more thing that's been pent up - I'm not a rap fan either, but it
somewhat distressed me to see all the put-downs of it on this list (over
the summer, for those who came in late).  I believe that it *is* a valid
form of expression and that there are plently of rap artists who do good,
creative, and innovative rap.  Us middle-class white boys just hear mostly
the mediocre and commercialized versions.  There was even a review of it on
the public radio show "Fresh Air" last night which sounded (hold onto your
hats) WELL DONE AND INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO!  Made me almost want to buy
an album.  Maybe I will.

Well, this is long enough, life calls...

As to the sonar ping Vs. dog bark debate:  Having been in the Navy and
having heard an actual sonar ping, I can assure you it sounds nothing like
that or the "classic" sonar ping from the movies.  In fact, a real sonar
ping sounds like a rusty porch swing.

And to Big Al:  Don't worry, Rolling Stone will slam Rush as they always

controversial enough.  They're just plain old talented musicians - the kind

 Hi, all, how's it going?
Just a couple of things here I wanted to talk about.
First off, refering to that guy who bought the Live/Life Under Pressure cd,
how much did you pay for that? I was just wondering cuz I picked up my copy
of the cd about a month ago, paid $30 for it, and I was wondering if I got
a good deal or if I was ripped...
  On another note, refering to RTB, I was wondering if anyone else noticed
the recurring 3's throughout the album: i.e. the three's on the cover, the
"armchair rocket scientist" chorus is repeated three times, the three dog-
barks/sonar-blips/whatever repeated three times... I know that some of you
going to just say that, "Hey, has anybody noticed the fours being repeated?",
but if you go and listen through the album again, you'll notice what I'm
talking about.
  Speaking of the dog-barks/sonar-blips/whatever, I was on my way to school
this morning and I wasn't even playing Rush(actually the radio, can you believe
that? Hmmm....), and I heard a dog bark that actually almost sounded like
the bleep, only a little higher pitched. But with all those voice changes
that the boyz make, who knows what they can make a bark sound like.  8)
  And, speaking about the radio, we have a "Top 40" type channel up here in
Erie, Pa, that never, EVER used to play Rush, (Jet-FM 102), but since the
release of their new album, they've been playing all kinds of Rush.  One
night at work, I heard Tom Sawyer and Dreamline both within a three hour
period. I know at least one person out there who is happy to hear that(Hi,
Mike!).
But, enough rambling for now.... 8)

                               Rocken' and Rollen' the Bones,
                                            Jefe....

In NMS #355, someone mentioned that lyrics from the PoW album were sent out
to schools, according to MTV, and rush-mgr said he remembered that too. I was
sure I had heard or read the same thing back when PoW was first released, and
I went to some effort, unsuccessful, to get a copy of whatever was
distributed. No one that I asked about it had ever heard of it, and I finally
came to the conclusion that it must have been something I dreamed! Nice to
know that this wasn't just my imagination. Now my question for the NMS
readership is: Did this distribution of lyrics ever really happen, or was it
just an idea that was discussed? Has anyone ever actually seen anything like
this? I think it would be very interesting to see how it was presented.

A non-Rush question for all you guitar players: Does anyone have the January
1983 issue of Guitar World? I'd like to get a copy of the interview with
Robbie Krieger that appeared in that issue, or buy the magazine. Please reply
by e-mail. Thanx!

I'm going to the Rosemont Horizon show on 11/1, my sixth consecutive Rush
tour. My initial impression of RTB was pretty much neutral, but the more I
listen to it, the more I like it.

	Rush is, no doubt, my favorite band. Thus, us rush fanatics are
susceptible to being satisfied with any material the band produces. I
went to the presto show, and it seems that now more than ever, the
computer is the
dominant instrument in all of their songs. The intensity that the band
used to play with is gone. The maximum volume and punch are constrained
by the little numbers that appear on the LCD screens of geddy's HUGE
rack-mount effects and rack synthesizers, sequencers, human clocks,
samplers. Rush has become MIDIots. I think that most will agree that the
primo mix of technology and raw power was illustrated in Signals, and
Moving Pictures. The early days (2112, COS etc..) would have been rush's
most intense working days. Three guys playing like mad to make a trio
sound like a mega-band.
	Now the macintosh coordinates all the sequencer tracks for every song.
Geddy's bass work has remained stagnant. He cannot scamper up and down
the bass neck like he could before. Neil has remained hard working
throughout the years, though.
	I like technology as much as the next guy. I have the Korg synth, the
Yamaha rack synth, the sampler. I love em and hate 'em. I have taken
piano for ten years. These instruments can make a good programmer sound
like a keyboard god. Samplers are great - fun to edit your sounds and
have strings that sound like the London Philharmonic. But Rush uses
these sounds as "ear candy" far too many times.
	Everyone epitomizes Neil Peart as a god-like poet. His lyrics, while
showcasing his broad vocabulary, are quite wordy. It's
pseudo-intellectual. If he dares to use such intellectual words,  the
phrases and ideas should follow the intelligencia of the selected words.
He is "way out there" in his own literary world. Rush fans pretend to
know what he is talking about. I don't believe he knows what he is
talking about. You can't take his drumming away from him though. He is a
total technician. Every downbeat and rest measured with excruciating
accuracy. I would like to see the days of greated spontaneity (sp?) on
his part. And I hope he doesn't play that same damn solo that he played
on ASOH and presto(PGH show) We all know that Peart has tons of chops to
choose from.
I'm sorry if my message is for the most part, negative, but the album,
in my opinion, receives way too much credit than it deserves. For
example, if they were going to make another instrumental, why didn't
they use a different format than the scheme for YYZ? (eg more themes
like in La Villa)  Well they do what they do. I'll probably love the RTB
show, though.

P.S. who cares if a dog is barking ?? Why is it there ?? Because it's there.

P.P.S. An English class is the last place that Xanadu (by RUSH) should
be 	discussed.

P.P.P.S  A sonar ping, What imaginations!

P.P.P.P.S Next, some geek Star Trek dude will say it's the enterprise or
something.

Hello all

	A couple of non-rush thingies:

Someone asked about drivin n cryin because he thought that a particular
tune reminded him of 2112. Well they don't sound anything like Rush at
all. However, I like them a whole lot. They are from the Atlanta area and
play hard rock/acoustic type music. I recommend any of their albums.

Someone said something about Pat Travers opening up shows during the FTK
tour. Helluva opening act. I actually went to see him instead of Rush. Can
you believe that? Wasn't disappointed with either. Been a Rush fan ever
since. Pat has a reasonably new record out and is touring the smaller
clubs. Mostly in the south so far.

Please no more dog bark arguements. I would like to see some thoughts on
specific songs. Part of the reason I stay on the list is for the thoughtful
reviews and perceptions. I really like some of the parodies. It would be
neat to have a file with all of these guys in it....rush mgr don't we
have all the songs by now?

[ Probably, but I haven't collected them.  Another listt member did, tho
  (Donna?), and I'll make sure I have them available soon.  Keep your eyes
  on the administrivia section for the announcement.  It'll probably be a
  Special Edition, also...                                       :rush-mgr ]

Hello.
I just returned from new jersey where I picked up some Rush news.
Apparently, Geddy is indeed the mystery rapper.  This is only what
I heard on the radio, so you have each individually judge the
credence of this claim.  Anyway, the DJ on 102.7 WNEW distinctly
said that, while at the Blue Jay game at the Skydome, he spoke
to Alex who reveal Geddy as the rapper.  Just what I heard...

<A NAME="356326">From: Doug Orleans <dougo@soda.berkeley.edu></A>
<A NAME="356025">Subject: rec.music.rush: Vote No!</A>

Personally, I never read news anymore.  I used to read rec.music.misc and
alt.rock-n-roll and a few other groups, but I got tired of weeding out
all the posts about things I wasn't interested in, or things that had been
said before, or whatever.  At first I thought the best idea would be to
create lots of different newsgroups, one for each band or type of music,
so that you could selectively subscribe to the groups you were interested
in.  Of course this would take forever to get enough people interested
enough to actually restructure it.

Then I read a post which had a list of all the mailing lists that existed.
There were lots of very specific mailing lists, like this one for example,
as well as general ones like the grunge-list or the manchester-list.
So I went and subscribed to about 15 or 20 of them, and after a while I got
lots and lots of mail about all the bands that I like (well most of them...)
delivered straight to my mailbox!  And I haven't read any news since.
(Mainly because I don't have time anymore...)

Now my first idea still has some merit.  For one thing, many systems can't
handle that much mail.  (footnote: I highly recommend using the mh package
of Unix utilities, if you have access to them.  All my incoming mail gets
sorted into seperate folders, one for each mailing list, and then I can read
each folder seperately, instead of reading them all mixed together.)
Another consideration is that many people read other newsgroups that are not
suited to mailing lists, so they would rather just read news than both news
and mail.

However, there are more disadvantages than advantages.  I've found that most
mailing lists have their own ftp sites for lyrics, gif files, and other
archives, while I doubt that many (if any) newsgroups have them.  The
National Midnight Star is run much more efficiently than any newsgroup could
ever hope to be run.  And just because a newsgroup is voted to be created,
it is up to each sysadmin to decide to get that particular newsfeed.  (For
example, many people don't get alt.rock-n-roll.metal.metallica, just because
the sysadmin doesn't like Metallica -- or maybe just doesn't like alt
groups.)  A mailing list, on the other hand, is under the control of one
single person, who is certainly devoted to the maintaining of the list.
(Well this is usually the case...)  In this particular case, creating a rush
newsgroup would undermine all the effort that rush-mgr has put into the NMS:
it would be much harder to get new subscribers, and probably many current
subscribers would unsubscribe.  And the largest problem, especially in this
case, seeing as how Rush is so maligned on the UseNet, is that a Rush
newsgroup would attract much more negative posts and flames than a mailing
list would.  It's doubtful that a person would subscribe to a Rush mailing
list if he hated the band, whereas it's very easy for him to post a flame to
rec.music.rush.

One possible solution is that you could make it moderated, and this would
solve most of the above problems; however, I have yet to see a moderated
newsgroup that wasn't censored, rather than just edited, whereas it's
usually the reverse for mailing lists.

If this mailing list really has over 1000 active readers, then we could
definitely swing the vote either way.  I encourage you to vote against
rec.music.rush, if it even comes to a vote.  (Somebody should post the
voting address to the NMS so that those of us who don't read news can vote
too...)

[ We;ll, the NMS will still be here, news group or no.  For what it's worth.
                                                                  :rush-mgr ]
