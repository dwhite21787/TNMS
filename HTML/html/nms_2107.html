I finally got a copy of the book "Mystic Rhythms the Philosophy of Rush"
(apparently amazon.com finally got more in from the publisher). I haven't
really read through it, but it reminded me a lot of my AP english test:
"compare and contrast these two poems..."  I don't think I will get a lot
out of this book, not my taste. However, if you were looking for it, try
amazon -- I don't know if any bookstores will end up carrying it, although
you might be able to special order it through them.

Most of the songs discussed seem to be PeW - GUP, although I do remember
"Red Tide" & "Time Stand Still" also being used. I'll post a list of the
songs covered tomorrow; the book is divided into several chapters, each one
with a "theme", and the songs are used to explain that theme.

Well that's OK, but it's just a matter of taste.  For me, Turn the 
Page and Mission are the only two really good tracks from Power 
Windows and HYF put together (though I quite like The Big Money).
Different strings etc.

Don't let them hurt at all!  Ignore them.  Music is about taste, 
and people who put down Jazz (or any other form of music) just
because they personally don't like it are just ignorant.

Didn't know that!  But I saw Jeff Berlin ten years ago, playing 
with John McLaughlin at a Jazz festival in the North East of 
England - he was great.

I just finished "The Masked Rider", and I'd like to strongly recommend
it to anyone who hasn't read it yet.  (If you haven't already heard,
it's available from www.amazon.com)

Apart from being a fascinating story about his bike trip in West Africa,
the book also gives tremendous insight into Neil's personality.   If you
like his lyrics, read the book!!

Rush-mgr, PLEASE respond to this post. Is there ANY WAY for us to send
off a GIANT thank you note with all of our (and any rush fans) sigs to
Anthem? I know you have the R&R hall of fame thing going, but I think
this would be a little more intimate, and maybe show Anthem that this
"Internet" thing isn't such a bad idea??? Just imagine..we could get
Rush fans from all over the world...and I think it would be a REAL boost
to their morale right now, which is obviously in a deep slump due to
Neil's personal tragedies.

   [ I have no idea. I've never spoken to anyone at Anthem.      : rush-mgr ]

Regarding Victor II, don't expect anything until AT LEAST next year. The
note I got from an Anthem contact was that this year was going to be
taken up by a few Rush projects, obviously Different Stages, but, the
word is that there will be a live video accompanying it out before
X-mas. I have not heard anything about this "box set" thing. I was also
told that Alex is having to pay for the next Victor project himself
again, and it is not one of the record companies "high" priorities right
now. So....I really wouldn't get my hopes up for any Victor stuff
soon..but it might be a nice filler next year.

Also, one last thing, Anthem records confirms on their "fanline"
(416)(923-5855) that the first single WILL be Animate. But...these guy's
change their minds as much as their underwear..he..soo.

Ohh ya...and one last thing...I did hear on Q107 from Toronto, that Ged
is looking for a band to produce. Supposedly, he was supposed to work on
the next "Change of Heart" record (a Toronto band..Ged's nephew is/was
the bassist), but the band broke up before the project got off the
ground. Soooo....who knows where he will pop up next? Maybe he will
produce Sarah McLachlan's next record..(HAHAHA...Just
kidding....please..this is just fictitious. It would be interesting
though?!?!?:-)

Hey all!

A lot of people are talking about Marillion I've noticed. While I 
haven't been a devout fan, I do have "Clutching at Straws" and the 
greatest hits compilation, "Six of One, Half Dozen the Other". My 
question is, which vocalist do you prefer, Fish or Steve Hogarth (I 
think thats his name but correct me if I'm wrong)? Fish definitely had 
his own style, but Steve has more of a lyrical quality.

Here is my Rush content: Misheard lyric from Red Barchetta- "...to far 
outside the Wire with my white hair down to my waist."

>> Does anyone else feel the way I do about this?  I though Victor sucked.
I just gave it another listen last week after playing it maybe twice when
I bought it.  The music was OK to listen to (especially the guitar ;-),
but I just don't find myself yearning for it the way I do with my Rush
catalog.  Also, the lyrics are very disturbing (to me).<<

I am glad that someone pointed out the disturbing nature of the lyrics 
on some of the songs on Victor. While I enjoy the album for the most 
part, I feel some songs go a little to far with trying to shock you, 
like "Don't Care" and "The Dance". I can't see what purpose Alex had 
with these lyrics. They certainly  aren't uplifting like most of Peart's 
lyrics usually are. But hey, I guess he is experimenting. I just program 
the ol' CD player to skip those songs, even though Les Claypool plays on 
"The Dance".  Other than that, the rest of the album kicks some 
guitar-playin' butt.

     people don't get it.  I mean, it really bothered me.  But now I have a 
     theory which helps me cope.  Maybe it'll help if some of you guys are 
     having the same problem.  Ready?  Here it goes:  Most people are 
     %#@*ing idiots.  Sorry, but it's true.  I'm a new subscriber and it 
     feels damn good to know that there are at least 5,000 "others" out 
     there with enough sense to get it.  Let me know if you agree."
     
     To J Runnels ->  I guess I come from a similar past as yours.  I have 
     also been an avid Rush fanatic for the past 18 years, and whenever my 
     devotion to the band was revealed, it seemed to alienate me.  While I 
     didn't let it 'bother' me too much, I was certainly aware of the lack 
     of general acceptance of Rush amonsgt my peers.  Eventually, we all 
     grew up; my friends may still not like Rush, but they can appreciate 
     MY devotion to them.  My own musical tastes have widened, but I still 
     maintain a close connection to Rush.
     
     You ask why people don't "get" Rush?
     
     In my opinion, Rush may be a difficult listen for most people.  Try 
     for a moment to step back and listen to a Rush tune like you have 
     never heard them before (this would be difficult for a long-time fan). 
     They have odd signature beats and rhythms, and challenging guitars and 
     keyboards.  You certainly wouldn't expect to hear a Rush tune 
     re-arranged by Muzak over your local K-Mart sound system. :)
     
     Some critics label Rush as "progressive rock".  I've always thought of 
     them as "intelligent rock".  While I don't think non-Rush fans are all 
     "%#@*ing idiots", I DO think that to be an avid Rush fan requires a 
     higher-than-average degree of intelligence, and an appreciation for 
     music that "deviates from the norm."
     
     Peace to all,
     
     John

FINALLY!!! Someone with enough balls to say they don't like LZ and the
Stones...
I too can be counted amoung those.. I just don't like the sound of the
Stones. Sure, they've got some classic songs that I like to hear, but for
the most part.. They just don't appeal to me..
As for Zepplin.. I grew up around a bunch of guys who listened to nothing
but Rush, Marillion, Zepplin, and a few others while we played D and D...
Try as I might, I could never really get into them. Here again.. Some great
songs that I don't need to list, but after a while, they started to get on
my nerves.. On the other hand, I do think Page is an amazing guitarist, but
for me, that's just not enough...Sorry, and Hats off to Tony.. Don't slag

Dear fellow Rushians,

Victor rocked!  I thought it to be some of the most refreshing approach 
to music taken in a while, rather than everyone ripping off everyone 
else.  Alex showed his true colors in that Album--lots of guitars, loud, 
lyrics which aren't great, but aren't sh*%@y. Hey, 2 out of 3 aren't 
bad.  I thought Alex was trying to help usher in a Neo-Black Sabbath Age 
(Black Sabbath is my fifth favorite band).  Now what does he do?  He 
teems up with Sarah MacLachlan, whose music I absolutely despise (IMHO).  
Oh man, can this mean that Victor II will be more sentimental, less 
loud, concentrate more on vocals and just suck overall?  I guess I will 
just have to wait and buy the album, but it seems he's really pulling a 
180 going with her.  Of course, I don't know how much influence she will 
have on the record, so maybe my assumptions will not come to fruition, 
but I think it's a dangerous combo.  Here's an idea that I know will not 
come true.  Why doesn't Alex work with Ed Vedder from Pearl Jam instead 
of Edwin? I like Edwin, but I know Vedder is a Rush fan and Alex is a 
Pearl Jam fan.  NOw that would kick ass!
Later everyone!

Hey arm-chair producers, mixers, and engineers:

If Presto is too "bright", why don't you adjust your equalizer, or at 
least turn down the treble! I know you guys are going to flame me for 
this, but what the hell are you talking about? The band members have a 
hand in producing as well, and I think the production compliments the 
feel of the songs very well. It wasn't supposed to be a "punchy" album.

I was listening to WDHA 105.5 in New Jersey(which plays a lot of Rush)
and they usually have a rock report every hour.They gave some news on
Rush,here's what they said:

Geddy Lee says that there are no future plans for Rush right now.He also
said that it's been a pleasure working with Neil and Alex.He also said
that they can't continue touring a young bands schedule.

I may have misquoted a couple of words but it was along the lines of
that effect.I still think they'll be back but probably not for a while.I
was still kind of sad when I heard that though.

I think a great producer for the next Rush album would be Flood.He's

be interesting.
Brendan O'Brian would be cool to.

Sorry, I know this is my 4th posting today (I usually sit back and read, 
but I feel like saying something today). I was just at the misheard 
lyrics site kissthisguy.com and they had one for "The Trees":

The real lyrics were: 
       ...and the oaks just shook their heads 

       But I misheard them as: 
       ...and the folks just shit their beds 

       The embarrasing moment of revelation: 
       It was my wife - I was trying to educate her in the
       subtle nuances of Rush's music - she didn't find the
       lyrics very subtle until I pointed out her mistake - she
       laughed so hard she almost fulfilled her own lyrics! 

       Age when I realized how wrong I had
       been: 33

At work we used to listen to a station here in Boulder, CO called KBCO
and after hearing The Indigo Girls and Talking heads for about THE
SEVENTEENTH MILLION TIME, we decided to switch stations.  After a little
surfig we came across a halfway decent classic rock station (103.5 The

and behold there was about 2-3 songs from our three gents north of the
border!!!  I was blown away because I can think of one other occasion
that a station around here played Rush.  The songs were Freewill, Closer
to the Heart, and one other that I can't remember because I was so
flabergasted.  When I left work they were on the letter L, so I'm sure
Limelight and the most well known Tom Sawyer will be played.

On to my stupid questions file:

1)  (For those NMSers in CO)  Has Rush ever played at Red Rocks?  If
not, why not?  It's such a great venue and an excellent place to see a
show.

   [ Nope. Have no reason why though, could be a number of things
     (size, location, time of year, $$ the venue costs to play...)
                                                                : rush-mgr ]

2)  I heard a rumor that Neil was on "Politically Incorrect" with Bill
Mayer a little while back.  Has anyone seen it or does anyone have a
copy of it?  I trust that Neil blew away the feild with his knowledge
and superior intellect.  Love to get a copy if possible.

   [ Yes and yes. There was a transcription done by our faithful Puanani
     in one of the digests a few years back, I've been meaning to put it up
     on the website but it needs a lot of html work.  Neil didn't say much
     during the show anyways (he was usually interrupted)     : rush-mgr ]

3)  Does anyone know of a place or person that sells Rush materials,
such as concert hats, shirts, tour stuff?  I'm looking for a black T4E
hat that has gold writing on the front and the stone creature on the
back.

   [ Try the Rush Backstage Club (link is on the Rush/NMS web site under
     Merchandise)                                             : rush-mgr ]

4)  (I never got this one answered and I know it's a "cheesy" question,
but it's just to satisfy my own morbid curiosity) What was the last Rush
album on 8-Track tape, if they ever stooped that low?  My girlfriend
says they probably went from vinyl directly to cassette.

Thanks for allowing me to ramble!!

<A NAME="2107017">Subject: Rush reference in Babylon 5</A>

Did all you Babylon 5 fans out there watch the season 4 episode "The Exercise
of Vital Powers", which was rerun on TNT this evening?

If so, perhaps you noticed during one of the conversations between Garibaldi
(Jerry Doyle) and Mr. Edgars (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.), that Mr. Edgars said:

"Nobody takes power.  They're given power, by the rest of us.  Because we're
stupid or afraid or both.  The Germans in 1939, the Russians in 1917 and 2013,
the Iraqis in 2025, the French in 2112."

That could be taken as a double Rush reference:  the song "Bastille Day" is
about a French revolution, and of course "2112" is the year in which the song
"2112" takes place.

J. Michael Straczynski is the show's producer and primary screenwriter.  Maybe
he's a Rush fan.  Or maybe it's just a coincidence that he put a Rush
reference in the dialog.

I remember seeing Zebra live at Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx (in the

ever put on a show. They were at the top of this "stair-like" platform,
about 20 feet higher than everybody else. It was pretty windy from what
I can remember and they had the smoke machine going pretty good. What an
atmoshere that night.

I remember being pretty much awe-struck at the show they had put on and
the exactness of their Rush and Zeppelin covers. Randy Jackson had the
vocals down pat and the drums, bass and Randy's guitar work was perfect.
Literally perfect.

They were, I think, my first live concert by a non-professional band.
And the best yet, too.

Hats off to Zebra.

       Hello,  Hello,

     Hello,     Hello,

     Browsing for CD's recently I found a special edition of Yes' Open Your
Eyes CD that was specifically designed for home theater surround sound.
Unfortunately, I don't (yet) have a home theater, but the idea interested me
and I did some digging on the net and found a site for the DTS company (DTS
hardware/software 'reads' the digital info and the amplification/projection
of sound is left up to someone else; like THX.) There is a list on the site
for CD's that have been re-mastered or originally recorded for surround
sound; for example Alan Parsons 'On Air' CD ( the link is:
http://www.dtstech.com/enertainment/compactdiscs.html .) UNFORTUNATELY there
is not yet any Rush available for audiophiles, but if we were to make enough
noise, maybe, we could get a couple of CDs like Moving Pictures or 2112
remastered for home theater. ("WHAT?! You want us to have to buy those CDs
AGAIN?!?!?!?!")
     Can you imagine being (((:-- SURROUNDED ---:))) by that scary voice
echoing "ATTENTION ALL PLANETS OF THE SOLAR FEDERATION..." in DTS and THX
theater sound!!! I'd probably wet myself!

Well, I never thought I would have one of these worth mentioning...but...

I was dropping my daughter off at daycare this past tuesday and we were
listening to 'Signals'. "The Analog Kid" had just ended as I drove past an
empty lot. Walking towards me on the roadside was a guy about 17-ish with a
tie-dyed rush shirt on (1st album print). here's the strange part - as is
passed him, he pulled his baseball cap down over his eyes! It took a few
seconds for the synchronicity of the event to sink in.....

Hi Tony,
  I could not agree with you more!!  I grew up listening to the same 
comments about Rush (about the same time also), so I listened to LZ for
years, 
not that it was a complete waste of time, but I think I would have
learned 
much more if I had dedicated some listening time to Rush back then.  
Oh well, it's never too late, I can still enjoy the chills I get when 
I hear 'Leave That Thing Alone' and of course 'Losing it'. 
In regards to your comment, "this lesson is described best in "Free
Will") 
and I chose RUSH!!", well SO DO I!!

As far as the Rush live albums I have to go in this order

1:  A show of hands
2:  Exit... stage left
3:  All the worlds a stage

As far as other favorite live albums these are not in order.  

Joe Jackson Live 80-86  Four bands, four tours and new versions of every song.

Peter Gabriel Secret World Live,   Mind blowing!  Artistic songs,
theatrical presentation, and unbelievable musicianship.  (Bassists take
note, you get to see Tony Levin and his "Funk Fingers" in action.)

Genesis Seconds Out,  Great performances of classic Songs.  Phil Collins
vocal performances are outstanding, even of the Gabriel era material.

Bob Mould Poison Years,  OK, so the whole album isn't live.  The live
versions of Poison years and Shoot out the lights are worth the price of
admission.

Honorable mention...

I have a videotape of the David Bowie 50th birthday pay for view special
that is very cool.  Not truely an album but still a great live performance
captured for ever.

The Cargo Cult

I've got twelve cabanas
In a kitschy style
Yard sale or Walmart
Big Lots or K-Mart
Shop with me now for a while

I've got a beat-up motorcycle
Pink flamingos on the lawn
Vibrating pillows
Cartons of No-Doz
Whatever shape it's in, nothing's too far gone

I believe that what I see
Is exactly what I own
But if I could get into the house
I'd bring some more stuff home

Got so much Cargo, don't know what I'll do
Cargo's coming to me
Can't give it back to you
Living for my Cargo, piled everywhere
I worship Cargo
While the neighbors stare

I've got a fleet of Red Barchettas
My preference in cars
Clothes that don't fit me
A ferret that bit me
Crystals, candles, books, incense, glowing stars

I've got red plastic eyeballs 
That spin around and chime
Thoughts of divestation
Fill me with consternation
House is gettin' smaller all the time
 ---that's why I believe---

Got so much Cargo around me
Give me your Cargo, it satisfies me

Sweet shopping cart, swing low, fulfill me

as we approach the fateful TNMS #2112, and as i catch up on most of this
summer's posts....

was thinking how neat it would be when rush tours again, if we, as a
fanbase, got to pick the opener, just for kicks.  not like that'll actually
happen, but, something to ponder.  and this artist would have to represent
say, a more modern, not necessarily more radio friendly band, but one
that's known by that target 14-28 year old audience so lamented in some of
this summer's earlier msgs.... 

of course, i'm going ahead and violating my own rule here, but just as a
thought, how about Ben Harper & the Innocent Criminals.  Ben Harper is a
gifted guitarist w/ his Weissenborn[sp?] guitars and array of well-utilized
effects, and the Innocent Criminals are an excellent combination of bass
and percussion, though perhaps not Peart-standard-issue... it would be neat
to see Ben harper and his percussionist [ Juan Nelson i believe ] join in
if all parties decided it could be neat for them to play together....

thoughts?

Because the book is quite long, it took me a whole weekend to read it.
And during that time I heard the album about 200 times.

The big screen was showing rare and vintage video footage, promos,
interviews, etc. all day. Then we got to hear several tracks from
Different Stages - and I tell you it's gonna knock yer socks off!
Apparently this was an exclusive first for SOR, so it was great to be
there. There was also a terrific raffle with lots of prizes donated by
Anthem - a platinum MP disc and a pair of NP's drumsticks to mention a
couple.

Rush tribute band Tom Sawyer provided the backing to Rush karaoke - much
admiration for the volunteers! Then Tom Sawyer played a set of old and
new Rush.

All in all a great day - I didn't win any raffle prizes, but the
drumsticks were handed back to be auctioned off for the Selena/Jackie
