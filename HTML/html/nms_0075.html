I can't get these rasters and I really want them.  I can get to the ftp site, but I
can't use the userid "anonymous".  I use my userid, and it'll ask me for a password,
but none of the passwords I've tried work.  If you would, could you
send me your files
or tell me another way I can get these rasters?

Thanks a lot.

He's back from his vacation.  I know, because I received a postcard from him
on Monday.

Greetings, all,
  I'm new to the Digest, but, having looked at the past few issues, I can tell
I'll probably be a frequent reader/poster.  I've been a fan for about six years,
and a practicing musicians for four of those.  My main instrument is bass, but
I also play guitar and keyboards.  I'm currently in a band heavily influenced
by Rush, where I have to split my time between bass and keyboards.  I can play
just about any Rush song/bass line, with a few notable exceptions, which I kind
of fudge, such as the bass solos to "La Villa Strangiato" and "Show Don't Tell,"
to name just a few.  There are obviously quite a few musicians on this forum,
and I look forward to corresponding with you all.
  In response to Jason Bold's query about the YYZ lick:  If you are referring
to the guitar/bass/drums unison lick after the intro, it goes as follows (the
first two notes are 32nd, the rest are 16th):

C C C# D# E F# G# A# B C# D# E D# C C#

Later daze,
Michael Rashas

I must apologize.  My presentation was pretty poor.  Anyway, here is how
I play it in tab:

                                             _______
-----2--0-----0--5--0-----0---|-----2--0-----4--2--0-----0--|
-----------3-----------3------|-----------3-----------3-----|

Every note is picked, except the 4--2--0 combination shown above with the
lines over it.
Any comments.  I have played this song for years, which is why I was
confused when I saw him play it.

     When I saw Rush in Philadelphia this year (late April), Alex was
using his Signature guitars like he had on the Hold Your Fire Tour.  He
used both his black and white model's and changed between them
frequantly.

     Then I saw a video of them in Toronto.  This was I think on May
17, and Alex was using what looked like a Paul Reed Smith guitar for
the whole show.  It was a sort blackish sunburst.  I had figured that
maybe Alex had changed the guitars he was using.

      A friend of mine had seen them at Alpine Valley in mid-June,
however, and said that Alex was using the same Signature guitars as the
ones on the Show of Hands video.

     I was wondering if anybody knows the reason of the switch, and if
anyone else had seen him using this other guitar elsewhere.

No question, Ben.  You get the "Best Signature in a Real Long Time"

But shouldn't the quote balloon read:

or better yet, considering the subjects of this mailing list:

	"Don't turn your back and slam the door on me, eh!"

First the unpleasant business -- 'jms@vanth.uucp' is guaranteed to fail
right now because vanth isn't in the uucp map yet.  As a matter of fact I
may have gotten my entry in too late for this month's version also.  The
uucp paths in my signature are guaranteed to work of course, and the domain
address should work for any system which knows the .commodore.com domain.

I don't have any information on the Rock Fantasy series right now.  I'll
have to get it from my brother, who collects comics, and post it when I do.
Hopefully this weekend.  Owing partially to the fact that I'm posting this
at 12:18 AM, I can't even remember the publisher's name.  :-)  They're not
a mainstream publisher; you'll have to visit a comics shop rather than a
newsstand if you want to find it.  I don't know if they accept orders by
mail, but I'll try to find out.  I also don't know when the Rush issue is
due.  It was second on the list for 1991 but I'm not 100% certain the list
was meant to be in order.

By the way, there's also another, unrelated, series of rock comics which
consist of unauthorized biographies.  (You may have heard of them on MTV in
connection with a pop "band" whose very name I'm afraid to mention.)  These
guys have never covered Rush, and I'm starting to wonder if we should
lobby them to correct this oversight.  :-)

	A Nice Really Early Morning Drive ("Scars")
			by Todd Day

It's way past midnight.  I'm on the road alone, no one
but me, both in the car and on the road.  I'm driving
back to Santa Barbara from the Bay Area on 101 in my red
Eagle Talon Tsi AWD (the closest I'm ever going to get to
owning a Barchetta).  Fairly boring drive through the
Santa Maria and Buellton area, as these are heavily
patrolled and I'm trying to keep my driving record intact.
Having just passed Andersen's Split Pea Soup restaurant,
I'm fairly certain the road ahead will be clear of the
State of California revenue enhancement vehicles, at
least until just past the Gaviota Tunnel area.

Ahhhh...  the Gaviota Tunnel area.  The only part of 101
worth risking a ticket over.  Actually, in spite of the
fact that the tunnel spans only the northbound section of
101, the southbound lanes are much more fun to travel.
Some freak of nature created by Mother Earth, Mother
Nature, and CalTrans.

Unfortunately, this road (like most US highways) was
designed for 70MPH travel.  Therefore, to wring the most
pleasure from it, one must travel at a minimum of 80MPH.
This requires concentration, and one must prepare
mentally.  In a car with a CD player and an 80 watt sound
system, this means preparing musically as well.  With this
in mind, I flip through my thick stack of Rush CDs.
Lessee...  "Red Barchetta"?  Too obvious.  "Lessons"?
Nah... that's something to end a journey with...  save
that for when I get to Goleta.  "Territories"?  "The
Rhythm Method"?  Good driving songs, but they don't
quite fit my mood.

My mood.  What was I feeling?  I'm out here all alone on
a moonless but perfectly clear night.  Sorta lonely, but
feeling very alive.  I sorta...  -- I get this feeling.

That's it!  I pull _Presto_ out of its jewel box, shove it
in the CD player, wait for it to spin up, and punch the
index button four times.  Before Geddy gets his first
"Hey!" out, I downshift to fourth.  By the second "Hey!",
the pedal is mashed into the carpet.  Right after the
third "Hey!", my turbo gauge shows twelve pounds of boost
and the tach is racing towards redline.  Before the bass
line repeats, I extinguish all dash lights and turn my
driving lights on.  It's just Rush, the road, the car, and
me.

As I race down the mountain, every curve brings a new
verse.  Steep downhills flow with each repitition of the
chorus.  Musical nirvana!  (Have I found Xanadu?)  The
best is yet to come.  It seems I've timed the 45MPH
curves to coincide with the final verse.  To maintain my
speed, I use both lanes to cut back and forth.  Absolutely
incredible!

The song ends just as I pass the last of the curves and
the northbound tunnel.  I set my cruise control to exactly
61MPH just as I spot a CHP waiting at the exit of the
rest stop.  Geddy begins the next song, "If I could wave
my magic wand..."  Hmmmm...
