Alex didn't invent the idea of using a guitar stand, that's for 
sure - but he *did* design (and I believe, manufacture!) the 
particular stand which he used himself.  I seem to remember 
reading that he made an illuminated book stand for Geddy as well,
so he could turn the pages with one hand while eating cornflakes
with the other (or something).

Anthem:  Left or Right (it don't matter if you're black or white!)

As I've read TNMS lately, it's been hypnotic to the point of osmosis!
NODOZE was kept in business I must say...but I think it's officially 
called Post Super Bowl Mordem...but I'm glad the Broncos won...but now 
to pay Dale Carter more than Steve Atware is a crime...Dale is a chump 
and a thug....Steve is a stand-up guy....which leads me to this 
question...

BRAIN:  "Pinky are you pondering what I'm Pondering?"

PINKY:  "Well I dunno Brain, but I think that Carmen Miranda is somehow 
related to you!!!!"

BRAIN:  "Which leads me to why I should lead the planet to world 
justice!!!  (Something the hat never did for Carmen Miranda!!!)"

PINKY:  "OHHHHH~BRAAAAIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!"

Anyway...my battle cry!!!!

"Can't we all just get along!!!!!"  (Say it like the squeaky toned 
hillbilly in Petty Coat Junction....it goes over much better!!!!!!)

You see, the great debate that fills our American lifestyles and 
airwaves day in day out drains me.  The political debates are quite 
frankly NULL & VOID!!!  Sure the President gets off on all charges...but 
he can't fool the best of us...he still committed a crime...but ask OJ 
about that one....I am like a kid with a pot on his head marching around 
the room banging other pots and pans screaming out....(most 
sarcastically I might add)

"We are marching to Bastille Day!!!"
~Bastille Day : RUSH

But then I am brought back to the realization of the way things are...

"It matters not...He is your king!!!"
The Judge responding to William Wallaces denouncing the notion
of King Longshanks being his King : Braveheart  

Yet my soul cries out for justice...but then I'm reminded of these 
circumstances and what "justice" has been interpreted as being over the 
ages...and I am reminded of this...seeing as I DID VOTE FOR KING 
LERZZZZEST!!!!

"Behold the high price of Treason!"
The Judge, before the torturing & execution of William Wallace
: Braveheart

Which leads me too Anthem and the everlasting fact that THERE IS NO 
JUSTICE IN THIS WORLD.....what a bunch of greedy idiots with no PR 
skills what so ever!!!

So, I'm still marching on...to the beat of a different...ummmm......

>.....ANTHEM!!!!

(Just for grins...if you have no sense of humor...go back and learn how 
to get one!!!  And if you do have one you probably work for Anthem or

Peace RUSH'ians, hope you had a laugh!

<sigh>

I hope people don't respond to this troll.  I've debated
Mike on various things in the past, and have found it to
be entirely unproductive.  He just makes stuff up as he
goes along, and dismisses that which contradicts him out
of hand. 

I've written a response but decided not to post it here,
except for the one itty bit that's Rush-related:

Example, please.  Pick "Freewill" for an easy one.

(The rest of my response, including source documentation 
such as references to my last unanswered email to him, can 
be found at http://www.teleport.com/~nickb/kerns/index.html.  
I highly recommend that anyone considering debating Mike on 
this should read my stuff first for a taste of what they'll 
be getting themselves into.)

ok...now I think someone is taking this too far, you can't compare either
PC or NP to Steve Gadd, mostly because Gadd does not play rock music. And
the facts remain is that though Neil is an awesomely good drummer, he is
not Gadd, he is not Lenny White, Bruford , or anyone of that Genre. Peart
does play some good jazz, but even he only recently got into real hardcore
jazz drumming, these guys have been doing that since the 70's.

Lets not talk out our asses, if we have something intelligent to say, lets
say it. But lets base it on an educated experience, and an opinion based
on that. Just because you do not like a particular music someone has doen
does not discount thier musical ability. And so far all I've seen is
comparisons that don;t even fit. If we are going to compare drumming, lets
looks at contemporaries. The way I see it, Bruford, Palmer, Collins,
Peart are all contemporaries and played *similar* music during that time
period. (say 1975 to the present, although 3 of those drummers go back to
1971 or earlier (in the case of Bruford and Palmer, 1969) and one plays
more jazz now than rock (Bruford)) I personally think Bruford and Palmer
blow NP and PC away, but PC and NP are both awesome in thier own rights.

Lets give credit where credit is due, lets pick on Tommy Lee instead of
P.C.

there were 5 Genesis live albums, (Genesis Live, Seconds Out, Three Sides
Live, and The two "Way We Walk" albums) and Bruford plays mostly
everything on Seconds out, and is also featured in a picture disk
featuring an Interview with genesis that was released just after that. I'm
not sure if Thompson played on that album at all (getting my info from the
"Yes Family Tree" that is included with the "YesYears" boxed set on that
one though, and I've found some of that to be possibly inaccurate).
Thompson did however play 90% of Three Sides Live, and The Way We Walk
(both)

sorry for the lack of Rush content, but hellthe fact we can discuss other
prog-rock bands at all is great. My appreciation of Yes and ELP, and
Genesis, and King Crimson and Tull and Floyd all came out of my
appreciation for Rush in the first place.

<A NAME="2177008">Subject: Re- Rush on UK Radio/TV / XTC</A>

Dear all

>mainly from Tommy Vance before he went very metal.
Yep, I remember Tommy Vance used to play Rush quite a bit, which was
fortunate as he was on (national) Radio 1 on a Friday night. He even went
as far as to broadcast Rush concerts such as the Dutch Pink Pop show from
the Hemispheres tour and part of a RTB show from Wembley Arena, both of
which I still have on tape somewhere.

I was local to Liverpool and their rock show fellow, Phil Easton, on Radio
City as it was then, used to play Rush a lot in the eighties.I remember
being very impressed that they managed to get Alex on the phone after
listeners voted him the best guitarist of the year around the time of ESL.

Of course all this was in the days when Rush would get good UK promotion
(see complaint posting about Anthem in NMS #2175) and do strange things
like (gulp) tour over here. Ho hum.

XTC bit: They have a new, long awaited album coming out this week over
here. I was thinking that XTC are another band like Rush who have been
around for a long while, have matured into a bit of a 'cult' band (with a
relatively small but dedicated fan base) and who still come out with albums
of quality and distinction, not relying on past glories. The new one, Apple
Venus (Part1) is "orchustic" ie. electric guitars replaced by, well, an
orchestra. I've heard some of it and it sounds great. Part 2 will be a
'norma'l XTC album out later in the year. Just thought you should know.

BRIT AWARDS: Was that Max Weinberg playing drums for the Eurythmics set at
the end?

Colin Miller mentioned the Ozzy music in a Montero commercial,

early 80's that finally made it up the corporate ladder

And for those who know a little about the historical inaccuracies of the 
Christian calendar (the one most of us use), there was (or at least 
should have been) a party for the 2000th anniversary of Jesus Christ's 
birth about 5 years ago.

What's the point of analyzing (I like that you can't spell "analyze" 
without "anal") when the "millenium" is or was?  It will probably be 
pinned down to a date that has very little significance on people's 
lives.  It's pretty much meaningless.  What are we celebrating?  When we 
refer to decades, why do we count 1990 as part of the 90's, despite the 
fact that, for those of us who can count, the last decade of the 20th 
Century shouldn't have started until 1991?

2000 is a nice round number.  I'll drink to that.

Michael Jordan is not an internationally prominent sports star, I

I guess you mean "World" as in "World Series".  Sorry, but there
are sports which have huge followings in many nations, all over
the world.  Basketball isn't one of them.

Most people in the world (that's the 'real' world, not just the
United States) don't know who Michael Jordan is.

Well, it may be popular in Canada and Japan to an extent, but
that's really only as a result of American influence.

Actually, outside of N. America, soccer is the largest dominated
sport.(World Infomatic Encyclopedia, 1998). It appears N. Americans are
the ones who like to prop up their sport's figures as immortal heroes.

Well...not actually a "cover", but more of an "ode". In the bridge just
before the guitar solo of "Between Sun and Moon", they do a bit off of
"Won't Get Fooled Again", by The Who. Ged also mentioned in the latest
Rockline that he likes playing to Who songs once in awhile also. I am
still waiting for a "real" cover album of Rush songs to come out though.
Here is my "wish list".

 Catherine Wheel: "Spirit of Radio" (obviously...already done!!)
 Garbage: "Vital Signs"
 Rage Against the Machine: Complete "2112"
 Placebo: "Tom Sawyer"
 Depeche Mode: "Animate"
 Pearl Jam: "Test for Echo"
 Nine Inch Nails: "Driven"
 54-40 (great Canadian band) "Half the World"
 New Radicals: "Everyday Glory"
 Tragically Hip: "Nobody's Hero"
 The Verve: "Bravado" (seriously...just think of the melody!!)
 Hole: "Double Agent". (actually....their latest tune "Malibu", has a
VERY similar sound as "Totem"...just a bit slowed down....have a listen!!)
 Sarah McLachlan: "Time Stand Still"

Well..thats it for today....now..the weather...;-)

Pierre asked: "Does anyone know if there's any rush skin for winamp?  

Since you asked, I am working on a Rush skin I began over two months ago (you
have no idea how much work is required to do one right).  It will include EQ
and Playlist skins, not just the Player. 

If you don't know what a Skin is, it is basically a downloadable interface
which changes the "look" of winamp.  I searched for a Rush skin a couple of
months ago and couldn't find any.

I'm hoping to have it ready by the end of the week, and will let you know.

<A NAME="2177017">Subject: Rush Fans = Thinking Individuals!</A>

February 22, 1999

To all Rush fans,

What I find truly riveting is that I bring into the NMS a statement
about Rush fans being "thinking" people, and inject some political
statements into the topic, and now, over three (3) months later, we are
still debating the issue.

I told you Rush fans were thinking people.

Thus it is written; so it shall be.

<A NAME="2177018">Subject: Dream Theater - Rush Comparison</A>

Okay, I think I have listened to Dream Theater enough that I can make a 
half-way decent assessment (opinion) of them. At first I didn't take to it, 
too complicated, too over the top playing, but as I cranked away I came to 
appreciate the differences. I like the hard, dirty edge to their sound. Good 
production too, I wish Rush could get such good production out of their 
records. It is still true that I think DT overplays, especially Portnoy, but 
man, technically they are awesome. They have some of the best chops i have 
ever heard. Some of the songs are disjointed with too many different riffs 
and nothing holding them together, as well as playing in odd time just to do 
it, not to benefit the song. But as I said, I like it. It just took some 
getting used for what it is. As far as a comparison to Rush, I feel DT is 
in the same "phase" Rush was in around the mid-late seventies, which was 
exploring every time signature and note they could. The emphasis for DT, as 
it was for Rush back then, is playing (read the Presto tour book notes for 
Neil's quotes on this). Rush then evolved to different writing styles with 
more emphasis on song writing itself and using different textures (keys). I 
think DT will start to think sort of the same way as they go along and get 
tired of wringing a thousand notes out of their instruments at break neck 
speed and focus more on the craft of writing a song musically, instead of 
technically. We'll see.

Do you agree?

(*This opinion was based on listening to only two of DT's records - Words and 
Images and the one after it I think. I have not heard the latest.)

Hi everyone,
I just got back from Orlando yesterday, and I am from a really small town
that gets one radio station, and it is country and smooth jazz, :( When I
was in Orlando, I was listening to the classic rock station, and I heard
Limelight. I was shocked, and happy, and then two more songs went by and
Closer to The Heart came on. I almost died. I got back to the hotel and went
upstairs. The next day while going to the beach, I heard Tom Sawyer. (Then
some really dumb song came on. As soon as I switched stations, Spirit of
Radio came on. On the way to the airport, I heard Limelight again. The only
time that I have heard rush on the radio before was about three months ago
in Ithica. (I wasn't around in the height of their career, I am only 16.)
Anyway, it was obviously a great vacation. And to top it off, when I flew
into buffalo and went to Canada to meet a friend at Hardrock in Niagra, I
saw Geddy walking down the street with his son!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(Just kidding, I had to get that "sighting" part in there.)

All this talk of comparing Phil Collins to Neil Peart is a joke! Phil is
an OK drummer, but has not stretched the boundries or expanded the
envelope like Neil has.

Other drummers I think are amazing:

William Calhoun of Living Colour (R.I.P.) - amazing guy with a
relatively small kit
Scott Rockenfeild (sp?) from Queensryche - just an all-around good
player
Tim "Herb" Alexander from Primus (formerly) - this guy is just amazing -
period. I am not a Primus fan, but...
Danny Carey from Tool - just a damn good player

What doya think???

Hey there, Hi there, Ho there!

I don't know about that.  I mean, Squire's a great  bassist, don't 
get me wrong, but Geddy was always much more adventurous with his 
bass lines.  Also, Geddy never played his bass with a guitar pick, 
and Squire does.  Being a bassist, I can honestly say that you can 
get a lot more accomplished by playing finger-style.  It's the same 
basic principle as classical guitarist playing finger-style--you can 
hit a lot more notes than with a pick.  Now, if you want to find a 
bassist that MIGHT be better than my man Geddy, then look no further 
than John Myung from Dream Theater.  Pick up Dream Theater's new 
video and watch the live version of Metropolis Part 1.  Myung can 
really rock!

Neil was asked about this in an inverview in the '80's (I heard a copy on
the internet somewhere, I don't remember where).  He said that he was
watching the tv when he came upon a cartoon about trees. He thought it was
funny how the cartoonist had given the trees human qualities, and Neil
decided to do the same thing, only lyrically.

Also, I went out to go to the store here in Jacksonville about 8pm (2-22)

Really.  See the album credits.  And I do several dozen historical

sounds like a piano--malleted strings.  But the mallets are swung by
hand, not a sprung key.  The live version of resist sounds like a synth.

There are two reasons:

I was recently listening to one of my old RUSH tapes. ( which I often do )
The tape was from the Roll The Bones radio release.  It features excellent 
commentary from Alex & Geddy about the record, etc.  As the song HERESY is 
ending, the radio host comments to Geddy about how he looked as if Geddy was 
enjoying listening to the track.  Geddy's reply was, "I haven't heard the 
song in a while, and it was great to just put on the headphones, closee my 
eyes, and get lost in the music" That just made me feel so good, and affirmed 
all those years of listening and enjoying RUSH & their music in the same 
way.  I'm sure many of you feel and have done the same.

Hate to keep this debate going, but I can't ignore something totaly
incorrect stated as fact. Slim Jim had this to say about basketball...

(snip)

I guess you mean "World" as in "World Series".  Sorry, but there
are sports which have huge followings in many nations, all over
the world.  Basketball isn't one of them.

Well, it may be popular in Canada and Japan to an extent, but
that's really only as a result of American influence.

Slim

(unsnip)

Then maybe you can explain why American college basketball players not
drafted into the NBA (that's National Basketball Association) get paid good
money to play in the Italian and Spanish leagues. And why are so many
American college players from eastern Europe and Africa?
While it may not be as popular as football (that's soccer, not American
football), claiming basketball doesn't have an international following is,
well, wrong. Let's hope it's never as popular as football, and that's from
a rabid basketball fan, who happens to like football just a bit more.

While I'm at it, John Caufield wrote about Phil Collins...

(snip)

 FYI - Phil Collins has also been the subject of a rather long-winded
     (and at times, rather heated!) thread on the Led Zeppelin mailing
     list.  What began as comments on Phil's talents (or lack thereof)
     during Zep's Live Aid reunion, digressed into comparisons between his
     and John Bonham's styles (much like has been going on in TNMS in the
     Peart vs. Collins debates).

(unsnip)

First of all, the guys asked Phil if he would play with them, then stuck
him next to Tony Thompson. Never mentioned there'd be another drummer. Just
put him there. Tony acted like he was the only drummer, not giving Phil
room to play. So, after a while, Phil just laid back.
Now did you catch his set with Eric Clapton? I bet Tony Thompson did.
