   I can sympathize with those who have had the show SPOILED for them already.
Perhaps an idea would be to use the rot13 method to encrypt the posts.  Sure
you can just put SPOILER in the subject line, but people might see something
as the text they are trying to avoid reading is scrolling by.
   On my Unix account, I have an executable script called trfile which contains
the following:

      tr '[a-m][n-z][A-M][N-Z]' '[n-z][a-m][N-Z][A-M]'

   Doing an ls -l on said file produces:

      -rwx------  1 stedman        49 Jul 29 14:03 trfile

   Basically, all characters are rotated by 13 so an a becomes an n and so on.
To encrypt the file you just execute the following command:

      $ trfile < spoiler > spoiler.encrypted

To unencrypt, you just do the reverse:

      $ trfile < spoiler.encrypted

   This may be a good idea or it may totally suck depending on how difficult
it would be for those who want to read spoilers to decrypt them.  I know
that rot13 is a standard on many newsgroups like rec.humor.funny.  Just
an idea...

[ I though about doing things this way, but not all of the NMS readership
  has access to a Unix system.  Now, if I could find the C code to do the
  same thing, I might consider it.  I don't want to do something that's not
  accessable to many list members.                                :rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="384002">Subject: Rush in the Ottawa Citizen</A>

To kill time, I'm typing in the following article from today's (21/11/91)
Ottawa Citizen (otherwise a sh*t-rag):

     "Older, wiser and still rockin'.....R U S H"
by Lynn Saxberg (Citizen Staff Writer)

	When Rush is touring, drummer Neil Peart's peace of mind depends on
giving a good performance.
	"My whole life hinges on how well I played last night," he says.
"It's so important and so critical that a show day is like nothing else.  I
judge my whole reality based on how well that two hours on stage go."
	That's the kind of uncompromising professionalism that has propelled
the trio to become the most respected of Canadian rockers.
	But 18 years ago, neither the band members - Peart, guitarist Alex
Lifeson and singer-bassist Geddy Lee - nor the critics would have predicted
that the band would become so firmly established.
	They've released 14 studio albums worldwide.
	They own their own record company, Anthem Records, and each band
member makes a comfortable living.  They even have a health and dental plan
for their roadies.
	Not bad for a band that used to play every high school dance north
of Toronto.
	The band is three weeks into a world tour, backing the newly released
"Roll the Bones" album.
	They perform at the Civic Centre Tuesday.

	To some, the enduring appeal of the music lies in its consistency -
complex lyrics over intricate bass and drum work, with Lee's soaring vocals
providing a distinctive hook.
	But from Peart's perspective as a musician and songwriter, the playing
and writing has changed enormously during the years.
	"To me, early things are like your fridge paintings from Grade 2 that
your mom used to hang on the fridge.  You grow out of them and you're either
embarrassed or a bit nostalgic about them," he says.
	"That's probably a good analysis with the early stuff for me.  For me,
anything much before 1980, I don't honestly relate to in any direct way
anymore.  As with anybody, you look back at your adolescence and it could be,
maybe not embarrassing, but uncomfortable at least.
	"I've become much better at communicating ideas and sensations and 
responses to things," he says.
	Although Peart sounds like a hard-to-please perfectionist when he
talks about his work, he is happy with the new album.
	The song "Ghost of a Chance", for instance, is a rare Rush love song.
The band usually shies away from love songs because they tend to sound
shallow, Peart says.
	"falling in love, as everyone knows, is a pretty common occurrence.
But beyond the falling in love, to create a real enduring love is an effort
of will and discipline and sacrifice and all those other things that are
work in a sense."
	"I was able to address a nuance of love like that, just through
having the technique of being able to think about it and then verbalize
it with exactly the right words."
	In the past few years, Rush has enjoyed a growing sense of respect
from a wider audience.  Peart speculates that it may be because of renewed
interest in heavy metal.  While Rush's music is more accurately termed
progressive rock, it's often been lumped in with metal.
	And that used to bother Peart.  "Three or fouryears ago, the
definition of heavy metal was pretty lame," he says.
	"Now it's actually a very respectable genre.  In fact, it's often
attributed as the return to real music and real musicians.
	"Before we were guilty by association and now we're kind of heroic
by association.  We're still doing the same things and growing our own way
but suddenly everything's changed around us."
	Rush fans who discovered the band in the early days have grown up
with the band.  Many are now in their 30s with careers and families.  Peart
says he's beginning to see fans in the audience with their spouses and
children.
	And the fans are definitely a devoted bunch.
	Rush has been bombarded with petitions from fans in certain
Canadian cities, including Ottawa and Halifax, to bring the band to their
town.
	Peart received the Ottawa petition, started by a local radio
station, when the band was in rehearsal.  After checking with the band's
manager he faxed back a positive reply.
	"At the time, we didn't know exactly when but those things do
matter.  you hear about something like that and you want to respond to it."

I'm currently reading the acclaimed novel "Skinny Legs and All" by Tom
Robbins.  Among the dozen or so acclamations at the front (from sources
such as "Publishers Weekly" and USAToday) is the following:

"Writing that is funny, sexy, imaginative and playful, yet has an
underlying texture both beautiful and profound."
		-Neil Peart, lyricist, Rush

Just a little tidbit, there.  Now permit some gloating:  I got Row A (sic)
floors to see Rush here in Ottawa on Tuesday!!  Should out-rock all the
previous Rush shows I've seen (since Signals).  BTW, the show is not sold
out, despite it being in a small arena.  Every seat in the Ottawa Civic
Centre is good, and the acoustics are much better there (saw Queensryche
recently) than Maple Leaf Gardens, Montreal Forum, or Skydome.

Fellow Rushians,
   Anybody out there know how much a picture disc (you know, records with
pictures on them instead of plain black {what's a record?}) of Hemispheres
is worth?  Somebody I know has one that's in excellent condition (not to
mention it's never been played before).  Also, does anybody know if there
were any other Rush picture-discs and/or where you could get and/or how
much they'd cost?  Thanx.

[ I think I paid about $15 for mine back in the early 80's.  I've heard they
  still go for around that, but I think you have to find them in specialty
  record stores (not Kemp Mill/Waxie Maxies/Musicland/etc types), or at 
  record conventions.  I've seen one advertised at $75 here, but I wouldn't
  touch it unless I failed all other options...                     :rush-mgr ]

Yo People,
Someone out there in Rush land wanted to know (rightfully so, I think)
how the more fortunate among us got good seats.  Well, I myself slept
out with a Large # of people - at least 8.  We had a blast, but we got there
EARLY - like, 11:30 p.m. the night before.  Other guys in my group got
there at 9:00 p.m. (no lie, 9 o'clock!)!!!  Needless to say, we got there
first and as a result got the best seats.  My advice to any ticket buyers
is to go to a distributer that has a computer access to print up tix.
This way, the distributer's computer automatically prints up the best
seats available - period.  These types of distributers don't buy a
section of tickets that they have to sell, giving you the best of their
particular bunch - they can punch up the best tix available in the
whole stadium.  Anyway, that's how it works (I think).
Hope this is remotely helpful!
Later........................

p.s. - Don't go for lottery!!!!!!!!!!!  You will get screwed.

[ Nine o'clock?  Geez, by then we had 20 people at our location!  I was

It's a Promark 747 alright!  Also, he breaks all his sticks when they're
about to break, and then gets fresh ones.  So the only way you'll get a
whole stick is if it was one of the last pair he used.  BTW, met someone

with RANDOMness and FATE.  Well, you get the idea... Jst my .02 cents

2) Neil on Rockline -- I KNOW those of you who will get it will tape
it.  And yes, this is a request for anyone who might be kind enough to
make a copy for someone out in the middle of the ocean.  I'm still
tryinng to find out if Z-Rock will at least broadcast it.   BUt I
suppose this can be discussed a little later...

3) Please, I beg you, don't ever complain about your seating.  Most of
you folks will be that much closer to the Boyz THAN THE REST OF US who
will be moping around the hhouse pathetically fantasizing about being
at a Rush concert because they didn't come to OUR TOWN.  I mean

Terry Stedman says that he got an original Hemispheres poster at a local 
record shop.  I got this poster a while back, but I was wondering if there 
are any more goodies inside the original pressings of any other albums.  I 
know that Fly By Night had the lyrics printed on the sleeve, and I'm still 
looking for that (my friend got it for $4!).  So... any other cool stuff?

Also, about Alex's photos, I got all of them except the one where he is 
dressed up like a little German boy.  I think one is him as Jack Ruby, 
shooting Lee Harvey Oswald.  Is that what everyone else thinks?  There's 
also of course, the Pope, George Bush, Queen Elizabeth, Liz Taylor, Prince 
Charles, any more?  I hope no one thinks this is a spoiler, but Alex has 
those pictures lined up on his amplifiers for the RTB tour.  They're quite 
large, and easily seen from the fifth row, Geddy's side.

Brought to you by the letter M.  From Power Windows.  I think this one 
refers to the large number of M's in the song titles, especially as the 
first letter (Marathon, Big Money, Manhattan Project, Mystic Rhythms, 
Middletown Dreams, Emotion Detector).  I'm not sure about the ones on 
Presto and RTB.

In regards to the mystery rapper:

About two months ago, I was flipping through the channels and caught
a small piece on MTV regarding the new RUSH album.  They had mentioned
a rap artist had helped the gang out on a song.  I would assume this
would be RTB.  The name of the rapper was stated. But since I was not
familiar with the person, I immediately forgot his name.

Perhaps, someone can call MTV's rock news program and obtain the name
of the rapper.

Hopefully, this hasn't come up already; I am sometimes forced to hit
"delete" on the NMS when the workload gets to high!

I was lucky enough to have a loge ticket at the Richfield Coliseum for
the November 17th show.  This lofty perch provided a non-standard view
in the Coliseum, and (with the help of field glasses) I noticed a
computer screen up near the back wall on Neil's right.  There were
plenty of colors on the screen, but I was too high to read what was
being displayed.  Anybody notice what was on the screen?  I'm
wondering what it's purpose was.

For what it's worth, I thought the show was way too short.

readers out there might be interested in knowing.  The opener for the
December 16th show in Toronto is none other than The Tragically Hip.

Unfortunately, I can't make it to the show, but to those who will be
attending, I hope you enjoy...

   Howdy all again,

      Well after standing in line for only 1 1/2 hrs last Sat. I was able
to get decent seats for the Dec 15th show here in the Buff.  I'm on
Alex's side, a section over from center ice in the Aud. (Closer to stage).
There were about 30 ppl ahead of me and the first guy out was only able
to get row L on the floor!!!  Man I thought I was gonna sit with the pigeons!!
But all worked out well.
      I finally saw RTB on eMpTyV and as usual it was around 12:30 am est.
But what I found out this week was that the Jukebox Network just added RTB to
it's play list.  What the hell is the Jukebox Network you may ask??
Well we just started to get it here in Buffalo back when Presto came out
(thats where I saw Show Don't Tell for the first time).  Anyway what it has
is a 900 number you can call and enter a 3-digit code for a video you want to
see...the price $2.50.  (Or 3 vids for $6...what a deal!)  They have ALL
different vids to chose from and while they play a vid they flash other
artists-songs-and code numbers across the bottom of the screen.  RTB is number
315 if you get the station, but from what I have seen lately on NMS, no one has
mentioned the Jukebox so it looks like I'm the only lucky(?) one.---Just some
useless trivia!!!

      Before I go... hey JOHN TALBOT if there was a award for best grapic on
NMS you got my vote!!!   That is just too cool!!!!  (Anybody who hasn't seen
it...it's the bunny in the hat).

Later y'all

I don't even know if Rush has thought much about the next album (I
know I have), but I know that they have been in the habit lately of
switching producers every few albums.  With this in mind, perhaps
somebody out there can shed some light for me.

I heard (from a source that shall remain nameless on the grounds that
my inquiries might tend to inciminate them) that there is a
possibility that Bob Rock might be producing the next album.  Anyone
care to offer any thoughts?  I _really_ gotta know.

To the person interested in Rocinante, books, etc. :
I always thought the title "Jacob's Ladder" referred to the passage in the
Bible where Paul the apostle dozes off and sees a vision of angels climbing
a ladder to Heaven. "..Follow men's eyes as they reach toward the skies ...
The shifting shafts of shining weave the fabric of their dreams..."
(please excuse misquotes) That has always been my thought on the subject,
anybody else?     Doug

Date: Fri, 22 Nov 91 10:53:16 CST

OK,

I'll probably invoke massive flames for this, but...

Well, I just bought the RTB CD. (ouch, sorry, I know it's late...)
Lots of good tunes.  I have heard them all on the radio.  Where's my thing?
is a pretty good tune.  Rush seems to have made their music much more melodic
and easy to listen to.  Not easy listening, but some of the songs on their
especially "Where's my thing?" have an effect similar to the one I experience
when I hear Jon Anderson sing the very end of "The Gates of Delerium".
You know, the part that goes "soon...oh, soon the light..."  Or something
like the second song on the first side of "Going for the One".
Really beautiful melodies.  Rush has done something here they really haven't
done on the other albums, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe not
being able to quantify/qualify/examine it (ie. put my finger on it)
is what makes it interesting.

Secondly, about the phrase "Roll the Bones".  Has anyone seen Predator II?
For some background, Predator II is about a predator like Predator I that
comes to LA during gang wars in around 1996.  Apparently, they are attracted
to intense fire and heat.  Anyway, one of the gangs is a Colombian gang,
and their leader is someone named "King Willy".  During the movie, the hero,
a cop, goes to talk to him about what (the predator) is killing all of his
people AND the cops.  Willie is 100% rastafarian (sp?) and talks like, "
Yaaa maaaan, they saaayyy you want to talk to me maaahn".  The interesting
thing is that the whole time he is talking, he is *rolling bones* onto the
top of a 50-gallon drum.  I think it is related to voodoo magic because
the columbian gangs used voodoo magic.  Does anyone know for sure?
I don't know if that is what the boyz intended, but I think it is the most
likely possibility.  Comments?

<A NAME="384023">Subject: Alex's keyboard work in Superconductor</A>

Many people have been mentioning Alex's playing of his keyboard part in
Superconductor with various body parts, including fingers, noses, foreheads,
and most recently a guitar stand with a glove attached to the end.

Well, none of this is as impressive as it might seem, since Alex isn't really
playing the notes you hear, he just triggers the whole line.  In other words,
he presses a key exactly when the part should start, and holds it till the
end.

It kinda depresses me actually.  In the old days, Alex would have taken the
time to learn to play this part, which is far from difficult.  I guess MIDI
has made everyone lazier.

It's even more depressing to see Geddy omitting the Midi-pedal triggered
background keyboards in such songs as Tom Sawyer and The Spirit of Radio.
These parts are mega-simple, Geddy has been putting them in for years, and
I feel the songs really suffer without them.

Ahhh... the old days... anyone ever try to play the Taurus Pedal synth
line in Cygnus X-1 while playing the background guitar chords.  Talk about
choreography....

RUSH AT THE SPECTRUM

by Allison Campbell

Seventeen years and 18 albums ago, three young bots out of Canada got
together to do the one thing they knew best - play guitar soaring
rock'n'roll.  Since 1974, Rush has had the same line-up consisting of
lead vocalist, bass guitarist, keyboardist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex
Lifeson, and drummer Neil Peart.  This trio, with their latest
release, _Roll The Bones_, which peaked at number three on the
Billboard Top 200 Album Chart has proven that time has not changed
their immense audience appeal.  The two singles "Dreamline" and "Roll
The Bones" are also rising on the album-oriented rock charts.
Rush, well noted for their strong depth and dexterity, show that music
can possess a certain level of intelligence along with a strong sound
and still reach enormous success on the rock'n'roll charts.  This
intelligence has kept Rush on top of the rock'n'roll scene today.
While intelligence may keep them on top, Geddy Lee's musical expertise
gets them there.  Lee's unique ability to switch from keeboards to bass
makes their music flow with ease.  Backed with Lifeson's textured guitar
work and Peart's avant-garde drumming, Rush's latest album is as fresh as
their first one.  Well, after 17 years and 18 albums these three "young
boys" had to learn something.

[Geez! How about that!  A favorable-type review.  What's the world
coming to? - its SENSES, maybe? :^)

<A NAME="384026">Subject: Eric Johnson</A>

THIS IS NOT A A SPOILER

People have asked for confirmation regarding Eric Johnson's
status as opener for Rush.  While at the November 17 Show
in Cleveland, Johnson said himself that that particular night
was his last opening for the boyz.  A shame, too, if I might
add.  I did, however, gain an appreciation for his talent.

Incidentally, I enjoy EJ's work more on his studio album
(Ah Via Musicom) more than the concert.  At both shows I
had the privelege of attending, the guitar seemed overbearing.
It was nearly impossible, at least from my vantage point, to
hear anything but his booming guitar.  On his album, though,
there is more of a balance between the bass and the guitar.
This makes the music more enjoyable to listen to, in my most
humble opinion.

Hello, again, guys and gals...

In the 'Star no. 381, Kevin Ryan Kirwan asked whether or not anyone knows of
other artwork/direction by Hugh Syme and whether or not Rush was his first ef-
fort.  I can't answer the second question but I do know of a Whitesnake album
cover which he did.  I think that it's the "Slip of a Tongue" album...  the one
with the round, cracked-ceramic-looking band logo against the lighter
background.

About the "Hold Your Fire" cover...  is this the only album cover not
containing photographs of the Boyz?  I have a mixed collection...  CD's, tapes
and LP's, so it's hard for me to know what's on what.

In La Villa, at the part where all you hear is the drums "in seven"

background when the CD player is cranked at this part. I am sure that it
is there, but what could it be?? You LP owners are going to have to have
a great LP and mega turntable to hear this one... It's like a yell way
