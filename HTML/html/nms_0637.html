Take hold RUSH fans, They've gone gold!!!

	Three months ago I too was wandering through the RUSH CD's at my 
local CD store and I came across the 24 carat gold plated Moving Pictures 
original mastered CD.  Naturely since this CD I did not have, I just had to 
pick it up and add it to my RUSH collection.  The price tag on this CD was $31.
Since I have over a half of dozen BOOTS and am use to paying mucho denarrow 
for these CD's, I couldn't resist.

	This CD is about 16 seconds longer than the more popular $12 MP CD.  
I now your asking, "But does it sound better since it is an original mastered 
CD?", and yes, yes it does sound better.  This CD print has a flatter RUSH 
mix.  Rather than having one sound stand out more, or another sound stand out 
more,  this CD has a flatter mix and sounds better.
	This jule case is also made better.  The CD sits in a locking 
mechanism that only unlocks when you open the jule door all the way.  The 
jule door also snaps shut.  But hey, enough on the jule case, back to the 
more important stuff, RUSH.
	The insert that is include with the CD it slick.  The more popular 
$12 MP CD excluded a picture of Master Neil.  This insert include Neil this 
time.  And finally, the insert opens up to a mini poster of the MP cover.  
Cool, way Cool.
		Later RUSH nuts...

Well RUSH fans, I don't know if the Video "Show Don't Tell" made it onto the 
top 200 on MTV last Saturday;  HOWEVER, part of the bass solo DID make it 
into the MTV Top 200 countdown.  Right after Song 58 (I believe) as they were 
going to a commercial, part of the BASS SOLO was being played on
MTV.

Got to agree.  One of my best "RUSH" memories was when I was living in
Washington and had a balcony that overlooked Portland and the Columbia
River.  A friend, also a big RUSH fan, was over for a visit, and all of
a sudden a summer thunderstorm started forming out over Portland.  I grabbed
a couple of chairs, some beer and my speakers and we headed for the balcony.
We popped open the beers, cranked up Jacob's Ladder and sat down to enjoy
the show (we don't get many thunderstorms out this way).  Great stuff!

Date: Thu, 04 Mar 93 12:00:00 PST

Yo guys and gals,

    Just a comment on Wayne's interpretation of the line "if you chose not to
decide....". I was always of the opinion (prior to reading the NMS) that Neil
was cleverly, VERY cleverly pushing the Freewill argument against the
Determinism argument. The basis of the freewill position is ofcourse that we,
as individuals have the ability to decide our OWN fate; there is no
pre-destiny. The key word here is ofcourse 'choice' (and the determinsts often
argue about what this actually means). So Neil is saying if you chose not to
decide (ie: you don't know whether Freewill or Determinism is correct) you
STILL have made a choice and THERFORE you are exercising Freewill!!
Bloody clever if you ask me, unless I'm completely wrong.
I DO recognise the religious argument in the song aswell, and I attribute this
two-topic mixing as implying (somehow) that Freewill doesn't necessarily
imply a God ( Determinism certainly has no place for a God.) HOWEVER, we all
know Neil is an Aetheist(true?) YET he profers Freewill. Now I'm confused....

Help on this would be greatly appreciated!

In response to Will Geeslin's post about Jacob's Ladder, I agree it is an
underrated song.  Especially if you've tried to play it.  Being a drummer
myself, I can attest to that with all of the funky time sig changes every
measure or so, this song is a show-case of Rush's musical talent.  A very good
one at that.

<A NAME="637008">Subject: The REAL origins of the "National Midnight Star" moniker....</A>

Hi fellow Rush fanatics....
Noticed the discussion about the origins of the NMS and it's unique
moniker.  Granted rush-mgr, that does derive from "Red Lenses" off of the
Grace Under Pressure album.
But the specific origins of this term that NP used in the lyrics comes from
an episode of the Second City Television Show in the late 1970's and early
1980's.   SCTV contained various presently famous movie stars and writers, such
as John Candy (Splash, Uncle Buck), Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day as dir.,
Ghostbusters), Catherine O'Hara (Home Alone, Beetlejuice), Andrea Martin,
Dave Thomas (brother of Ian Thomas, a famous songwriter, who had in his
touring band for 6 years a certain Hugh Syme, on keyboards, thereby solidify-
ing the connection to Rush in a direct way), Joe Flaherty (on Maniac Mansion,
and played the ever popular "Count Floyd" who always introduces "The Weapon"
for the band in concert).
SCTV, before they hooked up with NBC to do their show in the US, were really
on their peak creatively and satirically, when they worked with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian public broadcaster.  In one of their
episodes, the head of the mythical tv station, Guy Caballero (Joe Flaherty)
needs a great sweeps week rating boost to his pathetic lineup.  So he gets
local Mellonville rag tabloid, The National Midnight Star, to do a show
of sensationalistic, crappy tv journalism, exposing local and national stars.
Seemed like an Entertainment Tonight, cheesey sort of set up.  Also, Guy
was so hard up for ads, he only had the ads running for the tabloid version 
of the NMS, in between the mythical shows.
Meanwhile in the Rush universe, with the connections Hugh Syme would have had
via Ian Thomas and therefore Dave Thomas, Dirk, Lerxt and Pratt became
hooked on the bizarre comedy of this time.  They were really the only
original comedy coming out on mainstream tv at this time with the demise of
the original cast of Saturday Night Live leaving the air.  Really biting stuff
SCTV did.
Anyway, NP in tribute to the rag journalism the SCTV version of the NMS on
screen, was mentioned in Red Lenses as:
	We've got Mars on the horizon 		-a reference to their cheesy
						horoscopes (horrorscope)
	Said the "National Midnight Star"

	"It's true!!"				-they always claimed on the
						SCTV version that their
						outlandish claims "were true"
						with their unnamed sources.
	What you believe is what you are.	-how true

Anyway, two mysteries solved and the connection to Hugh Syme is fleshed
out and their resultant comedic interplays.  There is a lot of
"entertainment-based incestuousness (sp?)" in Toronto, as this was the
base for much of the SCTV material and of course, our favourite band.
Another example of where the best in entertainers and artists do
seek each other out.

Cheers.....

I disagree entirely.  You say that what sets Geddy apart from these other
two is conviction, but Springsteen just radiates conviction.  The energy
and feeling he puts into his music is what makes it great -- I'm not
particularly fond of his lyrics, but Born to Run is a truly great album,
IMHO.

It's a lot harder to defend Dylan from that charge, but again I would
have to disagree that his music lacks conviction.  Try listening to some of
his music for an extended period of time -- it takes a while to learn to
like (as Rush did, for me at least, and as do most artists that I
eventually come to worship).  I must admit, however, that I tend to prefer
covers of his stuff to the originals.

I, personally, don't appreciate Geddy's screeching, but it doesn't
particularly bother me, either.  I look past it to the beauty of the
instrumentals and the lyrics.  I think Fly By Night is one of the greatest
songs of all time, but my girlfriend can't get past the vocals.  Ah,
well...

Well I recently found out what Mr. Andrew MacNaughtan has been up to
during the off-season of Rush and it's kind of interesting.  First off, Andrew
is no longer the bands Personal Assistant.  Apparently he's had "enough of
living on the road".  He will however maintain his Tour Photgrapher status
and will also (most likely) do the photography for the new album.  He just
completed the album shoot for the next Primus album.  The album btw will
be called Pork Soda and from what I understand is pretty cool.  One final
note about Primus, look for them on a very big multi-band tour this coming
summer.....lolla, lolla lolla.
Until later.

   Not that it means anything, but Maseratti has introduced a new
barchetta - don't remember the name. Again, the word "barchetta" pertains
to a type of car, not a name, like spyder or coupe (yes, even though there
have been cars named Spyder and Coupe).

I agree, I always though that Barchetta was a classification for a type of car
independent of the manufacturer.  Like coupe, convertible, sedan, berlinetta,
spyder, targa, cabriolet ...  If the song were "Red Convertible", the FAQ
wouldn't include a history of every convertible ever made.  I think the
literal translation (small boat), plus the explaination that the term is
usually used for small open Italian sports cars, would be sufficient.

<A NAME="637016">Subject: Six Short Rush Ramblings</A>

Okay Folks, I rarely post, so please bear with me:
1.) Regarding intra-album comparisons:  Each album is different, reflecting
    different ideas  and different times.   Quality comparisons are tricky;
    let each album stand or fall on its own merit without having to live up
    to personal  likes of favorite  older albums.   It's fine to prefer one
    album  over  another,  or one 'era'  over another,  but I believe  that
    Rush's consistent quality  renders most comparisons to  "personal likes
    and dislikes"  (which are fine and legitimate,  but are not necessarily
    representative of the album's objective quality).
2.) BTW:
        (1) No 4th member
        (2) Nobody's got cancer
        (3) DROP IT.
3.) Anybody check out Bradbury's  "I Sing the Body Electric"?  It's a  good
    short story  collection.   Pick it up  in a good used  bookstore  for a
    buck.
4.) Anybody know if Neil still smokes?  I would think that an avid bicycler
    like himself  (not to mention a self-disciplined man  and strong-willed
    percussionist) would have kicked the habit.  Just a question.
5.) It  seems  strange  to  me  that  RUSH  did  a  video for _Afterimage_.
    Granted,  it's a song  that's special to them,  but  I have heard  Neil
    mention  several times that making videos is,  in his opinion,  a waste
    of time.   The video is  even more  puzzling in light  of the fact that
    most of the songs that are made  into videos are commercially succesful
    songs.   _Afterimage_  was never  a particularly succesful  song.   Any
    ideas?
6.) One last item:  I'm going to do something on this next Album which many
    of  you will  probably think is  stupid and  childish.   I am going  to
    listen to only side one of their next album.   I want to save one album
    side of songs for after RUSH is gone.   Face it, folks... Rush probably
    won't be around for another 10 years.   I'll ration the songs to myself
    for special occasions (birthdays, etc).  Sounds silly, but I'm going to
    do it.  So there.

In response to Wayne Torman's post of 3/93:
	"Let us not underrate the value of Neil as one of our century's greatest
(few?) existential philosophers."  Hmm ... I'm a little dubious.  As my mom
used to ask me, Which one of these does not belong?  Husserl, Sartre, Heidegger,
Foucault, Derrida, Sartre, Habermas, Husserl, Peart.  Those are a few 20th
century philosophers whose names might be lumped together as "existential," 
a rather ambiguous term to say the least.
	And as for the Anglo-American analytic tradition, dare we mention 
Peart in the same breath as, er, Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Ryle, Quine, 
Strawson, Sellars, Anscombe, Geach?   Not that I have any sort of privileged 
access to Neil's mind, but I think he would be the first to admit that he, 
like most of us, is a philosophical pygmy compared to the great minds of 
this century, or of any century for that matter.
The great philosophers are those people who are (a) geniuses; (b) people who 
are utterly consumed by philosophical problems, who spend a great deal of 
their lives learning to think rigorously and who spend an unbelievable 
amount of time reading other philosophers.
	I certainly *wish* Neil were a great philosopher.  Then I wouldn't 
have to spend five to seven years in philosophy graduate school, as I plan 
to do.  I could sit around, crank up the stereo, and read Rush lyrics.  But 
alas ...
	This is not intended as a flame, Wayne.  I think Neil *is* a great 
popularizer; his accessible lyrics combined with the musical facility of 
Geddy and Alex do open intellectual doors in ways that cold, forbidding 
technical philosophy does not.  But there we must stop, I think.  Neil opens 
the door, but doesn't show you all that much once you're in, as I think he 
would agree.  (I don't think Neil would rank himself with the great 
philosophers; he likely sees himself for what he is: a very proficient, 
creative drummer who is very smart and knows a lot about a lot of things, but 
cannot compare to specialists in any area save drumming.)
	As for your contention that Springsteen and Dylan have bad voices ... 
I couldn't agree with you more!

In response to Matt MacDonald's post, this most certainly is a flame.

	[ What every moderator needs:
	  flame_filter /usr/spool/mail/temples > /dev/null	:rush-mgr ]

	I won't say anything about Matt's amateurish slurs on people from 
Texas.  And I won't dwell on his evident ignorance  of the meaning of the 
adjective "unintelligble" (if my criticism were "unintelligible," then 
presumably you wouldn't have been able to understand it and argue against 
it).  I'm sure you learn many important things at the Columbia School of 
Journalism, but remedial vocabulary alas isn't one of them.
	I was astounded to learn from Matt that "Neil's lyrics effectively 
communicate complex and innovative ideas ... with a startling economy of 
language."  Whatever else they may be, none of the ideas from Neil's Randian 
phase are particularly complex.  Certainly they aren't innovative, as Neil 
recognized by acknowledging the "genius of Ayn Rand" on the 2112 album.  As
for Hemispheres, an awesome musical composition, anyone who has read 
Nietzsche's *The Birth of Tragedy* will find little new in Peart's 
appropriation of the Apollo-Dionysus dichotomy (Peart probably got the idea 
from Rand, who almost certainly got it from reading Nietzsche, which means
Peart is a "second-hander," as Rand in *The Fountainhead* would say, but I'll 
let this pass).  As for lyrics from Moving Pictures on, what's notable about 
these, I think, is their greater humility (and humanity).  They're more 
likely to be about relationships, Neil's travels, current events, anything 
but the communication of "complex and innovative ideas."  And when Neil does 
get into deep-think, it tends to be embarrassing.  For instance, "Roll the 
Bones."   Neil's treatment of the problem of evil-- this I take to be a major 
preoccupation of the song--is shallow compared to that of, say, Richard 
Swinburne, Alvin Plantinga or Robert Adams, all of whom are excellent 
contemporary philosophers and, incidentally, theists.  If Neil were serious 
about philosophy, if he wanted to transcend the current dilletantish 
agnosticism/atheism he exemplifies, he would grapple with the major 
arguments of these philosophers, or he would know his limits and not
write about the problem of evil.  "Roll the Bones" is infantile.  Neil can do 
better.

And finally, regarding Greg Andrade, who in response  to Aaron Silverman 
concludes "Thus, it is entirely foolish to claim that Neil Peart has gotten 
many of his ideas from Frank Beard." Indeed, it is *transparently* foolish 
to think such a thing, which led me to believe that Mr.  Silverman was 
joking.  At least I hope he was.

(rush-mgr: Matt and I are great friends: the superheated prose don't mean 
 a thing...)

Sorry, have to disagree in a big way there.  Dylan music is quite good,
especially, I feel, in producing the correct mood for the song.  Granted,
his music is not anything like Rush's - Rush's is much more complex and
rightly so, as this is more their style.  Personnally, I love Dylan, and
I rate his music higher than Rush's in general.  But, depending on my
mood, I will listen to a wide variety of different stuff.  (BTW, for the
guy who loves ZZ Top - I've got their first 7 albums on CD [the 6-pack +
De Guello (sp?).  I love them, but again, wouldn't directly compare them
to Rush.  I'm a fan of their blues material.)

As far as Springsteen goes, I don't care for him, so I'll let someone
else come to his defense.  (Anyone, anyone... :-)

I realize that you put an "IMHO" up there, and you may personally not
care for either Springsteen's or Dylan's vocal styles, but the _fact_
is that Dylan has an excellent voice.  Maybe not "pretty", whatever
that means, but you can really feel it.  I'd have a hard time trying
to explain what I'm trying to say.  Go to "rec.music.dylan" and there
will be lots of people who will be happy to explain the many reasons
why Dylan's voice is so good.  I'm not going to get into all that here
in a Rush forum, nor am I going to get into why people are listening
to the "wrong" Dylan performances.  All I can say is that I saw him
at Hamilton Place last fall, and it was an incredible performance!

Also, although I don't care for Springsteen, my reasons for this
dislike have never included his vocal style.  Sure, it's fun to
poke fun at his voice, but I don't think that alone would turn me
off of his music.  How about Roger Waters?  All he does is talk
through his albums, but I love a lot of his stuff as well.

And, just to include some Rush content, I've never thought Geddy's
voice was bad, although some of those early performances have some
humourous moments. :-)

Please ignore the spelling, I don't have my reference album next to me but
YYZ lost to The Police's _Behind My Camel_ off of _Zenyatta Mondetta_.

When I heard that YYZ lost, I had a strange vision of all of the Grammy voters
lined up against a wall being mowed down by Uzi toting musicians, with YYZ
being played in the background. :-)

	I might be mistaken concerning who beat Rush's 'YYZ' for the
Best Rock Instrumental Grammy. Paul McCartney and Wings' 'Rockestra'
on the _Back to the Egg_ album came out in '79, as pointed out to me
by Ron Chrisley.  My second guess :) was the Police's 'Behind My
Camel' from _Zenyatte Mendatta_ which did come out in '81.  The
significance of McCartney's recording is that it's the first winner of
this Grammy category.  Looking this up in _World of Winners_, Gita
Siegman, ed., p. 356, varifies these winners and the dates, but not
who the contenders were.
