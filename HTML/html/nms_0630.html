Why is COS such an underrated album?  Personally I think that the work they did
on Bastille Day, Lakeside Park, and The Fountain (especially Panacea) is among
their best work to date.  I'll agree that The Necromancer is kind of corny, but
that doesn't make the music bad, in fact the music played in the song is 
pretty good.  The listing for the songs done in concert lists all of there 
tours from Rush to RTB except COS.  Anyone out there know what they played at 
those shows? Rush themselves called it the 'Down the Tubes Tour' but I'm 
curious as to what other fans think.  Also, the tour date list leaves out 
all the COS shows, why the omission?  If anyone out there knows the answers to 
any of my questions, please respond to homewg@rpi.edu

Hi kids,

   There's something I want to throw out here and see if anyone sees what
I'm talking about.  After _Roll the Bones_ came out and I heard the 'rap'
and all that, I got to thinking.  Y'know how "The Spirit of Radio" was
adventurous in including reggae during the bridge, well I compare "Roll
the Bones" to it as being the "The Spirit of Radio" of the '90s.  Reggae
was big in the late '70s and early '80s and rap, needless to say, is big
now.  It just shows how Rush tries to stay on top of what the regular
music trends are as they evolve.

   Someone mentioned that they would like to see a Rush Rockumentary on
MTV.  Yeah, wouldn't we all.  Well, does anyone think that maybe we could
get a petition going and maybe talk those assholes at MTV into doing it?
It might even make that channel worth watching for an hour!

<A NAME="630005">Subject: lack of rhythm gtr live and Eth</A>

Yesterday someone said that Rush could have used a 4th member in the
pre-synth days and that the lack of a rhythm guitar during Alex's solos
sounded bad (BTW, I don't know where you got YOUR copy of ATWAS, but mine
doesn't have Lessons on it :^)).  I have to disagree.  I think Rush sounds
GREAT when they break into their original power-trio format.  Nowadays,
this happens primarily during the guitar breaks, and it seems that they
conscientiosly attempt to achieve the trio feel, not only live, but on
their albums as well.  This seems to be the pattern for them now, to leave
the solo sections relatively bare.  Maybe they realized that overdubbing
additional gtr parts tends to clutter up the frequencies, as well as making
it harder for them to try to recreate live (something they're always pretty
conscious of).  IMO, this shows a maturing of their arranging style.
Probably in the old days, they were eager to make as much use of all the
tracks available to them as possible, i.e. more  overdubbed guitar parts,
whereas now the keys take up a lot of the space that used to be the
guitar's.

Ethan Prater, eth (or sometimes edh) is the name of an Old English or
Anglo-Saxon letter that represents th voiceless th sound as in (where's my)
_TH_ing. It looks (looked?) kinda like a "d" with a bar through it (like a
lower case t).  What this has to do with By-tor and the Snow Dog, your
guess is as good as mine!  Did this letter possibly appear on the video
screen behind them back in the days when they played it?  I remember some
graphics for By-tor, but can't remember whether or not I saw "the sign of
Eth."

are wrong.  The Palace wasn't opened until 1989!  The shows were played at
the Michigan Palace in Detroit, an entirely different and now nonexistent

	After plowing through the last five months of TNMS issues, I
thought I'd add my own Rush poster request.  Does/did a poster exist of
the MP cover?  I'm interested in only the MP cover, NOT a collection of
covers with the MP cover.  This has always been one of favorite (a 'MP
cover shooting site trip' for the convention?) and would love to have
one 'suitable for framing'.  You just can't fully appreciate album art
on a CD (the one missed desire of LPs outside of being able to read
lyrics without a damn magnifying glass).

	As there are probably many bassists who subscribe to this list
out of admiration of Lee's talents, do any of you have the Fall '90
issue of 'Bass Player' magazine (Will Lee on the cover)?  This is the
only issue I'm missing since this mag's inception and I would like to
get a copy of it as backissues for it are sold out.  Please email me and
not the TNMS.  Thanks rush-mgr for this non-Rush request.

Also, if it helps, I saw Rush at the Onmi in Atlanta on May 1, 1990.

<A NAME="630009">Subject: My supposed statement (Part II)</A>

Hey,
If you remember, yesterday I couldn't remember what I was talking about in
regards to rush doing their sounds in concert. NOW I remember. This IS
kinda cool...I read an interview with AL, and he was talking about the
way their sound is done in concert. He said that there are two separate
systems that they use, one for the crowd and one for tape. If you've
noticed, in concert, AL has a pretty big rack behind him, this is the rack
for the house sound. BUT he splits the signal from his pre-amp before it
goes to the rack, into the mixer and eventually in the house speakers. The
other line goes directly off stage. From there he has the exact same rack
offstage housed in what he called a "dog house" he said it basically looks
like a doghouse, with a sloped roof over it. Why? Well, for one, it keeps
the extraneous sounds out of the mic (crowd noise, drum sounds,
overlapping bass, etc. ) The sloping roof also cuts down on standing waves
interfering with the sound. Also, I'm not sure about this, but I think
this could hold some bearing. If anyone who is into electronic music, you
might understand what I'm saying: It seems the closer you get to
electronic equipment with your instrument, the more noise and crap gets
picked up. Since one rack is on stage, I wonder how much noise it picks
up? Might havng a rack offstage help in noise reduction? Some of you who
know of what you speak could possibly help me out. :) I didn't need to
ramble, but I thought this was interesting when i read it, and thought
maybe you might like to know, those of you who are Lifeson fans and
interested in what his live setup is. This poses some interesting
questions about their next live album, since he's only been doing this for
just a couple of years. Also, if anyone is interested in what effects he
has in his racks, I think I have that info somewhere too. Let me know.
Sorry Bing. Hey Skyhawk.

<A NAME="630310">From: bobvila@iastate.edu!</A>

	Hey, maybe this is beyond your interest and maybe not... But the reason
I brought up the issue of DAT vs DCC / MD at all is that, since this IS a
Rush board, I assumed some of you might be making bootlegs (esp. at the next
concert).  Not that ANY of us sanction that kind of thing. :)
	I'm not at all worried about studio masters being made on either of
the new formats - that would be stupid.  Boots, on the other hand, are pretty
much made by amateurs, and usually by the ones who really love the band
they're illegally recording.  If you're using a Pro Walkman and recording on
cassette, I probably won't want it anyway - but DAT recorders are only $500
(no small hill o beans, but at $25 per bootleg... you figure it out).  They
sound NOTICEABLY better than DCC or MD to a lot of people.  And if your boots
get transferred to CD, they'll sound even better when they come from DAT
because the sampling frequencies match.  And everyone is happy.
	So... the moral of the story is, make all of your (original) bootlegs
of Rush on DAT, and don't even bother investing in the DCC format.  MD sounds
cool for jogging... except that, surprise!, you have to buy all of your music
all over again (or you basically pay like you are: _blank_ MD's are expected to
retail at around $12 from now until the next funky Sony format.)  Remember
also that CD-R is due out soon, so you can just record your own CD's.  I'd
bet that Meridian will figure out how to make a carry-around CD-R machine
soon, and then, BOY, will we be happy.

	BTW: this discussion might be better carried to another forum, even
though IMO we ought to be at least _concerned_ about sound quality from a
band this good.  What say, Rush-mgr?

      [ Yes, please people, let's keep the arguments over audio formats 
	and standards to email or USENET rec.audio.* groups.  Thanks.

I'm not going to respond to any of the propaganda coming from Mr. Silverman
after today, because I'm getting convinced that his grad school is being
underwriten by Phillips or Sony.  Anyway, yesterday he said:

> There are several reasons why

	 I don't know who "they" is, but DAT isn't dead as a consumer
format.  You can prove that by buying one at Best Buy.  Hey, video cameras
aren't cheap either.  We _are_ talking about a digital recorder small enough
(and cheap enough) to smuggle into a concert, not just another Walkman.  The
miniaturization of camcorders shows that even clunky VHS can fit in your
hand, so what's to keep DAT from downsizing even more?  I've seen the guts
of the thing, and DAT decks just don't have to be as big as they are.
I choose vinyl and CD as my favorite "next album" formats, thank you.  :)
      Mr. Silverman also writes:

	You take care of vinyl, it'll last longer than CD's.  No shinola!
About 1/2 of my collection is older than me, and it sounds as fine as the
Stanley Jordan LP I got new from an '88 pressing.  CD's may
well not last 15 years, according to accelerated aging tests.  As for Mr.
Silverman's last sentence, I think I'll let it stand on its own.

	If you want to pursue DCC/MD/DAT/CD-R more without taking away
valuable space from the "Niel's a jerk!  No he isn't" debate...

In the meantime, (please!) what's your stereo system like?  What albums
sound cool in Dolby Pro Logic or THX?  Are you all listenng to Rush in your
car?  What?  I'd be curious to know...   :)

Look, I know how everyone wants to voice *their* opinion or theory
this, but honestly, this is not an opinion or a theory! I'm not
alone in hearing this, it is not a belch. Someone (I don't care who)
says ""a'right guv'" and it's unmistakable on all the systems I've
heard it on. They weren't even expensive systems.

If in any doubt, take your MP CD along to hi-fi show and pick a
dozen systems (at random if you like) and ask people in the room
what *they* think is being said. Forget all the Rush biz, and just
use some ears. The stuff betweem them sometimes gets rather overused
IMHO. :-) A room full of strangers, esp if they're also strangers
to Rush, should get some interesting answers. You never know, you
might get some converts, too.

Oh yeah. Don't believe everything you read. :-)

All of this should be summerised in the FAQ, so this doesn't come
up again and again.

Agreed. Go to a hi-fi show to discover the real thing.

Mind you, a late friend of mine used to go to hi-fi shows just to
hear inferior systems that cost 3 or 4 times his own. These were not
cheap systems., but his was and still beat everything else. Now, *he*
was a Rush fan! :-) He was even critical of their live sound...

Maybe on *some* systems "a'right" can sound like a belch, or even
like "Morning guv'". I'll accept that "guv'" could be "gub" as
distingushing a single phonim (sp?) at that level in the mix can
tougher than an entire word.

Greetings.

About W.V. Gray's post on Bare Naked Ladies' "Grade Nine":  This
summer I drove to Newfoundland, the easternmost extremity of your country.
While in St. John's I met a kid from North Vancouver, British Columbia; we
hit it off, and I ended up driving him all the way back across the island
and down to the P.E.I. ferry in Pictou, Nova Scotia.  Along the way he
bought a Bare Naked Ladies' tape and insisted on playing it over and over
'til I eventually got used to it.  (I'll admit that there are actually a
couple of good songs on it, but only under duress.)

Anyway, the upshot is this.  This guy was an inveterate Canadian
nationalist, and explained that one of the reasons Bare Naked Ladies
chose the songs you mentioned is because Rush is, you guessed it,
Canadian, and because listening to Rush is supposed to be one of the Canadian
adolescent experiences.

Which doesn't explain why this particular kid had hardly ever listened to
Rush [ :( ]; who knows, maybe "Territories" does.

Just thought you might be interested.

Slainte,

Just because i'm sure everyone wants to know, the label on

Also, the booklet in mine is twice the width (and half the

Oh, and i'm sure Neil made the comment about the lyrics being
"correct" just to drive millions of fans insane when rationalizing

had since high school (a long time ago:)) but I really don't know where it
came from :(.  I bought it from a friend in school who I believe ordered them
in from the States somewhere.  If you or anyone out there finds out where the
place is I'd like to know too so I can see if they've got any other different
ones to add to my collection (you can't get anything like that here on
The Rock!)

Anyway, thats enough typing for me!

>>  On March 21, 1993, the Juno Awards will be presented in Toronto (Junos are

>>commemorating Canada's 125th birthday.  Medals will be presented to special
>>Canadian musicians Tom Cochrane, Celine Dion and the one and only Barnaked
>>Ladies, not!!!!  The Supreme Trio will of course be the third one.  Rush
>>is also rumored to play at the awards.  But we'll just wait and see!
>>
>> The show airs on March 21st on CBC (if you can get it), and for you really
>>dedicated Canuck music freaks, tickets are $192.60 CDN (tax inc.) and the
>>phone number is (416) 485-3135, and get 'em FAST!

   This reminds me of a few things that I forgot to post.  For those of you 
with a satelite dish, the CBC is on satellite E2, channel 19 at 8:00 PM 
eastern time.

	Also, I now pose a question, why doesn't the NMS list any awards (ie.
Junos, Grammys, etc.) that the Boyz have recieved?  Does anyone know of such a
list?  Or can we make our own?

	Later!

Maybe this has been discussed before, but I'm curious so I'll bring it up.  I've
always wondered why "New World Man" is Rush's only Top 40 hit (in America at
least.)  Now I KNOW Rush couldn't care less about that.  And the same goes for
me.  But why, of all Rush tunes released, did THAT one make it to the Top 40?
It's not really one of their best tunes, IMHO.  And I think a lot of people
would agree.  I thought maybe it was due to the song's length, but every song
Rush has released from Signals on has been short enough to get reasonable
airplay.  Anyone out there got any theories about this?  Does anyone really
care (other than me?)

Just curious.
