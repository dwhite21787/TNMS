some dude wrote (sorry, I don't remember who it was):

I agree completely, thought I don't think that you can really compare
the giants...

>For example: Yes - they went and put out "Tormato" (yuck) and "Drama" (very
>Rush-like despite)...slowly giviing in to pop....they then hit paydirt (in
>terms of giving in to pop) with "90125" (yuck).  Genesis had gone to "Abacab"
>and "Mama"

I think the main difference between Rush, and Yes and Genesis, is that
the latter two bands had line-up changes, while Rush didn't.  When
Genesis lost Gabriel, it lost its primary creative ("progressive")
force, imho.  What Yes lost wasn't as significant as what it gained:
Trevor Rabin.  I refer to 90125 and Big Gen Yes as the Trevor Rabin
Band.  Not as a deragatory term (well, maybe a little bit :-), but
because the band basically handed ALL creative control of the music over
to him.  Trevor can write hits.  Hence, "Owner of a Lonely Heart."

>Around "90125"'s time, Rush had "Signals" and "Grace Under Pressure" out as
>new material....  These albums (MV included) are progressive in a lyrical
>sense, I believe, but probably not musically real progressive....except for
>maybe Tom Sawyer and The Camera Eye...
>  in the 70's sense of the word (lots of changes in mood and time signatures).

I think what ALL the bands were experiencing was a need to change.  You
could argue that they changed for artistic reasons, for monetary
reasons, whatever, but all the bands definitely changed their sound over
these years.  (even Discipline, while still prog, begins a new "era" of
Crimson -- again, imho -- of that "pointialistic" type of music).

>Go to 1985....1987....you have POWIND and HYF.  These albums
>are very much "redefined" progressive with a splash of pop thrown
>in musically and lyrically.

Right on... I find these records a good mix of prog, poppy yet emotional
lyrics, and the experience of having written and recorded music for
10-15 years.  I guess the main thing missing from PoW and HYF is song
length.

Great post!!

<A NAME="2019003">Subject: Welcome to the 1998 Syrinx Awards (long)</A>

THIS IS THE SYRINX AWARDS SHOW!
(The Spirit of Radio bursts forth from the house speakers, the TNMS
crowd goes wild)

THANK YOU TNMS! HOW Y'ALL DOING TONIGHT? (applause)

Ahem...

	As promised back in October, I've been gathering nominations for Syrinx
Awards. These are awarded to members of TNMS who have come through for
the list and its members by way of things such as extraordinary acts of
Rush-kindness, super web-sites, detailed and informative posts, or
supplying us with hot, late-breaking news. What makes Syrinx Awards
special is the fact that they are awarded by members of the list for
members of the list. In this sense they are a means by which the list
recognizes a few of its shining stars and encourages others to emulate
them. By doing so, they heighten the experience for the rest of us.  
	And an experience it has been. In the two-and-a-half years I've been
subscribed, I've not only had an outlet to the latest breaking news
about the band, I've also made a number of e-friends, done some nice
tape trades, visited some great websites, and shared my thoughts on many
Rush-related topics. Thanks to everyone, I look forward to the next
years of reading the TNMS and your company.
	
	This wouldn't have been possible however without the sterling efforts
of our beloved Rush-mgr, who of course receives the inaugural Syrinx
Award. Without her tireless work, TNMS wouldn't be sitting in our
mailboxes on a regular basis. I can't imagine how much work she must put
into it. Moreover, imagine running not one but *two* lists. In any
event, she is a hero to us all. Thank you Rush-mgr! (long enthusiastic
applause, chants of HO-LY BITCH! HO-LY BITCH! HO-LY BITCH!)
	
	The second Syrinx Award, oddly enough, goes to yours truly. I'm not
sure I deserve it, but I'll take it anyway %^)  Honestly, I got the idea
for the Syrinx Awards from the Pink Floyd mailing list Echoes. Their
award (the Pinky) is something coveted by its members as a sign of
distinction and has led to a number of really super interpretive posts
and research into the band and their music. I think the Syrinx Awards
have given rise to similar results, although with a special TNMS flavor.
I'm also glad nominations were treated with respect and didn't become
the subject of goofy posts and/or flames. Thanks to all for embracing
the idea of the Syrinx Awards wholeheartedly. (more applause) And now
for some entertainment...

(the camera focuses on stage left as the New York-based Rush tribute
band Power Windows jams out to Limbo)

	Syrinx Award number three goes to none other than Jordan Finkelstein
(aka jman2112). Jordan regaled us last July with a multi-part chronicle
of his trip to Toronto to see Rush at the Molson Amphitheater. Jordan's
detailed account of visiting Toronto and going to the shows was a
pleasure to read. Jordan's posts reminded me of the kind of
travel/tourbook
writing Neil has done, and probably belong in some kind of Rush/TNMS
scrapbook if one is ever put together. What I remember most about Jordan
however was just how clearly his emotions came through in the posts. In
particular I remember how he distributed his collection of Rush
pins to TNMS members for free in honor of the shows he had just seen.
Now *that* was cool Jordan, thanks a lot. (much more applause)

	Number four goes to....Puanani Akaka! Whoo-hoo!!! (I've always wanted
to write that). Although Puanani is one of TNMS's more frequent and
interesting contributors, she was nominated for her brush with royalty,
i.e. her call upon the court of H.R.M King Lerxt backstage at a TFE show
in San Diego. We are all bright green with envy. I mean, come on, how
many TNMS members have ever met the band backstage? Probably something
like 0.01%. Getting backstage to meet Rush must have been one of the
coolest experiences imaginable. Not only did she also get to meet Dirk,
King Lerxt bestowed upon her a symbol of his unestimable bounty, one of
Pratt's drumsticks. Long live the King!! (repeated chants which
eventually fade into wild applause and Whoo-hoos)

	Syrinx Award number five goes to Rob Miceli. Rob went to great lengths
to set up TNMS members with tickets to the Toronto TFE shows and among
other things, hosted a post-concert bash which by all accounts was a
great success. Rob also frequents The Orbit Room and has found the nerve
to strike up a couple of conversations with the King himself. His
posts regarding these brushes with greatness have made for some of last
year's best reading. If this weren't enough, Rob has come through with
late-breaking Rush news and is our man-on-the-scene in the capital of
the Rush empire. Keep up the great work! (standing ovation led by those
who attended the post-concert bash)

	The last, but certainly not the least of the Syrinx Awards, goes to
Eric Hansen (aka Hanstones). If he hadn't been nominated for his web
site Power Windows, he probably should have for his recent post
interpreting Beneath, Between, and Behind (nice one!). Hanstones
consistently contributes provocative and thoughtful posts, and TNMS is a
better place for his efforts. Everyone who has web access go visit his
web page and others like it (such as the Rush Desktop Theme Park or
Grand Designs) and show your appreciation by signing their guestbooks.
These guys have put a lot of time and effort into making their web sites
nice counterparts to the TNMS website. 

(Power Windows returns for an encore: "THANK YOU!! Thank you very
much... Ho-Ho!" as we hear the first plaintive notes of La Villa
Strangiato)

	I thought about giving out things to the recipients of the first six
Syrinx Awards but came upon an even better idea. Quite aside from the
logistical problem of finding prizes and sending them out by mail
(the postal system here in the Moscow suburbs is stone-age), I came up
with a neat idea. Since Rush-mgr informed us that the TNMS homepage has
to move to a new server, I decided to donate $50 to help pay for the
server space. That way I can give myself, the Syrinx Award recipients,
and the rest of us each a gift- more issues of TNMS and access to the
homepage. Come to think of it, donating money for server space and/or
hardware to keep TNMS up and running is something we all might think
about doing once in a while. As we all know, you don't get something for
nothing, even if it seems TNMS is free (sorry, couldn't resist that
one). Rush-mgr, please let me know by private email how I can get that
donation to you.

	Hope you enjoyed this first edition of the Syrinx Awards, I've enjoyed
hosting it. The next ceremony is six months from now, in October.
Hopefully we'll have something in the shape of Victor II and/or a new
live album to drool over by then. 

	Take care,

	Erik DePoy
	Lyubertsy, Russia

I've seen this mentioned a couple of times now and would be 
interested in getting the address.  I take it, it's an American 
company?  Does anyone know if they would deliver to UK addresses or 
if there is a UK equivalent?  (Not Britannia - they're rubbish).

someone was playing a radio nearby)  He then proceeded to do a poor
imitation of Geddy's voice singing the lyrics "...crackle with the
energy". Then he told the same person to crank it up higher, and for the
guy to play Freewill, because he "knew the words to that one"<<

It was actually  him remembering smoking pot over his friends house many
years ago and his friends mom was getting high too. She put in a CD and
started singing.

Has anyone been to see Laser Rush in Seattle?  Is it worth going to, or 
is it cheesy?  I'm just looking for something new and interesting to do 
some weekend.

And now for something completely different...

How many of you students out there can study to Rush?  How about at work 
  how many of you can listen to Rush and concentrate on what you're 
doing?  I find that whenever I have Rush playing, my attention usually 
drifts away from what I'm doing and I start humming along, or even 
singing along (much to the annoyance of my coworkers) and all focus on 
the task at hand is lost.  So I don't get much done but I have a great 
time not doing it!  :)

Ok, so we've all heard Rush to Country (Cold Fire), they've done Rap 
(RTB).  It's only a matter of time before we hear, Disco Rush.  

Alex starts playing a "wakka wakka" riff on the guitar while Geddy warms 
up the crowd in a low voice, "aawwwoooohhh, baby...get'n freaky".  A 
giant disco ball, like the one from the last Pink Floyd tour, comes up 
in the middle of the crowd, and Rush breaks into their version of Disco 
Duck. 

Can you dig it?

Hello all
I've only been a Rush fan for a short period of time, but a couple of 
songs have stood out to me:
Closer to the heart(great lyrics and music)
La Ville Strangio(I love the way it comes together)
Something For Nothing(It has a powerful sound, thanks to the drum work)
Free will(I just like this song)

Thats my two cents!

<A NAME="2019010">Subject: Prog., personal relevance, etc.</A>

Hi everybody.

Someone wondered about Rush songs that we can relate too personally, or have
some kind of relvance to our lives.  Well, here's my quickie list: 

Subdivisions:  Be cool or be cast out, indeed!
Mystic Rhythms:  So many things I think about, when I look far away.
Grace Under Pressure:  Most of this album seems to reflect emotions and 
themes that occur in my life.  One of my favorites!
Circumstances:  These walls that still surround me still contain the same 
old me.
Tom Sawyer:  His reserve a quiet defense, riding out the day's events... 

Someone asked about Rush being progressive.  Someone else asked what
progressive means.  As a new fan of progressive music, I'll try my best to
give my opinion and maybe some insight on this whole mess. 

Progressive music, to me, means music that goes above and beyond what is
popular.  That can be done in any number of ways.  Commonly, it refers to
music that is exceptionally talented (i.e., good players), or well
orchestrated or composed, or exceptionally thoughtful.  Sometimes this means
using different, less-common instruments.  Sometimes this means playing
really interesting or difficult passages.  Sometimes this means writing
longer songs (i.e., not constraining yourself to the pop 3-to-5-minute
format).  Sometimes this means writing in different time signatures.  Almost
by definition, progressive music is not very popular.  The general public
does not seem to be very interested in music that is challenging or radically
different than what's popular. 

Hey!  If you wanna know more about progressive music, check out this site:
http://prog.ari.net/prog/ ... Or this one:
http://prog.ari.net/prog/GEPR/gepr.html

So what Rush do I think is progressive?  Now that I've heard much more of the
VERY broad spectrum of progressive music, I'm sorry to say that not much of
their music seems very progressive to me anymore.  Caress of Steel was their
first attempt at art-rock and progressive music, but to me, doesn't really
work.  Musically, it's not much different than their contemporaries.  2112
was a much better approach.  It takes the listener for a very nice
hard-rockin ride.  As someone mentioned, from 2112 thru Moving Pictures are
good examples of progressive rock.  And they're very good records too! 
Hemispheres is my personal favorite (it's got the long story-song, the
challenging musicanship, the expressive and colorful instrumental, etc.
etc.).  Right around the very late 70's and early 80's there came a new wave
of progressive music, which Rush followed very nicely.  They used a lot of
the sound of this kind of music (listen to all them synthesizers!), but the
music itself seems to be more closely related to the popular music of that
time (The Police come immediately to mind; the band even admits to this). 
But hey!  This is just my opinion. :) I think Rush got really progressive
with Hold Your Fire, though.  They really hit the books hard and made some
really fabulous, intricate songs.  Since then, they've been kinda doing their
own thing, but their own thing seems to be mirroring recent developments in
popular rock, and not pushing those boundaries as much as in earlier years. 

But maybe that's just me!

Oh, and by the way .. Rush roolz!

<A NAME="2019011">Subject: King Crimson and Rush</A>

Dear fellow Rushians,

In response to Chris Anderson's query regarding King Crimson's influence
on Rush, I have a few comments.  First, there is no doubt in my mind
that such influence exists.  The sound which Rush developed in the 1980s
with songs like YYZ, Red Lenses, Presto (the whole album) and others
sound much like King Crimson to be a coincidence.  If you wish to
confirm my theory, please listen to KC albums like the Great Deceiver ,
Discipline and Three of a Perfect Pair.  The similarities are very
striking.  Second, from numerous interviews with Neil Peart which I have
read, Bill Bruford is constantly cited as one of his favorite drummers.
It's no coincidence that the two worked together on Burning for Buddy.
And since such a relationship exists, there is probably little doubt
that Bruford's techniques have made a lasting impression on Peart.
However, I'm not a drummer.  For those of you that are, feel free to
correct me (nicely, though!).  Just a few thoughts.  Take care.

<A NAME="2019012">Subject: Defense and Covers</A>

I'm the guy who wrote a few editions back that I love Alex and believe he
never should be replaced. I also wrote that (though not in these same
words) if Alex got hit by a bus, it would be cool to see what Joe Satriani
or Steve Vai would sound like as a replacement (though Alex could never
really be replaced). I mentioned that I admire the speed and precision with
which Satriani and Vai play.

Somebody else then posted a message saying, "quickness and precision aren't
the same as music." A guy named Curtis then came to my defense and
described what great musicians Satriani and Vai are. I want to thank Curtis
for that. He pointed out, rightfully, that Satriani and Vai produce music
that boasts plenty IN ADDITION to quickness and precision. Their quickness
and precision simply are strengths, in my opinion. What's wrong with that?

Yes, quickness and precision are not music. By the same token, where would
music be WITHOUT quickness and precision?

Just because I remark on a musician's wonderful quickness and precision
(and that's all I did) does not mean I don't appreciate other aspects of
music. And it does not mean that that particularly quick and precise
musician has nothing more to offer, musically. Sheesh!

OK, I'm finished being huffy. On to something less contentious. I don't
know if this has already been introduced as a thread, so please forgive me
if it has. Here goes: What non-Rush song would everyone like to hear Rush
cover?

I know, I know, Rush doesn't play covers, right? I know, I know, we want to
hear Rush play Rush. I know, know, we don't want eight minutes of
invaluable Rush concert time taken by Rush playing another band's song. We
want to hear Rush music. I'm with you on all that.

So don't take this question ultra-seriously. Have fun with it. I'm just
wondering, given Rush's style, soul  and musicianship, what would simply be
INTERESTING to hear if Rush was to play it, just for fun? Pretend you just
sat (and stood) through a day-long concert at which Rush has just finished
playing every single song they've ever put out. And then, Geddy yells,
"Hey, we've got time for just one more! What do you want to hear?" What
would you yell?

(There's a good question in the above paragraph: How many hours of music
has Rush put out? How long WOULD the concert be if Rush played every song
they've ever recorded?)

(And here's another important question: What would happen if God and
Superman got in a fight?)

Away from normal habitat, but in one quite familiar....

I was listening to RUSH with an old friend last week.  He just happens
to be a recording engineer and producer and his credits include Blues
Traveler, among others.  Anyway, he basically stopped listening to RUSH
in 1984.  He says that he still likes the songs, and that the
musicianship is wonderful, but that the special effects that are
employed in the recording of the songs detracts from the actual sound of
the songs.

His case mostly was supported by all of the albums pre '84, when Terry
Brown was doing the co-producing.  I asked him to explain his point.  He
has a recording studio in his house, so he routed a CD signal into it,
and started his demonstration.As it was, he illustrated the drum sound
on A Farewell to Kings, and how clear and direct it is, and then the
drum sound on Counterparts, with all of the reverb on the snare.  His
point was that it is amazing that Neil goes to all the trouble that he
does to find the best sounding drum kits, and then in the studio,
doctors their sound so much.

After all of the changes that RUSH have gone through in the past 10
years, working back to the trio oriented music, maybe it would also be
nice to hear them remove all of the special effects and rely on their
musicianship for this next album.  What rule has been written within the
band that prevents them from working with Terry Brown again?  They have
used Peter Henderson on different occasions.

I do agree that the sound on the earlier albums was much cleaner, and
that progress has brought them to the point that they are now, where
there is much more sound in the songs.  Maybe he has a point....

I hope this is readable, as my son is trying to get on the keyboard and
I don't have time to proofread and correct.  Responses appreciated,
privately and in post.

I know it's been awhile since this thread has come up, but I saw an actor
last night who is the *absolute* dead ringer for Neil Peart.

Alright, so I'm watching Siskel & Ebert last night when they start a review
of a new movie called "Sliding Doors" (two thumbs down, by the way).  They
cut to one of the male lead characters in the movie and I'm telling you, I
look at him and think "Man, that's Neil Peart!!"  The actor's name is John
Hannah.  I believe he may be of Irish or Scottish descent (very strong
accent) or he may have been "acting".  In either case, he is the perfect
candidate to play Neil in a movie.  I plan to do some searching to see what
other films he may been in.

So now that we have Neil and Geddy cast (didn't someone recently say that a
walk-on character on the X-Files resemble Geddy?), anybody know who can
play Big Al?

Just my random thinks...

 Hello,

 We were at the Corel center on July 4th for Rush's last concert of 
their TFO tour.

Antics.............not from the guys kind of, but a quy jumped on 
                      stage and started to dance, much to my surprise 
                      he was not removed immediately.
                      I did not see Geddy or Alex signal security
                      to let him dance,  but they must have because no 
                      one touched him. He danced like crazy and the 
                      croud enjoyed this very much. It went on for a 
                      good 3 minutes then he was escorted off the 
                      stage.
   I thought (and the croud too, seing their enjoyment) that Rush was 
pretty cool to let this happen.

Question...........They played 2112 from A to Z live for US in 
Ottawa, now I need to know if they played it anywhere else on their

Ted,

     I do not mean to be a butt,  but I do not remember when Rush played
at Cinergy Field/Riverfront Stadium (home of the Reds/Bengals). <Not to
boast!>  I have seen Rush every trip into Cincy since PeW,  but never at
the house that Sparky, Rose, Bench, Morgan, Perez, Concepcion, Foster,
Griffey, Gullett, Billingham, and Bourbon built, and pummeled their 70's
opposition in.

     I think you are referring to Riverfront Coliseum, now "The Crown".
Rush has played that venue almost every tour since MP,  but Pete Rose
never got one of his 4256 (??) hits there. The Crown, like it's
counterpart, Cinergy Field,  is a steel reinforced concrete structure
and does suck as far as acoustics go, and The Crown is much to small for
baseball. However, put a real sport like hockey in The Crown and now
you're talking!  : )

      The Crown (then Riverfront Coliseum) was a stop for the "We'll
step on you to see the Who" tragedy and it was after that when alot of
venues and bands did away with festival seating. I did see Rush in
Dayton at Hara during the HYF tour,  and it was definitely festival
seating, which suprised the hell out of me, because like you Ted, I
assumed Rush was through with that type of seating.

      The stadium has housed the likes of Paul McCartney (and Linda, may
she rest in peace), The Stones, and The Beach Boys, but I do not recall
Rush ever playing there.

   Sorry to ramble Ted,  Take it easy.

	I can't believe how many people gave my dumb post about "the star" this
much attention.  In all actuality, the star really represents an opressive
society.  I don't know how many people remember the Soviet Union and
Communism.  Their symbol, was a RED STAR.  Same as China, Vietnam, and just
about every other communist country.  

	The next question is this:  Which author is it that Neil Peart (the
lyrical genius in Rush) worships?
Ayn Rand of course (also given credit of sorts in the liner notes of 2112).
 Now what is her politics? Severe anti-communism/socialism.  It just so
happens that the book ANTHEM involves that type of goverment.  The story of
2112 parrallels Anthem. 

	Now it is very clear to see what this star which the naked man (is this
the same naked man who represents the creative/artistic half of the mind on
Hemispheres?) is shunning away from.  It is in fact a symbol of the
socialistic, anti-technology goverment represented in Anthem, and 2112.

***********************

So.......you say you were bored by the 3rd time you saw the T4E tour?  And you
fell like Rush is just a well planned theatrical production and have lost much 
of what Rock & Roll is to YOU??  Which by the way you said was spontaneity 
and live improvisation.  Let me break it down for you a little so you can 
understand the workings of a legendary band that dictates your unruley ass.

    1.  Rush is NOT a hippy rock band like The Greatful Dead....so I doubt very
seriously that they care if you follow them all around the country and want them
to put on different antics every night just for YOU.  Get a life.

    2.  As for your dumbass self-centered comment, "Rush is a well planned
theatrical production and have lost much of what Rock & Roll is to me".....hmmm.
Let's see here.......seeing as how Rush's shows are very technical and
complex(more then you could ever know), where timing is everything, and it takes
very precise and expertise planning just to make a single element come to
life.....I would say they do pretty damned good.  So don 't EVEN compare their
shows to  The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Tiffany, etc....whoever you said.  It's 
not so easy to change around songs or stop and do a comedy relief special 
JUST FOR YOU  when you've got all the timing, triggers, and computer sequences 
in place for a "well planned" show for the evening.

    3.  Someday all bands will strive for this level of excellence.....and the
company that will bring it to you..........AT&T.  You dig?

"Regardless, when the question arises as to what should be done with the

There was also a rumour being thrown around that the Toronto farm team

I have a Rush-related tattoo. You know the design on the Counterparts 
lyrics booklet? It's also on the back of the CD jewel case. I'm talking 
about the picture called subjective contours...it's the picture with the 
Pac Man-looking things - that is the easiest way to describe it. When you 
look at the design, you see an upside-down triangle that isn't really 
there. It's actually a psychology-related symbol (I'm a psychology minor 
at Indiana University). It demonstrates the Gestalt theory of 
closure...the other shapes in the picture suggest the triangle is there, 
and your mind closes the image for you. Anyway, enough with the 
textbook-sounding stuff. I have that tattoo on my right ankle. It's about 
1.5 by 1.5. I also have one other tattoo, but this one has nothing to do 
with Rush. It's in the center of my lower back, and it's the symbol of 
the snake from the show Millennium.

And now for the absolute dumbest Rush quote I've ever heard. This came 
from one of my former coworkers. He's the kind of guy who listens to Top 
40 stuff (Spice Girls, Mariah Carey...blecch!), and he doesn't have ANY 
working knowledge of classic or progressive rock. Right before the Test 
For Echo tour, I was talking to this guy about music. I mentioned that 
Rush was still tops on my list. He shoots me this COMPLETELY snotty look 
and says, with all the authority in the world, "Come on, Caroline! They 
broke up for a reason!" When I finished laughing at him, I informed him 
that I was going to see them in the next month, and that they were doing 
a tour for their newest CD. I made fun of him until he apologized for his 
blasphemy! I told him he was doomed to rot in Kenny G hell...

Rush on, guys!

Caroline

P.S. - Tell me I was dreaming, but did I actually see a post of someone 
defending the little Hanson rat-boy drummer? Say it ain't so...

Does anyone know if this has been released to dealers yet and how
"limited" it really is?  Please let me know.  I have never been too much
of a Fender fan but this is Geddy we are talking about.  Dream Theaters'
John Myung is also releasing a signature bass this summer (Yamaha).

Thanks in advance,

Sorry, but I can't wait 'til 2000 for the next new Rush material.

Is there a chance they are thinking about a live album for later this 
year, a new studio album for release in early 1999 and then another 
studio album for January 2000?

That would definitely be more like it.  Otherwise, they might need to do 
something they've never done before, like put one or two new studio 
tracks on the live album...

>From September 1996 (T4E) to January 2000 would be the longest wait ever
for new studio Rush...  arghhhhhh!!!!

   [ And last year they went through a very difficult time...    : rush-mgr ]
