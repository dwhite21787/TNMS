How do all.
    I thought I write to give my two cents on the new video.  We all
know that Rush taped at least one show, and had the opportunity to tape
several others.  The clips that were aired on In Concert '91 were
enough to make me believe that one exists.  My guess is the Detriot
show is the one that they finished.  I'm really hoping that it is a
live video.  When you think about it, they only had three videos for
Presto and one for Roll the Bones.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)  That
doesn't make for a very hefty video.  So, if the release is actually
legit (fingers crossed...) I would put my money on a live video.  It
makes sense in the overall scheme of what has happened in the past.
    Also, can anyone CONFIRM (I'm sure twenty million others have asked
this) a Chronicles II?  I'd really like to know, but still don't want
to get my hopes up.
    Now, speaking of rumors, and don't quote me on this, but I believe
that Over the Europe is Rotterdam 5/3/92.  That is the info that I've
heard, and that the new 2CD boot called Atmospheric is also that same
show, in picture disc form.  So, anyway, that's all I've got.  Thanks
for the kind words, Jimmy!  I can't wait until I get ASOF#5...it hasn't
quite made it into my hands, yet, but I expect it soon.  Talk to you
guys later.
                       Trav.

Hi,

	I've recently seen people trying to clear up the facts about
the fly.  First off, I own "the fly" on CD.  It was recorded @ Madison Square
Garden on the 4th of December, 1991.  The title... according to "an italian
dude" who represented the (Italian) boot company the name came from the guy
who recorded it.  Apparently he was either part of the road crew or part of
the MSG crew who worked in an area refered to as "the flies."  This area (as
you might have guessed) includes any part of the show which is above the stage
(or at least that's what the guy said.).  Personally, I think the Dreamline
thoery sounded cool, though.
	Here's some tough trivia.  In which tune on "the fly" does Neil
screw up?  I'll post the answer in a few day's.  Mail me if you think you know
the answer.  (Don't give away the answer, Dave!)

Hi everybody,

Is it me, or has anyone else noticed that in the last bit of "High Water",the
part that says, "when something left the ocean...",  Neil's bass drum sounds
like the rhythm of a heartbeat?  I'm sure there is something subtle.  Neil
is quite a creative kinda guy, huh?

I know this question has come up before, and I apologize for bringing it up
again, but is someone compiling a comprehensive list of Rush bootleg
recordings?

I think it would be good to know what titles are actually recordings of the
same show, what the recording quality is like, etc.

Again, I apologize for bringing it up--I just hadn't heard anything about it
in a while.

  [ The post farther down in the digest concerning boots is a trade list - if
    you are talking about a list of CD/LP boots now available, 
    STEVES@vms.cis.pitt.edu is already working on one.	           : rush-mgr ]

FreeWill is a GREAT band. They sound a LOT like Rush.

This is not entirely correct. First, the drummer is a big, fat sloppy guy
who looks a lot like Rutsey and nothing like Neil....

Second, the bassist/singer and the guitarist DO look like Ged and Al, but
I'm told the guitarist wears an "Alex wig".

This is not true either....I've seen them twice and all they played were
complete songs....they even played Natural Science all the way through.

Well, I agree with your analogy but still like their original material.

They DO have an album...its called "Where there's a will, there's a way."
They sell it at their gigs.....
They play the whole country, coast to coast...

Seeya!! I'll give my review of Dream Theatre after the show!

To whoever talked about the chorus of Between The Wheels: Yes, the "lost
generation" phrase is indubitably a reference to writers such as Dos
Passos. But it surprised me that you did not mention (know?) Hemingway.
_He_ is the most renowned representative of the "lost generation".
The chorus is full of literary (and other) references.
"We can go from boom to bust <- Is this Neil's own?

To David Jabson: "Handle with kid gloves" isn't that rare an expression,
really. It isn't as common as "fuck you asshole", but it certainly pops
up every now and then.

Alright folks, the Rush Boot List is ready for "distribution." Once again, this
is not an NMS-related list, it's an independent one kept by me. Just send me
a message stating you want a copy, and one will be sent to you. That's it. Just
persuing through the new Goldmine: no new Rush CDs. One interesting thing: the
collector's showcase that always had a big selection of rare legit and boot
videos has no video stuff. A crackdown? Hmm... Later,

<A NAME="541009">Subject: Dream Theater, Dixie Dregs, and Rush</A>

Dream Theater recently came through the Detroit area to play a show and the
band also appeared in an interview at a local radio station.  I did not see
the show or hear the interview because I was headed to another gig, but
the band may actually gain a following in this area, thanks to the radio
exposure.  As for the quote from Scene magazine in Cleveland, I would
hardly call Kansas a progressive rock band.  Furthermore, I can tell you
that the Dixie Dregs aren't progressive either.  They are simply fusion
rock artists and are not influenced by Rush.  I can't seem to find the
review of their latest album, but Rod Morgenstein is the drummer and Steve
Morse is the guitarist in the band.  These two musicians are outstanding
and well known among their peers.  As for Rush influence, I think it's a
pitty that bands must so often be compared to other established acts and
that such a comparision may make or break them.  As soon as some people
heard Dream Theater was influenced by Rush, they immediately gave them
consideration.  Why not just judge them by their musical product and not by
their likeness to some other band.  If you want a band that sounds like
Rush, then go to a Rush show or cruise through Ontario on any given night
and stop to see the zillion Rush cover bands which perform in local clubs.
It may come as a shock to some people, but there are many other great
bands who don't sound like Rush or are influenced by them.  For the sake
of expanding interest, I'll name some must-hear acts:  Vital Information,
Chick Corea Elektric Band, Dixie Dregs, Stanley Jordan, John McLaughlin,
and John Scofield.  Sure, many of these are jazz/fusion groups, but
their members are incredible musicians and composers.

<A NAME="541010">Subject:        2112, Epic Poems, Flys on the wall.</A>

Arguments over the content of 2112?
	Sure, just like many RUSH songs (Old, New, Long, & Short) these
multi-interpretive qualities lend a certain "epic" quality to RUSH lyrics
that will make them live long after the group stops making them.  Just
like a good movie, or play -- it's the themes of our complex lives that
make these songs so real.
	I mean, if you could just figure it out -- would it be worth all
the fuss?  There are other songs that have the same high quality of music
that RUSH constantly puts out but if the lyrics are just another "boy
being meets girl being under a somewhat less-than-pink moon which then
expoldes for some inadequatly explained reason", would you really listen
to it after it's fallen off the pop charts???

And as for the Fly argument,
	hasn't anyone outside of Boston heard of a double-entendre?  Like
so many RUSH lyrics the Fly certainly has *both* the meaning so far
suggested.  (Dreamline allusion, "Fly on the wall")   And if you can't
cope with a douple meaning then "you'd better run home boy".

OK. OK, I know, we've had lots of posts concerning 2112 and I'm sure that
no definite conclusion has been reached (or will be reached, for that matter),
but I thought of something that should make good food for thought.  I'm
sure everyone is familiar with Neil's attitudes (as conveyed through his lyrics
and tourbook essays, etc.), so with that in mind I have one question:
   Does anyone really believe that Neil would ever advocate suicide?
Just refer to The Pass.  I don't pretend to know the Mind of Neil, but it seems
to me that he would condemn someone who "took the easy out" instead of fighting
for what was right or what he believed in, thus, I don't see why Neil would
write a lyric about someone who did.  If Neil wanted to make a statement about
the suppresion of the individual, I assume its because he abhors that 
suppresionand encourages making a stand, not allowing yourself to become the 
victim
  martyr without a cause, indeed!
Of course, we all should know that all the greatest works of literature allow
individual interpretations, which is very important.
OK, now lets find another song to dissect. (just kidding)

I just heard that on October 28th Rush will again be honored by some
sort of a music industry organization in Toronto.  Apparently, Geddy and
Alex (not Neil) will attend the ceremony.  Anybody have any more informatino
about this?  Supposedly Q107 (Toronto rock station) announced this.  ANy more
info from anyone?

BTW, I have several tapes from the European RTB tour, and on each one
Alex sings something different during CLoser to the Heart.  One night it
sounds like he waS  talking about 'little red riding hood'!  It's not
only the Spanish inquisition!

Time to be nit picky:
    On my copy of the Hemispheres CD, I noticed the following inconsistency.
The back cover lists the individual chapters of Cygnus X-1, Book II.  Chapter II
(of V) has the title "Apollo/Dionysus."  On the inside fold-out sheet with the
lyrics, however, chapter II is "Apollo" and chapter III is "Dionysus," bringing
the total number of chapters to VI, not V.  Anyone know why?  Was Neil being
paid by the chapter in those days? (I know I should find better things to do
with my time than look for things like this, but hey :-)
     Also, the inside picture of Neil shows him wearing a jacket/vest outfit
with a button near his left shoulder.  Anyone know what's written on the button?

Skip, with regard to your message about an official rarities release, I
have heard both Geddy and Neil say that there isn't anything unreleased.
Geddy said something like "People always think we have these vast
amounts of stuff....we don't have that much stuff, believe me". I can't
remember where I heard this interview. And Neil said (on Rockline, I
believe) something like "The idea of us working that hard on a song and
then to record it and not even release it would just be...absurd!"

I know those aren't exact word-for-word quotes, but I remember hearing
both very well, because I felt then what you're feeling now.... "SH*T!"

I guess that unreleased BY-TOR Part III will never make it to CD, eh? :)

Hey NMSers and baseball fans---

I'm surprised that nothing has been said about the Toronto Blue Jays
making it to the World Series this year.  I'm sure Geddy was there
and cheering like a madman when they came from behind to beat the
Braves Sunday night.  I'm sure I've seen Ged in the stadium during
every wide angle shot---couldn't pinpoint him though!  RATS!!!

Also wanted to mention that I think the guy who said Alex broke a
string at the end of the Overture on ASOH is correct.  Actually, this
is what I've always thought because he uses a black or brown(can't
remember exactly) Signature during the Overture, but then is shown
using a white one during Temples.  This could just be an editing
mistake, but it seems to me that the pause, and subsequent Geddy
smile, occurs because Alex is changing guitars.

That's all----GO JAYS!!!
