just checked mine, and that's correct.  the lyrics to the ``chat''
section are on the page *AFTER* the main lyrics to RTB.  they're right
next to the wall of dice with the bones flying around near the window....

also, I was just looking over other sections of the CD jacket, and have
a question on the inside first page --- the very last line on the page,
after all the credits, etc., reads [quotes are theirs, not mine]:
    ``Now it's dark.''

any idea what this means?

First off, yikes!!!  You guys either have alot of time on your hands
or, or . . I don't know.  But anyway, I can at least describe the
"spaceship" sound at the beginning of CTTH on ESL. Each song was put
on to that album individually and during the Perm Waves tour CTTH
came right on the heels of another song. So, when they put that track
into the mix (and take this from an RTVF student who has f*cked up
many projects) any leftover sound -even a second's worth- would cause
a quite noticable distortion at the beginning of the track.  This
also accounts for the quick/odd beginning of Beneath,between &
behind.  I actually did this once when I was making a bootleg
compilation of my own. I segued from the end of HEmispher's (the
sphere) into The Camera Eye from Signals tour and missed a second - I
ended up wityh the weirdest "synth" sound.  Of course, it went the
way of all flesh - My tape player ate it!  Also, there ARE boots
(good ones, too) with Twilight Zone, Necromancer, Bad Boy,& Fancy
Dancer.  Try to locate, they are good for a laugh, and of course for
historical value.
    If you e-mailed me any requests recently, please send them again!
 I deleted mail in a frenzy and can't get it back.

   Now about the posting I made that never got posted because of it's
content - let me bitch!  I made a post in reply to the wave of posts
that had the members of the band coming down with various fatal
diseases.  It was meant to be FUNNY.  The band jokes about this in
harsher fasion than I did - yet you would not post me, hmm.  Oh, well
thats why you're the manager and I'm not.  But, I thought the part
about Alex having a hysterectomy was pretty funny.   Oh well, no hard
feelings.

I don't believe the answers to my questions are available in the FAQL, so I'll
ask away.  Do any of you have information about interviews of Rush members
which have appeared in various newspapers around Canada and the U.S.?  I have
access to back issues of nearly every semi-large newspaper and would be
interested in finding interviews if I knew in which issues they appeared.
Also, I'm interested in mail lists for Yes, King Crimson, and ELP.  If anyone

A friend of mine got a hold of an 8 track tape in Singapore entitled
"Glam Rock, The Budding Stars". The quality is horrendous but I was surprised
when I saw "Not Fade Away" by "MOON". Curious, I popped it in to my
grandfather's Teac 8 track, and Wow! MOON? It was Rush! Anyway, the song is
pretty short but any dedicated Rush fan would know it's Rush during the first
three seconds: two stokes of some wierd power chord and geddy's shrill voice
jumps in. A very good song indeed - I hope Polygram crystalizes the sound on
Chronicles II if they include NFA.

- Rock on Rush Fans.

The theory that the name ``The Fly'' comes from the line in ``Dreamline''
is certainly very plausible. On the other hand, the cover has a drawing
of a _real_ fly. Now this could be just a joke, or it might indicate that
the name comes from the phrase ``A fly on the wall'' which is used to
indicate someone present for an event who is _not noticed but hears all_.
That seems to me to make perfect sense, and then the fly on the cover is
just an illustration of the metaphor used in the phrase itself.

It's a little known fact, but the protagonist of 2112 was one of Spinal Tap's
early drummers.  He didn't kill himself, the curse of the "Tap Set" did him in.
You can read ALL ABOUT the 2112 story in greater detail in the 2112 Tour Book,
easily available from your local Syrinx FTP site.  'Nuff said.

Rushppl --

   Let's be honest here, does anyone have any solid inscrutable _proof_ that
the main char in 2112 does or doesn't commit suicide in the end?  Like a letter
signed by Neil Peart or something?  For that matter, who ever even said that
this was a tragedy?  But, as Geddy says in the _Chronicles_ liner, that's why
it was time ot "stop the concept stories... invariably sixteen different people
come up to you and tell you sixteen different things about what you're trying
to say."  I'm not tryin' to yell at anyone here, but IMO, _2112_ is just one of
those songs where everyone is gonna have their own opinion, and I doubt anyone
is gonna have a sudden new revelation about it at this point....

   Also.. I wasn't gonna bring this up again, but since jlang mentioned it
today (don't you just love getting referred to by your address? :)   Anyone out
there who is on irc is welcome onto the #p/g! channel.. it usually get occupied
at night, and you'll have to msg someone to get on it (probably)... look
for me (Trroy), or jlang (Rush).. or some other ppl from here (Tvos, Kenobi,
Rocinante, Slythex.. to name a few...), and just ask for an invite.  That is
all... I ain't gonna beg or nothin' :)

<A NAME="537010">Subject: Favorite songs</A>

	I'm a relatively new reader of the NMS, and thought I'd make a post.  I
have talked to a lot of Rush fans and have read a few NMS's, and I SEEM to
notice that when people talk about their favorite songs, they tend to be either
singles or the more well-known pieces.  I for one would list "The Pass",
"Bravado", "The Analog Kid", "Emotion Detector", "Lock and Key", "Kid Gloves",
and "Hand Over Fist" as my personal favorites.  Ok, some of those were singles,
but they never got airplay around here. :)  Anyhow, is there anyone else with
similar tastes?  I'm curious about whether most Rush fans like the more popular
songs or are more like me.  I for one wished they hadn't dropped "The Pass" and
"War Paint" from the set list on the RTB tour.
	I'm going to make a 90 minute mix of post Moving Pictures Rush for a
friend who has heard little newer Rush.  She doesn't like 70's Rush, and she
bought Moving Pictures and thought it was
"ok" (darn return key!)  I'm wondering if anyone out there has any suggestions
of what pieces to put on the tape.  I don't want it to be simply a collection
of Rush's singles from Signals on.  If you have any thoughts e-mail me at
wilsonp@ucsu.colorado.edu.

Fellow Rush fans:

  I have been intrigued by the interpretations about 2112 that I have seen
over the past few issues.  Personally, I thought that

     1) The protagonist did not commit suicide, but...
     2) He caused insurrection, and the priests quelled it

  Other people (notably David Jabson) have come to radically different
interpretations about the end.  I don't know if I'm right or if the
others are correct.  Are there any interview clips or other word from
Peart that gives us a clue to the intended ending?

  Even though the connotations are obvious, I __NEVER__ thought that the
person killed himself, and was kind of shocked to hear others thought so.
Very interesting...

Shouldnt go making a title like that...  Someone such as myself might think
that you know something.
You can order Visions through the backstage club as well.. to the person who
asked...
And as far as who the producer of the next album will be, I think the boys
were very satisfied with both the sound and the production of the last album
with the little amount of time that it took and the overall quality...  My bet
is that we will see a return of Rupert..  except I wouldnt expect another
"spoken word section."  Another instrumental would be nice, but Im not going to
hold my breath...

Anyone have a confirmation on the video release and does anyone know of which
songs had videos made?  As far as I knew, only RTB.   And one more thing,
has anyone seen the Superconductor video?  I was there when they taped it
and my friend said that you can see the back of my head but to this day,
Ive never seen it..  is it good?  I dunno..

<A NAME="537014">Subject: misc. ramblings</A>

I have (what I assume is) a Canadian radio edit of the Spirit of Radio.  The
intro to the song is incredibly short, the solo even shorter.  This was on a
Canadian "greatest hits" compilation of many bands, circa 1981 (K-Tel was the
company, I believe).  I'm not sure if this is rare, but it's not really worth
lisening to, so what's the point?

A few comments on Between the Wheels:
This song is (at least partially) about the Lost generation, a group of
disillusioned writers and poets who emerged to prominence after the first
world war.  "from rockets red glare to brother can you spare another war,
another wasteland, another lost generation"--the meaning is pretty clear.
"from dreams to a bowl of dust"--the dustbowl, a la _The Grapes of Wrath_.

On of the most prominent members of the lost generation was John Dos Passos,
an avowed socialist who pulled a 180 in the 40's and became a free-minds,
free-markets capitalist (good decision).  Two of his books are _The Big
Money_ and _The Grand Design_.

Coincidence?  I think not--although I myself have never heard any interviewer
ask Peart about Dos Passos.  perhaps it's too intellectual for the average
rockline listener. . .

Someone mentioned hearing a lot of voices and stuff near the end of
Closer To The Heart on the Over The Europe CD.  Yeah, I noticed it too.
 And likewise, it scared the hell out of me too the first time!

Also, at the end of Where's My Thing, you can hear, "Nooo one expects

I bought my copy at Sam Goody's.  I do agree that it is poorly written (the

<A NAME="537017">Subject: 2112 vs. We</A>

As a new reader of NMS, I think it to be time to make a contribution of grand
proportion.  Actually this may have no significance whatsoever, but anyway...

With the recent discussion concerning the similarities between 2112 and Anthem
(BTW I have not read Anthem) I remembered a different piece of work that
reminded me of 2112.  Years ago in highschool I read a book called 'We' by
Eugene Zamayaten (sp?).  I vaguely remember the details of it, but for some
reason it reminded me of 2112 and its depressing, furturistic theme.  I
remeber the characters living in a huge dome, dominated by an overbearing
entity and so on and so on... (I probably should have read the book again
before submitting this such that I could be more specific - but that's the
breaks, man).

So if anyone out there has read 'We', and thinks that it does or perhaps
does not resemble 2112, let me know.  I wonder if any of the Rush members
have read it??????????

That's it,

Mart

	I always thought that Alex did it as a joke... Also, I remember
the part where Alex and Neil are talking- that was funny too.. Another
favorite from p/g tour video is when they are playing the weapon and
Alex is lying on his back kicking his legs in the air and wearing 3-D
glass (otherwise, you'd be only seeing in 1/2 D) and count floyd says
'look at that man dancing- he's scary too'.. Does count floyd say
at one part 'legs, however you wear them'.. That is an ongoing joke
with some friends of mine who are into Rush, but we could have gotten
it wrong..

Also, great tidbit Rush-mgr about the hopeful video December.. I've been
waiting to hear something on that...

Hi there.

	This might be extremely wishful thinking...but I wonder what
would happen if someone were to write to the band with the idea of a
rarities tape?  I mean, if someone put together a nice, really
well-written letter explaining that we are a small group of fans that
would like to hear some of the rare material...and is there any way
they could help us out?!  They probably wouldn't do flips over the
idea...but you never know!

	I remember a guy posting a while back saying he knew Alex or
something like that...can you ask HIM about it?!

	The key would be to stress that we don't intend on dogging
them and selling the shit for $$$!

	Lousy idea...probably.

	Another possibility would be checking with radio stations for
masters of old broadcasts...

	I've been looking around the ftp sites that have music files and 
have seen all the Rush bass tabs.  Iwas wondering if anyone has 2112 and/or 
Lakeside park bass tabs.  I would really appreciate if someone would tell 
me what site had them.  Thanks!

<A NAME="537021">Subject:      Covers of Rush songs.</A>

    It was asked if there are any bands (big or small) that did covers
of Rush songs.  The only one I know of is a tribute band called
Freewill.  They only do Rush covers and originals.  They're set up
EXACTLY like Rush.  A guy with black tied back hair and a big nose
sings, plays bass and keyboards, a short guy with blonde stringy
hair plays guitar, and a pensive and astute looking fellow plays
drums.  Both the guitarist and the bass player would occasionally
play bass pedals.  They were phenomenal musicians but I was a little
disappointed with the set, the only complete Rush songs they played
were Limelight, Tom Sawyer, and In the Mood.  The rest of the Rush
coverage was in the form of medleys.  Their original songs were
pretty poor, in the style of HYF but without the subtleties, variety
and lyrical depth (you'd be surprised how little is left).
    I saw them in virginia beach, I don't know how far and away
they tour.  I don't think they have an album, but I remember him
introducing one of their songs as a single, so you can get recorded
stuff from them, I just don't know how.

	Talking about putting songs on a possible "rarities tape" made me
start thinking...

	What songs HAVEN'T Rush played in concert?  I think it would be
interesting to have the set-lists available for viewing (unless they're
already around on the net somewhere...).

	(And no, I won't do the rarities tape!  I'm coordinating the Yes one,
and that's WAY too much for me as it is!  :)

  To all those wondering what "The Fly" comes from.
  When Rush played Hampton, VA on March 8, the night before U2 played at
  the same place.  (Hampton Coliseum) the boot, evidently was made by a
  U2 fan, and if I'm not mistaken, has some U2 songs on the tape as well
  as Rush songs.  (As you can see, I dont' own the boot.)  And as we all
  know "The Fly" was the first song off of "Achtung Baby" (no, really?)

  Just thought I'd end the guessing.

	I just got some sort of music catalog in the mail today and as I was
flipping through it I noticed there is a guitarist named Larry Carlton who
just released an album entitled _Kid Gloves_. I dont know if there's any
connection at all but it just seemed odd since "kid gloves" doesnt seem like
a very common expression. Or is it?

So I guess Geddy and maybe Alex will get to see their Blue Jays play in the
World Series finally. Pretty cool. Maybe we'll see em on tv! :)

Actually Scott, I should correct myself.  While it's true they played
Battlescar with them on the album, I was thinking of a live tape in which
Max Webster played Battlescar before they even recorded it with Rush.  I'm
pretty sure, now come to think of it, it was never really performed live
with both bands, although I keep hearing rumors of how they used to
practice it during soundcheck with Rush.  I don't know if it's
verifiable, anyone else out there know anything about this?

In the last issue, Andy (aacunzo@ccmail.sunysb.edu) ask if anyone knew
what was going on with the voice ramblings on the Over the Europe boot,
during CTTH.  Anyone got any ideas?  Or know what show that is?  The
Geddy "You got all that?" can be heard pretty well.  I guess the bit
about the "Spanish Inquisition" leads me to believe there's a Monty
Python fan among the band eh?

ASOF #5 came out this week for those who care.  Lots of concert reviews
and photos.  If you haven't seen it, give it a try.  Call the ASOF
hotline at 203-693-0506 for more info.  BTW, great back photo there by
Travis Williams (hello Travis!), another NMS contributor to ASOF.

<A NAME="537027">Subject: ATTENTION CLEVELAND AREA RUSH FANS</A>

ok ok....I read the first few posts about Dream Theatre, then lost interest
after it turned into an argument over whether or not they sound like
Rush. I'm sure they are influenced by Rush, since many people on here have
argued for them....but I ignored the last few posts that I could tell were
just more debates on the subject....

Now....an hour ago I was sitting in the Euclid Tavern enjoying a basket
of hot wings and a pitcher of beer with a good friend of mine and I picked up
a Scene magazine, which is a free publication in the Cleveland area that
highlights the local rock and roll scene. I looked at the concert section
and DREAM THEATRE caught my eye....

Well, after seeing the endorsement of them here, I immediately decided I
had to go see these guys play on Saturday. Then, I'm paging through the
mag some more, and there is an article about them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So I start reading....Here are the first two sentences:

"Dream Theatre epitomize progressive rock. Although I dislike comparisons,
this band incorporates elements of such great progessive rock icons as
Rush, the Dixie Dregs, Yes, Kansas and others into a sound all their own."

Well, obviously....I HAVE TO GO SEE THEM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've never heard of Dixie Dregs, but if they are influenced by Rush...that's
enough for me....plus Yes and Kansas....well...I know where I'll be on
Saturday!!!

The purpose of this post is to inform all the Cleveland NMSers that Dream
Theatre will be playing at Flash's on Saturday the 17th!! Tickets are $8
according to the mag....I'm gonna call tomorrow. Anyone who wants to meet
a fellow NMSer there...email me and I'll give ya a call. BTW, Flash's is
an all ages place, so don't worry bout that.

Well, thanks to all who posted the address for the poster.

Hello, fellow Rush fans (even the ones that claim to be Rush fans):

  As I was reading the newer issues, I noticed the anger of the NMS mob about
the issue of old vs. new and some interesting issues that noone would ever
dream of thinking arose in my mind.

  Now, I'd like to present my views in the form of an ananlogy (much like the
way Rush used to with their epics) so that you could understand better, for
those of you that have the capacity for it.  In the following analogy the
following legend is used to clear up things:

  I = The person that hates to talk about the old vs. new
  You = The person that started and/or talked about old vs. new

Here it goes:
******************************************************************************
  I am sick and tired of hearing about this old vs. new.  Thank you the
rush-mgr to put all the discussions at the end of the post.  I really don't
want to hear any more of it.  Better yet why don't we (all the "I"s) just not
allow anymore of these discussions to enter the NMS (utopia), so we can all
have a better enviornment of Rush discussions (combination of utopia,
hypocricy, and total misconception).  I'd like to hear more about the analogy
of 2112, I think that is a better topic (missed the point of 2112, therefore
hypocrit). All of you that talk about old vs. new don't have anything good to
talk about (over-generalization of "I"'s point of view).  You should take your
discussion out of the NMS and to personal E-Mail (why doesn't "I" do the same
for his/her discussions to personal E-Mail, therefore, hypocrit and extremely
selfish).  If we (again all the "I"s) all wanted to talk about old vs. new,
then it'd be alright (at least "I" is consistend with his/her hypocricy).

So we (all the "I"s, priests) the majority decide what is good for the readers
of the NMS (utopia), lets ban all talks of old vs. new (again utopia) by
first, putting the discussions at the end of each issue.  Second, tell them
(all the "You"s) that their discussions are meaningless.  Third, put them
down further.  Fourth, not allow anymore discussions to the the NMS (the
Temple of Syrinx).
******************************************************************************
Sorry for the radical reaction, but isn't that what we all should be?
Shouldn't we all express our opinions most honostly?  Neil, Alex and Geddy
would certainly think so.  I know Neil would.

I hope this analogy made some sense to the "Intelectual Rush Listener
Society" and that the point was at least well taken, open mindedly.

I hope the rush-mgr will let this go through.

	[ Good Grief..let's have a rest at it shall we? Thanks. Also
	  if you feel like responding to this, please send Keivan email.

Goodbye.
