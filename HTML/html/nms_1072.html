I sent my info on the BfB drummers directly to Garrett Young (like he asked

stroking their egos by sending their info. to the whole damn list, I figured
that I might as well do the same.  Here it is:

   Well, you know you're a Rush fan when you use Rush songs on all your radio
promotional commercials, when you use Rush songs for background music on your
radio show, when you play more Rush than anything else on your show, when you
play Rush so much that you make everyone at your radio station hate them even
more, and when you are officially cited as the rush man at your college
station. I've done all of this. People hate Rush so much at my station, that
they won't play them anymore. I am the only one who plays Rush on my radio
station. Sad thing, isn't it?

   Sorry for the marginal Rush content, but this is important to me. I am
considering, considering mind you, quitting my current band due to total
frustration. I am looking to see what kind of response I will get from this
message. Want musicians who are serious. Who can play Rush. Who are also
interested in doing progressive rock original music. Who live in New Jersey.
WHO HAVE TALENT, DAMN IT. I play keyboards and sing. I'm interested in a
bassist, guitarist without the ego, and a drummer who can handle Peart stuff
well, but doesn't think he's God. Puhleeeeease respond if you are interested
and save my musical life. I don't want to have to quit playing and sell all
my equipment and go into a life of computer work. I love music and want to
play, but need musicians with a better attitude and talent. One warning: all
musicians must have cars and must have an open mind toward blind people,
because I am a blind person. But I can play well, been playing for almost 17
years. Again, sorry for the marginal Rush content, but I know that there are
musicians in Rush fans and I didn't know where else to turn. Please respond
to s0067977@hawkmail.monmouth.edu, if only to give some inspiration to a
frustrated keyboard player of the nineties.

YKYARFW,

You've sat for hours with a scientific calculator in your hand
trying to determine "The Speed of Love" and think that
you've come up with the answer.

For me it's 64.2 hbps. (heart beats per second).

Having said that, let's talk about "The Holy Cross of Fire"
that Neil refers to in Double Agent.  There's only one
group that I'm aware of the uses a burning cross on
a regular basis, and I can't say that they are all
that holy. I'm referring to the KKK but I don't think it's
what Neil was talking about.  For those of you who
don't know, the lyrics are as follows: (yea right, like
I really need to tell this group the lyrics)

 - My precious sense of honer
 - Just a shield of rusty wire
 - I hold against the chaos
 - and the cross of Holy Fire
 
What IS the cross of holy fire?

All facts or thought provoking speculation are welcome
either here at "my house"

My first posting to this noble effort:

I have been intrigued by comments about the various stages of Rush's career.
 Points made about the grammy's and Neil's writing becoming commericialized
etc.  I am really curious about people's opinions on the music.  I think
that Neil has been getting stronger and stronger - in fact his lyrics keep
me going through all of the 3:05 songs that sound like Rush are trying to
write a hit (Stick It Out???).  I have been a Rush fan for 14 years and they
have had a major influence on my life.  I am constantly learning from lyrics
and melodies that I have been singing for years but perhaps didn't
understand.  The last 2-3 albums have had some good songs, and mostly great
lyrics, but I don't think they compare to pre-p/g.

Hey all... couldn't resist throwing in a pair of pennies on the topic of
Neil's lyrics and how they've changed over time....

When I think about Neil's lyrics and how they've changed over time, the most
striking difference between "then" and "now" would be that Neil used to
write in a more narrative style and now writes in a more lyrical style.
(These terms are from the study of literature/poetry.)

A work written in the narrative style tells a story. The songs of "then"
told stories (2112, Xanadu, Red Barchetta, etc.), and these stories all had
vivid, sensual (that is could be experienced via the senses) details that
allowed us to be a part of the song. (The image of "sunlight on chrome- a
blur of the landscape" is something we've all seen; "midway harkers calling
try your luck with me" is something we've all heard.) These images are
already imprinted in our senses and Neil is a master at drawing them
out. (For many of us they also elicit an emotional response... to remember
that "barefoot freedom" is a brief remembrance of childhood!) Finally, these
stories are entertaining in their own right. The story of 2112 is complete
with villains, tragedy, irony, a character that develops through the story
and an ambiguous ending!

A work written in the lyrical style expresses feeling or emotion and
(usually) is quite subjective. It doesn't necessarily tell a story. Songs
like Animate or Mystic Rythms (two of my favorite!!) are really a series of
related images (he still educes a sensual connection to his song) that
communicate an idea or feeling. It may be harder or easier to connect with a
song depending on your ability or desire to connect with that idea or
feeling. It seems that each recent album has been connected by a motif: Roll
The Bones, for instance, looked several ways at the same idea of luck vs.
fate vs. self-determination...

There are probably a million theories as to why the change in style and
there is probably a kernel of truth in each. It could be personal, group or
artistic growth/challenge/development. It could be a reflection of the
movement in world literature/art away from the narrative style and towards the
lyrical initiated by French Deconstructionalists 20 years ago. It could be
that Neil bought a notebook with fewer lines per page.

For those of you longing for lyrics of old, my guess is you long for a good
story. For those of you who prefer Roll The Bones, my guess is you've
connected with the feelings therein.

Anyhow, that's how I understand the deal. Hope it's helpful. Write me if
you'd like to communicate further.

By the way, I'm still working on the lit. allusion list.

Peas- Corey H.

<A NAME="1072309">From: "Adam Paul Loch" <lochadam@student.msu.edu></A>

THere has been a thread about people using Rush quotes in their yearbook. I
went one better-the complete lyrics to Red Barchetta! Let me explain...
I went to a small high school(Graduating class: 35), and every Senior gets
their own page to do with what they will. So along with the other stuff I had,
I had all the lyrics to my favorite song. Not bad, eh? Also, on my page, in the
section where I was thanking all my friends, I snuck Geddy Lee in there :) .
Also, my best friend put a quote from Time Stand Still on his page(kind of
appropriate, I would say), and
the year before one of the Seniors had his ticket stub from the RTB tour on his
page. We had a good amount of Rush fans for a small school. Oh yeah, another
story of (almost) concert violence: During the Cp show at The Palace, these
bastards next to me were like drunk or high(maybe both!), and they were like
screaming obnoxiously the whole time, and jumping on each other and giving each
other noogies during different songs. Needless to say, it was beginning to piss
me off. The same best friend mentioned before had to hold me back, eventually I
was able to just block it out and just focus on the show. It wasn't worth
getting kicked out of the show(and possibly arrested) just to hand out a
beatdown to some jerks. Anyhow, I'm rambling...Later...

<A NAME="1072007">Subject: lyric interpretations</A>

Just wanted to jump in on two separate issues involving interpreting
Neil's lyrics...

Keith Smerak describes "The Trees" as a parable about the stronger
oppressing the weaker.  I think it's the exact opposite.  My reading
of the song is that the Maples (the weaker) oppress the Oaks (the
stronger).  That oppression is made possible by the strength in
numbers reflected by the Maples' "union."  In fact, many critics of
Rush have interpreted this song as "union-bashing."  It probably is.
More relevantly, it is one of the clearest statements of Neil's
individualism and is a song that reflects the Rand influence as well.
The productive are always at the mercy of the unproductive in a society
where the unproductive can use an unconstrained state to gang up and
expropriate the productive.

BTW, for the last 5 years I've used lyrics from "The Trees"
juxtaposed against John Lennon's "Imagine" as the basis for an essay
question on my final exam in my Comparative Economic Systems course.

As for Cary Lasher's question about 2112.  I've always interpreted the
ending the first way (the good guys win).  On the assumption that the
song reflects Neil's general optimism, a happy ending is the only way
to make sense of the main character's obvious suicide ("my life blood
spills over") in "Soliloquy."  That suicide is a symbol of how unbear-
able life is under the Federation, and leads to the return of the "men"
of old.  More evidence for that reading... why would the Priests say
they have "assumed" control?  They already *have* control!  It can only
be someone else who *assumes* control, no?  That interpretation is also
consistent with Rand's original story where, near the end, the main
character (who lives) says:  "For the battle they [the men of old] lost
can never be lost.  For that which they died to save can never perish."
This implies the eventual victory of the good guys.  Though Neil has
claimed no conscious link as he was writing, the stories remain close
enough to justify paralleling them this way, IMHO.

Incidentally, I know several people who knew Rand personally when she
was alive.  I have never asked if she was aware of Rush's music.  My
guess is that she wasn't, and if she was, she would have hated it -
at least the music!  In Barbara Branden's biography of Rand "My Life
with Ayn Rand," she has a chapter tracking famous people who have been
influence by Rand, which includes a mention of Neil (as well as Simon
LeBon of Duran Duran, oh well...).

<A NAME="1072008">Subject: My 1st RUSH experience.& RuSH</A>

	I was introduced to RUSH by a friend in high school.  He asked me
if I wanted to go to a RUSH concert with him in Wichita.  I said sure but
didn't let on that I didn't know who RUSH was (Oh the shame).  It wasn't
till the ride down there that I revealed my ignorance by asking.  So what
does RUSH play?  They kinda laughed and put Tom Sawyer on the radio,
which I of course recognized from the radio.  This was during the Power
Windows tour, and Blue Oyster Cult was opening.  After BOC's set I was a
little concerned that I might have wasted my money.  One of my friends
suggested we go down to the floor (Still had General Admission).  To make
a long story short...Some guy dropped a bottle of Grain Alcohol.  And,
you guessed it, someone dropped a cigarette into the pool.  A huge circle
formed around the flame, and my friend and I seized the opportnity.  We
ran through the flames and ended up about fifteen feet from the stage.
So here I am looking at Alex, not knowing who the hell he is, but still
having a hell of a time.
	Since then I have become a RUSH freak.  I've been to five of the
boys concerts since then and I feel IMHO they get better and better.  By
the way no one mentioned that RUSH can be spelled with elemental symbols
also.

    One correction should be made to the post by Chris Pardua about
Bill Bruford's affiliation with Genesis.  Bill played drums for them
during their 1976 tour, but was never considered a band member.  He
does appear on a few random bootlegs, and also on the band's "Three
Sides Live" album, but never worked with them for a studio album.

    Can we put this business about the Rush country album to rest?
It was intended as a joke. . .give it a rest.

    About the musical/play based on 2112.  I love the idea!  I am
heavily involved in theatre (alas, not as a producer, as an actor) and
I think such a show would be an incredible specticle.  Spred the
word, we could have another "Tommy" on our hands here (and if you're
looking for a star. . .).

    One last thing.  I'm amazed with the number of "older" Rush fans.
Many people have expressed that they grew up with the band, yet I
just got into them a mere two years ago (I'm only 19) .  Wow, talk
about staying power.  I laughed when I read a review of the Cp show
in Worcester, MA, where the reviewer said no one in the crowd
was over twenty. . .ha!  Rush has always been (I hate to use this
term) "cutting edge" and their appeal to people in their 40's,
30's 20's, and teens alike is impressive (though I also like The Moody
Blues and Yes, so I guess my tastes do lean towards older bands).
I guess our boys are doing something right. . .

(Oh yeah, one more thing, "Double Agent" is the song that begins
"Where would you rather be. . .anywhere, anywhere but here.")

Ciao!

I had the privelege of meeting Cheryl Renshaw, who is one of the
people behind the Gift shirts. This is about the fourth time that
I have met someone from this forum. I am constantly amazed at the
caliber of the people that I've met. It seems that we not only share
a love of great music, but also place fairly high values on knowledge
and humanity. Every time (well, almost every time) I meet a Rush fan
I instantly feel at ease and love finding out that we have so much
to talk about (even other than Rush).

A hearty thanks to all of those who organized the shirts. I really
like them, and it's good to know that we've raised some money that
will go to a good cause. I just wish that I don't have to keep on
explaining that it's not a Limbaugh shirt ;-)

	Fellow Fans,

I was noticing with the discussion on Neil's lyrics how Rush talks of
their success.  In songs like "Best I Can"  the lyrics say "Rock and roll-in's
a dream, makin millions my dream. Well, I do that a lot.  I'll just give it
a try, won't let good times pass me by...they're all I've got."  Then on
"Limelight" from MP, when Rush was enjoying huge success, such songs as
"Limelight" were written.  Just one of the many themes I have noticed in
Neil's lyrics.  Of course the lyrics say "Living in the limelight, the
universal dream For those who wish to seem..."  Well just some more input
about Neil's lyrics.

Hey Dave:

	I *have* done the Indy/Cincy concert grind! Actually, it was the Indy/
Chicago/Cincy tour. Rush played the three cities during their Power Windows
tour. Marillion was the supporting act all three shows. This was in late March,
1986. At the time, I was still a doctoral student at Purdue University, so it
wasn't any big deal to make the trek. Since I live in Little Rock now, Indy is
about 650 miles away. I did go up with my best friend to see Rush at the Deer
Creek Amphitheatre during the Presto tour, but for the last few tours I've kept
mostly to St. Louis and Dallas. Rush hasn't played Little Rock since 1982. They
still play
(sorry-- butterfingers!) Memphis every other tour, but I missed the last one
because I was in Indiana on business at the time. Who knows, I just might make
it back to Indy or Cincy (or both) on the next tour.

	I've seen Rush in just about every venue imaginable except in a night
club. This would include arenas, amphitheatres, and stadia. I'm kinda partial
to amphitheatres as long as I'm close enough to the stage. Indy, Dallas, and St.
Louis all have excellent amphitheatre facilities.

	On the topic of Tommy Shaw: I have to admit (IMHO) I'm not too fond of
Tommy Shaw as an individual artist, but no one can really deny (and still be
judged as sane) his presence in Styx. That was probably one of the most under-
rated and maligned bands of the 70s. Their early stuff (e.g., "Pieces of Eight")
is excellent, but they may have hastened their own demise by producing that Mr.
Roboto garbage. Just my two-pence contribution.

	Hey everyone-- I'm off to see Page/Plant tonight. Although they could
never be as awesome as they were in Zep, I'm still psyched for it. BTW, although
my loyalty and love for Rush cannot be questioned, to this day the Led Zep show
I saw in 1977 is *still* the most gargantuan spectacle I've ever witnessed!

	Later, dear Rushies!

	Just a few days ago my friend got his personalized licence plates.
i didn't know he was a Rush fan, but his licence plate said "XANADU".  I
asked him and he said It just sounded cool and told me " How dare you

he was one of the untold millions who had never listented to Rush.  So I
played him Xanadu.  He told me that he ahad heard this song and that's
where he got the name.  Unfortunatly he didn't like Rush since and I
quote " The drumming sucks."  Well that really depressed me He also said
you couldn't dance to it. Well to each his own.

This is a response to a message I read in the Thurs March 16th post
of TNMS.  I recently saw a similar ad for those videos, and I was
just as surprised as you were.  Actually, I saw the ad sometime
near Christmas.  I went ahead and ordered the Counterparts video,
feeling that since the only live video I had was ASOH, and that
the lighting and pyrotechnics of the Cp's tour was so awesome, that
this would be one of the best videos to date.  Well, when I finally
got it (6 weeks) I was really disappointed.  The video was taken at
the Fresno show in CA.  The entire thing looked like someone had taken
the video with a camcorder.  It was very very very unprofessional.  In
fact there were many times when there was no sound, and other times when
the video stopped in the middle of a song, and picked up again in some
other song.  A lot of the time you can't even see the stage, and the
sound quality is just plain BAD!  I guess you get the point.  So
basically, I'd wait until they release a professional video recording
of the tour instead of paying $40 for something that is done by some
amature.
	As far as the RTB video goes, that may be much better because
there has been more time for them to put a good video together.  I
have actually considered getting this one, but since my bad experience
with the Cp video, I've been somewhat unsure whether it would be a good
idea or not.  So, I guess that makes two of us who are wondering about
these videos.  If anyone knows anything about the RTB video, we would
appreciate it.  Thanks.

Greetings, fellow RushFans (tm) !

Just a quick note. Everybody seems to know that Steve Smith played
with Journey, but so far no one's noted that he played drums for a
number of instrumental albums for Shrapnel records; most notably
Richie Kotzen, Tony MacAlpine and Vinnie Moore.

Thought I'd be the one to do so...

Oh, and: YKYARFW:

 You recognise notes of a Rush song within a quarter second and SCREAM
 at the person flipping the radio dial to "leave it there!"

 You don't see anything *odd* about referring to movies as Moving Pictures.

 You toss bits of Rush trivia back and forth routinely, and strangers look
 at you oddly.

 The name "John Rutsey" elicits hysterical laughter among you and your friends.

 You can remember nearly every moment of every concert involving The Boys,
 and you discuss the finer points in loud voices with strangers you've just
 met who happen to be wearing Rush shirts.

 Nobody finds it to be blasphemy to refer to three musicians as "Gods".

 You require a moment of silence during the drum solos in "YYZ," the
 keyboard intro to "Subdivisions", the bass solo in "La Villa Strangiato",
 and the guitar solos in several songs.

 You read the NMS!!!

Cheers,

<A NAME="1072017">Subject: opening acts</A>

I've had the good fortune to see Rush twice live (the RTB and Cp tours) and
I've seen two different opening acts.  Primus opened for them the first time
I saw them, and they were excellent.  I think that Les Claypool and "Herb"
Alexander rival Geddy and Neil as far as proficiency and musical talent.
(Primus happens to be one of very few bands whose entire discography is in
my CD collection -- Rush, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, and Pearl Jam are the
others.)  They played for about 40 minutes, and they were almost as good as
Rush at sounding right off the album.  They even played a lick from Finding
My Way (I think) at one point.  They were so good that I blew $30 and a
whole day out in the sun to see them headline Lollapalooza the next year...
For the Cp show, Candlebox opened.  Now, they weren't that bad, but they
were quite a bit too loud IMHO.  (Rush was pretty loud too, but that's OK.
It might have had something to do with the fact that I was sitting
right in front of the speakers :)...)  I got a little tired of the lead
singer taking off a shirt after every song (I don't know if he did this at
other shows, but those of you who were at the Long Island concert will know
what I'm talking about)... altho I thought the Doors cover they did near the
end was pretty cool...
BTW, I saw a post a long long time ago about that particular show, and how
Alex's guitar went out in the middle of Mystic Rhythms, and you thought
someone came up on stage and tried to grab him.  Well those were in fact
guitar techs, fixing his wireless transmitter which i guess failed (battery
ran out or something)... I coudl see this cuz I was off to the side of the
band...
Anyway... enough rambling... for now :)

P.S. for those of you offended by my list of "Rush fillers", watch for my

Bonjour Fellow Rushians!

I'd like to respond to Pete Kims post (NMS # 1067):
>But, did anybody notice that Rush's last 3 studio albums did not go
>platinum?  I'm kinda worried.

I felt the same sense of forboding (sp?) in '92 during the RTB tour.  I had
8th row seats at Cooper Stadium in Cols. Ohio.  Best seats by far I have ever
had at a Rush show!  It was great! I was having a fantastic time, singing
along to all the songs, happy as a clam.  At one point I turned around, and
what I saw astounded me!  The stands were only about  3/4 full!  Empty seats
everywhere!  All the shows I had seen previously had been packed!  I tried
not to think about what that might mean.  I agree with Pete, I could care
less about the general publics opinions of them, but what affect might this
have on the future of the band, or of their tours?  I guess I'm being
 selfish too, I like to think that there will always be new Rush  to look
foreward to!
Someone reassure me!

<A NAME="1072019">Subject: obscure Rush songs</A>

Ok... Here's yet another list, this time sure to offend fewer, if any people.
The category is: favorite obscure Rush songs.  By obscure I mean songs that
aren't heard a lot on the radio, aren't on Chronicles, etc... (BTW hopefully
this will be somewhhat different from the "what songs should have been on
Chronicles but weren't" thread from a while back, in that obviously you can
include songs on this list like Xanadu and Hemispheres and the complete 2112
whereas those were left off the Chronicles CD in the interest of saving
space -- who ever heard of a greatest hits CD with an 18 minute song on it?
:)...)
Anyway.......

1. The Analog Kid -- Signals
I hadn't really ever listened to this one much before the Cp concert (mainly
because I didn't own my own copy of Signals until this summer), but I love it
now.  It really grooves, and the sudden slow-down into the keyboard segment
is very well arranged/performed/pulled off/whatever... :)

2. Marathon -- Power Windows
I call this one obscure cuz I've never heard it on the radio, and I actually
got into this song first on ASOH.  I really like the bass line, and i love
the part at the end where they raise the chorus a step and sing it again...

3. Mission -- Hold Your Fire
This was another ASOH convert... I like the keyboard intro (simple yet
pleasing -- if there was anything else besides the keyboard and Geddy's voice,
it wouldn't be right), and I love the synchronized snare/xylophone/bass part
in the middle.  I think the guitar solo at the end is one of the best solos
Alex has ever done, and it's a shame that it fades out on the album...

4. Witch Hunt -- Moving Pictures
Well I'm not sure how "obscure" this one is (I actually like all the ones in
the Fear trilogy, but this is my favorite), but I really like the intro and
the vocals... I think this is the first song (chronologically) where Geddy
really sounds comfortable singing entirely in his lower range, imho...

5. Beneath, Between, and Behind -- Fly By Night
Ok, I admit it, I have heard the ESL version of this way more than the FBN
version, but I like both.  It's just a neat little song.

6. Double Agent -- Counterparts
I list this one as "obscure" cuz it wasn't released as a single.  I love the
spoken part over the 9/8 musical figure (it's probably not 9/8, but it has that
feel... 3 subdivided into triplets for you musical types), as well as the vocal
harmonies (but I like the harmonies on the whole album)...

7. Natural Science -- Permanent Waves
I like this one because of the middle section... it really grooves...
"Wheels within wheels in a spiral array, a pattern so grand and complex..."
I believe that section is called "Hyperspace" in the liner notes.

8. Twilight Zone -- 2112
I'm not sure why I like this song... maybe it's the chorus?

9. Where's My Thing -- RTB
Yes, I know this was one of the songs that showed up as "filler" on my last
list... but that doesn't mean I don't like it.  It grooves really well (I know
I use that term a lot, but i like songs that have a strong rhythmic feel to
them)... I like the funky feel it evokes.  And I guess it's unfair to call it
a filler -- i kinda fudged it so the comment following it would fit...
As a side note, I realize that some of those comments may have been in
somewhat poor taste... they seemed funny to me at the time but I apologize if
they offended anyone...
That being said.....

10. Circumstances -- Hemispheres

I like the somwhat complex rhythmic arrangement of this song... it's really a
pretty tight song, and I like the lyrics too... especially the french bit...
"Plus ca change... plus c'est la meme chose..."

11. Available Light -- Presto
I just love the vocals in this song.  What else can be said?  i'm sure if I
had any crystal glasses, they'd shatter whenever i play this song :)...

Comments?  Thoughts?  Your fav "obscure" songs?  Flames?? (altho I don't know
why people would want to flame THIS one :)...)
BTW, I left out songs like Xanadu and Cygnus X-1 and 2112 for reasons... I
believe that had they been shorter, they very well might have been included on
CHronicles, and that didn't stop them from chopping 2112 in half and putting
part of it on, anyway :)...

I don't consider them to be obscure :)

Anyway, enough for now...

<A NAME="1072020">Subject: Ed Schreiner's postings</A>

If you are referring to my earlier remarks about the first album, you
will recall that I did NOT say that the first album didn't sound like/
wasn't influenced by Led Zeppelin, rather, that the album sounds MORE
like the work of Budgie in the early to mid '70s. It seems to me that
this sound was a common motif among many bands during this time,
particularly those on the British blues bandwagon (which includes Led
Zep, Budgie, Cream, and our own beloved Rush).

I personally do not feel that "Anthem" sounds too much like Led Zeppelin.
My own theory is that people compare all loud rock from this time period
to Led Zep because they happen to be the best-known example. While Led
Zeppelin were certainly groundbreaking, I still prefer Rush, Budgie or
the Who.

As far as bands who go country, I would have to say the even Led Zeppelin
do not have the market cornered on this. "Act Naturally" and "What Goes
On" by the Beatles are definitely country songs, as are quite a few
albums by the Byrds, before Led Zep even existed. In fact,
country-influenced rock and roll is nothing new at all, what with rock
springing as it does from the fusion of rockabilly (fast country w/
drums) and 50's rhythm and blues.

I think that if Rush put out a country album, song, or whatever (though I
doubt this will happen outside the fictional postings on this list), it
would be a good album, because the members of Rush are craftsmen,
dedicated to perfection in their musical endeavors. Who knows... if it
were to happen, we would all buy it (new Rush album, after all) and we
may even be converted.

Hey, y'all!

My  many thanx to Michael Kubik, fellow compuserve dude who turned me on to this
list!

It's been a kick reading what you all have been writing lately.  It's done alot
to rekindle my passion for Rush, which my life has been sorely lacking these
days.  I've recently moved from Phoenix to Colorado Springs, leaving all my
stuff (including my stereo *and* complete Rush CD collection) in storage over
800 miles away until I can save up the $$$ to go get it. Until then, my only
entertainment (and my only furniture, for that matter) is my computer and a
working phone line... and YOU guys/gals!

And entertain me you have!  In many ways... *not* the least of which is this
krap about a country album.  I hadn't even heard that rumour until getting my
first TNMS list, but I still knew right away that it was a joke... it had to be!
Whoever mentioned it first must have been joking... and if the boys ever put out
any country music, it too would surely, simply be a joke!  I'm not sure what was
funnier... the c&w song title satires, or the fact that some really fell for it.
You suspend your disbelief, and you are misinformed!

Anyhow... it's gonna be alot of fun getting to know so many Rush fans, and to
have a forum on which to tell my own stories, and to expound on my own love for
their music.  My problem is, though, my entire cyberlife has been spent in the
sheltered confines of commercial services, and I know little about poking around
the 'net to look for Rush files/gifs/articles/etc. The fact that the keepers of
this list have had to change the server name/address threw me for a loop, and
all the mail requests I've sent to the server are bouncing back to me. Obviously
I've mistyped something... any help, rush-mgr??  I haven't even been able to get
a copy of the FAQ, so I won't ask any questions until I get it... don't want to
bore you all!  Any help you want to send my way, though (how to get Rush stuff
on the 'net) would be appreciated. I'm getting a SLIP account next week... at
last!

One thing, though... did anyone else out there attend the Power Windows tour in
Phoenix around the first of March, 1986?  My buddies here doubt my story about
the big-busted woman in the gold sequined dress, and I could use some
confirmation!  :)

 ...just another rational romantic mystic cynical idealist...

Yes, here is yet another first poster.

So, some information about me.  I am 36 years old, married for 17 years to my
high school sweetheart and have a 15 year old daughter.  Devote Rush fan
since 2112 or in earth years, 1976. My family and I have been to seven concerts
in three States.

Most everything I have seen here on the NMS is very positive towards the band.
However I feel the need to comment on the Candlebox flame from the person that
saw them open for the band. Originally when my daughter began listening to them
I did not like them either, but after listening to the one CD they have release
over and over (I was experiencing Rush burnout which is possible after 19 years
of devotion -- sorry) again the band grew on me.  Then when we attended the
Atlanta Rush concert and they opened, it was very good.  Then a few months
ago Metallica (yes Metallica) Candlebox opened again and again they were great.

The moral of the story is just because they are not Rush, don't flame talented
musicians even if you don't like the music.  BTW I have since recovered from
the burnout and am back to listening to the only truely original band I have
ever heard - Rush of course.

Also recently added to my complete collection of all vinyl, CD and Video tape -
the UltraII Gold version of MP and laserdisc of Chronicles and both are very
good.  Soon, the Grace Under Pressure Tour laserdisc and Signals UltraII disc.

Keep up the good work.

Hello all you Rush Fans,

	The other day I was helping my daughter with a report she had to
do on the history of Ohio. We were looking on a map of Ohio and what did
I find but a small city called Rushsylvaina. And if this was not enough
it sits on the shores of a small river called Rush River. This is not a
joke you can check it out yourselves. If you draw a line between
Columbus and Lima Ohio and about half way between them you will find the
town.

	Anyway think of the posibilities, If we all moved there we would
have a town devoted to Rush. This would solve the problem of no Rush on
the radio. We would undoubtedly get a visit from Rush on every tour. Oh
the posibilities are just endless.

	Well I guess that means that I am a true Rush fanatic, just for
coming up with the idea. Well you may send your comments here or to my
e-mail address your choice.

   All right, someone has really pissed me off.

   To that nonmusician, nonmusic loving ignorant fool who decided that the
keyboard era of Rush was "wuss music", I have one thing to say, or maybe it
is a few. How many other keyboard players have flamed your narrow-minded ass?
I am taking this to TNMS becuse I have this problem with people who compain
about the synthesizers and sequencers that Rush uses. First of all, I know
very few people, myself included that can even come close to matching Geddy's
work. The man has to play a bass and keyboards at the same time. I doubt you
could do that. Be thankful I don't remember your name.

   As a synthesizer player of almost 17 years, I am personally offended. In
an age of rock where everyone has forsaken keyboard players, I feel like I've
just been smacked in the face. A synthesizer is an instrument too, one that
can sound just as rich and aggressive as a guitar, bass or drums, depending
on who plays it and how he uses his gear. I am really tired of keyboard
bashers. Why don't you open your mind a little? Or are you too busy banging
your head against the wall from all your thrashing guitar music to understand
what I am saying? Maybe it is braind damage from moshing too much.

  Yes, I am mad. You picked a bad time in my life to say that. All that music
may sound like "wuss music", but I highly doubt that you could ever come
close to producing it, or any music for that matter. So, if you could do
better, why not get off your butt and do it. SHOW ME, DON'T TELL ME, BOY.

THe show I saw, Alex was still using primarily his PRS (Paul Reed Smith)
guitars... the only exceptions I noticed were Stick It Out when he used a
70's Les Paul, and on Xanadu where he brought out the ol' Gibson double-neck
that he used back in the 70's... (the original prototype of that guitar was
designed and constructed for Jimmy Page, so he culd play Stairway to Heaven
live without switching guitars four times)

Hey folks...

Since it appears that the band won't be on the road for awhile,
we are looking for information on cover bands, primarily in the
Detroit area, but also in Lansing, MI, Flint, MI or Toledo, OH
areas.  I've seen cover bands discussed out of the east coast,
Chicago and Cleveland, but was looking for Michigan.  If anyone
has any info., it would be appreciated via TNMS or email me at
ak385@detroit.freenet.org  OR  gragazzo@k12.dserv.com

Peace and happiness...Ginny

number is (416)535-0613.

Have fun...Ginny

Here's a pretty good list with which you can truly determine if you are
worhty of 'fan' status.  Also, I took some from other messages so I'm
giving them credit here [SPACE FOR RENT].
You know you're a Rush fan when...
 - You have all the albums but still check CD stores to make sure they're
   well-stocked
 - You celebrate Bastille Day even though you don't care about France
 - You like the Blue Jays because Rush is from Toronto
 - You refer to Canada as 'The Holy Land'
 - You buy the new gold discs because you can't stand not having an album
 - You spend your free time memorizing Rush liner notes
 - You tape and compile Rush interviews and collect periodicals with Rush on
    the cover
 - You refer to non-Rush fans as atheists
 - You started a fund to buy a Red Barchetta
 - You travelled to Thailand to visit Bangkok
 - You call the Rush FTP site for lyrics you already know by memory
 - You asked for your ashes to be spread across Lakeside Park
 - You sing Rush songs to your children instead of lullabies
 - You changed your last name to Zivojinovic
 - You watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 because Geddy Lee has a MST 3000
    lunchbox
 - You read the unabridged 'Don Quixote' because his horse is called Rocinante
 - You named your first boy Geddy
 - You got a license plate that reads 'Syrinx'
 - You can't see through your rear window because of the Rush decals on it
 - You celebrate May 24th even though you don't know what the real holiday is
 - You cut down all the trees in your back yard to stop them from fighting
 - You listen to Rush Limbaugh because his first name is 'Rush'
 - You built a Rush shrine in your room
 - You listen to bare minimum of 2 hours of Rush a day
 - You watched the Grammies to hope to get a glimpse of a Rush member
 - You watched Primus's opening act to make sure that you didn't miss any Rush
 - You spend time making lists like 'You know you're a Rush fan when...'
sorry that its so long, but I figured you guys'd enjoy it.

Rush fans-
	This is the first time I have posted on the NMS- I am a student
from UCSB.  Anyway, I have a few flames to throw and what I believe to be
some somewhat interesting information.  Firstly, some moron obviously
accidentally mentioned "Def Lepppard" (spelling?-who cares) in the same
sentence as Rush- I believe his name was Andy.  I believe that Rush's
albums have changed significantly and I may not even be as fond of the
newer stuff as well, but lets not got to extremes.  Also, as far as I
know from a friend of mine who's a hard-core fan, Neal got his drumming
ability partially due to a Ph.D. in percussions @ some Michigan school.
I may be totally wrong about this so be sure to let me know if I am.  I
also heard that there is a school in Washington that offers a course on
Neal's lyrics- if anybody knows about this fill me in.  Also somebody
said Presto was the best Rush album- what?

Hello fellow Rushians! Hope everyone's doing well! I have quite a few things
to ask and discuss, so I'll do it in parts, this being the first.
First thing (this is a low-flame), I hope you're all not going to run this
periodic table name thing into the ground like the C&W album spoof.
It's okay for a couple of issues, but please! BTW, got to thinking
about the C&W thing, and thought, you know, what if they DID make
a country album? Don't you know it'd be the best damn country
album ever made? I know I'd buy one! Hell, Rush could make an
album of Indian snake charming music for all I care! I'd still buy one!
Don't you know it'd be the best damn Indian snake...(well, you know!)
Anyvay, I've got some interesting (or not so) things to discuss here
(been savin' 'em for a while):
1) I've never seen or heard any official word about this so this just my
idea (don't even know if it's already been discussed here). Regarding
the song "Twilight Zone" from 2112. I'm almost certain that the song
is based on two actual TW episodes. I'm pretty certain because I've
seen them both! I went back to a book I have called "The Twilight
Zone Companion" that describes each episode. The verse about the
'pleasant faced man' with 'three eyes' was taken from an episode
called "Will The Real Martian Please Stand Up", and the verse about
'you wake up lost in empty town...giant boy...' was taken from an
episode called "Stopover In A Quiet Town". I can describe the
episodes if anyone's interested. The verses are very short summaries
of the actual episodes, and the only thing that's different is that the
'giant boy' is a girl (a giant alien) in the real episode. I don't remember
now if I saw the episodes after hearing the song or the other way
around, but whaddya think? Cool, huh? Has anyone else seen these
episodes? I used to watch TZ faithfully everynight during high school.

2) Don't know how many of you were/are Living Colour fans. I was
sad to hear of their breakup. Shoulda known something was amiss
when Corey Glover started to doing a VJ stint on VH1. Anyhoo, I read
in Spin magazine a few years back about LC being spotted visiting
with the Boyz after one of Rush's concerts. I know for sure the
drummer Will Calhoun was a fan. When I lived in Houston, LC came
through and appeared at a record store to sign autographs. I went to
get my Guitar Player magazine cover signed by Vernon Reid, and
was wearing my HYF tour shirt. When I stepped up to the table Will
Calhoun looked at my shirt and said, "Great album!" I was kinda
stupified, so I just mumbled something like, "Uh..yeah." DOH! If there
hadn't been a long line of people behind me, and I had taken my brain
with me that day maybe I could've talked to him about Rush. Oh well.
I wish had that Spin article, it was cool, it was about how some
newer bands nowadays are citing Rush as an influence. It was quite
a surprise seeing Rush in Spin since it's always been (and still is) an
'alternative' magazine.

3) I'll end this first long note by telling you about a trip I made to a
local record store here in Little Rock, AR. I moved here from Houston
about a year ago. Not happy about the rock scene here, but anyway.
There's a couple of good stores here. One called "Been Around
Records" and the other is "Dark Star". "Dark Star" is just almost exclusively
a boot store. Just got my first Rush boot from there,
called "A Right To Passage", Pink Pop Festival, Holland, '79. It's
awesome!!! The store "Been Around" sells used vinyl, tapes and cds.
I happened to skim their Rush vinyl section and whoa! Found some
goody-goody fun stuff! I scored the Hemispheres picture disc; a promotional
12-inch disc of TSOR on side A and The Trees and
Working Man on side B., cover says "Not For Sale"; a 12-inch single
of Subdivisions/side A, Red Bar. and Jacob's Ladder on side B, it's on
Mercury's English label Phonogram; and finally found the Bob & Doug McKenzie
album (missed it originally). YESS!!! All these appear to be in good
condition, however I haven't heard them yet, as my defunct turntable sits
next to my defunct VCR. Sigh....

Sorry for long-wind-baggedness. I've probably got one or two more of these
long posts to do, then I promise any future posts will be nice & short.
E-mail, flame me if you wish.
