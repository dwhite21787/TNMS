What ever happened to the "Superconductor" video?  If anybody has it on tape,
I'm sure we can come up with some mutually agreeable swap...

	Has anyone read ``Anthem'' by Ayn Rand ?  _2112_ is supposed
to be inspired by it, so it should be worth reading. I have read
``The Fountainhead'' and ``Atlas Shrugged'' and wasn't very impressed.
The books seem to propound a convoluted jumble of individualism,
self-fulfillment, objectivity and capitalism. As I understand it,
Ayn Rand emigrated from Russia around the time of the Russian Revolution
(she was a kid) and this personal experience shaped her philosophy. Hardly
objective as she took an unrelentingly anti Left stance ever since.
I liked some of her stuff but I think she was the most insensitive
philosopher ever.

	I find Neil's stuff (after _2112_) to be much more sensitive and
sophisticated. In fact Ayn Rand would have strongly disapproved of songs
like ``Subdivisions'', ``Territories'', ``Time Stand Still'', ``Distant
Early Warning'' and ``Between the Wheels''. Apparently, she upheld the
right of an individual to form his/her own opinion except if it was
different from her own.

        Greetings RUSHans -

Ok, I have a proposal to the entire list.  I'm probably starting an
uncontrollable chain reaction here, but here goes.  My question is:

                What were each of the Boyz' BEST albums?

Personally, I happen to think that Alex's best is _Signals_.  I just think he
does an excellent job on it.  As for the other two, well, it took me a week to
come up with Alex's best.  Gimmie some time for the rest! ;)

As for my favorite Rush song?  Hmmmmm.  That would be a toss-up between "The
Analog Kid" or "The Pass."  TAK's sound just jives me this great feeling about
life and love.  It also fits me since as in the story, I want to leave home.
And I WILL be in less than two weeks!  What a coinkeedink, eh ;)

"The Pass" is simply just such a sad song.  As I have had to talk two people
out of suicide, it has a certain amount of nostalgia for me.  The last verse:

                        "No hero in your tragedy
                         No daring in your escape
                         No salutes for your surrender
                         Nothing noble in your fate
                         Christ, what have you done?"

The "Christ, what have you done" just hits me in the gut like a sledgehammer.
It is simply THE best song on _Presto_, and close to their best song ever!

Any discussion is welcome (and encouraged! :)  See you on Olympus (guess the
reference)

I didn't mean to offend anybody by my "visitation report" the other day.  I just
passed on Neil's reaction to our bantering on about his watch.  Personally, I
don't give a damn what his watch says, but I respect other people's right to
care.  If I thought that this list was a waste of time, I'd not be reading and
posting to it!  Its a great communication forum for people with incredibly good
taste in music.

As anybody who reads notes knows: you gotta be real good at filtering out what
you consider "noise on the line".  Its very subjective.  Neil mistakingly got
the impression that some of us sit around for hours contemplating every post to
the digest.  That was my fault.  I don't think most of us do.  Besides, what we
do with our time is OUR business, not his.  What bugs him (and me too) is when
people invade his privacy, worship and idolize him.

I didn't mean to make anybody ashamed of posting to the digest.  I like to hear
how people enjoyed concerts, what songs they like, what Neil's lyrics mean to
them, even the 57 different hidden meanings in the Hold Your Fire cover.  Its
up to me (and a little, my manager) to decide when I'm wasting my time.  I've
got a life, Neil's got his, and even poor souls trapped in Silicon Valley like
Bob have theirs.

Okay... since I don't have a life, I went home last night and studied the
picture on the HYF sleeve.  Here's what I found, although I'm pretty sure a
lot of you have already discovered them!

1.  "Grace Under Pressure" is represented by that hazy image on the side of
     the building. (left side, in the alleyway, right under the streetlight)
2.  The window right next to the "15" has a picture of the puppet on "A
    Farewell To Kings".
3.  The man who is juggling the balls is also the man on "Hemispheres",
    naturally a bit older of course.
4.  There's some sort of weird image behind the fence near the fire hydrant
    which I think looks kinda like "Caress of Steel".
5.  Someone mentioned the lightpost representing "Fly By Night"... I thought
    the hubcap on the car looked like the owl, but I can't quite make it out
    since I'm looking at the CD sleeve.
6.  What does the cat symbolize?
7.  Why is there a picture of the Statue of Liberty on the third floor?
