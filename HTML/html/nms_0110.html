I'm just wondering if for any other(than Omaha) shows,
two Giant(15' or so) Bunnies dropped from the lights during the
Presto part of the show and started "dancing" with the help
of some of the roadies? Or was this a freak occurence? We
didn't get the roadies in bunny costumes--Mr Big came onstage
during In The Mood. There was this cute little guitar duel
between Alex and the guitar player(I forgot his name--again).
You figure out who got more applause.

As far as covers go;
Primus plays the opening minute of YYZ on one of their songs--I
believe it's a live track. It was a shame though--I thought it was
some rare live stuff for a minute!

On last thing; Has anyone heard of a single that Rush put out
between HYF and Presto? I heard about it from a quasi-
reliable source this weekend. Or how about a "Rush Through
Time" picture disc. For that matter, what Picture Disc's
are available? I only know of Hemispheres and HYF(the juggling
guy.)

	Just thought any NYCers would like to know, I live in Greenwich
Vilage and when I came home for Thanksgiving vacation, I was able to pick up
the Chronicles video for $18.34 (includes tax). That's the best I've heard so
far anywhere in the area. By the way, that pathetic excuse for a music store
didn't have any RUSH albums past AFtK. I was looking to pick up Power Windows,
and they didn't have any.

	I saw a question about where the boyz are now. Well, I heard a rumor
that Neil and Alex are on a rock-climbing tour of Utah (they brought the
instruments, of course), and I could have sworn that I saw Geddy working in
Pizzera Uno on Fifth Avenue. Anyone else hear anything?

P.S. After watching the Chronicles video, I was semi-upset that half of it was
	concert video. Also, someone commented that the Time Stand Still video
	was "someone going crazy with a blue screen." I said that this was done
	to emphasize that nothing in the video would "stand still". Any other
	interpretations of the song/video?

   Just a quick little posting.. As far as the difference between a regular
pentacle and an inverted one (achieved by rotating a normal one just a *few*
degrees), here's the classical reason for the change in significance.  The
regular pentacle supposedly represents the four elemental forces supporting
and being the foundation for the spirit, making the spirit the more important
of things.  The inverted ones make the material more important than the
spirit.
   Sorry for the tangent, just a few ramblings...

<A NAME="110005">Subject: Triggered vocals and _The Body Electric_</A>

I admit I have not kept up to date on the Midnight Star, but I've read the
discussion you've had about the pedals that Alex uses. If you have the
_Chronicles_ video, you will see that in some of the songs recorded live,
Alex uses the pedals. You will also notice that when he does, no vocals are
triggered. In fact, what is triggered, is background bass chords and various
effects. I think this should settle the argument completely.

I did enjoy the video extremely. Seeing the three in their earliest recordings
(Closer to the Heart, and The Trees) was somewhat amusing (Hair, cloths, and
all).

You've probably already noted about this, but the song _The Body Electric_ is
based on G.Lucas's first film: THX-1138. In fact, the video for the song
uses clips from the movie. It is possible that this is not the name of
the song, as the tape I have (_Grace Under Pressure_) is printed incorrectly (t
e names are in the wrong order). So, the "1001001" is directly from the movie,
and that is why it is in the song.

Hi-

I just purchased the Chronicles video at Tower records for $16.99. The audio
quality is fairly poor. I have a decent 4-head hi-fi VCR and when I listen
through my stereo system, there are several instances of strange hissing and
popping sounds. I would rather have paid the usual $25-$30 for the video and
have good sound quality. Even considering the poor quality, I still enjoyed
Chronicles, especially the older ones - Closer to the Heart and Trees. Does
anyone know the circumstances of the filming of these two? I assume that they
were for some kind of promo.

Greetings (burp!) good to be back at school.  To jump on the bandwagon,
I am a Political Science major and a Journalism minor here at the
University of Delaware, in Newark (pronounced New-ark, not Newerk (NJ))

Pretty cool interview with Mr. Lifeson last week...good to hear about
the next album! BTW, was the awards ceremony broadcast on TV at all
(MuchMusic,MTV,local cable?) If so, I wouls be interested in obtaininbg
a copy.  Please e-mail me with info!

Browsing through the local newsstand, the latest copy of 'Q,' the British
music magazine gave the 'Chronicles' CD three stars out of five (or four)
I'm not sure.  Also, the year-end 'Rolling Stone' issue has an column
about boxed sets and compilations, and mentions 'Chronicles' as one
of the better greatest hits albums to be recently released.

If anyone else has a 'brush with Rush' experience to share, please do
so.  I think it's neat to hear these types of stories.

Requested the new Noteworthy Music CD catalog today...most Rush discs
are sold for $8.94 (w/o shipping) Good deal...just in time for the
holiday season.

That should cover it for now...

 Yep, I've seen ads for Tower Records that advertise Chronicles LaserDisc
for about $25.00 (no, NOT the CD, but the music video compilation) As for
whether you can find it, oh well.

 Also, I recall Neil saying (I think it was in a Backstage Club newsletter)
that although his is a admirer of John Dos Passos' work, his lyrics
to Big Money and the other-one-which-I-can't -remember-right-now-song
have NOTHING to do with the novels.

I'm shocked (ZAP) to hear about the supposed rap version of "Tom Sawyer."
Some people may have no objection to it, but I personally find it foolish
and usually stupid: look at "Ice Ice Baby".  Tell me that's not a *poor* tune.

IMHO, sampling of music in most forms degrades the purpose of music itself:
to _create_ an art form.  (Granted, you might not agree with me on my defin-
ition of its purpose, but oh well.)  Sampling merely takes someone else's work
and makes it into something that is (ostensibly) yours.  As an objectivist I
find this reprehensible. No one should have to stoop to this level.

Well, folks, there's some food for thought.  Toss that around for a while.

<A NAME="110010">Subject: A few observations on live performances.</A>

Hello fellow Rush-heads..  just a few thoughts that came to mind about live
performances:

First, has anyone else noticed on the "A Show Of Hands" video that during
the Overture to 2112, Alex's guitar has the miraculous ability to change
colors from black to white at different camera angles?  :-) :-)  I just
noticed that while watching it the other day and thought it was kinda funny..
Probably has something to do with him breaking a string on his white
Signature during Tom Sawyer, switching to a black one for 2112, and the
film editors mixing footage from two or more consecutive performances, so
some shots were of the night he broke a string and some were of a night he
didn't and kept using the white one.

Anyway..  something else, concerning live versions of "In The Mood".. during
the chorus, has anyone noticed that during each tour they change it a bit?
The part that goes "Hey baby, it's a quarter to eight"..  on ESL it's "Hey
cookie..." and on p/g and ASOH it's something else (can't quite make it out)
and I was listening for what they'd say when I saw them on the Presto tour
and couldn't understand it then but my friend said it was "hey woman..."
Anyone know what word they've used on what tours, just out of odd curiosity?

Can't wait for the new album..  February or June?  I've heard both, anyone
know for sure?  (hopefully February, but if they are just in the WRITING
stages right now, it'll probably be June..  sigh)

P.S. oh yeah, just thought of something else: those of you talking about
the Family Channel satanism thing - "Anthem" isn't on ANY Rush videotape.
There isn't much old stuff on the p/g video, and I really can't imagine
what they'd possibly pick out as satanic (well, the whole idea is a laugh
to begin with but that's beside the point)..  maybe they should have
looked at "Witch Hunt" a bit - it sounds like they are the kind of people
perhaps that Neil was talking about in that song, ya know?

I don't mean to be insulting to anyone, but I HATE being asked to name my
favorite <anything>.  My favorite band is Rush -- I have no question about
that -- but if asked to name my 3 most favorite bands I have trouble
deciding between Yes, Jethro Tull, Kansas, Styx, R.E.M., etc.  If you ask
me to name my favorite album or albums by any of these groups, I just can't
do it.	I could maybe name my *least* favorite, but that would leave the
majority as favorites...

So far I've restrained myself from singing the original lyrics to any of
these rap rip-offs out loud in public when I hear them.  If or when I hear
anything ripping off Tom Sawyer, this may change!

For what it's worth, I've heard the same story about the origin of the
pentagram.  I've also heard that an inverted pentagram is a Satanic symbol
because it resembles the head of a goat.  But I don't know whether it's
true.  The story I believe in is that the five points stand for the four
elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) and Spirit.  Thus a pentagram is a
symbol of *anything* magickal.	Witches, of course, practice white magick
(not black) and don't even believe in Satan.

As for backwards masking, the human mind will definitely create signal out
of noise.  It works for light as well as sound -- for example, if you want
to see JFK getting shot by his driver in the Zapruder film, you will!
(Yes, this is an actual conspiracy theory; and no, I don't believe it for a
second.)

Incidentally, sometimes I find that the more I listen to an alleged
backwards recording, the *less* I can hear the alleged words.  I can barely
hear anything in "Another One Bites The Dust" anymore.  It just starts to
sound like random syllables -- which is what it is.
