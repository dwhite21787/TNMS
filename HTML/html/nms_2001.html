I would like to hear about the most influential Rush lyric from you
guys. It seems to me that one song or line in a song sends each of us a
shot of lightning and from then on we are hooked forever. I'll go first.
The line that really caught me was from Subdivisions......"Some will
sell their dreams for small desires or lose the race to rats,Get caught
in ticking traps and start to dream of somewhere to relax their restless
flight" When I heard that line I became so inspire to not waste my life
and make something of it. I'm human and still working on that
part..........................

You deserve a freakin' Medal of Honor, man... the "agression will not
stand" post was nothing short of brilliant.

I don't know if it's coincidence or not (gotta love the Holy Bitch) but
it seems like every anti-KAR-vs-SecSoc post is sandwiched in between two
KAR listings.

I do fear that KAR may have to go underground one day soon... I'd hate
for some bullshit wannabe fan to misinterpret our attempts at humor, and
actually bump into Neil one day...  GOD that would suck..!  He'd retire
for sure.

<A NAME="2001007">Subject: Victor II/contracts/various comments</A>

Hi gang -- 

I finally got my message from the One!  ^Brown cow now how!^ 

o Victor II -- welp, I'm glad Alex is starting work on Victor again.
	I'm sure we'll be seeing more of Bill Bell (pookey), also.
	I wonder if he'll use Edwin again, or ask Sebastian Bach to
	do the lead vocals, since he did them for the demos.  Will he
	have another pre-determined theme again?  Will he be
	encumbered by effects?  Will Dalbello make another appearance?
	Will Adrian steal his father's work and release his own solo
	lp named 'Hugo'?  Will he include the recipes for the drinks
	this time around???  8^)

Actually, Alex's return to Victor and Geddy's project search, to me,
indicates their own restlessness and uncertainty about Rush's future.
Obviously one cannot gauge when Neil will feel up to working again. 
And since they have a seemingly large block of time of Rush
inactivity, it seems logical to go *do* something.  I have no doubt
we'll see another studio album -- it's more a case of WHEN, not IF. 
 
[ And of course, much bowing and scraping to the Holy Bitch for
providing us with the info.  :) ]  

o  Which brings up Point Numero deux -- from the info. Bob Roper (he
	of SRO/Anthem) had mentioned when Cp came out, Rush's contract
	with Atlantic called for a 3-lp deal, starting with the next
	album -- that being _Test for Echo_.  Does anyone know if this
	live set completes the 2nd lp for that contract??? 

o I saw a poster advert on a storefront window the other day that
	read: JOHN GALT corporation.  I wondered if I should call and
	ask, 'Who is John Galt?'  8^)  

o Was not Manu Katche supposed to be on the Burning For Buddy disks???

o Ok, real fast, my list of drummers:
	* Manu Katche -- sensitive, complex, feel, beautiful to listen to.
	* Neil -- power, complex, energetic
	* Mark Brzezicki -- Manu and Neil in one...
	* Phil Collins -- GREAT dynamics.  Neil could learn from that.
	* Russ Kunkel -- Feel and sound, funky-ish, to me
	* Steve Gadd -- feel, grace, complex, memorable arrangements
	* Chad Gracey -- simple, but tasteful
	* Richie Hayward -- damned if I can figure out what he's doing
	* Copeland, Morgenstien, Alan White, Smitty, etc.... (sigh)

ok, time for bed.....  *yawn*  *stretch* 

Ho-hoo!

First - 

The Ayn Rand reference on the Oscars was in the category of 
Documentary.  One of the nominees did their film on Ayn Rand.  Sorry, 
it lost.  Looked like it was in B/W.

Second - 

Neil would waste his time as Julien?  I think not.  I am setting the

Why not have a thread on what the very first Rush song you ever heard 
was?  That first song that got you hooked on them for the rest of 
your life?

Mine was Bastille Day from ATWAS.  On 8-Track.  Got it by mistake 
from Columbia House or RCA club or something.  That was 1979.

To Greg Cormier: 

Regarding A Show Of Fans, they have ran into some financial difficulty and
are desperately trying to keep their website open for all Rush fans.
Steve and Mandy Streeter would greatly appreciate it if you (and any other
fans) contribute with small donations so the site won't get closed down by
the company that is hosting their site.  The same goes with the magazine,
BTW.

I tried to send this before, but I guess it got lost.  My first time
since '92 posting here (if I did then).

I don't suggest getting the Smell the Fuzz CD if you are only getting it
for the Alex track.  The track is "Strip and Go Naked" from Victor.  If
you like the rest of the musicians, or are getting it for completion's
sake, go for it.  But you would be much better off getting Victor if you
don't already have it.  I assume you do.

Corgan's track sounds like some of his whiny crap without the whiny
vocals, but the Thayil track and the one with the guys from White Zombie
and Danzig are pretty good.  Only listened to it a couple of times so
far.  So many other more interesting things to hear than a (excluding
Alex, Kim, John Christ and Yuenger) guitar wank fest.  This, of course,
is my unedumucated opinion.

Hello all,

Rob Savoury made a comment in TNMS #1999 about Rush being addictive.  It got
me thinking and I was wondering if this ever happens to anyone else.

Whenever I'm getting ready to go out on the weekend, I usually turn off the
TV and turn on the stereo.  What I play usually depends on where I'm going.
Rock if I'm gonna go catch a live band, a top 40 radio station if I'm going
clubbing, etc.  Well (and this has happened a lot), I found that if I put
ANY Rush CD in the player, 9 times out of 10 I'll wind up going through at
least 5 or 6 more and end up staying at home and falling asleep on the couch
at around three in the morning.  It's kinda cool because I save a ton of
money that I would have spent on $7 Rum Runners.  So you see, it's not only
cool to listen to Rush, it's also economical.

Take care,
Chris

P.S. I've started my own Super Secret Rush Lodge.  I'm the Grand High
Exhalted Poopa and it has the three essential Bs that make a lodge
successful: Bowling, Beauty contests and Beer.  As a matter of fact, it's so
secret I'm the only member, so don't even think about asking to join.
Whoops, I guess it's not a secret anymore.  Damn.

 This is a reply to

<A NAME="2001314">  > From: Rob Savoury <rsavoury@cs.mun.ca></A>

I totally agree with what your saying.  Not only is Rush's music, in depth,
well thought out and beautifully delivere, its just damn good music.  I get
very tired of people complaining about Geddy's voice and how "soft" Rush
seems.  I wish for once people would just listen to the music and stop
focusing on the little things about a band that are insignificant.  I just
tell people when I talk to them, "if Rush is such a pothetic band, why have
they been around for well over 30 years and have 20+ albums, with a
consistant fan following to this day"?  People always have a hard time
responding to that.  But I'm just replying to them in defense of Rush.  Its
very hard to show a person who doesn't comprehend talent, knowledge of music
and heart how to enjoy Rush.  My philosiphy is, show people Rush but dont
force it.  I for one fell in love with Rush while going to sleep in my
freinds basement apt listning to "The Trees".  Its very hard for people to
look past the surface, I mean after all, isn't that one of Rush's biggest
statements?  "Conform or be cast out", Rush stands for all those who do not
conform.  The write and play their music and we, the fans, listen and love
them for it.  Just keep that in mind whenever you get someone as simple
minded as your work collegue.  Tell her to "listen" to the message and the
way the music "flows" next time.  Anyway I have rambled long enough..

Sincerely,

The Non Conformist

<A NAME="2001020">Subject: Moving Picture Album Cover</A>

I'd like to put in my 2 cents and expand upon what has already been said
in reply to the guy that asked about the Moving Pictures album cover.
My understanding is that it's a play on the term "moving pictures" with
multiple levels.
1.) The movers are "moving" the pictures.
2.) They are emotionally "moving" pictures, hence the people crying.
3.) On the back cover, the scene is being filmed, "moving pictures" being
an obscure term for motion pictures or movies.
4.) On the inner sleeve, the band photos show the the boys captured in
motion, as they are "moving".
5.) The actual pictures that are being moved are symbols that have been
moving through time
	a.) The man in star logo remained a symbol for Rush and their
            of individualism throughout their career
	b.) The dogs playing poker, a cultural icon that has moved through
            time
	c.) The image of Joan d'Arc being burned at the stake is an image	
that has moved through time and serves as an allusion to "Witch Hunt"
as well.
Any other takes? Have I missed anything?

p.s. I too would love to know what the p/g album cover means. I heard a
while ago that it alludes  to another piece of art but i don't know
what.

Maybe most Rush fans have a longer attention span than you, sir.  No
slight intended.  Compared to most other prog-rock bands, the length of
Rush' songs and the esoteric subject matter is hardly unexpected, and I
certainly appreciated them.  I believe the album's original trouble
stemmed from poor mixing and a cover screw-up.

Unlikeable would be your opinion, many of us think it rocks, and its
eventual success is an indication that millions of people DO like it.

    I too have noticed this, sad as it is this seems to be the life we

non-Rush society.  Oh well, who gives a damn.
    Anyway, On the same thread, my ex-girlfriend couldn't stand Rush.  
It was the saddest thing.  I'd try to put on an album and she'd flip 
out.  I'd ask why she didn't like them and she'd say "because they suck"  
so I broke up with her. (Not actually for not liking Rush, but her 
flawed line of reasoning did end up contributing) Anyhow, I have 
recently met a lovely girl who likes Rush and things are cool.  The 
point is who cares!  There are plenty of Rush fans out there who you can 
relate with and vice-versa.  Love you all.  If you're in Boston check

<A NAME="2001028">Subject: Geddy's basses a correction</A>

Hi all,

After a quick look at a magazine that had a recent interview with Geddy
about his gear, I have to say that I stand corrected.  Geddy was playing
Steinbergers at that Time.  He started using the Wal in 1985 on Power
Windows, after Peter Collins let him use one that he owned.  Grace under
Presure was released in 1983, I missed the boat by 2 years.  

Geddy said the following about the Steinberger.

"It was physically eisier for me getting in and around my keyboards using
the smaller bass."  "But the sound just wasn't good enough; it was too
limiting."

He still thinks that he plays the Wal basses the best, but that the Fenders
have the sound that he wants for the music that Rush is playing now.  

On a closing note Geddy stated in the interview that he would use other
basses in the studio, so until he says exactly what he used it could be a
toss up.  Geddy has used Fender Precision and Jazz basses.  Richenbacher
4001, Steinberger L-2, and Wal (Model?) Basses.  Of course that we have to
assume that he's played just about everything and owns a lot more than just
these basses.

Yours in gear,

John A. Tyler

Has anyone notice a certain similarity of neighborhoods between the video
for "Brick" by Ben Folds Five and "Subdivisions" by Rush?  Sure, one
neighborhood is most likely in California and the other is in Ontario, but
both fit the prefab motif to a T.
	The video was directed by a Kevin Bray, but I don't know if it was
he or the band who are fans of Rush or it was an uncanny coincidence.

I suggested Madrigal for a wedding song but no one resounded with a "ditto".  
Am I the only one that thinks that song is the only "obvious" love song Rush 
has done?  Or, did I have too many free samples of the yield at the last 
KAR meeting?  I remember Geddy during an interview in '87 say when the went 
to record "Time Stand Still" they hadn't done any love songs before and 
because of this they wanted a female voice to accent it (or something to that 
effect), but I don't really think of that song as a love song anyway.

   This may be an old thread but if you had to pick a Rush album that had 
the best sound for each instrument(guitar,bass,drums,percussion,
keyboard)what would they be ?

Here are my picks :

Guitar- 2112  (like the aggresive playing)
Bass- Power Windows (great riffs throughout)
Drums- Moving PIctures (best produced drum sound to date)
Percussion- AFWTK (Xanadu !!)

While we're at it what would be your favorite sound effect in a Rush song ?

The grumbling heard in By-Tor would be my favorite effect.Anyone know how 
do they generate that sound ?

  Remaining hopeful that we'll all see a new studio effort from the boys 
what direction do you think the band will take ? The past few albums have 
features less and less keyboards and a more straight ahead approach.While I 
enjoy this sound a lot I think I'd perfer to have a little more depth in 
the music like PW or HYF.This would translate into more keyboards and may 
be considered a step backwards for the band but I don't think they ever 
sounded any better than those two efforts.Some may not like the lyrics that 
much but IMHO musicaly they've nmever sounded any better.
  I realise that the band doesn't want to produce a duplicate sound and are 
always trying to put out a new sound and direction with each studio release 
but for my listening pleasure the sound they achieved in both  PW and HYF 
are the best to date.What do others think about the bands direction on any 
new releases that may be forthcoming and what is your favorite sounding 
album musicaly ?

Hello Rush Freaks.  Those of you who are into music theory might
appreciate this.  I think it's safe to say that Tom Saywer and The Spirit
of Radio are Rush's more popular songs.  When you analyze the two songs
on a theoretical basis you'll find a very common element... they're both
in E Mixolydian!  Both songs were generated by the same key and mode.  I
thought that was interesting.  Bye.

<<Does anybody else have similar stories involving

I used to work as a phone support technician for a computer company
that will remain nameless.  We had a "cube farm" where four of us had
desks inside a large cubicle.  Two days after starting, I brought in
my Rush photo (the same one as the "Milk" ad but unretouched) to hang
over my desk.  The person who sat "behind" me saw it and went
ballistic!  It turned out he was a born-again Christian who was
CONVINCED that the boys were athiests and preached against
God/Jesus/etc.  I did my best to dissuade him, but he would not budge
in his beliefs.  I also would not budge in taking down my photo--up it
stayed, along with the cast of "Forever Knight", which also drove him
nuts.  ("Athiests!  Vampires!  AARGH!")

My motto is live and let live... but don't piss me off!

The best thing was, I got one of my other cube-mates to start
listening... in fact gave her all my Rush tapes that I had the CDs of.
 Too bad we lost touch after I left that job...

Dr. Paul Smith wrote (in NMS #1998)
>This "not Rush musicians we like listening to" thread can be reduced to a
few basics. We all listen to Genesis, Yes, ELP, King Crimson etc., plus
Pearl Jam
What can I say - not true. I don't listen to any of these bands (except
Pearl Jam), because I simply can't stand them. I guess RUSH is my only
flirt with 'Prog-Rock'. My favorite list would include
a) Helmet b) Kraftwerk c) Beach Boys d) Stereolab e) Pink Floyd (well, can
propably be called Prog-Rock) f) Chemical Brothers g) Cowboy Junkies, plus
lots more; which brings me to the next point.
Two Rush sightings (you judge if they qualify):
  On the Cowboy Junkies LP 'Pale Sun Crescent Moon' they have a whole song
('First Recollection') based on two lines from that William Faulkner-Novel
'Absalom, Absalom' that inspired Neil to use those words in DEW. Plus, the
Cowboy Junkies are from Toronto as well. (The album is from 1993, I think).
At least an interesting connection.
  I recently watched MTV Europe at a friends place, as I don't get it
myself, and during one of those 'we show more pictures than you can
see'-clips to promote MTV they also showed a (very little) bit of the
'Stick It Out'-Video (I think this was it), showing this guy tied to a
chair and struggling to get free. What a surprise! Take MTV, who doesn't
like RUSH, plus Europe, which isn't RUSH-land either, and still they have
it in their promo-Spot. Pretty neat, I think.

So much from me

The coolest thing is that I heard a song that I hadn't

believe it was off their first album, which I've never heard.  Was
*that* cool!  I'm an artist and was painting while listening to the
CDs, and my brush stopped in mid-stroke when I realized that I didn't
instantly recognize those opening chords.   

What a weekend--got to fly in a small plane for the first time (Piper

<A NAME="2001038">Subject: Very cool Rush wedding song story</A>

Hey all,

I wanted to share a different story about Rush being
played at a wedding.  The wedding just happened to 
be mine and it occurred August 3, 1996.

My wife is German, so we decided to get hitched over 
there in Germany.  She is from a pretty small town up
about an hour from the Holland border.  Anyway,  there
is this little medieval chapel up on this hill set back in the 
woods a bit that overlooks the town.  Very cool chapel,
by the way.  It has stone walls that are 3 feet thick.  They
also have one of those pipe organs, although a small one,
since the church only has 4 pews and holds about 70 people
if you really jam it.

So,  I'm about to get married, my wife-to-be is waiting 
outside to come in.  Now over here, when the bride is walking
up to the altar, they start playing "Here Comes the Bride", but
they don't even know that song exists over there, so what
normally happens is that the bride and groom go to some 
musician in the town and pick out some appropriate music 
to play.  I did not know this.  She knew I did not know this.
She took it upon herself to go to a musician friend of her 
parents, who is a Professor of music over there somewhere.
She brought with her a copy of my Roll the Bones CD, and 
told this guy that she wanted him to play Bravado at our wedding 
on the pipe organ.

And you know what?  He did.  Right while she was walking
up to the altar to marry me.  You know what else?  I am 
ashamed to say this, but I did not even notice.  I guess
I was just nervous.  The only person that noticed was my
brother, Joe, but when he was listening to it, he was just 
like "Naaaaaaa!  Couldn't be!!" 

Fortunately I have some video footage of this so I believe
it actually happened.

The cool thing about it was that at the time she really did
not like Rush, but it was the song Bravado that started 
changing her mind.

Another pretty cool thing about it is that this professor guy
learned to like the CD so much while he was learning the 
song that he kept my CD.  Although I had to buy another
Roll the Bones CD, it was a small price to pay for letting 
somebody else in on the band.

So this just goes to show you that Rush is appropriate at
weddings, and that women do like Rush.

Fred

Hi Rush Fans:

This is my first post. There are a couple of things I would like to tell
everyone. First, It is great that we as fans of the greatest band to ever lay a
note to vinyl, have a place to discuss Rush. I have seen however a lot of
irrelevant material posted here. This is a medium to communicate to others how
the words and music of rush move us in various ways. It is not a place to
discuss Metallica, Dream Theater, The secret Society of Rush (Julien, You are
an idiot!), or anything that adds to my time of sifting through meaningless
chatter to find the interesting threads.
     I have seen Rush in concert 17 times in various places and consider them
as having influence on what I have become today. No, I haven't tattooed a
pentagram on my forehead or anything like that, but I recognize the differences
in cultures, perceptions, and inner beings as brought to light in the songs
Subdivisions, The Trees, Closer to the Heart, Hemispheres, etc. I think you
know where I am headed here. Rush should be taken for what it is and nothing
more. (Julien!!!)
A band for the ages that has through its music and lyrics been able to
establish a deeper connection to someone than the typical bubble gum, gone in a
year, follow the leader style band that seems to be prevalent today.

Rush On....
