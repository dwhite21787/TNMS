Let me make a quick clarification here - when I said yesterday that I
would remove any further postings of conversations with DJ's, I meant
I would remove any *verbatim* transcripts.  If you gleaned some tidbit
of interesting info from any source, feel free to post it, but try to
keep it short - *summarize*.  I have no problems with someone saying
"The DJ at WXYZ said ______________"; my problem is two screens of some
conversation that may or may not have any real content.

Well, I'm in a hurry, so this will be shorter than usual (which isn't
saying much, is it...)

Anyways...for those of you already jelous of us in Pittsburgh...the other
hard rock/metal station here (WMYG, now 97 Rock) played "Dreamline" the
other day.

I called up the DJ at WDVE (the station that's been playing a lot of RTB)
and asked him about why a lot of stations don't have it.  He said something
like "Well, I can't speak for anyone else..all I know [lapsing into
promo mode] is that we have the whole album and we're playing all the
different tracks from it."
I asked to hear "Where's My Thing", but they played "Heresy"--and gave
away a copy.  I was caller one!!!  Unfortunately, they were giving it to
caller ten.  So it goes.

On FidoNet, someone mentioned that th

that his college radio station played "Where's My Thing".  He called up
and they said that they just got that as a promo single.  Interesting...

Hasta luego..

Well, some more about Pittsburgh radio and Rush.  No, not about new stuff.

The station here that's been playing all of those new songs DOES seem
to be a big Rush station.  I never realized that before, but I guess every-
thing's relative, and that most other stations have LESS Rush.  Anyways...
they have a show Sundays at 9:00 for two hours.  Listeners call up a special
number during the week and leave a message with a request for a song
that you don't hear often.  Well, during the commercial for the program,
they play pieces of people's messages.  Maybe 5 of them.  The second one is
someone asking for "Side 1. 2112. From Rush."  I assume that they DID play
this, then.  Wow...

Also, they play some of the solo from "Working Man" in a regular commercial.

However, all of this Rush isn't going to make me stay here...I want to go
somewhere else, for college at least.  (I'm in high school now.)

Greetings,

  Okay, first off, Dreamline finally hit Boston.  I called WAAF (107.3FM), and
they said, yeah, we've been getting a lot of calls, it'll be on soon.  They
were in the middle of their top-9 requests segment.  Well, #1 turned out to be
Dreamline.  And, they gave enough of a preamble for me to get the tapedeck
rolling.  WBCN played it later, but unfortunately, I had to dash for the
tapedeck, and I missed the first part.  Pity, since I get 'BCN more clearly.
Anyway, it sounds great (love the Gedster's bass sound)!

  Question:  about this satellite premiere.  How do I find out which station
in Boston will be playing it? Is there any way without calling ALL of them?

Thanks!
--Mike

	I was looking at the center picture for HYF (the one in the tour
booklet) last night, and I had with me a copy of that question from the
FAQL.  I'm a fairly new subscriber, so I don't know if this point has been
discussed previously, but look at the picture, to the right of the man's feet,
on the street, pretty much right in front of the lamppost.  There's some red
stuff that might be a reflection of something.  Is it just me, or does anybody
else see a familiar red-star-in-a-circle pattern there? I've stared at it for
quite a while, but I can't be certain that my mind isn't just straining at
nothing just so I can get  onto the FAQL.  ;^)

Well, fellow fans - I'll try to make this short!

2 days ago, around 11am, my 6th sense seemed to kick in & told me to
turn off the CD player & turn on the radio instead. Sho' Nuf'!! Ol' DJ
Larry from Larry's BBS announced that he'd play "the new single from
Rush" for the 1st time in Tucson on KLPX. He claimed that they were
one of the 1st radio stations in the country to get it - yeah, right.
But! He mentioned that it had some deep lyrics from Neil - & he even
said his last name right!!! I guess he's not as much of a goob as I
thought he was... ;-)

Anyways, I sustained my 1st Rush related injury because of this - I
managed to skin my knee while rushing (heh) off to get my tape player
ready for the Dreamline event (You know you're a Rush fan when...)!!
Interesting song - I love the lyrics & the chorus melody. I played it
for a friend & she said it didn't sound like Rush at all - mainly
because Geddy's singing is so low. I thought that was fairly
humorous!!

That's all....& it was nice...yeah, That's Nice...    :-)

      I really don't think that Rush would do a Tesla like set.  Here are
my reasons:
 1. Rush have had no songs that are completely acoustic since 2112
(correct me if I am wrong)
 2. I agree that it would be great but Rush are not into re hashing old
tunes,  they are the opitomy of the word progressive and I Don't think
would do a show with Rivendell, Twilight Zone, No One at the Bridge being
that acoustic set.
 3.  Neil hates degressing musically and thats why he doesn't like to go
back to old ways.

Besides     I can't picture geddy just sitting thier with Neil on
tamborine or something

ROLL!!  THE!!  BONES!!

        I was wondering if anyone found Dreamline to have an added power
that was somewhat lacking on Presto.  For some reason it just kicks me a
little harder, and it's not what I expected.  Of course I am very very
pleased things turned out the way they did.  I hope the other cuts are
just as good!

        (stupid question ^^^)

        Geddy's voice actually sounds really cool.  It reminds me a
little of MP, it's lower I guess, but it give him a more, hmmm, i dunno
how to put it.  Listen to lines like   "They travel the road to
redemtion" and it sounds cool, very spacy and mystical.  Neil's writing
also adds to this, words like Jupitor, Sahara, liquid, crystal, gypsie.
        I also like the funkyness of Ged's voice in the beginning.  Very
good song!  The more i hear it is a part of all of RUSH!

        KOME has had Dreamline at no. 1 on the 9 most wanted now sinse it
came out on tues!  According to the DJ, he thinks that nothing else will
knock it out of first, unless another cut off the album is released.  he
said that the ammount of calls they get for it is incredible.
        I think it is time all the negative reviewers, MTV, and the
Rolling Stoners suck my boner!  I mean cummon, there has not been this
much excitement over a song on the radio since Poison's Unskinny
Bop, yeah right (glamsters {no intention of hurting the feelings of
hamsters})

        Sorry it's late and I'm tired, but you catch my drift!

        Matt! Hoser! Where in heck ar ya?

        Take Off!               Dan-

Hey, Forget about the new album anyway. Talk about Baseball.
The Blue Jays are in first, but they have lost twice the Brew Crew.
Why does'nt somebody tell Geedy to start the tour know, and get it
over with. Even if the Jays go to ALCS they are going to lose to the
Twins. Minneasota is winning and winning and it's the Twins all the
way in '91. So if any of you Rushoids can get to the band, tell to give
up the Jays and get on the road.

Hi.
Well I'm back from my summer hiatus (as if you knew I was gone.)
Good to hear all of the good news about the album; even if it is in
slight abundance.

Has anyone out there heard anything about a 20 year anniversary package
thing? I know this might be a little early but I was just curious if
anyone has thought about this. I know box sets aren't exactly new and
rare theses days, but it would be neat to see a collection of rare
takes/unreleased live stuff. Plus a nice booklet with cool photos.
Anybody have any ideas?

Later
