First and foremost, Happy Birthday to Alex Lifeson!  This makes him,
what, 38 years young?

Secondly, there was a slight problem with the ftp stuff on Syrinx
between yesterday around 16:00 until about 9:00 this morning (EDT).
I think it's fixed now; if you have questions/problems, drop me a
line here.

Thirdly, there is a new sound file on the ftp site: it's "FlyByNight.au"
a Sun audio file in the 'rush/sounds' directory.  Before any more people
send me complete songs in sound files, let me check with our legal dept.
about just how much trouble I'm risking having complete songs available.

Lastly, as a reminder to all of you thinking of passing the word of this
list along to friends, associates etc.  New members are always welcome;
the list is growing daily.  I have a policy where I must receive mail
directly from the person reqesting to be added; I can't sign up a person
"for a friend."  I was once burned by someone being added "as a joke", and
don't plan on repeating that.  If you know someone who is interested, have
them send me mail containing their name and an e-mail address at either
address in my .sig, and I'll put 'em right on.  I try for next-day service,
but can't always guarantee it, especially over the weekend.

Hi, yall:

I called around to the stations in the Bay Area
that I can receive (KRQR, KOME, KSJO, KZAP) and
asked about the radio premiere of Roll the Bones
and would they be carrying it?  The responses were
uninspiring, in general, but KZAP (a station in
Sacramento that carries a great deal of premiere shows)
said that they probably would carry it.  KOME said they
would check on it and let the us all know later (not too
much later I hope...)

Also, I'd like to raise an issue that has bothered me for some time.
If any of us true fans were to get the great honor of meeting
the Three Canucks, what would you say to them?  I have often
thought about this because the tendency is to say stuff like
"Gee, I think you guys are really great and I have liked your
music since before I was born", or whatever.  I hope that none
of us would want to come across like that.  But the question is
how do communicate with people that you greatly admire and respect,
so as to distinguish yourself as someone that they can relate to
on a personal level, not the typical musician-to-fan level.  I
realize that these guys are not probably going to take the instant
"Oh my god, you are THE GUY... You have exactly the qualities we are
looking for in a 'best' friend.  Would you like to come back to
Canada and meet our families... " attitude, but you would like to
leave them with the impression that you are not just some stupid
hero-worshipper with nothing to say.  So, what do you think?
Have any of you out there actually met them?  What were your
impressions?

Check it!

KUPD (98 in Phoenix, and 106.1 in Tucson) has been playing Dreamline.  One
time, the DJ decides spontaneously to play Where's My Thing also!  I like
Dreamline, and like Where's My Thing even more.  Can't wait til' 9-3-91!

Also, I saw SOMEONE from the arizona.edu domain post here.  Who else from
Tucson (and even Phoenix, Tempe, etc.) is on this?  Could you Arizona people
please send to the mail address in my signature file.  Knowing you may come in
handy when Rush tours here! (Getting Tickets, etc.)  Catch ya' later!

<A NAME="324004">Subject: Dreamline/Boxed Set</A>

Yo.

Well, the local station has been playing only "Dreamline".  I
requested "Where's My Thing" only to be answered by "Play what?".
Guess I'll have to keep trying.  Auugghhh!  This is so aggravating!!

If no one objects, I could certainly try my hand at "unofficially"
transcribing the lyrics to "Dreamline" -- I've only had the song stuck
in  my head for a week...

For anyone and everyone interested, hopefully we'll get some news
first-hand on whether they'll put out a boxed set.  I asked Neil via
the Rush Backstage Club about whether they'll put one on.  (Along with
the 400 other  questions I asked him)  Whenever he decides to answer
all the questions the rest of the world has been sending him, hopefuly
he'll answer that one.

Oh yeah, I also asked him about why POW and P were brought to us by
letters.  Actually, this was partly a real question and partly a joke.
He complained the last time that the questions were too serious, so I
hope he takes it as a joke...

And now for something completely different...  Personally, I think the
folks on this Digest have every right to talk ad nauseum about the new
songs/album  UNLESS the same person, or a whole lot of people,
regurgitate the same exact info.  I mean, face it, we've been waiting,
quite patiently, too, for this album to come out since DECEMBER --
we're all beyond the point of excitement and this is the only outlet
we have to express our repressed joy.  Especially since, ideally,
we're the only ones who understand what it's like for Rush to come out
with new material.  And if we can't rely on each other for support and
understanding of our ecstacy, then why bother having this digest?  Let
people be excited and ecstatic  and freak out -- THAT'S PART OF THE
FUN!!!

ROLL THE BONES, MAN!!!!!

Say, can anyone here help me get a copy of Neil's "Pieces of Eight" and
the "Beyond Borders" piece that Alex did with Rik Emmett (another great
guitarist), Liona Boyd, and a jazz guitarist that I can't remember right
now for Guitar Player magazine. Drop me a note if you have/know where
I can get these! Thanx!

The first new tune I heard here was "Where's My Thing?" last Wednesday
on WONE Akron.  Later that day, they played "Dreamline" (which also
has been getting airplay on WMMS Cleveland for those in the NE Ohio area).
I finally was able to get it on tape today.  Cool tune.  Real upbeat with
a rock/jazz feel.  I really like it.  Can't wait till Sept. 3rd now.

Yes, I know I posted earlier and this is not Rush-related but last Wednesday
was a "special day".  Not only was new Rush played in this area but I saw
Van Halen at the Blossom Music Center that night.  EXCELLENT show.  For those
who have a chance to see them - GO!  I was quite disappointed when I saw them
on the _1984_ tour but things are different now.  Not cause of Hagar but the
music (and them) have matured somewhat (at least that's what I think).  And
the new album rocks your face off.  It's great to hear good 'ol fasion R 'n' R
again (and especially from them).  Also, the show was musically sound (which
is good cause they are only in the 2nd week or so of touring).  Like I said,
if you can see them - do so.  Eddie's guitar solo alone is worth the $$.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled Rush News ...

Dan...

Sorry, this is a reply to a completely scrambled message from 'Daredevil' about
the KPEZ airing of RTB.  All I could make out was 'please tell me the time and
and location of the live RTB show on Thursday'.

KPEZ 102.3 (could be 102.5)

Hey All Rush-heads!

    Well this is probably one of the weirdest requests you'll ever see come
across the network, but ah I figure this is by far the best place to ask!  My 3
man bowling team needs a name, and I was thinking of doing something Rush
oriented... so what I am looking for is some suggestions of a team name that is
Rush influenced/oriented.... please reply by mail to me (no need to waste
bandwidth)... I'll summarize after we decide on a name...

Thanks!

Hello folks,

	Just got back into the swing of things here with my first issue
of TNMS after the summer.  Gosh, I can't believe how much the topics of
discussion have changed since May.  Now, instead of hearing vague rumors
about a new album (entitled "Throw the Stones"or "Rolling Stone Can Smoke
My Bone", &c.), we're reading definite stuff. I like it!

	But, I digress.  I'm writing to express my amazement that people have
actually *heard* more tracks from RTB than "Dreamline".  Here In Philly, the
only semi-good radio station is WMMR, which had to be tortured endlessly by
my girlfriend and I before they would play "DL".  They premiered it last
Wednesday and have played it only rarely since.  Needless to say, we haven't
heard hide nor hair of any of the other tracks.

	Are we listening to the wrong station or what? Seems that Southeastern
Pennsylvania suffers from a dearth of good radio.

[ When I'm in Philly, I listen to 93.3 and 94.1; one isn't WMMR. :-)
                                                                  :rush-mgr ]

	Regarding the radio premiere of RTB: What's going on? Some say it's
a live set (like the premiere of FBN at Electric Ladyland in 1974 (which I
have, if anyone's interested)), and some claim that it's a satellite 'cast.
If the latter is true, will Westwood One carry it? Help!!

	Finally, for those Rush-fans in the Erie, PA area (my hometown),
Rocket 101 (WRKT 100.9) will premiere this album in some form on the 29th
at 11 along with every other station on the planet.  They have been playing
"DL" quite often...

	Keep rocking, you Rushians, and have pity on those of us who must
wait until the 29th! :-) :-)

	Mike

<A NAME="324014">Subject: More HYF symbols</A>

I was reading the FAQL last night and there was a question about the HYF
symbols on the inside cover.  I had a little bit of time to kill last night
so I dragged out my CD, Album, and tour book and found a few more -

1.  Leaning against the trash can in the front is an oxford shoe, just like
    the one the girl wears on the ESL cover and Tom Sawyer video.

2.  The back side of the owl on FBN is resembled on the lamp post on the far
    right side.  (Only on the CD and tour book)

3.  There is a woman looking out the window next to the Statue of Liberty.

4.  A copy of the painting on the far left on MP, is wrapped up in cloth and
    leaning against the front steps.

That's all for now.  If I find myself waiting in the E.R. waiting room again
I will probably look for some more hidden symbols.  (everybody's fine)
