Hey Rushians,

It's funny that the consensus seems to be that everyone either loves
Rush or hates Rush.  Most everyone that I know that doesn't love Rush
the way that we do, doesn't despise them either.  Actually, they rather
like them.  They just prefer other artists before Rush.  They might even
have a couple of Rush's discs, but not all.  Just strikes me as funny. 
I have never been slammed for being a Rush fan.  They comment usually is
"Yeah, Rush is pretty cool."

A few are posting about their tattoos, or the ones they plan on
getting.  I figured I would let you in on something I have been planning
on doing.  I play goalie, both roller and ice hockey.  To alleviate some
of the expenses when I started buying equipment, I decided to get a
helmet and cage like Chris Osgood and Glenn Healy.  It was cheaper than
a mask.  But over time, I have started replacing my used equipment for
newer and better equipment.  And the mask is next.  I have found a few
people who air brush designs on mask.  My plan is to have The Starman
painted on the top, with a small design of two of my favorite albums on
either side.  As long as it doesn't get too expensive.  Then on the back
panel, I plan on having a line from Freewill put on.  "If you choose not
to decide, you still have made a choice!"

Hey Renee (pharmgal), Yngwie wouldn't appreciate playing in Maple Leaf
Gardens, because he would be filled with the fear that comes with
playing against Tie Domi.

Off the top of my head:
1) "Gone" or "Bad" by U2 (Just to hear Geddy do the vocals)
2) "Breadfan" by Metallica/Budgie (Early Rush only)
3) "Us and Them", Pink Floyd
4) "Hammer to Fall" by Queen (I could actually seriously imagine that)
5) "Suck" by Nine Inch Nails (Just Kidding)
That's all for now.

Hi everyone!

I'll have a week off from my job in April, and I'm thinking of driving to
Toronto.  (I live in Massachusetts.)  I figure I'll visit Alex's "Orbit Room"
club, see the parliament building (cover of Moving Pictures), and other stuff.

I was there for less than one full day back in 1991, while passing through on
a vacation trip with some relatives.  But this time, I want to spend a few
days, and make it a more Rush oriented visit.

I've read the "Rush Fan's Guide to Toronto", and I'm sending this letter to
see if any of you folks out there have suggestions or comments.

PS: (this is not specifically Rush-related) does anyone know of restaurants in
Toronto that are vegetarian or vegetarian-friendly?

Hello fellow Rush freaks!

This thread is a goodie, and it seems to come back a few times a year. I've
got a Rush-related tattoo on my right ankle - it's the picture called
subjective contours, from the back of the Counterparts CD case. To describe
it simply, it's the picture that looks like Pac Mans and Vs. I actually got
the image from a psychology textbook (I got my psych minor at Indiana
University), but it's definitely original.

If anyone cares, I also have the circular snake from the Millennium show
tattooed on the middle of my lower back. I like it.

Have a good day, everyone!

Michael Jordan is not an internationally prominent sports star, I 
can assure you.  Basketball is essentially a domestic American sport.

I guess you mean "World" as in "World Series".  Sorry, but there 
are sports which have huge followings in many nations, all over 
the world.  Basketball isn't one of them.

Most people in the world (that's the 'real' world, not just the 
United States) don't know who Michael Jordan is.

Well, it may be popular in Canada and Japan to an extent, but 
that's really only as a result of American influence.

     I was watching the either Sacramento Kings, Utah Jazz game, or the 
Phoenix Suns, Jazz Game (Big Jazz fan obviously).  Anyways, at halftime 
they showed the stats and the assists were Utah Jazz 21, and Sacramento 
or Phoenix 12.  I thought this was really cool.  Sweet. . . See ya!!

 This takes the Japanese version of Different Stages down to $44 (not

Rush did cover one song that I definately know of.  It was a B side of a
single released early in their careers. What the single was I don't know
(any help rush-mgr?), but the cover was "Not Fade Away" by Buddy Holly and
the Crickets.

   [ "You Can't Fight It" was the single.                    : rush-mgr ]

Not really what you were looking for now, but I'll think on it.

Then someone else had an interesting idea, no?
Neil says the song is about trees.  Hence the title.  It can be a
metaphor for any class struggle you like.

Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom.
It is the argument of tyrants.

Sorry.  If there is precedent for a product existing, patent wil be
denied--the waterbed is a classic example.  A dozen peole tried to
patent it, but Robert A. Heinlein had described it in fiction for 30
years, along with the linear accelerator, the moving walkway, and the
robotic remote arm.  So none of them are patentable.

My copy of Virtual Songs was fulfilled by Todd Harper a few weeks ago.
According to Mike Bahr's website (http://www.goodnet.com/%7Edurnik/), I
e-mailed Todd and he got back to me within 2 days (a miracle, considering
Prism's track record) and my CD was delivered in about 2 or 3 weeks.  This
quick turnaround led me to believe that I just missed the cutoff when Mike
stopped shipping orders last summer...  It's been so long since I actually
paid for the thing that I don't even remember how much it was.  I'm glad I
was only temporarily ripped off for one order though--you have my sympathy
for being out over $200.

Hello Everybody!

I was watching the Pens - Islanders on Wednesday the 18th and heard both TS 
and Limelight.  Who ever runs the music between faceoffs at Nassau Arena, 
EXCELLENT JOB!
Too bad my beloved Penguins ended their winning streak that night but nothing 
lasts forever I guess!  Just as long as we beat those Philly Cheesesteaks on 
Sunday night I'll be happy.  Should be a great game.
Later.

     FYI - Phil Collins has also been the subject of a rather long-winded 
     (and at times, rather heated!) thread on the Led Zeppelin mailing 
     list.  What began as comments on Phil's talents (or lack thereof) 
     during Zep's Live Aid reunion, digressed into comparisons between his 
     and John Bonham's styles (much like has been going on in TNMS in the 
     Peart vs. Collins debates).
     
     I just found it odd that the man with no jacket seems to be the topic 
     of choice on both the Zep and Rush lists these days.....

This is a mistake which I've seen in other promotuions for this tape. It
is Merrilee Rush that is on the tape, not OUR Rush. I contacted the
company that put this out several years ago, and they sent me a copy.
It's very poor IMHO.

I'm sorry if I sound nit-picky and this isn't a flame. The guitar stand that
Steve Howe used was VERY different than what Alex uses (or anyone else, for
that matter). I believe that he called it "the octopus", or something to
that effect. It held 3 instruments ( a Coral sitar, a lute, and an acoustic
guitar). He and his guitar tech dreamed that thing up. If you observe
closely to the Yessongs video, you can see how the stand worked - it had a
swiveling base that had 3 "arms" on it, one for each instrument. Quite a
cool idea!
I can't shed any light on the subject of if Alex invented the stand
mentioned earlier, but I can say that I have one and it works out very well
on stage.

Hello fellow Rush fans! Cheers to the guy who loves side one of
"Hemispheres"! I am a huge fan of it as well. I also think that side two
of "Caress of steel" is another great album side! And of course, side
one of "2112". These are all masterpieces in my opinion. Does anyone on
this list live in the Cincinnati area?                       Later!

Been a while, but some items have intrigued me...

1) On the subject of favorite album sides, I used to have a specific use =
for album sides.  Specifically, I fell asleep to them.  The right =
collection of songs can be wonderful for easing into slumber by the =
light of one's stereo display.  To wit...
    Robert Plant    The Principle of Moments    Side 2 --falling asleep =
to "Big Log" is the ultimate!
    Yes                90125                                Side 2 =
 -always loved "City of Love" and "Hearts" is a great finish
    The Fixx        Shuttered Room                   Either side-- just =
dark music
    The Fixx        Reach the Beach                 Side 2--love the =
guitar work at the end of "Outside"

That's all I can think of now, since my stereo is now in the living room =
and I can't fall asleep to it.  However, I can recommend some great =
sides for general listening:
    Rush        Grace Under Pressure and Signals    Both Side 1  - these =
were my first two and I love them still
    Asia        Asia        Side 1    - not great art, but some rockin' =
music
    INXS        The Swing    Side 1 - before Michael Hutchence decided =
he was a sex symbol
    The Police    Ghost In The Machine    Either side --I may be the =
only one, but THIS is my favorite Police album
    Billy Squier    Don't Say No    Side 1

Yes, they're all from the same time period, but this is when I bought =
most of my albums and most of my favorites.

2) What songs would I love to hear Rush cover??
    Yes "Tempus Fugit"
    Marillion "Berlin"
    The Fixx "Deeper & Deeper"
    GTR "Imagining"
    Blue Oyster Cult "Astronomy"  although I doubt I can be done better =
than on Imaginos
    and finally....Alan Parsons Project "La Sagrada Familia" from Gaudi

Hope you've enjoyed Dave's crunchy little thought nuggets.  SOON =
AVAILABLE IN CHOCOLATE FLAVOR!!

Hey Rush Fans,
Someone one I work with claims they saw Rush at The Warner Theater in DC
in 1978. Can anyone verify this? I thought they would have been playing
bigger venues during that period...Many thanks to the people keeping us

<A NAME="2176038">Subject: Vegas Rush Sighting</A>

Greets All,
I just got home from a trip to Las Vegas and I have a Rush sighting to
report.  Around 2am Tues night/Weds morning my friend and I were
returning from doing the usual Vegas tourist thing (bit 'o gambling,
lots of walkin' and gawkin').  As we were walking through the lobby of
our hotel (the Golden Nugget) chatting about the stuff we did I suddenly
stopped.  What did I hear being played over the PA but "Digital Man".
We'd noticed that the Nugget didn't play the usual elevator music in the
lobby (we'd heard Golden Earring's "Twilight Zone" on the way out) the
fact that they played Rush was kinda odd but "Digital Man"?!?!  That
isn't even a common song on the radio.  We stopped for a quick bite in
the cafe and listened to the music for a while but nothing gave any
indication that it was a radio station.  Imagine, Rush being played over
the PA at a 4-Star hotel... stunned me.

BTW, I highly reccomend the Stratosphere to any of you Video Poker
players out there... lots of full pay (9/6) Jacks there and even a bank
of 10/7's (no gimicks... full pay).   In less than an hour playing (two
sessions over 2 days) I walked away $100 richer on those $.25 10/7's.

Ben & anyone else who's interested, 

I've been following the Prism saga closely as I'd like to get hold of some
of the Prism back catalogue when its eventually re-released.

Last I heard there were indeed 4 guys who had taken up the Rush back
catalogue. They had all been sent "packges" from Mike Bahr with lists of
customers who are owed stuff.....There is talk of financial compensation as
well.

You can find details of the people to contact at  :

http://www.goodnet.com/~durnik/home.html

I've e-mailed all of them :

Scarred has info on his FAQ
Xanadu has a 1 line update at the front of his website saying he's still
working on the "package"
Todd Harper was putting a website togther, last time I heard
I didn't hear back from Rob Glander.

Good luck !

Bezza.
