This is an interesting insight.  All those years of listening and
analyzing Xanadu and not once did I ever make the connection that
"mad" could mean "insane."  I always took it to mean "pissed off,"
i.e. the immortal man was p.o.'d at himself and the ancient book
because he was trapped in the pleasure dome and couldn't get out.

One thing that no one seems to able to reconcile is the "last immortal
man."  If he was the last and final one to make it to the dome, fine.
But presumably there are others who made it.  Where are they?

You could also take "last immortal man" to mean that our man is the
last one left in the dome; that is, there used to be others in there
with him, but they are not there any more.  They most assuredly
didn't die; where are they?  I've re-read both Coleridge's poem and
Peart's lyrics, but can find no clue concerning other immortals.

I guess this could just be Peart's poetic license, somewhat akin to
"image is just an eyeless game" in Anagram (for Mongo).  That is, we
just have to "suspend our disbelief" and overlook this illogical quirk
in the storyline.  It still bothers me though; more discussion about
the "last immortal man" would be most welcome.

Greetings Programs,
	I just read the comments made about emotional music without
emotional lyrics.  This is one of the very concepts that attracts me
to Rush.  To be able to evoke thought through words at the same time
as evoking emotion through music is the ultimate combination.  When
both the lyrics and the song evoke emotion without intellectual
stimulation, there is little or nothing to be learned.  It is my
belief (at least I like to think it is :-) that music and lyrics
combined can be a powerful teaching and learning device.
	But then again, I could be wrong.  It's finals week here at
WSU, so I probably am! ;-]

> Randall Stark TEL: (+44)-31-650-2725	   | Dept. of Artificial Intelligence

I think there is a lot of truth in Randall's comments about Rush's
lyrics being sometimes ponderous. I don't share Neil's passion for
rationality, which is why I feel (along with Randall) that the lyrics
are at times pretentious. Rush's lyrics are very rarely in first person.
When they are, they tend to be quite emotional.

First person, emotional Rush songs (IMHO):
----------------------------------------
	1.	Circumstances
	2.	Freewill
	3. 	Entre Nous
	4.	Limelight
	5.	The Analog Kid
	6.	Afterimage
	7.	Red Sector A
	8.	Time Stand Still
	9.	Tai Shan
	10.	Presto
	11.	Scars
   	12.	Available Light

However, I find a lot of third person Rush songs to be very emotional.

Third person, emotional Rush songs (IMVHO):
-----------------------------------------

	1.	Something for Nothing
	2.	Closer to the heart
	3.	The Spirit of the Radio
	4.	Natural Science
	5.	Witch Hunt
	6.	Subdivisions
	7.	Losing It
	8.	Distant Early Warning
	9.	The Enemy Within
	10.	Marathon
	11.	Territories
	12.	Mystic Rhythms
	13.	Mission
	14.	High Water
	15.	The Pass

That's not a bad list for any group. I admit that on occasion, that I've
(almost) been moved to tears by Afterimage, Red Sector A, Territories,
Witch Hunt (live ASOH version during Alex's solo).

However, there are a whole slew of Rush songs that I dislike because of
the lyrics. Examples are, Tom Sawyer, Chemistry, The Weapon, Kid Gloves,
Grand Designs, Emotion Detector, Open Secrets, Second Nature, Prime Mover,
Lock and Key, Chain Lightning, War Paint, and Hand Over Fist.

So IMHO, Neil is sometimes on the money and sometimes over the top
like anyone else. His background is Ayn Rand's Objectivism which I now
intensely dislike but used to like (which means it's been internalized
to some degree). He showed signs of coming out of it on Distant Early
Warning (``Obsolete, Absolute''), Mystic Rhythms (``Primitive things
beat in the heart of everyone'' (I don't have my lyric sheet)), Mission
and Tai Shan. But he keeps retreating to it in songs like Open Secrets,
and Prime Mover. Maybe it's this spirit of rational inquiry that keeps
him from writing more emotional songs.

  Mr. Randell, you are expecting flames, but you won't get them from
me. No, flames are to *good* for you.
  I'll start by asking you to define "emotional" in the sense you used
it. IMO, The Trees, Bastille Day, and Natural Science were not meant to
be emotional and are definitly *NOT* funny. "La guillotine will claim
her bloody prize" again IMO, is *NOT* to hilariously funny. My guess is
that you are looking too hard to find hidden meanings, etc. and missing
the entire point of the song. Bastille Day, beside being about Bastille
Day, has the message that we should always be conscious of our past so
that we do not make the same mistakes over again. This is also the theme
to the song A Farewell To Kings. The Trees and Natural Science, are
about society and the world we live in, and are both excellent examples
of metaphors (which IMO Neil uses very well).
  In conclusion, I think you should stick to your artificle intellegence
and leave real intellegence to people who don't bash Rush on the Rush
*Fans* Digest. Yes, I know everyone is entitled to there own opinion, but
I think it's Rush-bashing here is inapropriate.

WOW My first posting!
	Intros.....I have been listening to rush since aound 1982-83, my
friend got me interested in Tom Sayer, favorite song of all time "In the
Mood". (fav RUSH SONG).  Apologies to all the gutarists I contacted a long
time ago about music, but I have been REALLY busy.

	I need some suggestions.  A frat here at Ohio State has an
AIR_BAND_CONTEST every year.  And since my friend Scott has LONG black hair,
and my friend Scott has short brown hair, and me? I got da blonde (ah too
have the long hair that I had in High School again! its long, but not in the
back) Anyways,  we do Rush if ya havent figured it out. (heck I just recently
figured out where "NAT. MIDnight Star" came from).  What song that rocks (so
to keep audience interested) has vocals, and is just plain great that we can
do as an airband?  we have done:
	Spirit o Radio / Closer to the Heart (live SOH)
and	Big $$$ / Limelight

	what do the experts think?  We were thinking of TOM S. and Spirit
again (me...I wanna do in the mood!)

MGR Insert your interuption and suggestion 'ere!....

I'm in the vast majority (I think) of the readers here who like the
lyrics as well as the music.  Some of the lyrics I don't pay much
attention to, but I find that the majority of songs have lyrics that
reflect how I feel about human values and emotions.  Then again,
maybe I've just been brainwashed from listening to too much Rush.

Is it even _possible_ to listen to too much Rush?

Also, maybe it's just me, but I read a lot into the lyrics that would
only mean something to someone with a college education in engineering.
Thus, I was quite surprised to learn that Neil has only a high school
education.  I suppose that as "The Professor," he's learned a lot from
sources outside of school.

Re: Neil's lyrical style..  I agree with Randy and Gordon.

Neil's lyrics are written in a very analytical/intellectual style which
typically isn't very emotional.  This reflect's Neil's own personality
which is very reserved and analytical.  Everybody's got their own subjective
views as to how much they like this.  No problem, right?

(This is becoming an emotional topic!)

Now, now folks.  Let's NOT chastize Mr. Stark for expressing his opinions.  It's
not like he spoke poorly of those who disagreed with him, he just stated his
honest opinion.

As for MY opinion, I heartily disagree with him.  Peart's style tends to be
clinical and objective (once again, pun intended), and this might be one of
the reasons he appeals to me.  This style, IMHO doesn't lose any emotion, it
just presents them in a different package.

As for someone who mentioned the music, it plays an important part in adding
emotion.  In "Subdivisions", the way "Nowhere is the dreamer, or the misfit
so alone" is sung really drives the point home.  It did for me in 1982 when I
first heard the song on MTV, and it still does some 8 years later.

Perhaps I am that guy.  I once upon a time wrote a question to TNMS
about "Broon's Bane".  I was wondering it had originally been a part
of "The Trees".  Someone else commented on the fact that "Alex's
performance in 'Broon's Bane' is dedicated to Elliot" (see liner
notes).

Anyway, what does "Retrospective" say of "Broon's Bane" and/or Elliot?

Thanks,

Hi-

about Neil's lyrics-
I listen to Rush for the music. Alot of the time, the lyrics are tuned out
and I don't care what he has to say. He does have his moments though. When
HYF came out, I was having some tough times (or so I thought then) and to
this day, "Time Stand Still" is very special to me, and always will be.
The live version *really* grabs me 'cause Geddy is really putting his heart
into it. Maybe we should drag Geddy's emotional(or lack of) way of singing
into this discussion. On the other hand, some times Neil is just a little
too overbearing in his word choice, but that varies with my mood.

12 beers-
I just watched/listened to the g/p video tape. Geddy *definatelty* says "I
drank twelve beers":
                         "I've been gone so long"
                         "lost count of the years"
			 "I sang some sad songs"
			 "I drank twelve beers"

and....
I also think "Cinderella Man" is a mega-cool/bitchen'/tour-de-force from hell.
Best song on the album, IMNSHO. 8-) Really! I think it's unmatched.

I'd like to make two suggestions to all TNMS contributors:

1. Please don't flame

   I relish each issue because TNMS rises above these sophomoric
   attacks.  Flaming is like flipping off a passing motorist; the
   safety of distance (separated by traffic and two sheets of glass,
   or a thousand miles of "net space") enables sheep to roar like
   lions.  The "LYNCH THAT BASTARD RANDALL STARK" flame, and others
   like it, do not belong in TNMS.

<A NAME="193013">2. Please define your "Subject:"</A>

   Some people have many topics to discuss so they define the
   subject as "Misc stuff" or "My two cents worth."  For those of
   us who haven't time to read each word of each issue, the subject
   definition is important for following particular themes of
   interest.  Vague definitions make that difficult.

	 This is Jacob's Ladder"

The last line was paraphrased, but the part in question (i.e. T.C.

In the book 'Visions', there is a statement that on the nights Rush
recorded ATWAS, they did a three night run at Massey Hall (Toronto).
There was mention that concerts on "home turf" are tough, because you
want everything to be just right.  ANYway, the first two nights went
very well, but the third night was jinxed; everything seemed to go
wrong.  Neil was seething by the time the show started, and apparently
really put the emotion into his playing.

The story notes that he played so ferverantly durning "The Temples of
Syrinx" that he "broke the snares on his snare drum".  It also says if
you listen to it closely enough, you can tell when it happens.  I tried,
but could not discern the place where it occurs.

I have two questions:

    1) When a drummer "breaks the snares" on the snare drum, what sort
       of sound/effect would it produce at the moment it happened, and
       how would it affect the drum's sound afterwards?

    2) Can somebody find exactly where in the song he did it?

Thanks for your responses,
