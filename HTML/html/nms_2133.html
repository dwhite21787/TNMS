So, you're probably all wondering, where the hell is my digest??

I was in Atlanta until last night, so I'm going through and getting caught
up on my email. I heard that the commercials for DS have been airing, if anyone
has a copy that they can either convert into Quicktime for me, or send me
a tape copy of (for the website) please let me know. 

I didn't even get to see DS until last night, I personally really like the
packaging. Leave it to Hugh... :-)

ps. I'll be going through the admin mail in the next day or so, and fixing up
the website with all sorts of new info. But first, the digest mail!

Having spent time on both sides of the pond, is is fairly typical for
British workers to get paid half in real $$$ what a US counterpart does,
but pay the same numerically in Sterling as a Yank does in $$$.  This
works out to 2.5-4 times the price, in adjusted currency.  You get
screwed.  I'd blame Tony Blair, but this inequality existed at least 15
years ago.  The only solution is to do what my family did--move to an
anarchic state like Indiana where we barely have any taxes and an $11
billion surplus at the state level.

  Totally agree...except for his recent soloing.  I am referring to the
TFE tour, in specifics.  I have a bootleg video of one of the Toronto
shows and it's got some pretty good closeups of geddy's solos in Driven
and CTTH...both good instances of him using index/middle to pick and thumb
on open E/A  (i play bass, too).  You will see a little more of this on
the DS video, once it comes out.  Here's what his driven solo looks like,
roughly:

I've listened to the recording I made of the album premiere several times
and I've noticed that they've removed the drum solo from the end of the
WM/FBN/ITM medley on the AFTK disk.  They did an amazing job because it's
virtually undetectable unless you know to expect it.

Anyone else notice this omission?

That is true sometimes, but definitly not always. When songs require it
(Turn the Page, Driven, etc) he does that, but on most of the older
material, as well as some new stuff, he plays in a more normal fashion.
What may be throwing you off (dunno how close you've been to see him play),
is that he often rests his thumb on the E string, making it look like a
classical guitar hand. This is what some nice binoculars and 20th row seats
will do for a bass player :) I noticed him doing this first when he played
Animate. I was looking to see if he alternated fingers on it or what, and I
saw hin anchoring on the E string, and using two fingers at once (not
alternate). It's possible it was just one finger, with both moving, but,
hey.....

Also, I'm almost positive it wasn't his thumbnail. The interview is from
Guitar magazine and is on the NMS website. I don't remember which issue.

To which I respond-

First, I don't need to prove how big a fan I am, my coworkers
are ready to kick my ass, because I've been living/breathing
this release like a maniac for two weeks now. They just know
how big a fan I am (and are getting a little sick of it right now).
Just the fact that we're on this list should show we're pretty big
fans.

Maybe you misread my post on cdnow. I didn't pay ten
bucks shipping, I received a ten buck *coupon* from
webcrawler. Cdnow charged $20.99 for the cd, $4.46
for release day delivery (10:30 am). That's $25.45 less
$10.00 means $15.45. The need, as you say, is to save
money. I don't live in the sticks, I'm located within the
five minute drive of three major music outlets. I'll bet
the cheapest one will be $19.99, plus 6% Engler makes
$22.39. Given the choice, I'd rather have DS and seven
dollars than just having DS.

Not to mention I think it's great to buy my favorite
progressive rock band's new release in a fashion such
as this! Seems fitting somehow.

Anyway, I had a blast catching the premiere on real
player. Chatting with some other nms-r's at the new
bulletin board (tnms). We got a little punchy near the
end, I think some were getting a little tired.

I've decided that Jo Robinson is a little odd. she always
sounds unprepared, off the cuff sort of. Wonder what
she's gonna do now that her station radically changed their
format. Anyway the premiere was great, Ged and Al
sounded good, but less jocular than I'm used to.

How many people thought (hoped) the "special gem" at
the end was gonna be Neil? I did. Maybe a recorded bit
of something. 2112 was just as well though.

I've got the day off Tuesday. I'm sure I'll be staring out
the bay window starting about 8:30 am, waiting for that
fed-x bus to roll in.

later,
scoots

Oh my God.  Unbeliveable.  Holy Shit.

This is *by far* the BEST live album I have ever heard.

Bravado and Resist are true gems, and 2112 is even more incredible

  Hard Rock and New Wave.  They've focused all there attention on Rap =

<A NAME="2133012">Subject: DS Premiere - JR</A>

Hey Rushians,

I am glad some others on the NMS stated their opinions
about how J. Robinson conducted some of the interview.

Personally, I did not care for the tone of the interview 
when she was discussing with Geddy about how Rush decided
 which songs to put on the live album.  Case in point, she said something like
"Well, so you guys listen to a song and go.....ummm...
Geddy played good, Alex played good, but Neil SUCKED....
better try another show's version of the song."  I, for one, was just 
struck the wrong way by this phrasing about Neil and "sucked."  
It's not like I took it to mean she was downing Neil, but it
just didn't sound professional, necessary, or tactful.
Of course, I'm pretty darn sensitive. I do not want to talk anymore
about Neil......Regardless, J. R.  doesn't seem like the most
sensitive or sincere person at least.  

I do give her some credit, she did extend condolences to Neil 
at the end of the interview.

I really think the DS premiere would have been MUCH cooler had 
Mike Portnoy from Dream Theater conducted the interview.

For God's sake let a great musician (and an obvious fan of Rush)
talk to Ged and Alex on national radio.

Along those lines, wouldn't it be nice if DT could open for Rush
someday!!!!!!????

later,

Chris

First the confession--haven't posted in two months.

Yup, a Nashville radio station, the 'Rock' at 105.9 fm has been playing
Rush since going on the air several months ago. 'Limelight', 'Tom
Sawyer', 'Permanent Waves'. This week even aired the new live album
in it's entirety along with interviews with Geddy and Alex. This
station even plays 'Working Man' occassionally.

The new album. After missing the last tour I was joyous in accepting
the entire 2112 set on 'Different Stages'. Now my only hassle is
whether to shell out--what, 30 clams?--to get it, or wait for it for Christmas
(the perfect secular gift!)

Sorry it this has been mentioned (I don't have time to read through each
TMNS).  At the beginning of Game 4 of the World Series, they were doing the
pre-game melodramatic nonsense that accompanies all such events.  As they
were showing highlights of the first three games to set the mood for the
evening, the background music they were playing seemed hauntingly familiar.
When the announcer took a breath, I realized the song was La Villa
Strangiato.  I have heard Tom Sawyer and Bravado used as background before,
but they're more known to non-Rush fans.  Also, they played 2 or 3 minutes
of the song, including the jazzy part in the middle (you know, the chromatic
part from A to A, if you're a musician).  I was disappointed that the few
Rush fans I know didn't notice.

Hey!

Excitement so thick...

cd-now just e-mailed to notify me that my ds copy was shipped on
Nov. 6th & should take 2 days. As Nov. 8th is a Sunday, I expect
it on Monday, before 10:30 am!

Ho-Hoo! Just feeling a little goofy looking forward to Monday the
9th instead of Tuesday the 10th!

Good day eh!

  I had the good fortune of finding a local establishment that was not 
afraid to sell DS a few days early.  I am currently listening to 
"Discovery" as I type and was overwhelmed by Alex's soloing into that 
part of "2112."
  All I can say is that the wait was well worth it.  The packaging is 
excellent (aside from the slip cases, oh well)and I like the collage 
tucked inside the cd case.  Well done!
  Well, I need to return to enjoying "Presentation."

Take Care,

P.S.  The bonus CD is amazing... 'nuff said!

I was lucky enough to find a store that already has DS on
sale here in Dallas. Overall the CD is really good, though  I
could do without hearing Tom Sawyer, Closer To The Heart
and Limelight YET Again. I really wish they'd included Double
Agent...but I digress.

Most "enhanced" CD's are little more than cheesy multi-media
press kits but DS breaks a whole new ground. The program,
ClusterWorks, is a mouse activated light show with controls for
pattern disbursement among other tweaks. It's on Disc one so
when you get to the end of 2112 pop it in your box.

It's really amazing!

Outside of the great things about Different Stages I keep hearing from the DJs 
on our local rock station, WRDU 106.1FM, I've got a couple of interesting Rush
"hearings" to report:

  During the 06 NOV 98 Carolina Hurricanes @ Washington Capitals NHL hockey
  game, I heard "Tom Sawyer" being played at the MCI Center during a time out
  in the third period...
  During the WNCN-17 (Raleigh, NC NBC affiliate) news on that same night, they
  played the jackhammer sound effect and the first few bars of "Force Ten" as
  a lead-in to a story they were doing on andro (the nutritional supplement).
  The pictures being shown were of weightlifters...
  WRDU is playing the *entire* 3-CD set of Different Stages tonight on 
  "Saturday Night Live." Show starts at 11:30pm EST.
 
Outside of that, it seems like Different Stages is getting the most press I've
seen/heard for a Rush album release in quite a while... certainly good to hear
the group mentioned so much in a positive light!

Cheers,

He outshines Lee & Peart in my opinion - sure, they're very good, 
but Alex is the virtuoso of the band.  His talent -does- show - 
it's just that unfortunately, guitarists are judged not by the

So what do we think would be fun for Rush to do on an interactive CD? 
What about . . .

 - Automating the "name that lyric" game that has been discussed recently

 - "Build Your Own Body" featuring body parts of Alex, Ged and Neil from
different periods of time.  Then you can assemble your own body using
different parts of different members.  Try Ged's face circa T4E with
Neil's handlebar mustache on Alex's Signals torso, or put Neil's Presto
era hairdo on Alex's Fly By Night era head on Ged's Subdivision
shoulders, hours of fun and breaks the ice at parties . . .

 - Maps of each tour with interactive concert programs from each tour
and pics of each show when you click on the city

 - "Name That Axe" featuring partial shots of the instruments that Rush
have used over time

 - A "Stupid Rock Music Critic Tricks" screen saver, giving random
samples of some of the memorable foolish quotes from the critics of Rush
(including some of the idiots-at-large on alt.music.rush and the R&RHOF
chat groups).  

 - An additional graphics package would allow you to print out faces of
some of the more vocal Rush critics with a dart board target
superimposed over their faces.  

 - The name of the person responsible for moving Phoenix to Arkansas on
the T4E shirts

 - Any other suggestions?

Hello all...

I live in the Chicago metro area and I used to listen to Jo Robinson's
former employer - the now defunct Rock 103.5.  When the T4E tour was
rolling (1st leg) in the fall of '96, I think Jo Robinson also interview
the band members.  She, and I think Lou Brutus, were at the show at the
United Center to welcome the band to the city.  She is, in fact, quite a
big Rush fan.  At least, that's what I could gather when listening to her
show.  

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to *hear* the interview the other day...I was
only able to read what the rush-mgr had posted.  When I first read the
interview, I originally thought that particular question about Alex not
doing much work was a little harsh.  But then I just figured she was
probably joking around with Alex given her previous contact with the band.

Well, anyway, I'm not really trying to side with Jo one way or the other.
I wasn't there at the interview and I really can't say what she meant by
it, but if I had to guess, I would say that she probably didn't mean it
that way.

*************
By JOHN POWELL -- Jam! Showbiz
TORONTO -- With the click of a mouse and the touch of a few keys, Rush
 fans are about to take Neil Peart's "Test For Echo" lyrics to heart. Those
purchasing the "Different Stages" live concert collection (out Nov. 10th) will
have the opportunity to "press a key" and truly "see amazing things".

The first disc in the three-CD set is specially enhanced to mimic the
 elaborate laser-light shows that are the trademark of any Rush concert.

Designed by Japanese computer artist Hisashi Hoda, the ClusterWorks
program, once installed and launched, will animate a computer screen with
intricate streams of colour and light. Ranging from tiny pin-point firebursts to
bold kinetic strokes, the elaborate patterns randomly pulse to Rush's music
as Disc One is played. The light shapes constantly evolve and never repeat.

Fans can also change the designs by moving their mouse and pressing
designated keys.

Hoda and his program came to the attention of Rush's bassist/vocalist and
"Different Stages" producer Geddy Lee, who was intrigued by the idea of
simulating a Rush laser show. Hoda flew from Japan to Toronto and
demonstrated the ClusterWorks program to the already computer/Net-savvy
Lee. He was impressed.

"It's kind of a delicate imagery and, when it was mentioned, there were
  things about it that reminded the record company of Rush's live light show,"
said Lee, speaking to JAM! in an interview at the offices of Rush's Anthem
Records. "So for that reason I had a look at it and I thought ... Well, as long
as it doesn't, you know, f--k anything up with the production of the album,
 maybe there are some people who would enjoy it, and it's of no extra cost."

Also of no extra cost is Disc 3, a special limited edition bonus which features
a long-lost Rush performance at London's Hammersmith Odeon during the
1978 "Farewell To Kings" tour.

Joking that the ClusterWorks enhancement may be of "special interest to
 people who smoke a lot of herbs", Lee had some light-hearted advice for

those Rush fans who are so inclined.

"Get your stash out and vibe out for an hour," said Lee laughing.

Fans can try out a demo version of ClusterWorks and Hisashi Hoda's other

projects at the OnScreen Art Project site at:

It's about 10:48 p.m. and it's storming outside.  About 5 minutes ago while
listening and recording the premiere here in Chicago during Tom Sawyer and
looking out the kitchen window, the brightest and loudest lightning struck --
I'd have to say at least within one block of my house.  I saw the incredibly
brilliant flash and the lights dimmed, went out and the entire house went
silent.  Then the thunder!  Woah, man it reverberated right through my heart!
It was so loud the house literally shook.  That HAD to hit something.  I
instantly thought to myself, damn, MY RECORDING!   Then the power came right
back on.  No pun intended, but was that a rush!  Nice shot of adrenaline.
Just thought I'd share that with you guys.  It was too cool.  All's well,
