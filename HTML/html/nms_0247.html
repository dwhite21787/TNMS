No, your network feed isn't down.  This is the first NMS sent since
last Friday, 5/24.  Monday was the holiday, and Tuesday got too hectic
and short on time.  No adjustment to your set is necessery.

Hi folks,

You know when your a Rush Fan when:

You hear jackhammers and you think of "Force Ten".

You know when your a Kim Mitchell fan when:

You want something to drink and you say "Might as well GO FOR SODA!!!"

There is a lot of talk about the title "Roll the Bones".  I'm not sure
if I like it or not, but that is beside the point.  Everybody seems to
be trying to pin it down to one meaning.  Judging from previous albums,
the title usually carries several meanings, and this helps to unify much
of the material.  (Rush get religious?  Don't think so.  They seem to
have a much more internal sense of "religion")  I wouldn't be supprised
if the album contained material on gambling, voodoo, and the Stones
(actually I am starting to see a connection).

I found the comment on women and Rush pretty accurate.  I don't have any
Penthouse Forum submissions or anything, but I have found that there are
an exceptional few that do enjoy Rush.  I find the biggest complaint
from any woman forced to listen to *my* choice of music in the car, is
Geddys voice.  Then these are the same people who were all over G&R.  I
never did understand.

I read in "Visions" that Rush played with The Police in Europe
(Amsterdam?) many years ago.  Being a big fan of both bands,  I was
wondering if anyone knew any further details such as interband relations
(like Stewart and Neil), set played by each etc...

That's enough rambling-
						Greg

PS   Anyone know anything about the *sound* of the next album?

Hey out there,

   Forgive for protecting the innocent, but I read lots of neat bits in the
last NMS, so I'll just flog them all.

   I'm sure the conversation about 'Rush Visions' has gone around, but in that
text, the author (more on him later) claims that Alex threatens to leave on a
rather regular basis.  Scary premise, but kind of comical by the same note.

   Back to the author, was it just me, or did his bias and enthusiam damage
the content of the book.  I read it, and just kept thinking, "Great, you get
to go Bowling with the boyz, and I don't.  Don't rub it in".  I loved the
factual information, but the content left a bit to be desired, IMHO.

   Are there any of these massive Rush social gatherings here on the West
coast?  I move to the west, get internet access, and find out that I'm leaving
the area with lots of great off-album Rush events.  Bummer.  Hey, let me know.

[ It's just a matter of somebody saying "Gee, I think I'll have a Rush 
  party."  Post to the list and see who shows up!              :rush-mgr ]

Thanx,
Dave

P.S.  La Villa Strangiato is my favorite song, followed by (also IMHO) the
appropriately ending Red Barchetta.  Its like that exhilirating feeling that
you get after a really fast drive.

<A NAME="247005">Subject: Info on Spirit Of Rush</A>

I saw a message a while back about a Rush magazine called
"The Spirit of Rush." I decided to see what it was about.
I wrote and received an issue (dated Autumn/Winter 90/91).
I thought all of you might want to know what it is like
(if you haven't already seen it).

The magazine is not a full-color glossy magazine. It is
black-and-white, but does contain pictures and
a few advertisements (the magazine is published in
London, so all the adverts are from overseas). It is put
together rather well (physically) and doesn't look
like it is going to fall apart. The cover consists of
some nicely drawn artwork of pieces of Rush's album
covers.

This issue consists of about 55 pages of:

    Interviews, old and new:
        - Hemispheres interview
        - Presto interview
        - The World According to Peart
        - Off the Record '82
    Rush Trivia:
        - people tell something about the band
          that others might be interested in
    Signals:
        - mail from readers
    Chronic:
        - Discussion about "Chronicles"
    Show & Tell:
        - Music Express Mag, Feb 1990
    Rush Backstage Club:
        - Another Rush newsletter
    Permanent Trades:
        - Personals
    Lyrics from "Caress of Steel"

Overall, there is not much "new and exciting" stuff
in it (but considering this issue was probably mailed
out last November, it is understandable). But I was
sent a printout of some very recent news, including
some info about their upcoming album ("Roll The Bones",
as I'm sure you've all heard).

Along with the issue, I received a list of live audio
tapes, live video tapes, audio interviews, video
interviews, song videos, commercially released videos,
miscellaneous videos, books, press kits, laminated
backstage passes, 7" records, cassette singles,
misc. cassettes, misc. 7" records, 10" records,
12" records, misc. 12" records, CDs, and misc stuff,
magazine/newspaper articles, and posters. Some of this
stuff might be for sale, but I am not sure. I am going
to write in to find out.

The mag is put out 4 time a year.  For subscription
info, please see the previous message in an earlier
TNMS, or email me.

I am hoping that more people will subscribe and support
it. It seems to me that the mag really needs more reader
support.  PLEASE NOTE: I am NOT affiliated with this mag
in any way. My first contact with it was yesterday, when
I received this issue.

Well, I hope I didn't bore all of you.

[ Not me!  Thanks for this review.  It might make me get off my arse and
  send in a subscription!  Theoretically, the next issue will have an
  article with/on the NMS.                                    :rush-mgr ]

If no one has answered this question already....

two?  Why not all the astronauts?  Who are Young and Crippen, specifically?

Young and Crippen were the first two astronauts to fly the Space Shuttle
Columbia.  I think it shows a lot of class that a Canadian band was so moved
by the achievement of the United States' shuttle program that they were
compelled to write a song (and an awesome one at that!).

P.S.  In case anyone cares, (which I doubt) two other shuttle astronauts, Matt
Mattingly and Hartsfield, were graduates of this institution, Auburn
University.  Other than military academies, Auburn has more astronauts than
any other university.

   Hey, I was just listening to Permanent Waves and I noticed on
the CD cover, the newspaper headline clearly reads "Dewey defeats
Truman" (on the CD), wasn't that supposed to be blacked out?
   While on the topic, I'm in Canada and bought my CD in Canada.  In
the lyrics to "Free Will" I have: "If you still choose not to decide
You cannot have made a choice".  So Canada's (or at least the one I
have) version is not the "official" lyrics, either.

[ Hmmm, what is the label this is on? Anthem? Polygram? Other?   :rush-mgr ]

This will probably evoke some nasty replies, but here goes.

I think the reason there aren't more female Rush fans is that women tend to
sing or dance to music and most like music with more of a dance-like beat.

To appreciate Rush, you have to really sit down and just LISTEN.  Additionally
you have to study the lyrics and listen again for all of the awesome parts
you miss.  However, most women listen to music casually, while they're
doing something else and aren't really paying attention.

That's a big generalization, but by far it's been my experience.  Everytime
I've sat a women down and tried to get them to understand what is so AWESOME
about Rush and what makes them so different, they've listened for a few
minutes, nodded and asked if I could put on some Vanilla Ice (or something
similar).

Hello once again!!

With regard to the possible meaning of "Roll the Bones" - what if it's
another phrase that's gonna have lots of meanings once it's
incorporated into the whole album or even one single song? Ya know,
kinda like how "Hold Your Fire" did for both the album as a whole
*and* for "Mission." The meanings will probably go a bit farther than
the religion & drugs possibilites. We all know how creative Neil is
with his lyrics - I bet this is another one of his little
plays-on-words/message-to-society kind of deals....

As for the "Women who like Rush" topic - well, I'm one & I happened to
"discover" them all by myself - with only the aid of the radio station
where I consciously heard my 1st Rush tune (i.e. I probably heard
others before that but didn't know/listen-carefully-enough-to-care who
did it; it was "Limelight," some Sunday afternoon in May, 1981 on KRBE
in Houston <before they went Top-40> BTW <if anybody cares!>)

I have only met 2 other women who are really devout fans <one of which
subscribes to TMNS! - Hi, Amy!!>, and I know only 3 guys who are
really into them (I introduced 2 of them to Rush). I have yet to have
an SO who really likes them - but that'd be really cool!! Why do I
like them so much? Well, I realized early on that since their lyrics
weren't focused primary on love, they didn't treat women like pieces
of meat (like too many others I could mention) - in fact, they don't
mention  women (specifically) at all, really. They *are* The Thinking
Man's/Woman's Band IMHO - one of the main reasons being that they
don't stoop so low as to discuss/emphasize their sex drives in their
work.   Oh, BTW - I went to the Presto show in Phoenix last year alone
- I dragged myself there & enjoyed it immensely!!

Kinda on this topic - I've been watching lots of videos lately (now
that school's out - yay!) and have been fairly disgusted by all these
pretty boys parading their macho-ness around. But that's not the
point, just an opinion. The real point is - do any of you get "The
Jukebox Network" through your cable systems or is this just in
Arizona? It's pretty cool - you can call up & request videos & they
actualy play them - nothing like that stupid ol' Dial-MTV. For the
most part, the video selection's pretty interesting - mainly a mixture
of metal & rap. They had "The Pass" on there a long time ago - I only
saw it once & never saw the # to request it by again, however.  :-(

Ok - that's all!!

Your best bet would be OPERATION:MINDCRIME, since it tells a story with
intricate album engineering.  There is more of an edge to the music on
this, compared to most of Rush, but there -are- similarities.
  Queensryche's current album, EMPIRE, is not a concept album like
MINDCRIME, but is still a very fine piece of work.  Peter Collins has
worked with both groups.

It is no coincidence that the chap who introduced me to Queensryche
is a major Rush fan.  He even has business cards (printed in red, of
course) identifying himself as a Rush fan interested in any and all
rare Rush items and oddments.  THIS is dedication....

How ya all doin?

I have met many of women who like RUSH.  In fact, its surprised me a few
times because I wouldn't have guessed them as a fan.  My 'girlfriend'
has been the biggest RUSH fan I have ever met (she was the one who
turned me on to RUSH years ago).

Queensryche? how can they be compared to RUSH?  Not ten (five) years ago
they could only be heard on heavy-metal radio shows late at night along
with the likes of Anthrax and Metallica.  Only recently have they
changed their style to a more popular "listenable" radio playable one.

as long as I'm on my soapbox....

Rolling the Bones ins't such a bad title.
In a Grateful Dead song off of 'American Beauty' they sing :
 "Roll Them Laughin Bones"
In the movie 'Willow' the old wizard "rolled the bones" to see who would
go on their quest.
When he did this he said something like "when you roll the bones they
don't tell you anything, so just make something up"
Just a thought.

re: Queensryche & Rush

   There has been a lot of talk recently about the similarity (or otherwise)
   of Queensryche to Rush. Being a fan of both groups, I felt I should
   respond to this.

   My feeling is that both groups tend to talk about similar topics, but from
   an entirely different perspective. Both groups examine ideas and concepts
   that are important, not just now, but in the future, and as such they tend
   to appeal to an intelligent audience.

   Queensryche seem to look at the world from the point of view of "These are
   the nasty things that might happen if we continue the way we are going...".
   To illustrate this point they concentrate on the darker side of humanity,
   and very few of their concept albums have a 'happy' ending. You might say
   that they are shouting a warning about the possible effects in the future
   of trends visible today - indeed one of their albums is titled "The
   Warning". A lot of their subject matter is concerned with the impact that
   technology, in particular (Artificial Intelligence) computers, might have
   upon society. To give a particular example, the album "Rage for Order" is
   (I think) about an android that breaks free of its programming and wants
   to experience human emotions, especially love. But its programmers and
   controllers refuse to accept that it is 'alive', and switch it off,
   effectively killing it. Queensryche demand the question "Is this murder?".

     Rush on the other hand take an entirely different approach to a similar
   subject. Peart too, seems to be concerned that technology may be advancing
   more swiftly than the minds that control it ("science like nature must also
   be tamed..."), but rather than just pointing out possible future problems,
   he also tries to suggest some answers ("we need someone to talk to & someone
   to sweep the floors", "to sow a new reality, closer to the heart").Rather
   than talk about human-like robots, Rush often put forward the idea of
   robot-like humans, in other words the dehumanising effect of modern
   technology, stifling the artistic spirit ("pulse of dying power in a clench-
   ing plastic fist...").

     In general, Rush adopt a much more positive approach to humanity,
   emphasising the achievements of mankind and glorying in its greatness,
   rather than predicting doom and gloom. Nevertheless, there has recently been
   a note of concern creeping into some of Peart's writings (Distant Early
   Warning, Red Tide), which might indicate Peart's 'faith in human nature' is
   beginning to wane?

   Musically, Rush are far superior to QR. Although QR are superb musicians in
   their own right, and can express intense emotional highs & lows in some
   of their songs (eg. any one from Operation:Mindcrime), they do not have
   the technical brilliance of Peart or Lee. Moreover their style is very
   much 'in your face' and friends have commented that even QR's ballads are
   too intense.

   Anyway, that's just my opinion, comparing & contrasting two of my favourite
   groups. For any of you who haven't yet heard any QR, I'd suggest "Operation
   :Mindcrime", and "Rage for Order" as two of the best (non-Rush) albums ever
   made. Also, while we are on the subject of Rush-like groups, you might like
   to check out an album by a group called Dream Theater called "When Dream &
   Day Unite". This is a truly awesome album, combining excellent lyrics
   (worthy of Peart!), with superb musical ability, all played at breakneck
   speed.

     That's enough for now.

	You know you're a Rush fan when:

-  You smile every time someone uses the term "Rush hour" or "It was quite
   a Rush" etc.

By the way, is someone keeping a record of all these? I think it would make
a good entry to the 'special' directory at syrinx.

It is now 4PM, Monday afternoon.  I've been working on a few modification
to the mail based archive server in order to get it to run on another
machine.  If you have sent a request within the last 24 hours, it may
have been eaten by my testing.  Sorry about that.  I expect the server
to be back online by Wednesday.  I apologize for any problems this may
have caused.  Till then, Rush on...

This will probably be my last post of the semster, so bear with me
(This could get emotional...:)

First, a heap of thanks to our holier-than-thou Rush-mgr. Dave, you've done
a hell of a job raising your "child" and I hope you continue to do so. This
mailing gives me something to look forward to at work!

[ Ummm, I'm not sure your adjective is exactly what you meant... at least
  I hope not!  :-)                                                rush-mgr ]

Billboard magazine has instituted a new way to tabulate their album charts.
With this change comes the establishment of something called "Album Catalog"
featurung Greatest Hits compilations and older albums from established
artists. Last week on this chart, Moving Pictures was #18.

I also wanted to note that the Rush song used on the news program several
years ago was ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY Mystic Rhythms on the NBC program
called "1986." (I had to get that out of my system).

Well, that's about it from this end. Hope everyone has a great summer (it
looks as though it will be a hot one on the East coast).

"Throwing (Roll?) the Stones (Bones?)" - hopefully this mess will be
straightened out soon so we can kick things up again in the fall!!

Keep the faith and talk to you in September.

Here is Alex's last lick in the guitar solo to YYZ, found at 2:48 on
the MP CD.  This might be how Billy Sheehan might play this lick on
the bass.  In the tab, the letters below the notes represent the rhythmic
value of the notes (S = sixteenth note, S3 = sixteenth-note triplet, E =
eighth note).  The upper register notes can be played with either the left
hand (easier) or the right hand (harder).  To play with the left hand,
reach over with your right hand and play the B (4th fret) with your index
finger.  Then hammer-on the A (14th fret), hammer-on the B (16th fret),
pull off to the A, and then pull off to the B (4th fret).  Above the upper
register notes I have put the fingerings I use when using the left hand.
To play with the right hand, finger the B with your left index finger, and
use the first and third fingers of your right hand to hammer-on and pull off
the upper register notes.  The same fingerings can be followed, except for
the last triplet figure.  To play this figure, I play the C (5th fret) with
my left hand middle finger and the Eb (8th fret) with my right index
finger.  Of course, if you have a 5 or 6 string w/ a high B string, you can
play it just like Alex, by using the left hand and always pulling off to
the open B string, transposing my tab down four frets.  I've always wanted
to play this with another guitarist in a band, but so far have only played
with the Lerxstmeister on various CD's and videotapes.  Hope you enjoy it!

Thanks for all the Queensryche recommendations y'all sent me.  I picked a
couple of discs up this weekend.  I like "Empire" a lot - there is a *clear*
Rush influence all through that one.  "Operation Mindcrime" is pretty good,
too - but the way the singer shrieks and wails like a metal-cliche is quite
distracting.  (Hmmm, which other group that we all know has had *that* said
about it???  ;^)

I'll have to agree - serious Rush fans are likely to enjoy listening to QR,
too.

It's not near either one!  Hmm.  I've been there and taken
pictures.  Probably the easiest thing for your friend
to do is to take the Bloor-Danforth subway; Bloor and Danforth
are the same street; Bloor is the name west of the Don Valley Pkwy, and
Danforth east of the DVP.  Anyway,  there is a subway stop at Pape.
Get off and take picture.  The signs are in both Greek and English
and there is also a Danforth-Pape library.

Other sign we took a picture of is an old address for Rush
fan club members on Glen Cameron and Willowdale.  This is
the old neighbourhood where Rush grew up...

Anyway anyone with any more Toronto questions please ask; I
have visited there, was two days away from moving there and
decided to stay here in Texas.  I know enough about the city
but not so much that I don't have the visitor's perspective...

Rush is a group that gets around by word of mouth.  Since men/boys/males
make up the overwhelming majority of Rush fans, it makes sense that
men remain the biggest number of fans; guys tell their guy friends
about Rush.  Also, Rush is a performer's group; most rock musicians
are also guys.  Finally, the way I got into Rush, sadly, was through
a guy who was an incredible fan.  So stereotypical.  But how else
would I have been exposed to it?  The radio doesn't really play them
a lot...and to my credit I turned on several of my female friends to
Rush.

"Rolling the Bones" could be taken from a short fantasy story written by Fritz
Leiber in the late '60's called "Gonna Roll the Bones".

"Roll the Bones" in that story meant crap shooting. Only the protagonist of
the story was rolling the bones with the devil . . .

In absolutely unrelated-to-RUSH news, R.E.M.'s latest, "Out of Time", is #1 on
the Billboard Pop Album chart this week. Kudos to my other favorite band!
Paula Abdul will likely replace them next week :-(

Good day, eh?

	Well, I've returned from a brief vacation in New York, and my
sun-burn (from NY?) hadn't even healed when I thought I would post.
Basically, I was driven to post because I was offended by a previous
TNMS ...  :)

	HMMMPHHH!  If you had said "a disproportionate number of small
female RUSH fans" I would let you get away with it, but since you didn't ...

	All I have to say to this is, "Who got *you* hooked, buddy?"
Well, okay, one more thing ... you have good taste in women.  :)

	Just for the record, and the general knowledge of anybody who cares -
*I*, a mere female, am responsible for getting this gentleman hooked on
RUSH.  Unfortunately, I don't think there are any particularly funny stories
to relate regarding this event ... Can you think of any, Brian?

	On a sad note, though, I've spent the last three years at JHU
trying to get a few more girls/women (whatever) to enjoy RUSH a little more.
All of my roommates have turned their noses up at the music (and slammed
their doors shut) so I think I'm fighting a losing battle...

Someone in a previous issue was discussing how the two titles
that are floating around (rolling the bones, throwing the stones)
could be changed around to be an alusion to rolling stone.  Well,
I was just talking to cygnus(Marshall Robin) and we came up with
the full title of the next album.........

ROLLING STONE CAN SMOKE MY BONE

well, wadda ya think???  A statement against all the bad press
rolling stone has given them over the years?  Sounds good
to me, this will send those losers into a tizzy.

It has happened.  The mail-based archive server at ingr.com lives.  I
have (foolishly?) agreed to continue Keith's legacy.  The new setup
seems to be working.  If anyone has trouble obtaining their files,
use the server's MESSAGE facility to report the problems.
