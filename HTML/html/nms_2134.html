After listening to Discs 1 and 2 of Different Stages, I actually had to
choke back a tear when the 1978 version of Xanadu on the 3rd disc
started up.

So many years have passed us Rush fans, ya know?

On Saturday, I watched the Buckeyes blow another solid chance at a National
Championship.  On Sunday, I'm still so upset that I can't even bear to read
my newspaper.  On Monday, I have to take a bunch of crap from a few
co-workers who aren't Buckeye supporters.

And then there was Tuesday.  I leave work at 9:50am to "run an errand."  At
10:07, I arrive at Best Buy.  At 10:08, I'm pleasantly surprised to see
that Different Stages is "specially priced" at $16.99.  At 10:25, I return
to work and listen...and listen ...and listen.

I guess football isn't so important afterall!

hey -

well, a couple of things I'd like to say.

I am so envious of you guys in the U.S. getting DS today.  so, 
I had a great time listening to a boot-leg of the CP tour this 
morning to cheer myself up!  "closer to our hearts" is its name, and 
has a great version of CTTH - really.

so, to pass time, and be thinking about the new stuff, I have spent 
all afternoon [at work.....] looking at the NMS web site.  I have 
been checking out the old interviews.  thanks for all the efforts 
that people have put into collating that stuff!  it is great for us 
here in the UK, as we have had so little Rush material to read over 
the years - especially the early stuff. I enjoyed reading some as old 
as 1974.

well, that's it really.  it just kinda hit me today [again] what an 
impact the music has on me....AND I CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT MONDAY!

be good -

Walnut Hill Lane, I drooled on myself.  I've been anticipating this =

Just to give my two cents. I am pleased over all with Different Stages, but
I am disappointed with the packaging. I do appreciate that they did not use
a double CD plastic case (like Chronicles), but as I am sure most of you
have noticed, the third disc is laying loose in the case. I almost dropped
it as I opened it for the first time. I am by no means an engineer of CD
packaging, but come on, how many poor souls are going to drop this disc
when the first open the album.

Take care all, and enjoy the alum.

It certainly sounds like there's rhythm guitar in the background of Alex's
solo at the end of Driven. Where do you suppose that's coming from? Do they
have that sequenced, or do they have someone offstage playing? Neither?

I walked to the horrid, horrid chain store. I had to sole intention of
purchasing DS & getting the hell out of there. Little did I know, so
much more was "in store" for me....

As I neared the entrance of (blank), I had such a heart-warming thought:
Everywhere, in the US anyway, thousands of Rusheads are doing the same
thing as me. It was an overwhelming sense of solidarity. The first thing
I notice as I enter (blank) is that the live version of "Resist" is
playing. Loudly. Next, the price is not bad. $20.99 for 3 discs is not
too much to ask. I had a feeling that the crappy pimpbait chain store
would try & drain me of the last coppers in my piggy bank. Finally, when
I went to purchase the thing, a 30something business looking woman had
beat me to it. I almost hugged her, but I didn't want to surprise her &
knock DS out of her hands.

I'm listening to it at work, and I couldn't be happier. DS sounds like
the best bootleg ever recorded. It's raw. It has mistakes, but the
sound... The sound. It's massive. The packaging is outstanding. It's
really funny. Very quirky. I'm happy to be a Rushead on this day.

And there was much rejoicing (yeaaa...),
Chad

Hello Rush fans!

I just picked up the Different Stages CD, and I have to admit, it's
great!  While I was listening to it, I discovered during "Show Don't
Tell," There is an extra voice along with Alex.  Is that Neil?  It
sounds like whomever is singing the harmony is just a little
uncomfortable with it... I may be wrong...:)
I still like it...:)
Anyone know?

I have it!  I am jazzed.  The sound is great.  The version of 2112 is a
major improvement over the one on ATWAS.  The new Rythym Method is a
heart pounding as it was live.

But...

I can live with the paperboard packaging.  But did they have to leave
the Hammersmith disk completely unattached?  I'm not looking forward to
having to catch it everytime I open the package.  Also, I wish they had
made 2112 one track.  I can't put it on scramble with other disks
because I wouldn't be able to tolerate having 2112 broken up like that.
Outside of that, and that I would have picked a slightly different set
list, DS is an excellent album.

Well, as I listen to Bravado here on my computer, I am astounded at the
clarity of the music for a live recording - especially the drums.  I can't
imagine this with 'phones on later!
Er, um, what was the point of that bogus "enhanced" crap??  I could see if you
could get it to do that stuff along to the CD music but you can't.  Now it is
taking up space as a screensaver I don't want.  Anyone know how to get this
junk off my system???

Overall, thumbs up.  The '78 CD's artwork is already serving as my wallpaper!
What do the shirts say that the guys have on who are dragging Al away?

P.S. - It is a treat to have some of the Great Woods performances on the CD as
I was there.  Neil had an Ace bandage on his right elbow that show but still
had a performance worthy of capturing on CD.  Amazing!!!

I'm up to the "the river" part of Tom Sawyer.  I still have YYZ & a cd to go
b4 finishing my first go 'round of Different Stages, but I have two words to
this possible going away present from our heroes....thank you!

I got chills from the the beginning of the into of Dreamline and have had a
smile on my face since.  Being a fan since MP & audience member of a dozen
shows, the raw feel of this mix and apparent "real" sound compared to ESL &
SOH makes me like 'stages even more!  I rolled my eyes when I saw the Trees,
Tom Sawyer & CTTH on a live album again, but these editions made me change my
mind.   

Along with the cover and liner notes art, this is a fantastic retrospective
that if this their last go at it(which I hope not), then I feel very
satisfied.

I am in awe of the quality of the Different Stages album.  This album
represents
the best of Rush and I am certain of that.  The spirit and drive of this
band is there.
The emotion and honesty is there.  The first two discs - amazing; the third
disc - I cannot describe the wonder of this GEM of a disc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At this time, I would like to thank Geddy, Alex, and Neil for
their great contribution to music and to my life.

Thanks guys for all these years of great music.  (Be it only
since 1989 for my humble self).

Hi everybody out there:

Buenos Aires. Today, Nov. 10th, 2 PM. I had DS in my hands. No release parties
around here. But I wanted SO BAD to celebrate this!!!
My wife and I will arrive at the same time at home tonight, as usual.
So I called her to her office and told her: wanna celebrate! (she doesn't like
Rush so much)(anyway she went to the USA to see them live with me
twice...)(guess that was just because of the "shopping" part of our tour...)

So, I bought a nice a cold bottle of the best white wine in town, some candles,
and told her: "wanna put together the two more loved things in my life, I feel
really out of my mind tonight, I wanna have tonight the best of both worlds,
Rush and you..."

I guess she understood so well, 'cause we made love like crazy for 1 1/2 hours!
and after that, the cold wine, and Different Stages filling every corner of the
house, enchanting us so deeply !

So, I discovered that you may have to take care of listening to DS ! It takes
out the deeper instincts of everyone of us.
I never took drugs in my life, and I'll never do it, but if I have to guess
what is it like, I guess is would be like tonight.

So, Neil, Geddy, Alex, thank you for inspire these kind of unforgettable
moments in anyone of us.

to be a done deal. Why do I say this, you ask? I have noticed a very
important sign in the artwork and graphics of this extremely awesome album
that foretells the End!

Yellow, red, blue. The tinkertoys are yellow, red, and blue, and inside the
liner notes (which are kinda hard to get to imho) there is a yellow, red,
and blue bar on the track listing page. Some of you music fans out there
may be able to think of another album that had these three colours
prominently in the artwork.

_Synchronicity_, The Police

Well, _Synchronicity_ was the end for another excellent band (I love that
album), and it incorporated those VERY SAME COLOURS!!! The next year, the
Police broke up--with some bitter acrimony--and Sting went on to do a bunch
of solo musak :-( and conquer the world with AOR shit, IMNSHO.

Come on, which would you rather listen to, "Don't Stand So Close to Me" or
"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"? Me too, although "De Do Do Do, De Da Da
Da" was kind of a low point.

Intentionally or not, the Rush Gods have given us a sign: the band is no
more, kapoot, zero, fin. It's all over folks.

Or I'm full of hot air! :-)

Clusterworks:  Wow!  That program that comes with disc 1 is REALLY COOL!
Command-I turns on the feature that makes the patterns respond to the
playing audio CD (sorry, Mac-only feature).  It's a real trip!

2112:  Anyone else bugged by the fact that it is played in a lower key?
I've heard it twice now, and it still bugs me.  I hope I get used to it
because it is interfering with me being able to enjoy it.
Funny, I didn't even notice it when I saw Rush on the T4E tour (San Jose, CA)!

Hey all, 
    Finally the big day has arrived and I must say that the CD just plain
rocks.  Various thoughts on the album:

     I love the bootleg feel to the album with all the crowd noise kept
in.  Definitely makes it my favorite album to date. 

     The bass sounds great, nice and distinct.  The solo in Driven is
especially good.  The way Geddy plays around with the echos is great.  

     2112 is quite a piece of work-gives me chills when I listen to it.
The "hey" cheers are great, they take me back to the concert.

     The artwork, etc. is awesome.  I love the Tinkertoy statue with the
big crowd around it (the tinkertoy tatoo and shaved into the back of the
guys head is a nice touch).  It's also great how the tinkertoys are
scattered around (I like the one tucked into one of the boxes in one of
the photos on the memorabilia layout).  The Hammersmith Odeon picture
was hilarious.  The Guys show some great humor with Geddy as a scalper,
Alex being dragged away in a straight jacket, and Neil smiling from the
second story.  It's also nice the touches to detail they included (colors
of CDs associated with the different stage tinkertoys for example).  
  
     On a different note, all these tinkertoys makes me think that they'd
look great on the new TNMS t-shirts.  Anyone else like the idea?

Overall the album brought back some great memories from the T4E tour like
camping out in the rain at the arena box office to get 2nd row center (and
feel the power of the box office when they locked out all the other ticket
outlets so the box office would have first dibs), great lasers especially
when they reflected around the whole arena, finally being able to shout
"hey" during 2112 and being able to hear the whole thing, and watching the
whole place go nuts once 2112 started up.

At the store the other day I was looking through the Rush section, and they had
two different copies of the Hemispheres remaster.  One had the standard ugly
brain/Apollo/Dionysus cover, but the other had a simple-yet-elegant black cover
with the Hemispheres logo in red and yellow, which is the one I bought.  Of
course, when I opened it up, the brain cover slipped out.  Have the remaster
packaging people finally decided to disguise the cover, or was it just a glitch?
Personally, I like the black cover better, and left it on top.  I mean, how many
naked butt guys do we need in our CD collection?

Hello...

Got my copy of DS today... for the most part I really liked it.  I like
the mixing strategy Ged (and Paul) used this time around... more organic
and real...it also helps that the music mix is so varied because even
though I like the way they captured the sound for the ASOH record, the
music was from a more "polished" era.... I know some people probably
lament over having "Closer to the Heart" again... but check out the
upfront way it's mixed on DS.... the ending on that kicks serious
tail.... and it leads to 2112, which brought a chill down my spine that
hasn't left me yet....

I like the '78 show as well... still takes me a few moments to adjust
the ears to listening to Ged fly that high though...  Cinderella Man is
a real treat !!!

I do wish they would have included more of the interaction with the fans
that they had on the CP tour.... but I guess that's my own fault for
owning too much *footware*....

I pulled out a magnifying glass at work because I wanted to see what was
on the shirt of the guy hauling Alex away... I think it says "Jolly
Teabag Body Guard"... which makes it look like they are going to take
him away in the truck.... Anybody know what or who the signifigance of
"Jolly Teabag" is ?

Salt Lake City, UT

Dear Fellow Rush Students,

I cannot begin to paint to you the feelings of this heart upon hearing
the new Rush live album, "Different Stages."  I drove to Media Play after
work yesterday and bought one of only a few remaining copies.  I drove
home and popped set one into my portable cd player and listened through
the headphones.  Alex's intro to Dreamline sent a chill down my back.  I
sat back in the recliner and for the next three and a half hours soaked
in history, the history of a band I've faithfully followed now for over
twenty years.  

Needless to say, I am very pleased with the album.  As a bassist, I was
particularly charmed with Geddy's bass lines throughout the album.  When
I loaded the third disc, the bonus disc, I was ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY. 
The London performance of Bastille Day was even more exciting than the
"All The World's A Stage" version (which was tremendously exciting and
full of energy).  I had always wanted very much to hear 
"A Farewell to Kings" live on an album.  Yesterday I got my wish.  

When I finished the album, I sat back reflecting.  My ear cartilage hurt
from the hard plastic Sony headphones.  My inner-ears hurt from the
volume.  I remembered that I first saw Rush at the Salt Palace, in Salt
Lake City, twenty years ago.  I looked up the date: May 17, 1978.  Then I
looked at the date of the Hammersmith Odeon performance: February 20,
1978.  I cannot begin to paint to you the feelings of this heart when I
realized I had seen Rush just a few months after this third disc, the
Hammersmith Odeon concert, was recorded and lay in Geddys Lee's basement,
only to magically re-emerge in the palm of my hand twenty years later.  I
can't think of a better moment to celebrate my twenty years with Rush. 
This dear experience will remain with me for the rest of my life.

Thank you Rush fans for participation in this forum.  Ideas and
experiences about Rush from fans all over the world have certainly
enriched my long association with 
Rush's music.

Sincerely,
Barry J. Cook

<A NAME="2134038">Subject: DO NOT PATRONIZE HMV RECORDS</A>

Hi Rush heads,

I went to HMV record store yesterday, Tuesday, to pick up my copy of
Different Stages.  For those of you who don't know, HMV is one of the
largest retailers in NYC and I went to their superstore on 34th street and
6th avenue.  There are about five racks of new releases when you first walk
into the store.  Do you think they had DS on display?  NO!  I asked a kid
who worked there (actually, he was probably 20 or so, but a kid in my eyes)
where the new Rush CD was and he laughed and told me they didn't get it in
yet.  I answered, "but today is the release date!"  He just smiled and said
that they don't always get it on the release date.

Anyway, I vowed to never patronize HMV again.  I found a little record store
that had it.  The store is about one tenth the size of HMV, but they
certainly had it on display and in the Rush section.

It is in my hands now and I can't wait to get home from work and pop it in.

Because I know the rush mgr hates advertising, anyone in Midtown Manhattan
who wishes to know the name and location of this store can email me
privately.  

P.S. - they are selling it for only 24.99.  I'm sure HMV would have sold it
for more.

Peace,
Max

Well, this is pretty cool.   Today, KEGL in Dallas played an entire hour
of Rush (less 30 of commercial b.s., of course) as their daily nooner
program.  They are playing tons of stuff from DS, and really giving the
new cd a good plug.  Maybe it'll let some folks know there's a new cd
out and it will help it on the charts.  Is there a way on the web to
find out where it entered the charts?

To Paul in the UK, I paid $24.99 at Virgin yesterday for DS, and seems
like to me that when we lived in Scotland we paid about a pound for
every dollar we'd spend in the US.  So, you're a doctor, right!  Scarf
up the cash and get the thing!  25 pounds well spent!  Cheers, Lara

$17.99 -- what I paid for Different Stages (at the CD Warehouse on Forbes

for $20.99. 

What are folks paying elsewhere?  I was expecting to pay more.

Greetings fellow Rush freaks-

    Picked up "Different Stages" yesterday, and absolutely love it. 
>From the awesome packaging to the prestine sound quality, it is a
first rate live album all the way. The "2112" is truly amazing.  I was
slightly disappointed by the apparent lack of availability of the
album, however.  The local Virgin megastore in Manhattan practically
had it hidden.  It wasn't among the new releases, and they didn't have
the cassette(Rush is the only band whose albums I buy on cd and
cassette, you know, for the car).  Any word on a video?

Last week, someone on TNMS posted a few e-mail addresses where we could
write to MTV.

Well...I sent the same e-mail to both of the addresses last week Friday.  I
wrote to them, in a very sarcastic, but very disgruntled tone, how MTV has
no taste in music, how they've totally sold out, and how they have more
stupid programs on about whiny Gex-Xers than anyone really cares to know
about!  I even wrote as my "sincerely", "Please e-mail me back asap, and I
don't mean an auto-response.  I mean an actual typed out response from
SOMEONE at MTV."

It is now Wednesday, and I have yet to receive any response from MTV...all
I have to say is, "Go fu**ing figure!"

By the way...Different Stages?  Oh God.  I...I think I'm gonna cry, it's
THAT good!

Also, anyone on TNMS have Dream Theater's latest live stuff...the video and
the double disc?  Speakin' of DT, I have to agree with the person who said
Mike Portnoy should have conducted the interview for the world premiere of
DS.  When I saw DT in Chicago this past May at the Vic Theatre, I was lucky
enough to get an after-show pass, and this one dood asked Portnoy, "Will
Dream Theater ever tour with Rush?"  Mike, being the nice guy & Rush fan
that he is, politely responded, "Well...Rush is really having a rough time
right now, and we've never been asked to tour with them.  But, if they ever
did ask us, we would DEFINITELY jump at the chance!"  So, I would have to
agree that a Rush concert with Dream Theater opening/playing with Rush for
a few songs would be so kick ass!  We can only hope and pray that Rush will
be back sometime soon.

Cheers all...

I agree with you, but in a much different way.  I order from CD Now and
other places quite often.  It's convenient, it's cheaper.  At the same time,
however, by shopping at my local retailer, I am supporting my local economy,
and in the long run, that is more benefecial to me personally.  The real
issue is then which is more important to you?  I find that they both are
important to me, depending on which day of the week you talk to me.  Back to
the Rush!
