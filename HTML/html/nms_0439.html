Hi all, didja miss me?  :-)

Well, I'm back, and things seem to have run rather smoothly while I was
away.  I'd like to extend a bit THANKS to our founder, Jimmy Lang for his
work in keeping the NMS going while I was gone.  Thanks Jimmy, and where
are my tapes!?!?!??  :-)

I don't think there's too much actual substance to convey here, just a
couple of things I've noticed over the past few weeks/months:

    1) This is a discussion list, and everyone on here will have their own
       opinion about what is discussed, and what is good/bad.  Remember, 
       "Opinions are like _ssh_les; everyone has one, and they all stink."
       In less-crude language, please try to respect what other people have
       to say - you may not agree with them (which is fine, and rather
       expected), but don't flame people just because they think a song or
       band is excellent/putrid/whatever.  Everyone's tastes in music are
       different, and that's partially what makes this list good.  There are
       headbangers here as well as NewAge types, all drawn together by a
       liking of Rush.  If you find you absotively posolutely cannot contain
       a volcanic verbal (typed) reaction, please take it to email.  Let's
       all try to work and play well together, folks.

    2) This is a music discussion list, not a forum for bootlegers.  The 
       staff of the NMS does not officially encourage the making and trading
       of illegal recordings, and I'd rather not see too much stuff about it
       in the digests.  We all know they're out there, but I don't want to
       turn the NMS into a boot-trading forum.  For starters, it's illegal, and
       guess who the Feds would come looking for first!   There are a few 
       pressed (vinyl, CD) versions of live shows; I see no problem with 
       discussing them.  I'd rather not see posts of someone saying "I taped
       last nights show, and am looking for one of last week for trade."  Oh,
       one more thing, anyone advertising *selling* of bootleg tapes will be
       shot on site, and I encourage others to do the same.  It's one thing to
       accept a blank tape or the cost thereof, it's totally another matter to
       sell the contents thereof.  It's just not cricket.

Well, enough bellyaching.  If anyone wants to discuss either of the two topics
above, please feel free to send mail to "rush-request@syrinx.umd.edu" or if
your mailer is limited in addressing, "rush-mgr@syrinx.umd.edu".  I don't 
penalize for language in private, although possibly for spelling... ;-)

We're within 25 of breaking the 1300 barrier for membership.  We may be there
already, since there are several re-dist sites on the list.  If you read the
NMS through a re-distribution site, please drop me a line at the administrative
address to make sure I have you on the names list.  Thanks!

Oh, one last thing.  This is non-Rush related (unless you count two or three
comments about them from dozens of shows), but if you're into the show on
Comedy Central called "Mystery Science Theater 3000", do you know about the
MAILING LIST for it?  If not, send mail to "davida@syrinx.umd.edu".  No, it's
not run from here, but there is an anonymous ftp archive here for the list.

   With all this talk about oldies, I was wondering if I was the only person u
upset with the fact that Caress of Steel was completely ignored. I realize that
the album didn't do well, but it has some great music (I LOVE the Necromancer).
They played something from everything else!

I agree; I had the feeling that Neil had been progressively distancing
himself from Rand's Objectivism since PeW, but RtB shows (IMHO) that
Rand's influence lives on (and this is disregarding the question as
to whether the cover of HYF is an allusion to _The Fountainhead_; IMO
it is). Though I think that it is clear also that Neil is NOT one who
imposes his opinions on others, particularly when it comes to subjects
(like the existence of God, the nature of any putative `afterlife,'
etc.) from which we might be epistemically isolated such as are
addressed by many religions.

>Many of Neil's more philosophical songs (Show, Don't Tell comes to mind)
>are interesting on two levels... first on the superficial level and then
>second on a more philosophical level.  Show, Don't Tell is a song about
>the centuries old debate between Aristotelians and Platonists about the

I also agree with the existence of two levels in Neil's lyrics. This is
a very wise method of writing -- it allows everyone access to the song
without overburdening the listener if he or she is less inclined toward
interpretation. The `other level' is not necessarily _philosophical_ but
is often literary as well.

On the other hand, I just don't see ``Show Don't Tell'' as about the
`centuries old debate between Aristotelians and Platonists' -- it
certainly does address epistemological issues, but there are other
epistemological positions besides that of the Platonists and
Aristoteleans! One might take for example `you can twist perceptions/
reality won't budge' to be a criticism of the Platonist
position, but it wouldn't be a good one. At best this could be taken
to mean `you can mis-explicate the nature of perception/ the world of
appearances _is_ the ultimate reality,' (which I think is stretching
the interpretation) but then it is only a statement of position, not
a criticism. I think the song has more to do with doubting what one is told
by others; just because something is said or occurs in print doesn't
mean it's true, etc.

If you have more to say about this (your) interpretation of `Show Don't
Tell' Jimbo, then please tell!

   I don't know if Neil has cancer, but Geddy's parting words at the Boston
show were "See you in two years" ( or something to that effect). It doesn't
sound like they are planning to stop touring.

just to add my opinion of the 6+ year-old rumor about Neil and his health ...
while i don't think anybody's going to be satisfied for sure until Neil
himself says something about it, (even w.r.t. the faql) i think it would
be very difficult for the man to pull off a 60-mile bike ride (which he
frequently does on days between concerts) while also being treated for
any shape, size, or form of cancer.  not to mention endurance in the concerts
themselves.  of course he was wearing that bandanna ...  :)

<A NAME="439006">Subject: Rolling Pebble Awards</A>

hi everyone!

I was really excited to see Geddy and Neil win second place
in their respective categories in RS. Lars Ulrich won first, but
for Rush to appear twice in a magazine that either totally ignores
the boys or gives em bad reviews when they do recognize them, is
at least a sign that their readers arent as close minded as the
mag is. Since it was a READERS poll, you would think the editors
of the mag would take notice, but I would be surprised. I wonder
how many of the Rush votes came from NMS members? :-)

Also, I have discovered something weird. I have had my p/g cd for a
while now and never noticed anything wrong. But then my friend dubbed
it and came to me later and said there was static during the first
few seconds of Distant Early Warning. Well, I didnt believe him of
course until I listened to the tape and sure enough there was a staticcy
(sp?) noise. So I was like, "Well, thats your tape not my cd." Wrong.
I stuck my cd in the player and it was coming from it. I wasnt too
distressed though, because I bought p/g used and figures that was why
it was screwed up. So I told my friend I would redub DEW from my
Chronicles cd, which had been digitally remastered, supposedly.
Guess what? It's on Chronicles too! There are two possibilities:
One: its just a major screw up. Two: It's supposed to be there.
Anyone have any ideas?

[ It's supposed to be there.  See the FAQL (due out very soon, or available
  at the ftp site.                                                :rush-mgr ]

Plus, who said Clapton won the Grammy? You're nuts. Unless you
saw a different award ceremony than the tens of millions of other
people.....

Oh well...no big deal....Seeyal

Well, I was hesitating to mention this earlier assuming it had been mentioned
here before, but after perusing the archived digests I haven't been able to
find a mention of it.

Having just recently seen the movie "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey," I thought
it was interesting that during the part where they come into the concert hall
for the battle of the bands, when another band is on stage just finishing up,
that band is none other than Primus!  I noticed because the bass player wore
the same (or similar) pants to what he wore when I saw them in San Diego.

Well, I thought it was interesting...  :-)

What is it with these people saying Rush was ripped off?
The way I see it, Johnson was snubbed last year.  IMHO, Stevie Ray won only
     because everyone jumped on the "Stevie's Dead, He Was So Good" bandwagon.
While Rush is one of my 2 or 3 favorite bands, "Cliffs of Dover" is clearly a
   more technically demanding song.  I mean, look at the guitar tab for it and
 tellme it aint.
Before you get pissed and gripe about Rush not winning, look at it from a
     musician's standpoint, and not from the view of a fanatic.
I have seen Eric headlining here in his hometown of Austin Texas twice, and
 bothtimes he gave any band a run for their money as to the quality of his
 show.     He is perhaps the most awe-inspiring performer to watch, and 
certainly one of
the greatest guitarists in rock music, today or ever.
Now, before my mailbox gets flooded, I am in no way shape or form going 
against Rush.  I'm only putting in my $.02 worth for what was the better 
song in the    category.

<A NAME="439010">Subject: Of Grammys and Such</A>

Well, I've now received TNMS for a week, and I feel obliged to comment on a few
things.  :-)

As has been said before, it was fairly obvious that Rush wouldn't get the
Grammy...and its kinda good in a way that they didn't considering a lot of
the other 'talent' involved.  However, I do feel that Eric J. deserved it
completely, as 'Cliffs' is a wonderful, emotional instrumental.  WMT, although
definitely very good, isn't the same.  YYZ and La Villa have much more impact.

Next, I think that bashing Eric Johnson or Primus is silly and childish.
I happen to like both of them, as well as a lot of other music (ahh, heresy!).
Neither of them are of the same caliber as Geddy, Alex, and Neil, but they
are good in their own ways.  I'm sure we'd all like to see a show with nothing
but Rush, but opening acts are good too.  There is other good music besides
Rush.

Finally, I think that ALL of Rush's music is equally good, although in
different ways.  The raw energy of 'Rush' -> 'ATWS' is incredible.  The
melodic structures of 'AFTK' and 'Hemispheres' are really neat.  The
straight ahead rock of 'Permanent Waves' and 'Moving Pictures' is refreshing.
The synthesizer and lyrical exprimentation on 'Signals' and 'GuP' give a
whole new dimesion to their sound, building up on 'Power Windows' and ending
up on 'HYF', which IMHO is their best album.  The back-to-basics on
'Presto' is very cool, but 'RTB' recaptures the energy of Rush.  One of the
best things about Rush is that if you aren't in the mood for one of their
sounds, you probably are for another.  They're kinda the Swiss Army Knife
of music. :-)

Well, I've babbled on for way too long, so I'm gonna end this.

Man, was it a surprise to see Rush being profiled on ABC's "In Concert" late
    Friday night.
It was almost as surprising to see Neil being interviewed (though it seemed 
he  wasn't too comfortable with it.)  A magazine interview, sure, but I've
 never    heard him say anything.
(except for the occasional "This is Neil Peart from Rush, and you're 
listening  to Texas' best rock, KTXQ-102.")
Anyway, I'm sure we'll all enjoy quite a bit of feedback on this during the
     next few issues or so.  Any questions, any comments, any, uh, anecdotes?

     Hello all,

        Well I'm fighting a case of insomia so I figured to catch up on some
     mail.

      --  First of all for those Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans, Friday's
          show was pretty funny...anyone else catch it??

      --  OK, like the most of yous I was bummed about the Grammy deal...but I
          was VERY glad to see Eric Johnson win, with his lastest work
          he deserves it.

      --  When is(was) the Juno Awards held??  I know the boys are nomimated
          for a few...some info please?!

      --  Finally...I have read some of your comments on RUSH doing earlier
          stuff live...maybe they said they don't see it happening or Ged's
          voice isn't what it used to be, well whatever the case may be
          my solution could be doing what
          The Who did on their "final" tour...have a regular tour as usual but
          add a couple dates for special shows including all of 2112,
          By-Tor..., Hemispheres, etc...

First, many have said that Rush should have got the grammie because of their
longevity. WELL WHAT ABOUT YES!?!? Do you think they ever got one? And
they've been around longer. At least Rush gets awards in Canada.
Still, I would have been ecstatic for either Yes or Rush to win.
However, they did not, which brings my next point:
I am somewhat of a musician, so this statement is not made in ignorance:
	Eric Johnson is booooo-ring.
I'm sorry. His music does not give me a woody. He's a fantastic guitarist,
but I find his music to be no more than excellent guitar playing, not
music that I'd want to listen to.
Third, THINK. How long have the Neil Peart cancer rumors been around?
Ever since I can remember -- and the guy's not dead. Jeez.

Last, put "in my humble opinion" in front of everything I've said. :)
I'm not flaming, this is just my OPINION.

   If it were, Rush wouldn't be anything to write home about. It's nowhere
 near YYZ or La Villa in terms of compositional ability. It's very well
 executed, of course, but so are Paul Gilbert's hyper-speed arpeggios.

> You're comparing guitarist to guitarist here. Not band to band.

   True. But anyway, I feel WMT is no achievement for Rush, while CoD is
 fairly representative of Eric's style. Of course I haven't heard Eric's
 previous album, Tones, and I realize there are entirely different
 instrumental pieces on Ah Via Musicom, but CoD bears resemblance to his
 vocal writing style as well. Oh well. This isn't TNMS material exactly.

   Point taken. I guess this is how you become after playing guitar for
 2/3 of your life. But I would venture to say the bass playing on WMT is
 nothing special, especially in terms of Geddy's usual playing.

   Which proves that you should listen to something else for a change.
 Rush are very good musicians and function extremely well as a unit,
 but by no means are they the absolute best in anything. And I seem to
 forget everything presented here are just opinions.. ;->

For those of you who have been anxiously awaiting the results of the Boxset
Poll, I will have the final tallies sometime before St. Patrick's Day.  Until
then this is the final week to submit lists for the poll.  For those of you
new to NMS, I need 20 to 25 of your all-time favorite Rush tunes (including
live material from albums, bootlegs, and videos).  Please send them to this
address:

           dgsst4@unix.cis.pitt.edu

It looks like I should have at least 60+ songs to complete a boxset.  I also
like ideas for a title.  I will keep you posted on any changes or if any new
ideas might occur.

All right, so "Where's My Thang" didn't win Best Rock Instrumental.  It's
still a great song, nevertheless.   And it's not BORING, as some people might
think.

Personally, I think Nirvana should have been nominated for Best New Artist.

This past Friday night, apparently their was a 1/2 hour interview
with Rush on CNBC (or FNN - I get them confused). I only caught a
short segment of it...can any NMSers who saw the whole thing fill
us in on what of interest was said....I know this was a new interview,
because I heard Roll the Bones mentioned.

On a faintly related note, what is the best Rush airplay (on radio)
you ever heard? Here in Peoria there is a public-access "radio" station
which is broadcast over cable TV...they have a "Rush Hour" every
Saturday night...has anybody ever heard of a commercial station which
does this? Other than what I just mentioned, Central Illinois radio
is unfortunately nearly Rush-free.

(ps - I'll post the answers to that lyrical quiz this week)

Cool! In Concert on ABC had an "artist profile" of Rush Saturday night.
They had bits of interviews with all three members--yes, EVEN Mr. Peart.
They also showed 9 seconds of in concert footage of WMT? and 20 seconds
of Dreamline. I was extremely pissed that they didn't play a WHOLE song
from the RTB tour. Instead they played Closer To The Heart from the ASOH
video. I can't believe that after so many years and albums, Rush is still
given cheesy little "artist profile" segments instead of featured artist
status. Where the hell is Tina Turner NOW?? I don't see her touring or
coming out with new material, but of course, they HAVE to spotlight her
and her stupid movie soundtrack songs.
Hopefully, in the future, they will play some recent concert footage,
because of the little bit they played last night, it looked and sounded
GOOOOOOOOD!!!

i think that eric johnson deserved the award. i like "wheres my

and from reading the list, why do i get the impression that all
you rush fans would be more happy if rush didnt have any opening
act at all? the majority seems to hate mr. big and many are split
about eric and primus. i think all three are fantastic. if you
dont wanna see the opening act, go to the show late or something.
all three of those acts have musical value. no ones asking you
to admit that theyre better musicians than rush. if you dont like
them, thats ok, but dont chastise others for enjoying what they
think is good music.

        I have just heard too much discussion about Neil and cancer.  It

who post these things get some proof??   I didn't think you had any!!!
 It seems that those people always say a friend told me about it.  Well
thats is all I need to believe it.  Neil does not have cancer...

1)  THe reason people thought this in the first place was because of his
short hair.  Kemotherepy(sp?) was what everbody thought it was.  I fknow
anythiong about kemoterepy you know that it makes you extremely sick to
your stomach.  You throw up alot. I konw 2 People that were going through
Kemotherepy, They could barely walk or eat.  And one of them was a
healthy man younger than Neil.

[ Chemotherapy, if anyone cares.                                 :rush-mgr ]

2)  Has it ever occured to anyone that maybe Neil is just going bald?

[ For clues, look on album #3.  Hey, new rumour??  :-)           :rush-mgr ]

3)  He looked extremely healthy and energetic every time I have seemn him
on this tour,   3 shows, rockline(audio),  In Concert interview,  Buddy
Rich video,etc.

                Those people who do post stuff about Neil and cancer make
this list look like the front page of the ENQUIRER.  Why post crap like
that!!!   And don't flame me on the NMS!!   Send me email and we can

Yeah it was kind of a disappointment, although if you all say EJ is good 
though,
then I am at least satisfied that the award went to a good player and not
just some sellout band.

I would also like to say that I was rather impressed with Lars' speech when
Metallica (YAH!!!!) won the Metal award... he spoke of getting the recognition
that metal truly deserves and thanked metal fans who have stuck it out, and
these were the things that those pole-up-the-butt, love song loving snobs
needed to hear!!!

Whoopi Goldberg tried to make fun of them, but she failed miserably!! She
was a total flop as far as trying to use Metallica for joke material!

I wish I could have seen Johnson.. at the Cap Center (in D.C.) on 12/4,
we got to see the joy of all joys Vinnie Moore open for Rush (yippee!!!!
yahoo!!!!! oh boy!!!!! PSYCH!). I would have even taken Primus over
Vinnie Moore!

Oh well, I hear rumors of another Cap Centre show being added at the end
of the tour, so hopefully us Baltimore fans who got *SCREWED OVER* will
be able to catch that one...

Metallica is coming too - 4/2! YAH!

First off, assuming Where's My Thing is a bunch of leftover riffs, Rush's
leftovers are better than most bands main courses.  However, Eric Johnson,
being an artist who writes primarily instrumentals, deserves what he got.
Also, EJ recorded Cliffs of Dover with three different bass players, so
its not just a guitar song.  Where's My Thing is cool when one is
experiencing a caffeine rush, but Cliffs of Dover is the superior of the
two.  Flame away.

Not that I'm putting down the idea, but how many of you saw the Who's
"Tommy" 25th anniversary performance? Who thought that Bowie did something
good by letting the fans pick his "oldies" tour songlist? Who went to
see the Monkees reunion tour? :)
I thought it was brave of the Who to try and perform "Tommy", and I
watched basically to see if they'd pull it off with dignity. (no comment
on that here)  I thought it was cool of Bowie to do some of the older &
less widely-popular tunes, and I was conveniently missing for the Monkees.
I'd pay serious money to see or get a video of Rush doing 2112,
Cygnus/Hemispheres, Lamneth, and tunes from FBN-AFTK exclusively. Shoot,
if we got a venue-full amount of fans (with money), do you think
we could hire 'em out for a night? ! :)

The mystery of the behind the stage seating is now solved. As I
regretfully expected, the seats were NOT good AT ALL. Row 1 ended
up being row I, and the section was at the back end of the Arena.
sh*t! Last time I try to beat the lines by going to Eckerds for
TicketB*stard tix. Anyhows, quickly ....

The Miami show was a simliar showing of all the past revies I've
read. "Where's My Thing" is *great* live! The medley of songs
performed as an encore was well done with perfect transitions. I
was a bit less than impressed with the stage, but whadya expect
from someone who's four rows from the back wall.  :(

Wabbits! The inflatable wabbit on the right couldn't get it up!
Wabbit wangwers finally came out and stuffed him back in the hat
and took him away. Y'know, if these are the same wabbits from the
Presto tour, seems there'd be aLOT of them after more a year.  :)

Final rambling: in waiting behind the Arena for autographs (which
never happened unfortunately) the stage lighting manager came out
to BS with the fans. According to him, the boyz being baseball
fans, swung through Flroida to coincide with Spring training, and
that some baseball folks were invited backstage.  Another tidbit:
the boys are now into golf! They scheduled enough spare time to
play a round in Miami at the Doral course.  Seemed to make sense,
cuz we followed their bus up to the Naples I-75 turnoff (Naples
being a big golf-type-o-town).

Hmmmm, maybe I should grab Buffy and hang out at the clubhouse
for autographs?                Naaaaaaaaaaaah!
