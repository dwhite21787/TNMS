Just a quick note:  it's fairly obvious that things are a bit slow lately;
they usually are in the couple of months before an album release.  We've
exhausted most of the topics from previous albums, and are waiting for the
new one to spawn new threads.  I just want to vent a little steam in
response to a mail msg. I just received.  The person wanted to be removed
from the list because it was "lame" and had a s/n ration of ".3".  Just for
my own curiosity, I checked the back issues, and this person had not posted
anything themselves in the past couple of months issues.  It ticked me off
that this person was complaining about the content of the group, yet had
added nothing of their own.

Quelling my first response (which could have been neatly summed up in
two short words totaling seven letters), I decided to turn this in a
positive direction.

The (nameless) person complained about the satanism thread, as well as the
anti-drug posts.  Now I abhor a lack of content as much as the next person,
but I feel that the only stupid question is that which is unasked.  Who
knows, maybe somebody with a hazy idea about christianity/satanism/rock
(I use lower case on purpose; I don't worship any of the above) had their
view clarified, or maybe somebody with a firm opinion was jarred and made
to (re)think their position.

Lastly, that same person made me think a bit; postings are nice to have,
but let's try to limit them to Rush-related topics with some sort of
value of content.  Think about what you have to say, and use your common
sense, imagination (and maybe a dictionary).  Personally, I have very
strong opinions about the two topics mentioned here, but they are to a
great deal opinion, not directly related to Rush and don't really belong
here.

Let's try to keep this an interesting forum for the discussion of what
it's intended for.

Oh, one P.S.:  In light of the SCTV/Count Floyd mentions later on, it brings
back the memory a few years ago of a (car) camping trip.  I'd brought a live
tape from '82 or '83, and it had the Count Floyd video part before "The
Weapon".  We'd had a few beers, and it sunk in as to what he said:

  "So scary, you'll want to tear your own heads off!"

We cackled over that for a good 15 minutes!!!!  I also like the line:

  "Ooh, listen to the synthesisers - scary!"

>[really cool stuff]

It sounds just like a whole bunch of ignorant fundamentalist
nervous Christians to waste their time finding Satanic references
in *everything*.  I am a Christian myself, and I attend church
(when i'm not at school 8), and it amazes me, the silly things
these brain-dead morons come up with... I like my youth pastor,
for example, but when he says things lke "peace signs are just
crosses upside down and are Satanic", it makes me want to vomit
profusely and them whack the man upside the head!
I can't believe they would waste time bashing a very good band--
a band that has has really good lyrics and awesome music, not
the really stupid stuff you hear in the radio/top 40 mainstream
these days.
I mean, i've heard stupider things, like Cyndi Lauper's "She
Bop" is about masturbation (which, from what I hear, has *some*
basis on fact), and that there are backward messages in Queen's
and the Beatles' music.  I mean, what are they going to do
about it?  Why do they feel they need to protect their precious
little children from ALL possible bad outside influences? Why
not let them make their own decisions? (Freewill? 8)
And why bother pointing out all the *bad* things? Do they think
Gospel and Christian rock are the only kinds of music worth
listening to? Heaven forbid there be variety in this world!
(aside note: i've heard that they think even Christian heavy
metal is satanic. ARGH!). If they spent half as much time
as they waste doing this working on the social problems Rush's
songs talk about sometimes, this might even be a decent world
to live in.

VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: this is only my very humble opinion
and should not be taken as gospel (no pun intended). I only feel
this is a fault of the Christian church, and it is not an attempt
to bash it in any way. (I get this from the 10+ years i was in
Christian schools and attending church)

p.s. I didn't mean to get off the subject quite so much.... sorry.

Well, I just happened to have been reading a book on Greek myths by
Robert Graves, where he tells the myth from several sources, then
explains it.  Most of his explanations centered on the switch from
matriarchal society to patriarchal (along with some really interesting
parallels in Hebrew, Caananite, and British mythology), and the image
of the man bound to a flaming wheel he considered a sun-god image.
Either that, or tying the "sacred king" (whoever had the honor of
marrying the queen/priestess and then dying at the end of his term--
6 months or one year at first, but as things switched, that got longer)
to a flaming wheel was one of the myriad ways different cities changed
kings.  Quite an interesting book...but very thick.

While I'm running on about Greek myths, the version I remember about
Pan and Syrinx was this:  Pan, the god of nature, fell in love with
the nymph Syrinx, the daughter of one of the river gods around there.
She wasn't particularly taken with him (well, he's got goat legs and
horns!), and ran away until she was cornered on a reedy bank of her
father's river.  So she prayed to Daddy, and he changed her into one
of the reeds.  Pan cut several of the reeds and made a pan-pipe out
of them in commemoration of Syrinx.  Now, Robert Graves would go on
about goat clans replacing the earlier worship of the river goddess
or something.  Whatever.  So, the Priests of Syrinx would be
anti-Pan, if the name came from this myth...but who knows what made
Neil choose that name anyway.

<A NAME="237005">Subject: Hello, tab notation, & lyrics corrections</A>

Well, I finally got around to posting a message
to this group. This is my first post, so let's
see if it makes it.

First, hello to all fellow Rush fans!

Second, I downloaded the tablature from rush/tab
and I noticed that there is no indication of
the lengths of the notes. This may be fine for
experienced players, but not for beginners like
me. I have a suggestion. At the top of the bars,
use W,H,Q,E,S,T,X to signify whole, half, quarter,
eighth, sixteenth, thirty-second, and sixty-fourth
notes (or maybe 1,2,4,8,S,T,X). In the example below,
the first note is a quarter note, the second is an
eighth note, and the third is a quarter note. I think
this would make learing the stuff easier. Suggestions
are welcome, of course.

 Q H Q
-------
-3---3-
-------
---1---

Third, does anyone have any more bass tab other than
the start of Hemispheres that is in rush/tab?

Fourth, I ftp-ed the lyrics and I noticed some errors
that I thought I'd mention. I listed the song name,
the line as it currently is, and the way it should
be. I know there's more, but I can't recall all the
corrections I made (and I deleted the original versions
I downloaded).

Song: Bastille Day
Old: Ooh, there's stained velvet, dirty lace...
New: Ooh, blood stained velvet, dirty lace...

Song: Hemispheres
Old: ...a stillness fell, a sound of peace
New: ...a stillness fell, a sudden peace

[ Thanks for the tip - I have corrected these obvious mistakes in the
  lyrics files.                                                 :rush-mgr ]

I think I typed enough for now. Until next time...

	I want to apologize to Dan on my comments Thurs. or
Wed or Tue (Its all a blur now).  I guess I'm a graduate student with an
attitude.  Too many finals, too much coffee etc.  Ireally got off on a tangent.
	My main point was supposed to be the things that set Rush appart from
the others.  To this point I see the use of multi meter.  Granted some bands
use this but it is usually so obvious.  As if to say, "Look at us, we're
playing in 7."  I also point out their use of color vs. melody in many
soloistic passages.  But I think the main thing for me is the grasp of
building and timing that, for me, are their strongest attribute.

	They have created wonderful beginnings.  The opening to Camera Eye is
probably my favorite.  Here they incorporate suspensions to put the listener
off just a little while longer.  The fourth chord in the guitar of the
four chords repeated over and over.  I believe it is an Fsus.  They repeat
this umteen times and yet when they change they have put the listener off
long enough and they take you to the next section, C maj?, instead of just
dropping it into your lap.  Other "great beginnings" are La Villa, Red
Barchetta, Xanadu! and more I'm sure, these are just off the top of my head.

	Another way they set them selves apart is that they don't start
writing a song with a time stipulation in mind, which lets them create.  I
can't see them sitting down with 4'and 33" of time left to fill on the vinyl
or trying to fit the radio length or format in mind.

	I don't get the feeling of them trying to please anyone.  I see it
more as them doing their thing and hoping we like it.

	One last comment, this about being about Lime Light,  I was driving
along listening to this the other day in my car and I finally listened to
the lyrics.  They really had a lot more meaning after reading N.Peart's
comments about fans, playing, the music industry etc.

	Enough rambling for now and, again, my apologies to Dan.

<A NAME="237007">Subject: Playing tapes backwards</A>

Someone asked in the last NMS if anyone had heard "Anthem" backwards.
If you want to hear it backwards, follow these easy steps:

1)	Copy the song onto a tape that you wouldn't mind cutting apart.
2)	Cut the tape that has the song on it out of the cassette and
 	flip it upside down, and tape it back in.
3) 	It may be easier to cut one side, twist it, tape it back in, and then
	wind the tape up, being careful not to let the twist get wound up in
	the tape.  When you are at the end of the song, cut, twist and tape.

	I really doubt there is anything in "Anthem."  I've listened to stuff
	like "Stairway to Heaven" backwards, which was 'sposed to have a whole
	bunch of Satanic messages in it, but doesn't.

	The only things I've found any understandable messages in are:

	Pink Floyd - The Wall.  Right before "Empty Spaces"
	The Beatles - Revolution 9.  "Number Nine" says "Turn me on, dead man"
	backwards.

	Well, this really didn't have much to do with Rush, did it?

	As for the ol' "I never hear Rush on the radio" bit, I heard two Rush
	songs on Q95 last night.  "Territories" at about 8, and "Working man"
	at about 1 a.m.    Later.

<A NAME="237309">From: "Chris Webster" <cwebster@rodan.acs.syr.edu></A>

In case anyone is extremely interested in hearing something backwards, here's
how it can be done:  Record the material on a tape that you're not concerned
with -you may ruin it.  Once it is recorded, open the cassette's case--usually,
there are screws that you unscrew (what else?) to do this.  Lift the one
half of the cassette casing off, flip the two reels around so that the tape
will now be playing backwards, and reassemble the case.  If I remember this
correctly, there is a rubberish material that lines the inside.

Really, it's easier to do this than describe it.

The same friend who taught me how to do this also told me about someone he
knew who searches for satanistic music.  Evidently one of the most recent
Phil Collins or Genesis releases qualified. (I think it was Invisible
Touch.)  One of the songs has a lyric where the word "lived" (or "lives")
is used.  Flip "lived" around and you get "devil".  Pretty damning, isn't
it?  :-)

Ok, so the thing isn't a pentagram. Fine.  What was rush trying to say
with these images then?

I still feel a slight teetering towards magic, mystic, or evil thoughts
when trying to decipher the pictures' meanings.  Regardless of the true
intent, that's what these images have, obviously, represented to some
people.

Pulling out Webster: a pentacle is a five-pointed star used as a magical
symbol.  Fine.  Rush could have been thinking 'magically.' (It fails to
describe a circle circumscribing the star...)  The meaning of pentagram
only lists the definition of: PENTACLE.  Great. Thanks for the help.

Remembering some occult:  I once read a book about occult which talked
of the pentagram (or image resembling the one on _2112_) as the
summoning place of a demon.  First, you would have to draw this
figure on a wall or floor (I think). Then, with the help of a few other
really odd things, a demon would supposedly appear in the figure: his
head in the top point, legs in the bottom points, and arms in their
respective side points.  It seems that if their were a pentagon in the
center of the figure, the demon would be blocked. (This is MY conclusion,
not proof.)

Olympics of the Mind/Odyssey of the Mind: Ever do this in high or junior
high school? Well, we did a balsa-wood structure for ours. Weight was to
be placed on it until it broke. The most weight wins. You also had to
act the thing out in a skit.  We chose to use the forces of good and
evil as our skit.  Good guys wore white robes, bad guys wore black. We
contructed a pentagram from wood and red string (for the star).  We
were going to put candles at the points, but the fire aspect ruled that
out.  The bad guys put the balsa structure in the middle and then
proceeded to "worship" it.  The good guys would then place weights on
the structure, each one forcing not only the structure to be hurt, but
also the bad guys.  When the structure collapsed, good prevailed over
the then-dead bad guys.  Anyways, we really didn't know anything about
occult, but were just trying to do a skit.  It turned out pretty well,
but I got a nasty bleeding from a razor blade I used to slice the
string with.  I thought for a moment a demon would come with the blood,
but, thank goodness, he was a no-show.

rush-mgr:  Someone left a note to you discussing the dead-ness of this
issue.  Should we not discuss a certain item after a certain amount of
responses or should everyone have their time to speak on a topic that
they want to resolve?

[ My personal guideline is when the "cut it out" posts outnumber the posts
  themselves...  1/2 :-)                                         :rush-mgr ]

 Just Superconductor, nothing else. Time is 4:47 (same as on Presto).
It is made in the USA, there is no credit to Anthem Records Inc as there
is on the Presto cd. There is no insert in the cd jewel box, but the back
of the box (and the cd itself both say:

"LICENSED FOR PROMOTION ONLY. SALE IS PROHIBITED.
 Ownership and right to possession reserved by Atlantic
 Recording Corporation."

 The "album" number is PRCD 3331-2, and it says it is from
"The Atlantic album "Presto" #82040-1/2/4"

On the box there is a sticker that says "When you PLAY IT, SAY IT!",
whatever than means.

Anyways, no, its probably not any great find, the song is the same as
the album,  but I thought it interesting anyways. Besides, it only cost
$1.98   (-:

past Saturday, I decided to go rent a Rush video since I had never seen
one before.  I grabbed the Grace Under Pressure Tour concert video
since that was the first tour on which I had a chance to see them
( and p/g happens to be one of my favorite Rush albums ).  As I
expected, I enjoyed it immensely.  My only complaint was that the
editing was very distracting in parts.  There were places where there
would be several minutes of 1-2 seconds clips of the show.  I'd be
trying to watch Alex's hands (since I'm a guitarist) but my brain
couldn't react fast enough.  Has anyone else had this problem?

    Next, I'd like to offer a totally non-musical observation on
Alex's style.  For you guitarists out there, have you ever noticed
that Alex really doesn't like stretching his hand out very much?  If
he can help it, he never stretches his hand over more than 4 frets,
3 if possible.  He doesn't go for the Robert Fripp 'I can put an
octave between my index finger and pinky' chords.  This observation
was confirmed when I watched the video this weekend.  The moral of
the story is: If you're trying to figure out a chord in a Rush song,
ask yourself, "What's the easiest way to make this sound right?"  If
you're stretching your hand too much, you're probably doing it wrong.

    And now for something completely different ... Who is the guy from
SCTV who introduces 'The Weapon' dressed up as a vampire in the p/g
video?  I just about busted a gut watching that!  Can anyone give us
any more details about the relationship between Rush and the old SCTV
bunch?  The other obvious reference is Geddy's vocal on 'The Great
White North' ('... It's ok.  I memorized them.  I'm a professional' ).

[ To digress a bit, the 'vampire' is Count Floyd, who hosts "Monster Horror
  Chiller Theater" (?) on SCTV.  The connection, as far as I can tell, is
  that Geddy went to school with a couple of the members (Rick?).  There
  are a few cross-overs; Count Floyd, Geddy/Take Off and the name of this
  fine digest you're reading (in only 1/2 D, unless you have...)  :rush-mgr ]

    What would I do if I met Rush?  Well, I'd probably ask Alex several
dozen questions of the form, "How do you play chord X in song Y?"
Since I don't know diddley about drums so I'd ask Neil about his bicycle
trip in China.  That sounded pretty cool.  I might also bring a copy
of that venerable document, the TNMS FAQL.  If I was lucky, I could
get them to verify its accuracy and fill in some of the holes.

    And lastly, best wishes to everyone attending the Rush party in
Philly next weekend.  Unfortunately, I can't attend 'though I'll actually
be in town that weekend.  I'll be busy graduating down at the
Convention Center.  I wanted to be in on the Rush Jam but my broken
strumming arm would have precluded that anyway. :-(  But hey, we'll
have Rush Party II later this summer in DC, right?

ORQ:

"And now I'd like to introduce a scary song!  Oooh, even the name scares me!"

  Boy, I love this subject!

  Thanks to Eric Kay, for your review of that silly Hell's Bells video.
Even better, you included the address and phone number of the organization
that puts this thing out.  I'll have to call 'em up and see the vid for myself.
These goofy evangelists crack me up!  I'd find it absolutely hilarious,
except for remembering that far too many people take this stuff seriously.

  Anyway, the rush-mgr said in response:

>   I wish somebody would play recorded religious hynms backwards and see
>   what "satanic messages" pop up!

  I've actually seen (and heard) this happen on a religious 'documentary'
a few years ago.  It was a typical anti-rock crusade, but they whipped out
a few christian records (contemporary and choral) to see if anything could
be found when playing them backwards.  A couple of songs actually had
reverse messages, and the reaction to 'Jesus loves you' in the music practically
had the hosts in fits.  "Oh Lord, it's a miracle!  Hallelujah!"

  It was quite obvious that these messages were put in on purpose (you could
hear backwards speech in the music to begin with); no divine intervention,
sorry!  Backmasking has no demonstrable effect on listeners, but isn't it
curious that 'Jesus loves you' hidden in music is a "miracle," but 'Satan
loves you' is horrid insidious perverted nastiness?  I'm happy to say that
I've known some very reasonable and caring theists, but these geeks never
fail to astound me with their lack of rational thought.
