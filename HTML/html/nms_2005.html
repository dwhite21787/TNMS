>>Hey gang..
Finally got Victor yesterday, via the BMG music club.. Have given it a once
over, and find myself straining to get into it. Anyone else have this
problem? I don't know what it is.. Maybe screaming guitars just aren't my
thing anymore. GOD, NO, I'M GROWING UP!!! Or maybe it's something else..  Any
thoughts or comments???
Cheers from New Mexico..

I had a hard time with it at first, too. I liked "Promise" on the radio,
so that was OK.
I think some of the other lyrical styles were just not to my liking. But
my biggest problem was with the *content* of the songs, lyrically
speaking. Ouch, Alex, lighten up, you're scaring me! (oh yeah, then
there's the cover art. Why?)

     I am in awe of all of this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am very new to the internet(3 days), The first sight I wanted to find was
on RUSH. I not only found Rush, but I found this great place to that fans
can express their views and opinions on this great band.
I thought I was the last true RUSH fan.....WRONG!!!!!!!!  I have been a fan
for 14 years and and now realize how little I knew...THAT IS ABOUT TO
CHANGE THANKS TO YOU ALL.

     The first RUSH I ever owned was Grace Under Pressure, the only reason
I got it was because it came to me in the mail via one of those music clubs
selection of the month things, so   I tossed it in the collection of tapes
that I never listened to...UNTIL...one day a friend and fellow music fan
spotted it and asked me why I never opened it and all I remember saying was
that I would never get into these guys..
The very next day he brought over an old beat up Maxell tape with the
numbers 2112 on it and said "Dude, you've got to hear this"... I did'nt
want to hear it , I had no interest, BUT..to oblige him I did.....
My first listen does'nt count because all he could do was tell the story
without letting me really listen (if that makes any sense). After begging
him to shut up I got another listen and my first thought was "DIFFERENT"
after listening again I realized that this had to be the coolest thing I
ever heard....then I found out there was 5 other songs .  GUP was ripped
open and after the 1st listen I knew that these guys were special and ran
to the music store , bought Moving Pictures became inspired by music and
lyrics...In about a months time I had the collection(I'dve had it sooner
but being 15 at the time I was financially strapped)...THANKS FOR
LISTENING....(or should I say reading).....
Bye for now

Dear fellow Rushians,

Hello all!  I'm not a *big* Pearl Jam fan, yet I like a lot of their
stuff.  I finally got VERSUS this weekend and the very first song "Go"
is an almost note for note, rhythmical rip-off of "Stick it out" in the
chorus sections.  NOw both Counterparts and Versus came out in the same
year so I agree it's hard to know who copied whom if that happened at
all.  I just thought it was interesting considering that in Pearl Jam's
latest work, Yield (which, in my opinion, is their best work since Ten)
the song "Given to Fly" sounds so much like Led Zeppelin's "Going to
California" (Led Zeppelin # 4).  Coincidence....?

   [ For another PJ comparison, try "Rear-View Mirror" & "New World Man"
     on for size....                                         : rush-mgr ]

Palo

"The case was tried by the Jury inside, the choice between darkness and
light..." Amen.

P.S.  To Chris Sadlers, the phrase "And the Meek shall inherit the
earth." comes from the Psalm 37:11 and echoed again in Matthew 5:5 by
Christ.  As great an author as Neil Peart is, we should not blindly
believe that because the words are credited to him that they are his per
say, especially words of such fame as these.

That being said I'm curious to hear anybody's thoughts on how the p/g title
relates to the lyrical (or musical if any care to go that far) content of 
the album, *or* the era it was released. (neil's relation to the economic
times)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, what I always thought was this:
We all know what it is to display "grace under pressure" and many of the songs
on this album follow that theme
Red Sector A - Strength in the face of unimaginable torture
("For my father and my brother, it's too late, but I must help my mother stand
up straight")
Afterimage - Surviving the death of a close friend
(This just can't be understood")
Kid Gloves - Trying to be a balanced individual in the face of pressure of a
crappy world..
("It's cool to be so tough.....It's tough to be so cool")
I dunno, they're all just about Grace Under Pressure -
As far as the "rocks disturbing the surface of the calm water" the water is
displaying grace under pressure because the ripples that the rocks (pressure)
create in the water are quite graceful.
And you have to love the liner pic of the egg in the clamp.
I am glad someone brought this up, because this has never been one of my
favorite Rush albums, but listening to it today, I think it is gonna be in
heavy rotation this week.  :)  So thanks.
In the p/g credits, Rush would like to thank Marilyn.  How did they know?

"mrs. christ, can jesus come out to play?"
"no.  he's over at the temple, casting out the money-changers . . ."

[sure, i could dis deities from other popular religions. . . but who would get
the jokes?]

well, it looks like ole stephen once again has to wade into the debate about
what an album cover 'really' means.  get a pencil, 'cause i'm only gonna say
this once.

g/p was the second rush album i ever had the pleasure to own, bought with my own
money, as a gangly youth of seventeen.  saskatchewan had a particular rainless
spring that year.  it was windy and dusty.  at high noon the day was not much
brighter than twilight would have been.  apocalyptic.  other worldly.  a vaguely
orwellian time.  yeah.

i grew up in a small town and could seldom plug into the world for current news
about rush.  occasionally, i would find articles about them in "creem" or silly
guitar hero magazines.  a year later while travelling across the country on a
greyhound bus, i happened upon a copy of 'success under pressure' where i
learned for the first time about the troubles da boyz had with the album.  they
decided to change producers.  they couldn't find a producer, but had to start
recording, anyway.  the mixes sounded horrible.  steve lillywhite didn't want to
produce them.  roger kneebend (famous for his work with the Beatles, you'll
remember) was called in, but his contribution to the project was minimal. 
finally, they found peter henderson, but i wonder if he was intimidated by the
band's outlook, style and dedication.

and when they contacted hugh syme to come up with the album graphics, maybe he
picked up on the band's tension from the album's rocky course of completion.

we have an androgynous figure staring into the middle distance of a chaotic and
dissonant  seascape.  the figure could represent the band members collectively
 - or the average rush fan at  that time.  from reading nms, i guess it is now
de rigeur to ponder if the latest rush album will be their last, but there was
nothing of the kind back then (from what i managed to hear).  but after they
recorded grace under pressure maybe they WERE considering breaking up.  had the
rush magic dried up?  so, the figure stares into a tumultuous and uncertain
future.

i rarely listen to g/p all the way through.  i hear a lot of hard and angry pain
weaved into the fabric of those tunes.  'dew' is a plaintive cry about nations
and people who can't communicate. 'afterimage' is a eulogy that hides subtle
questions about the random stupidityy of death. 'red sector a' and 'the enemy
within' speak about doubt, hopelessness and fear.  'kid gloves' chronicles the
angst of a sixteen year old who shouts love at the heart of the world (compare
this with the cheekiness of 'the big wheel' or the thoughtful introspection and
discovery of 'double agent').  'between the wheels' substitutes Fate for God in
our lives and still the narratee is dissatisfied.  even the two 'lighter' songs,
'the body electric' and 'red lenses' have sinister and paranoid (negative
energy) overtones.

you know, i love this album.  moving pictures is supposed to be a dark, sullen
body of work, but g/p is brooding, manic depressive and not at all cheery and
confident about the future.  where moving pictures has worldly depth and a quiet
maturity in its messages, grace under pressure has only troubling questions that
hang uncomfortably in the air long after the last chords have faded.

the album cover reflects all this so beautifully, making the band picture --
which i've always personally liked -- inside seem so ironic (and we all know
that sometimes irony can be pretty damn ironic) because they look so
companionable and happy.  i listen to grace under pressure and again i see dust
darkened skies over naked fields, breathe the gritty air and remember my own
youthful anger and defiance that i used to hide my own uncertainty of what might
come. 

anyway.  just my thinks.

next week:  caress of steel and the thing that lurks under my bed.

<A NAME="2005009">Subject: The Music or the Lyrics ?</A>

    After seeing some of Rush's songs transposed in the Argentinean tounge ,
for our fellow Rush fans south of the border,it made me wonder if some fans 
were missing the meaning behind these songs due to the language barrier.All 
they hear is the wondeful music and what must sound like jibberish for 
lyrics.This makes me realise just how lucky I am to speak English and be 
able to listen to the lyrics and the music together as they were meant to 
be.I guess I've always taken it for granted that everyone who hears a Rush 
song is hearing both the music and the lyrics as the entire production but 
now I realise that this is not always the case.
     For me it has always been both the lyrics and the music.One thing I 
always hated is repetative lyrics in a song.Some groups just don't have the 
knack for lyrical song writting so they concentrate on the music and just 
throw in whatever lyrics they can think of at the time and then just keep 
repeating these same lines over and over again.This is not the only part of 
what I love about Rush songs.The other part is the dynamic music and 
complexity of it's arrangement that moves me.
   The question then to everyone is what component of a Rush song means the 
most to you ?  Is it just the music ?,just the lyrics ?,or both ?

  For those of you who have acquired some or all of the remasters I was 
wondering what your feelings were on the overall sound quality and whether 
or not they are really worth it or not.I have 4 of the remasters so far and 
I feel they are worth it but it may not be that easy to detect without the 
aid of headphones.One thing I noticed on Xanadu is at the very begining 
where Neil is doing a lot of percussion work and he hits those long 
cylindicular chimes(not sure what their actual name is).On a couple of 
notes he hits there is a echo of the note which slowly fades out.I've never 
heard this before on the original CD.Has anyone else heard this or am I 
from another planet ? What other things has anyone else heard that sounds 
new to them ?

Salut le monde,

I had this wicked and weird dream (almost a nightmare) last night.
Rush was playing in Ottawa. I thought I had good seats, but when
we got there, it was under one of the bridges over the Rideau Canal, 
beside the National Arts Center. Seats were on both sides of the 
ciment structures holding up the bridge, so nobody had a good seat.
The stage was on a floating barge or some sort of deck?
When the Band started to play, it sounded like the Gogoes singing
"Are lips are sealed". But it was a rearranged version of one of 
their songs, the lyrics were their own, that much I knew.
I don't know what to make of this?
Has anybody else ever had a weird Rush scenario in a dream?

  Does anyone else see the band heading more and more towards the acoustic 
sound rather than the heavy guitar sound on their newer releases.It would 
seem to fit the latest trend in the music industry over the past couple of 
years,Dave Mathews band,Day's of the New to name a couple.You can hear 
pieces of it in Test for Echo in songs like,Driven,Half the World,Resist 
and from Counterparts Nobody's Hero.
   Alex was using some kind of emulator or synthesizer to emulate the 
acoustic sounds from his electric guitar.The mix was pretty interesting 
sounding and a nice change from the norm.Would this format work throughout 
an entire Rush album ? I'm not so sure it would carry the band through an 
entire album of songs but I definitely wouldn't mind hearing more and more 
of it incorporated into their music.How does everyone else fell about this 
sound ?

I would like to add something I read about this.  The star (not the Rush star, 
just any star symbol in general) represents the cross in some Christian usage 
(as in Jesus on the ...).  When used upside-down as a pentagram, it represents 
the upside down cross.  Therefore, if anything, the Rush star is NOT satanic.

Just thought you guys might enjoy hearing this

I was in my local neighborhood record store yesterday (April 1st), and 
all the staff were abuzz because a local Denver radio station was telling 
how the Rolling Stones had played incommunicado at a local nightclub the 
night before under the pseudonym "Eddie and the Cockroaches".  Sure enough, 
the DJ comes on, talking it up even more, then played some tracks of the 
Stones live.  The store owners couldn't stop talking about it!  They were 
lamenting the fact that the night before they were home watching TV, etc.

It was hilarious!  Until I reminded them what day it was, and felt sorry for 
bursting their bubble.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Any chance of taking your virtual
hatchet to Julian Daigle? :-)
 I wouldn't mind his posts so much if he'd go back to amusing... but
this "serious" shit is getting on my nerves...!

To make this at least partially Rush-content-related, I recently
rediscovered "The Analog Kid" after buying the Retrospectives CDs.
Man, I hadn't heard that song in at least 10 years.  Now I have my CD
player set on one hell of a loop... "Analog Kid", "Invisible Light",
"Bravado", and "Passage to Bangkok" play repeatedly as I go to sleep. 
Sweet dreams, shall we say? :-D

I agree with Chris, and it brings up a point I've been wanting to bring up 
for quite awhile.  The keyboard usage on HYF is very much along the lines of 
wind instruments (except for the killer keyboards on songs like Prime Mover, 
Force 10...), and I think it adds to the beauty of the album.

Many of you have stated that HYF has the most keyboard usage of any Rush 
album.  To my ears, P/G has the most usage by far.   Afterimage, Red Sector A, 
The Enemy Within and The Body Electric seem dominated by keyboards (and I 
love them), whereas most of HYF uses keys as accents.  Am I the only one that 
thinks this?

Heidi-ho there, Rush fans!

I have a request. I've been hearing a lot of people chime in with their
favorite 'other than rush' bands and albums for awhile now. Not too long
ago, I bought Live's 'Secret Samadhi'. I like it. But the one I hear the
most praise for is 'Throwing Copper'. And the most popular (on this list)
Dream Theatre album seems to be 'Awake'. The request is for someone to
convert 'em to MP3 format and send 'em to me. (so I can check 'em out

Other Rush lyrics I enjoy immensely:

Most original (sing this one, c'mon, you know you want to!):
 -"Let the truth of Love be liiiighted! Let the Love of Truth shine
clear...Sensibility, armed with sense and Liberty...with the hear and mind
united in a single, perfect, sphere." [DAMN! that's good]

(one of the) Most evocative:
 -"Its the motor of the westerrrn world--Spinning OFF to Every extreme!"
[gets me every time]

best combination of raw energy in the music and emotive lyric:
 -"Alternating currents [scratchy guitar shred here] force a show of hands"

best overall Rush song ever: (feeling a little arrogant today)
 -tie. The Camera Eye and Vital Signs. (voting for this one was done by
secret ballot, and I'm the only one who voted)

Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, Limelight, all get honorable mention, but too
overplayed to really enjoy them anymore.

Could MP have been any better? I don't think so. So innovative. So popular!
So much money raked in! Ther rest of their catalogue, which is totally
awesome, pales in comparison to the tightness. The diversity yet
psychological syncopation. [huh?]

I LOVE THIS BAND!

I just found out that there will be a new restaurant opening in Times
Square in July of this year.  It will be a spaceport style eatery set on
Mars, with Martians running around, the whole sci-fi deal.  The name of the
place is Mars 2112!  It is owned by an Irish company of the same name.
Anyone else hear about this?  I can just see it now, Rush: the official

In NMS #2003 Langford said he/she read a review of the Signals tour 
Milwaukee show and Losing It was listed as the highlight of the show.  I 
didn't see the Milwaukee show but I did see the Signals Tour and Losing it 
was not in the show I saw.  Based on my experience Rush doesn't change the 
show from night to night so I find it highly unlikely that Rush played 
Losing it on the Signals tour.  I'm not saying the Milwaukee Journal didn't 
report the song as the highlight of the show.  They may have indeed done 
that and written a glowing review of the song.  However, just because the 
song was in the review doesn't mean the song was in the show.

On the inspirational lyrics topic I want to add that in college I had an 
English Literature class with this very old professor who clearly was a 
brilliant inspired individual once upon a time.  He really tried hard but he 
had clearly lost his edge.  His name was Dr. Avni  and he taught at CSULB if 
anyone here has met him.  In my review I wrote the lyrics to Losing It.  It 
just seemed so apt.  I really hope he got it.

Re: Incredible Rush lyrics

Even though one may have heard a song a hundred times, it often amazes me 
how a particular line will catch my attention and make me think.  I had heard 
"Beneath, Between and Behind" hundreds of times without REALLY paying 
attention to the lyrics when the two lines "all shining eyes, but never 
seeing" and "why do their shadows bow in fear?" caught my ear.  

This is one of those early Rush songs that seems to be ignored on this list.  
It is a testament to what Rush is about (i.e. NOT sex, drugs and R&R).  If you 
haven't heard it (its on FBN & ESL - although I realize not all of you have 
these albums), in my opinion the song is about the history and truths of the 
American Dream ("a wondrous dream came into being").  

It starts with the American Revolution "ten score years ago, defeat the kingly 
foe", moves on to Western Expansion, mass immigration, and the modern 
inventions from the Industrial Revolution.  The lines "all shining eyes, but 
never seeing" and "why do their shadows bow in fear?" depict how the early 
Americans so bent on growth gave no heed to the negative side effects of this 
growth.  The final stanza seems to describe how through time the promise of 
the Dream is alive, and although it is unfulfilled for many, hope still 
prevails.  To me, "history's debt won't be repaid" can describe both 
"environmental" debt (as in "raping the earth") and "moral" debt (to the 
peoples that were betrayed/enslaved or otherwise taken advantage of to make 
America what it is).

Hanstones

"Beneath, Between and Behind"
 ------- ------- --- ------
Ten score years ago, defeat the kingly foe
A wondrous dream came into being
Tame the trackless waste, no virgin land left chaste
All shining eyes, but never seeing

Beneath the noble birth
Between the proudest words
Behind the beauty, cracks appear
Once, with heads held high
They sang out to the sky
Why do their shadows bow in fear?

Watch the cities rise
Another ship arrives
Earth's melting pot and ever growing
Fantastic dreams come true
Inventing something new
The greatest minds, and never knowing...

The guns replace the plow, facades are tarnished now
The principles have been betrayed
The dreams's gone stale, but still, let hope prevail
History's debt won't be repaid

Calling all /2ush fanatics...

Oh, hi.  This is my first post -- in a long time.  Was a TNMS regular
back in the day, but then a couple little things like dropping out of
college and joining the Navy got in the way.  But now I'm back, and all
is right with the world.  =)

I really started to get into Rush in 1994.  I was familiar with most of
their "radio-friendly" songs, like Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Fly By Night,
The Spirit of Radio, Time Stand Still, Closer to the Heart, etc., but I
didn't actually own any of their albums.  Until I bought Counterparts...
and I was hooked.  Got the rest over the course of about a year through
the nice folks at BMG, and I've got all the Remasters, now, too.

As for inspirational lyrics, here's a fave from CP's _Everyday Glory_:

"If the future's looking dark
 We're the ones who have to shine
 If there's no one in control
 We're the ones who draw the line
 Though we live in trying times
 We're the ones who have to fly
 Though we know that time has wings
 We're the ones who have to fly"

Nowadays, I'm to the point where I listen to Rush every OTHER time I'm
in the mood for some tunes, as opposed to all the time.  Although I'm
partial to some "Rush-y" groups like Dream Theater and Fates Warning.  I
realize a lot of you frown on DT discussion here, but... if y'all haven't
given "Images and Words" a listen yet, do it, do it now!

We're all waiting semi-patiently for the next live album, ehy?  I'm going
to guess that the opening song is going to break the first-song-one-the-
live-album-is-the-first-song-from-two-studio-albums-before (which would
be Animate, natch) and say that it'll be Dreamline.  I'll also wager that
they have a lapse of creativity and call it "An Evening with Rush."

That's it for now.  Your next /2ush listening assignment is: to give CoS's
_The Fountain of Lamneth_ a spin and think of it as an anology for life...

As an NMSer who loves lists, be they "best non-Rush albums", "favorite
Rush songs/albums/fills", etc., I want to join the
"favorite or inspirational Rush lyrics" list submitters.

Here we go:

"A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission"--hell, this entire
song inspires me

"You can surrender without a prayer, but never really pray without
surrender
You can fight without ever winning, but never ever win without a
fight"--makes me think

"Got my sights on the stars
Won't get that far, but I'll try anyway"--is this my life or what?

"Even when I am gray, I'll still be gray my way"--very defiant guitar
work by Alex on this song!

"You got nothing to fear but fear itself?
Not fate, not failure, not fatal tragedy?"--Wow!  what a song!

"Run to light from shadow
Sun gives me no rest
Promise offered in the east
Broken in the west"--I have this song's lyrics next to my desk

That's enough for now.

images scanned and have "A work in progress" you can download the test work 
at the rushtastic ftp site at ftp://www.rushtastic.com/pub if you're 
interested. The Rush98 will include most of the images from Rush97 as well 
as about 50 more or so, as well as sound. I can't give you a date of the final 
release as I'm pretty much as the mercy of my work schedule, but I might have 
the finished product out as early as April 30th.

Hey fellows,
 
	On the issue of Ged's lip-synching to the Double Agent I must say
that when I saw them in DC Ged would walk away from the mic when the
sampled voice came on  without trying to hide anything. 

	I must also mention this to the new owner of Victor who's having
trouble "getting into" the music: Victor is a big disappointment. I think
that it simply sucks! Alex is certainly one of the greatest guitar players
but one may not come to the same conclusion by listening to Victor. Alex
has always been pushed to creat complex and sophisticated guitar
arrangements in a three piece band where every single note certainly
carries a lot of weight and defines a specific tonal quality in a song. I
think that on Victor Alex, being freed from the demanding musical
enviornment of Rush, was just having fun and had no intention of making
anything creative and meaningful. He obviously went through the hassle of
releasing Victor for personal reasons rather than to make any claims of
artistic expression. Victor certainly does not have anything to offer
musically and I just hope that, if there is to be a follow-up, Alex will
make some effort to  show his real potential.

     Hello,

     I just remembered a "Rush sighting" (sort of) that occurred last year.
     I work in the OR of Iowa Methodist Medical Center (yes, the hospital
where the McCaughey septuplets were hatch...- err - born). One day going
about my duties, I heard a familiar sound: Rush! One of the Cardio-Thoracic
surgeons who often brings his own tapes to listen to whilst operating
(usually good ol' rock-n-roll) was listening to Roll The Bones!
     I thought to myself "Ahh! Further evidence of the intelligence of Rush
fans!"
     By the way, coincidentally, this was the same OR room that the
septuplets were born in. Rush played here!!! I actually missed the 'blessed
event' by about an hour or so. I'm glad I missed it, though - that lady's
teeth scare me.

Why are we here? Fertility Drugs!!! Roll the bones!

I have a comment to make about RUSH's penchant for putting down their

light on some of their songs.I have heard Geddy say "lakeside park" is
a stupid song,"losing it" is a dry song,they also said "the trees" is 
no good.Geddy has gone as far as to say that he can't even listen to
anything pre -2112.I know as well as anybody that the band has the right
to say whatever they like regarding their music,but I will also say it 
makes me feel a little strange when I hear them put down a song,especially
if it is one that I really like.I know the band has gone through many
phases of development and has changed their musical style constantly
throughout their career,but they should not be embaressed by their early
material,in fact they should be damn proud,its some of the best music
that has ever been produced.Does anybody else get an uneasy feeling when
they hear these kind of comments from the band?
