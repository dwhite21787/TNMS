<A NAME="64001">Subject: Presto</A>

   All of this talk about the appeal of Rush has brought up a question that I 
have been wanting an answer to.  The song Presto, what does it mean?  I got 
the general theme of the song: yes, I would love to be able to make everything
all right, but I'm not magic.  No one is.  Even though I can look at the past 
and see what was wrong('my memory has a second sight...') and sometimes even 
see whats wrong in the present, I can't change it.    Now, my problem comes 
at the bridge.  ("don't ask me, I'm just improvising...).   What do those
2 verses mean?  What exactly does Neil mean by "I radiate more heat than 
light?"  I've been looking at this for a while, and I'm still fuzzy.  Any 
ideas?

  Hi! I'm a bass player and I'm super-heavily into RUSH, and, as Geddy Lee is 
God, he plays lots of stuff that's too complicated to pick out by ear. So, 
here are my questions: 

    1) Does anyone else here play the bass guitar?
    2) Is there some way that I can get my hands on some sheet music through 
        this digest?
    3) Anyone have a good Geddy Lee statue that I can sacrifice my first born 
        to? (For those without a sense of humor, I'm not kidding)

Recent postings in the Digest have brought up the old argument of why people
like the things they like.  I agree with the old addage that goes "There is
no accounting for taste."  I think that trying to rationalize your obsession
(and mine too) with RUSH is rather silly.  I have grown tired of people
constantly pointing out that they like RUSH because RUSH is the 'best' band.
I do not feel that it is necessary to justify likes and dislikes such as music.
Why does everyone need to use their left brain to explain what their right
brain is telling them?  Can't you just like RUSH without having to justify
your feelings with left mindedn mental exerciese aimed at proving your tastes
are better than other peoples tastes?  I would agree with the popular opinion
that RUSH lyrics are more insightful and probing than most, but this is not
a prerequisite for my admiration of their work.  It is good because I like it
but this should not be confused with liking it because it is good.

Just talking off the top of my head and hoping to generate some good
conversation. . . .

I don't know what you mean Rotem, ANY song that can be played on an electric
guitar can be played on an acoustic.  True, it won't sound exactly the same
without chorus, distortion and delay, but all songs can be acoustically
adapted.

Here's some more chords for you, from 'Presto'... the main acoustic part
('I am made from the dust of the stars, etc...)

C - Open ... 5th string 3rd fret, 4th string 2nd fret, 3rd stg open, 2 stg 1st
             fret, 1st stg open  ... note, 6th (fattest stg) not used
Bbsus2   ... bar all stgs at 1st fret, plus add 4th stg 3rd fret & 3rd stg 3rd
             fret
Fmaj     ... bar all stgs at 1st fret add 5th stg 3rd fret, 4th stg 3rd fret
             and 3rd stg 2nd fret.

Hope you didn't already know this.

By the way, if there are any other guitar playing Rush fans out there, drop me
a line if you want to trade solos, sound tips, etc.

     Hello all!   This may be a question for the FAQL, but since I haven't
heard it posed yet, I will ask it...

   Why was Presto "Brought to [us] by the letter M" and
   why was Power Windows "Brought to [us] by the letter D"?

   In response to the question about playing Rush on acoustic guitar, I
can play Rivendell from Fly by Night, and the Discovery of 2112.  This latter
wasn't played on acoustic, but it sounds good anyway.

   Hats off to the management for doing a fantastic job.

Some Rush stuff that can be played on acoustic include "Closer to the
Heart," "Presentation," "Fly By Night," "Entre Nous," and "Different
Strings" just to name a few. I also like to play the intro to
"La Villa Strangiato" and "A Farewell to Kings." Unfortunately, it's
hard to convey the proper fingering and phrasing of these songs over
the net, so if anybody want details, please send me e-mail separately
and maybe I can work something out. Oh, and I forgot Alex's acoustic
instrumental, "Broon's Bane" that I like to play. I have the transcription
somewhere ...

>From the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide:

      * Rush (1974)
      * Fly by Night (1975)
      * Caress of Steel (1975)
    * * All the World's a Stage (1976)

Canadian heavy metal trio Rush began as a poor man's Led
Zeppelin with a bone-crunching live sound that built up a
modest following on the arena circuit, a period encapulated
by the early albums and climaxing with the earnest live set
_All_the_World's_a_Stage_. The band's dogged determination
to improve finally paid off when their sound and conception
suddenly gelled on _2112_, a science fiction concept album
that stands up favorably against similar efforts by British
counterparts.  At this point drummer Neil Peart, bassist/
keyboardist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson had proven
their instrumental chops and proceeded to improve their song-
writing.  That goal was finally achieved on the breakthough
_Permanent_Waves_, with its excellent hit single "Spirit of
the Radio" and the beautiful "Jacob's Ladder."  Thought Lee's
banshee vocals continued to be a source or irritation for some,
his tremendous synthesizer programing helped expand the band's
range.  By the time of the second live set, _Exit...Stage_Left_,
Rush had become one of the top arena attractions around.

Hear Ye, Hear Ye !!

This is to announce that I've finally gotten around to uploading the
SUN raster files (containing pictures of album covers & pictures of
the Boyz) !!!

The place they are located is waterloo (sorry, don't know the complete
Internet (name) address), with numeric Internet address of:

    129.97.129.72

Here's what you do:

1) "ftp 129.97.129.72"
2) login with userid "anonymous", password <your userid>
3) once logged in successfully, change to to the /incoming dir
   ( "cd  /incoming" )
4) the pictures are in the following files - just use the normal "get"
   to download them to your machine.

    - rush.rast.info: This is the first file to get; it contains
                      information on how to deal with the other files.
    - rush.rast.rush: Album cover from first album, _RUSH_
    - rush.rast.2112: Album cover from _2112_
    - rush.rast.aftk: Album cover from _A Farewell To Kings_
    - rush.rast.fbn: Album cover form _Fly By Night_
    - rush.rast.hemi: Album cover from _Hemispheres_
    - rush.rast.boyz1: Picture of the three of 'em (Recent)
    - rush.rast.boyz2: Picture of Geddy & Alex (Recent)
    - rush.rast.boyz3: Picture of all three (Recent)

    Once you've downloaded them, follow the directions in the file
    "rush.rast.info" to display them on your workstation.

If you need to get a copy of the program "xloadimage", there is a
compressed tar file on the waterloo server, in the same directory
as the pictures.  To get it to a working state, first download it
(using binary transfer) to your local machine.  Then uncompress it,
and un-tar it by using the command: "tar xf xloadimage.tar"  This
will un-tar all the files into the current directory.  After that,
it's just a matter of 'make'ing the file to get the executable. The
README file is very informative - read it! I was able to do it on
a VAXstation 2000 and a DECstation 3100.

                In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
                A stately pleasure dome decree:
                Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
                Through caverns measureless to man
5                 Down to a sunless sea.
                So twice five miles of fertile ground
                With walls and towers were girdled round:
                And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
                Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
10              And here were forests ancient as the hills,
                Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

                But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
                Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
                A savage place! as holy and enchanted
15              As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
                By woman wailing for her demon lover!
                And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
                As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
                A mighty fountain momently was forced:
20              Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
                Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
                Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
                And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
                It flung up momently the sacred river.
25              Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
                Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
                Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
                And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
                And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
30              Ancestral voices prophesying war!
                  The shadow of the dome of pleasure
                  Floated midway on the waves;
                  Where was heard the mingled measure

I have an acoustic, but I can't really say I play it.  But I like to tinker
and lately I've been working on Rivendell (off of Fly By Night), and have
the intro and the first couple of measures worked out.  Sounds really good!
All it takes is headphones, callouses, and lots of determination!  :-)

Hello!  You can add me to the list of 1st time senders.  I have a few
comments regarding a few of the last articles.

With regards to "Rush Through Time," I don't know about the cassette
version, but I have a copy of the album which I picked up in Germany.
The record is actually a Picture Disc -- instead of black vinyl, both
sides feature a concert photo of the lads in full swing printed on the
actual album.  There is no date on the record or cover, but judging by
the length of Alex's hair (*long*), I'd put it at just past
2112/Hemispheres/Farewell (Neil's "Kit from Hell" as Steven Owens II
(or is it Steven Owens I -- I've lost track :) ) is also in the
picture).  The album itself is a compendium of songs from the first 6
or so albums -- something like:

Side 1: Fly By Night/Making Memories/Bastille Day/Something For
Nothing/Cinderella Man/Anthem
Side 2: Overture/Temples of Syrinx/Twilight Zone/Best I Can/Closer to
the Heart/In the End

[ This is *my* personal favorite of my albums.  I love the selection of
  older stuff, and the tape lives in my tape deck in my car!   :rush-mgr ]

The cover of the album has the brand name of Mercury on it, but I'm
not sure how official it is (it lacks a date, copyright, credits, etc,
etc. -- it doesn't even list the member's names!)  Printed on the disc
is something like Pic Disc - A Division of Fitzgerald/Hartley Co.
Though I've seen it Germany once or twice, I've never seen it over
here in the States.  Perhaps someone else can shed light on its
origins... (Alas, my copy has a couple of scratches on side two --
actually, "gouges" or "trenches" might be more appropriate wording :))

[ I've got both this one, and another one called "Anthology", a Venezuelan
  import.  I'll try to remember to bring 'em in and post the information
  on them.  "Anthology" is interesting - the song titles are in Spanish!
                                                                :rush-mgr ]

With regards to playing Rush acoustic, I just started learning to play
guitar a year and a half ago, and naturally the main things I wanted
to learn to play were by Rush.  There are a couple of music books out
there (check music stores with lots of printed rock music) -- I have a
two volume set of Rush, covering albums Rush through Power Windows.
So far I've learned the acoustic pieces from 2112, In the End,
Panacea, the Intro to The Trees, and bits and pieces from Closer to
the Heart, Natural Science, Rivendell, Necromancer, etc, etc.  If your
interested in the books, mail me and I'll get you the Publisher, etc.
(I'm not at home at the moment so I can't get you the catalog #s).
By the way, if any of you have ever wanted to learn to play guitar, I
suggest doing so (I waited 20 years to start) -- it's great to be able
to play some of the pieces, and it's yet another way Rush and their
music has enhanced my life.

I was going to add a paragraph about why I like Rush so much, but this
thing's long enough (not to mention I have classes now), so that can
wait...

Hi.  I was wondering how Rush performs their songs that require
sequencing.  Does anyone know if Peart follows a click-track, or
do they use some kind of MIDI rhythm follower.  For some reason
I have a feeling that a rhythm follower would have a hard time
keeping track of what the heck Neil was doing.  I noticed on the
Show of Hands laserdisc, Neil is wearing headphones during Red
Sector A.  Is he listening to a click-track?

There are several versions of "Rush - Complete" which contain all of the
music for all Rush albumns up to a certain period; for example, I have
a two volume set which goes through Power Windows; I've seen one volume
versions up through Signals.  Any way, most of the rhythm music is there,
including chords for those of us who can't make much sense out of music.
This isn't tab!  But most of interesting lines are transcribed (e.g. intro
accoustic to LaVilla, intro to Spirit of the Radio, chords for In the End,
etc.).  The lead parts aren't there, but the bass lines are.
I picked mine up a local music shop which had a large selection
of sheet music.  A friend picked up a copy at Musicland, so you should be
able to find it easy enough.

In all this is an excellent source of information.

Good day!

        It's been awhile since I posted, but I just discovered something
that really blew me away! To make it more exciting for everyone else,
listen to the first part of 2112. Concentrate on the last guitar solo.
This is very important. After listening to it, ask yourself what it is
taken from. I'll post the answer on Friday.

I asked this question a while ago (almost a year! scary...) but I don't
think I got any responses so I'm trying again.  Someone's got to know!
I'm wondering what Ged says before 'Jacob's Ladder' on Exit....

	"We'd like to do an old song for you right now.  This was
	 done a long time ago by ...(???)...  This is called
	 'Jacob's Laddder.'"

I assume this is some sort of joke but I'm still really curious.
Maybe this could be added to the Questions List as well.

I'd also like to take this opportunity for thanking rush-mgr and all
the people who sent in nifty things like program notes and interviews.
Excellent work that should be commended.  (Sorry, I don't live anywhere
near D.C.)

Hi folks,

    Just a quick note with a plea:  when you request missed individual
issues, PLEASE state either the date or the digest number for what you
are requesting.  When you say things like "yesterday", remember, mail
doesn't always (or usually) get to me the same day!

    Thanks from the bottom of my keyboard!

Ok, it's come to my attention that our mailing list is a bit drab,
name-wise.  As I've been basically concerned with getting the $%^&*
thing out, I hadn't really given much though to artistic flair.

So, with that in mind, I present:

                 NAME THE MAILING LIST CONTEST

Since I have absolute power over Syrinx (hahahahahaha!), I can do
just about anything I want with the mailing list.  We can have the
address stay the same or change, we can re-name the Digest, we can
do whatever we feel like!  (Talk about your objectivism in action!)

Think about what you'd like to see in the way of an interesting:

    - Real address (in the "Return-Path" field in the header,
    - Alias for receiving mail (instead "rush@syrinx),
    - Name of the Digest (instead of "RUSH Fans Digest")

Post all ideas to the list, not directly to me here, unless you're not
sure about the appropriateness of an idea, or something like that.

Let's take the Jethro Tull mailing list as an example (hi Roger!).
It's called "The St. Cleve Chronicle", after a fictitious newspaper
from a Tull album (_Thick As A Brick_).  Now, we should be able to
come up with something good, right?

If this doesn't generate some bandwidth, nothing will!  :-)  Get
those brains in gear and those fingers tapping!
