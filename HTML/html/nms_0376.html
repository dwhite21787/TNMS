And, yes, people know the take-off from Blazing Saddles.  People figured that
one out quite some time ago, and posted it too.

And, please, don't rag on people because they just figured out the anagrams
in Anagram (For Mongo).  They either didn't take the time to look, or just
looked over it.  And let's face it; some people are just slower than others.

Does anyone who regularly read Modern Drummer, or anyone who has seen the

BD setup (which I'm SURE he's using a double-bass pedal on)?  Either post to
TNMS, or mail me personally, I'd like to know so I know what to watch for

To the person who asked the question about the voices in the 'Camera
Eye', those voices are really a Dog in a Submarine-NO! Just kidding. I'm
sure that prettymuch all 1000+ NMSer's know about the peculiar voices in
the second half of that song. Well, here's my thought: It is the voices
of two people exchanging greetings. Why do I say that? Well, I have a
Signals tour video boot, a Moving Pictures boot, and a New World Tour
audio boot, all with the song on it(Damn short versions though!). The
voices can be heard on these live versions also, so we know it wasn't
some studio chat that they overlooked. What are the two people in the
song saying? Well, I think it is a simple
1st voice: "'ello!"
2nd voice: "Morning Gov."

Hope that clears things up for ya. And I won't doubt that someone else
might come up with a different explanation.....

Hi there,

	 I was listening to BBC radio a couple of nights back when I heard
a trailer for a programme about an Aboriginy claim for compensation against
the UK government regarding radioactive fall-out from early Atom-bomb tests
that were conducted in Australia.  In passing, the presenter mentioned that
many "Dreamlines" crossed the geographical area in question and explained
that these were mystical path-ways followed by Aboriginies in their wanderings
through the outback....a bit like ley-lines follwed by New-Agers and Hippies
in Britain in search of personal fulfillment and spiritual power.

	So now we know where NP got the title DREAMLINE from!

<A NAME="376007">Subject: Is Rush really in this commercial videotape?</A>

Yesterday I was looking through the Videolog at a video store. (Videolog,
for those who haven't seen it, is a comprehensive listing of all
commercially released video tapes. It is looseleaf, updated weekly, and
probably very expensive.) Anyway, it has a section where artists and actors
are listed, with each name followed by a list of all tapes in which they
appear. Under Rush, in addition to the tapes we all know about, was a tape
entitled "Scrooge's Rock and Roll Christmas", released by Sony home video.
In the section of the book where each tape is briefly described, it says
something to the effect that this tape is the classic Christmas story as
interpreted by well-known musical groups of the 60's, 70's. and 80's.
Needless to say, the video store didn't have this tape, nor did the manager
know anything about it. I'm skeptical that this could be out there as
described without anyone on this list having previously brought it up.
How about it, people, can anyone shed any further light on this subject??

BTW, today's (11/1) Chicago Tribune has a nice story about Rush in the
Tempo section. 12 hours to go to RTB in Chicago!

Yes, but in the old days, Rush didn't have fifteen album's worth of songs
to choose from.  They were more or less forced to play every song off the
album they were supporting.  Look at bands starting today.  For example,
GnR used to cover 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' live, since they didn't have
the material.

I wasn't disappointed.  I saw them last night.  If you want, see my spoiler

I am pretty sure it wasn't a harmonizer.  After last night's show, I was
able to notice that they PILED effects on top of some of Alex's vocals.  I
really don't think they use a tape machine.

<A NAME="376010">Subject: concert info</A>

Hello all.

  My questions are directed to those of you who have been to a Roll the Bones
show.  First and foremost, I see many people posting ticket price information
and I see two types of tickets.  One being the "normal" ticket and the other
being the "gold" seating or something of that nature.  Now the only "gold"
seating I ever heard of was for Yes's recent Union tour, which was played
completely "in the round" if you know what I mean.  Well, if you don't it
means that Yes actually played in the center of the arena on a rotating stage!
Now there was a section of the floor directly surrounding the stage sold
as "gold" seating and cost a pretty penny.  I am curious if Rush is using a
similar format (which I HIGHLY doubt) or, if not, what the heck the extra
bucks are for.
  Secondly, I want to know what kind of shirts are being sold for the tour.
A list containing brief print descriptions would be really appreciated.  I
thought the Presto shirts were real cool.  But $23!! That really sucks.  I'm
getting so tired of concert-inflation.  Oh well, for the boys I'll probably
dish it out.  That's all for now.

<A NAME="376011">Subject:  Why Voting on Rush can be contraversial.</A>

Lately someone (is it cubsfan@.....?) has been asking for votes on:

Fave Studio LP
Fave Live LP
Fave Song Overall
>From Rush Releases

I cannot make an intelegent vote over these.  Most likely, votes from people
like me would blow the curve for those who have been well rehearsed in the
theology of rush.

Until last weekend, I only had the latest two studio releases from rush
(Presto and Roll The Bones)  Now I have Moving Pictures to that list.

Their older material takes more time to listen to before a comprehensable
statement could be made on them.  What should be included the results of the
poll is a list of the albums the voters have heard -

I.E. if someone doesn't have Hold Your Fire (providing they haven't heard it
from someone else) - they surely won't vote on any of the songs on that LP.
(Sliding right into my next point) There are many Boot copies of Live Concerts
out there - Those who have copies may have heard from those copies outstanding
variances (or extra added solos/lyrics) that aren't on Copywrited releases.
Therefore, for them to say "I like the version of YYZ on the bootleg copy of
their Chicago performance da-ta-da-ta-da" would be similar to saying "I'm so
lame - please - take me to court so I can have charges pressed against me..."
No one here is so crazy as to do that (I should hope, and if they are - I hope
they aren't caught...

>From a Phreaker's handbook they have commandments - the first of which states
that you should not go around flirting with fate by telling everyone you
possess particular "illegal" skills or items.)

>From the collection I own:
ROLL THE BONES
PRESTO
MOVING PICTURES

I enjoy Roll the Bones the most, mainly for it's underlining theme - I haven't
yet discovered that of Moving Pictures (Though I suspect it has to deal with
the changing concepts that come with age vs. those same concepts from youth).

And for favorite overall song, certain songs I prefer listening to at different
times.  Once I realize the meaning of a song - it immediately may (or may not)
become one of my leading favorites from rush.  Thus far, the songs I most
enjoy from the three albums I own are (In no particular order other than
random):

Limelight         from Moving Pictures(The problems of being popular)
Show Don't Tell   from Presto         (How often we steriotype/judge)
The Pass          from Presto         (Cynical ways of dealing with stress)
Hand over Fist    from Presto         (Men are like children, when they fight)
Dreamline         from Roll The Bones (Perception changes with age/chance)
Roll The Bones    from Roll The Bones (Life is based on coinsidence, our
                                       reactions to coinsidence, and the
                                       consequence of our reactions.     )

Just because I claim to enjoy these more doesn't mean I don't enjoy the others
it just means I either don't understand what others mean yet, they don't 
present
to me some (understandable) concept which I haven't understood before (I.E.
Explaining how we take mortality for granted in Dreamline...), or that they
appear too superficial - (Dadaism is a nice concept, but I don't have to like
that type of art...).

I go for lyrics more often than I go for music (Unless it's an instrumental or
a solo).  I want to taste each drop of maple sap - to be educated from
relization - to step inside other people and understand how they view certain
topics to be more objective in making decisions.  Not until recently has
someone explained the way how some musicians sound like "Bubblegum" -
(No offense, but, Wilson Phillips is a nice group - they present a world from
 a highly optimistic viewpoint... similar to the majority of thought-pool of
 children.  Their music supports their beliefs with expecting chords and easy
 to-listen-to harmonies, sounding rather "Bubblegummish".  Rush's Presto is
 completely contradictory to this - Neal even admits that the only theme to
 this album is cynicism.  Although "Presto" sounds a little bubblegummish it's
 literary is not.  Most of the songs on that album present the negative world.
 Perhaps because of the complete contradicting sides these two albums take I
 found it significant to record them on oposite sides of the same tape. )

You don't have to agree with me - actually, I would rather you wouldn't because
that would just prove that I have more to learn...

Date: Fri, 1 Nov 91 11:41:34 EST

More than 10 car-loads of people, all destined for one location, left the
campus of Purdue University in a caravan that probably pissed a few people
off :)

We all arrived around 6:45pm for the 7:30pm start.  I was very disappointed
in my seats, for someone who stayed out all night, and was third in line.
We were three sections away from the stage, 15 rows up Geddy's side.

Eric Johnson went on as scheduled.  He put on a brilliant show, playing his
three "popular" tunes, plus three more he tried to sing on.  Frankly, he
should just play.  Incredible playing abilities.  You could tell he was
from the same town as Stevie Ray Vaughn in his dress, playing style, and
stage appearance.  The bass was WAY down in the mix, which was the only
problem.  But then, you were there to hear Eric Johnson, and no Rush sound
man is even going to CONSIDER giving anyone a chance to show-up Geddy.  He
went off at 8:03pm.  Very nice, short set.

Black curtains dropped everywhere, hiding the ENTIRE stage.  At 8:27pm, the
lights went out, we stood up, the curtain fell, the cartoon characters
walked into the arena, took their seats, and began playing Force Ten.  The
show SEEMED like it went on for several hours, because they never stopped.
Three tunes before a spoken word in-between songs.  The set list was the
same that has been posted here before.  No changes, even on a Haloween
night.  It would have been nice to see "Witch Hunt" played just for that
show.

Comments in general:  I don't know if it was the quad stereo or the mix,
but I was having a difficult time hearing Alex's guitars in sections.
Remember that I was not on Alex's side, so it might be stereo effects.  Neil
looks like he's either been lifting weights or he's put on some weight.
You couldn't tell in his oversize T-shirt and bandana.  Geddy was wearing
SPANDEX!  Amazing!  And Converse tennies :)  The new stage is fantastic.  I
think the new light show has its strong points and its weak points.  The
veri-lights everywhere REALLY add to the show.  I want some for my band!
Gone from the stage are 20 thousand cabinets and HUGE drum kits.  Instead,
there's a much more "intimate" appearance .... four cabinets for Alex, and
four for Geddy.  A single-bass acoustic, and a single-bass electronic
revolving drum kit remains for Neil.  The lights themselves seemed to cast
a more intimate glow on the stage.  Gone are the halogen floods.
Veri-lights replace them.  The rear projection screen is used much better,
too.  Not over-used ... again, more intimate ... more emphasis on Geddy,
Alex, and Neil.

Alex:  Most impressive, when I could hear it.  He needs to learn
how to dance, though :) .... His stage movements have never really
impressed me a whole lot.  His singing is improving.  He was hitting the
background vocals very well (he did miss the first "Subdivisions", though).

Geddy:  Two Wal basses.  One red, one black.  Both with very impressive
sounds.  His singing was very impressive.  I commend his successful efforts
in hitting the higher notes in "Freewill," "Finding My Way," and
"Limelight."  The spandex was a funny one.  Never would have expected it.

Neil:  Ya know ... there's not much to say.  His "new" drum solo was not
all that new.  It started differently .... electronic.  It was cool.  But
then, everything from the Cowbell section to the end was the same as it has
been.  Still unbelieveable, though, in the quad stereo system.

There's a whole bunch of stuff I left out, but I have to go get the
pictures from the show developed!

Hi folks!,
I've only subscribed to TNMS recently, and figured that as long as I'm going
to be reading all of the other posts, I may as well add a little something
every now and then. As far as my faves go, here they are:

Favorite Non-Live Album: Definitely 2112. I love the transitions from acoustic
to electric, and the mix of the classical influences and rock.
Favorite Live Album: E...SL. A great mix of some of the older stuff.
Favorite Song: Red Barchetta ('nuff said!)
Favorite Member: 'Professor' Peart (since I'm a semi-retired drummer), but I
		 enjoy all of the personalities and actually spoke to Ged in
		 the hotel lobby in Germany while stationed there in '83.
I've been an avid fan since. I've seen five of their tours (and missed five 
others by less than three days, DAMN!)
I've got everything they've put out commercially, but woe unto me, nothing
boot.  :^(

Catch you in the news,

I can't believe how many times people have been asked not to
spoil the show for others who have not seen it yet, and yet there
are at least 2 postings everyday that contain information about
the show!

Yesterday, Matt the Bassist writes:

To those who have seen the show or are spoiled:Why do the Boyz open
with "_______?"

I left what he said blank in case somebody didnt read this post.
Matt, no offense but, were you thinking when you wrote this????
You direct your message to those who have seen it or decided readf
the spoilers, so only these people knew what the opener is. That leaves
another group of people; those who havent seen the show and DO
NOT want to know anything about it until they see it themselves.
Yet, you put the question where EVERYBODY can see it!!! Why?

Then Tero is just plain rude and lists about 6-8 songs played
during the show, referring to them as every bad tune Rush ever
had.

PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE don't continue to do this. If your message

Yo people,
I'm not sure if this post got through or not, so if you've
already seen this info, I do apologize----

Anyway, Rush has used harmony since the very 1st album!
If you listen closely to _Before & After_ you can hear
-a dog barking! (just kidding)

-an overdubbed Geddy singing harmony on either the last or
next to last "Yeah, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah" !!!

It's really crude, but it's there.

I don't have much different stuff to say that what has been said. -Wish
the song choices could have been a little more varied compared to what
they played last year; the sound mix wasn't perfect (samples LOUD, toms
soft), etc.

But I do have something to add and that is the amount of JAM the boyz
had. Especially w/ the new songs. With Bravado, instead of just cutting
it, they toned it down and got kind of well, busy. At the very beginning
of Where's My Thing, I thought it was Xanadu, due to the spacy
guitar/bass/drums intro. It seemed that a number of other songs
(Subdivisions, The Big Money) had some different things to them. Like
the boyz re-worked them. Interesting.

Also, the tour booklet is rather nice. Excellent portrait shots. And
real candid photos off the stage.

All in all, very enjoyable. All they need to do is bring back By-Tor!

Ed Chang at Berkely:

My typical Rush fan list was meant to be humorous, didn't you notice
that two items on it were "funny". With all the profound discussions
of dog barking and Neil's lyrics mixed with those immature posts that
simply said "Rush Rocks!", I thought it was time for some levity.

Anyway, how do you know that the millions of Rush record buyers and
the 10-20K concert goers don't possess some of the qualities I spoke
of in my list?
Since you speak of population samples, how did you have time to poll
even a small percentage of the record buyers and concert goers? : )

Hi all...

I know it's been a long time since I posted, and even longer since I
updated the Available Boots List.  There is now, however, a new set of
files for anonymous ftp.  The machine is chaos.cs.brandeis.edu
(129.64.2.6), and the directory is ~/morgan/abl.  The files are:

format- this is the format for submissions to the list (and the format
        of the main list).  anything not submitted in a format close
        to this will be ignored.

item- this is the smaller of the two lists.  it contains a list of
      RUSH bootleg items and who has each.  Use it to decide what
      basic thing you are looking for (i.e. Presto Tour)

people- this is the major list.  It contains a list of people who own
        RUSH boots and what they have and what those recordings
        contain.  Once you know what you want, you can contact the
        person (or people) listed and ask them how they want to do
        it...

Please DO NOT send me lists of non-RUSH recordings, as I will ignore
them.  If you wish to be listed as someone owning (and being willing
to trade) non-RUSH boots, I will be happy to list you at the end of
the people file...

NOTE:  though I am on the list, I am very busy this semester and don't
really have time to do much taping.  Please only ask me to trade if no
one else has it or will trade with you.

Please feel free to send me submissions.  I will not promise to put
them up immediately, but I will try to get to them as soon as I can.
In deference to the wishes of our rush-mgr, I will not be posting
messages here every time I update the list... when it has expanded
significantly, I will, but not just because I add another album or
two.

Also, please DO NOT flame me (or the list) for the topic of bootlegs.
They exist.  I did not get my first bootleg until AFTER I owned ALL of
the currently extant albums (except Archives which a) I can't find and
b) I _might_ not buy anyway and RTB which wasn't out yet).  Having
these bootlegs will not prevent me from purchasing future albums or
going to concerts (when I can afford them), so I don't really think
that I am taking anything away from the Boyz by having these, and that
is the typical argument people make for not having them.

There's a series of books put out by Paper Tiger (the publisher, I
think...I can't remember the editor/authors names) that are just about
album cover art.  The books are, naturally, 12"x12", and nearly every
page has either one full size picture of a album cover or four pictures
of related covers (all by one band or all with a similar artistic theme).
I've got a couple of the books...the first is too early to have any Rush
in it, but the other book has two or three Rush album covers, including
Signals, and now I can't remember what else (I seem to remember being very
disappointed that p/g wasn't there, but that could be my faulty memory,
too).  They're neat books, at any rate, for those of you who are graphically
inclined, particularly when it shows trends--a bunch of covers with wierd
portraits on the front, or all one color, or whatever.

On a related note, there's something I've been trying to figure out for a
while now, and I'd love to be able to ask Hugh Syme about.  What's the font
he used for the titles on p/g?  I've been searching through all the type
books I've got and haven't found anything with that combination of thin
and circular letters, particularly with that shape S and G.  Ok, so maybe
I'm going overboard on this, but is this really any different than wondering
what kind of fill Neil uses in a certain spot in a song?

The Chicago Tribune had a rather large article/review on Rush today (11/1)
in the Tempo section for those of you who get the paper.  Anyway, they
blabbed on about a lot of corny stuff (including equating Geddy's voice
to Donald Duck), but one interesting thing they did say was that the
rap part was done by Geddy.  To quote, "RTB ... even contains a rap
vocal by Lee on the title track."  Now, the reviewer (Greg Kot, Rock
music critic) may have just supposed that Geddy was the one who was
doing the rap vocal, but then on the other hand, he may have some
inside information - i.e. from other people who aren't so involved in
keeping the rapper's identity a secret (like G, A, & N are).  Who knows?

They also said that bands like Living Colour, Metallica, Fishbone, Megadeth,
and Queensryche all cite Rush among their inspirations.  This info is
probably not new to everyone, but nonetheless, interesting.

Just thought I'd say it....

I don't think they have such a tradition.  I've seen them on every
tour since Hemispheres and if my memory serves me correct the following
were their openers.  Please correct me if anyone remembers............

Hemispheres  -   Passage to Bangkok  <sp?>

Rush played The Trees during their Power Windows Tour. It sounded real
cool with a bunch of different types of bird noises and a barking dog
sample in there too(A REAL dog bark! Not some submarine sounding dog.).
I don't know if they ever played Cinderella Man live, but if you will
listen to that song closely, it sounds like a pretty damn hard song to
reproduce live, what with all of the acoustic and electric guitar
overdubs. Good song. I give it an 11!

Greetings and Falicitations --

Just a few comments, etc.

1)  I bow my head in memorium -- Neil with only one bass drum.  IS
THIS THE END OF AN ERA?  WILL THIS CREATE A PERMANENT WAVE OF
SINGLE BASS DRUM TECHNIQUES?  I just can't picture it.  Sigh.  I must
express my condolences on the loss of the second bass drum (give it to
me...!!!!).  sniff.  sniff...  And BLUE, too.  He's been really
changing his colors pretty quick, lately.  I say neon pink should be
the next one...

2)  Something just occured to me.  The reason they don't do a lot of
their older material is because the songs don't interest them anymore
and according to Neil, if the song isn't interesting, they'll be bored
playing it and that won't be fair to the song or to the person who
likes that song.  He considers it "lying" to play a song half-assed.
Personally, my feeling is, LIE TO US!  WHAT DO WE CARE?!! WE DON'T
MIND!!!  I DO see his point, though.  But then again, IF YOU CAN PLAY
'FINDING MY WAY', WHY NOT ANYTHING ELSE????!!!!!  Hmm, I am detecting
a bit of, oh, musical hypocrisy here.  Oh yeah, then after he talks
about "lying", he then turns around and says that they like to sort
of "play the spectrum" (my term) of their material by doing a song
from their beginnings to the most recent stuff.  geez, what a guy...

3)  Assuming the Rockline interview with Neil hasn't been on this past
weekend -- will anyone be taping it (dumb question)?  Also, DOES
ANYONE KNOW IF ROCKLINE IS BROADCAST OVER Z-ROCK?

Hi all,
   The Rosemont Horizon concert was 20X better than any other
concert I have ever been to before, which is not saying much but
it was AWESOME.  Played all of my favorite songs, though one was
cut rather short.  As mentioned, this was my first Rush concert and
I had no idea what to expect, I was completely blown away from the
first beats of the first song.   The playing was awesome on all counts
esp. (not unexpectedly) by "[Ladies and Gentlemen]... Mr. Neil Peart."
(Pronounced by Mr. Geddy Lee as 'peer' with a deffinite, distinguishable
't' sound at the end - so f*ck anyone who thinks it rhymes with 'near'
or 'dirt' - oh, sorry if that was a spoiler of any kind.)  

[ You missed the point - "Peart" rhymes with "near", as opposed to "dirt"
  or "pert"; the reference is to the *vowel* sound.               :rush-mgr ]
  
                                                           All of the
lighting, stage design and everything was darn amazing, too.
   I had a pretty lousy seat, but luckily was right by a railing that
I could stand on to get a very good view.
   Eric Johnson was alright but it won't cause me to want to listen
