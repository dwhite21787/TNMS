Responding to Thomas Beaudoin's post, asking if Rush played at
any event like Woodstock:  Welp, it wasn't exactly Woodstock,
but we used to have grand events in Texas called Texas Jams.
We had people like Van Halen and Kiss headline all-day music
fests.  One time, I can't be sure of the year, Rush head-lined
the Jam.  People I know still talk about it...

	Just thought I ought to say something about the whole Satanism/2112
scandal.  People that thought that Rush was Satanic because of the red star
were not only inaccurate about the band's "Satanism", but were also
inaccurate when it came to the idea of a red star having Satanic overtones.
The "correct" symbol for Satan, hell, etc. is an upside down pentagram.
If the star had been reversed, those people would have been closer, but it
appears that they were wrong in both cases.

Kudos to Gregg Jaeger for the most thoughtful post concerning Rush and
Christianity.

Why do people suppose that Neil Peart is specifically "anti-Christian"?  It
is obvious to me that Peart is a humanist, dismissing abstract and
nonsensical (to him and others) concepts of fate and unquestioned faith.
Peart believes that human beings are the only entities in control of their
lives and destiny--that human action shapes our society and individual lives
at the micro- and macro-sociological levels.  Christianity is never mentioned
outright; his humanist philosophy may not be completely compatable with some
precepts and tenets of Christianity, but I feel that is beside the point.
Man is the controlling power, as opposed to fate, faith, or religion.  Never
is Christianity mentioned, w/ the notable exception of "The Pass," at least
to some listeners (not to me, though).

Howdy,

Hmmm....Rush's playing in Japan, eh?  Hope we got some good shoemakers over
there...  (I know, that's REALLY bad, but I make no appologies)  :)

Lesse here, do I have anything serious to say tonight??  Yeah...I actually do.
About the CD/Tape thing.  I personally vote for tape(s) because...

                            1.  It's cheaper.
                            2.  It's easier to pull off.
                            3.  We can put the long versions of Cygnus X-1
                                and Natural Science and all the other long
                                stuff on one tape, the short stuff on another
                                and make it a two-tape deal.  You could buy one
                                or both, depending on what you are interested
                                and what you can afford and everyone is happy.

Oh well.  I'll buy it regardless.  Later.

P.S.  I'm an atheist and I still like Rush.  I think that, within reasonable
      limits, a person's religious beliefs need not interfere in the music that
      he/she listens too.  Once again, I have to say oh well since I am not
      at all qualified to enter into this discussion.

    Hey, to whomever asked if that was Ged playing bass on SNL, well, I hate
to spoil it for ya, but there is no doubt in my mind that it was NOT Geddy.
  The main reason: check out how short the guy's hair is. If that show was
originally aired Thanksgiving 1991, (end of November), then, between then and 
fDecember 5, 1991, when Rush came here to the Cap Centre, he would have to
have grown about 2 feet of hair. An amazing feat, to be sure. Or maybe,
he's just going bald and was wearing a wig thorughout the whole tour! HA!!!
   no, really, this is not a flame or anything, but that guy on SNL is
just another bass player that looks like GL. Plus, I don't know anything about
basses, but what he plays every week on SNL (another reason - would Ged have
a weekly gig? Don't think so) doesn't look anything like what Geddy played
in concert.
    One more thing: I vaguely remember hearing an interview where one of the
guys (Neil, I think) was asked whether Rush would ever consider playing SNL.
Whoever was on said most probably no, they weren't the type of band for a
show like that. So....

Rushppl --

Just a couple of things here....  First, thanks to everyone who enlightened
me on that Cygnus X-1 issue... even if I did feel just a little stupid at the
fact that a LOT of people knew what the "X-1" meant :)

Also... my apologies to anyone who had a very screwed up copy of the NMS which
that post was in... there was aparrantly a big ol' problem with my .sig file,
where my backslashes came up as control characters....

Now all I need is a response to my "Zanadu/Xanadu" post, and I'll be damn
happy :)  ...then again, maybe I should just read the rest of the issues from
Thanksgiving break before I complain about that, eh!

Hi Rush fans,

I'm BRAND new to this E-mail and especially Rush newsletter thing so bear wiht
(typo) with me.  Well first of all, about this second favorite band thing, mine
is without a doubt Triumph.  Ya know, ya gotta stay loyal to those Canadian
power trios.  Not to mention Rik Emmett is a genius on the guitar.  He
continues to show his mastery on this two solo albums, Absolutely and Ipso 
Facto.

I really haven't heard too much about Rush in the past few months since they
completed the Roll the Bones Tour.  I was, however, interested to see that
someone mentioned that a new album may be on the way by June.  Sweet.

About that whip sound on YYZ, it is definately NOT a whip.  I read somewhere
that the sound was created using glass and breaking a chair.  I forget how
exactly they did it.

Have any of you been to Anthem Records in Toronto?  I have and it is VERY
small.  They have about eight employees and a total of four bands on the label.
Besides Rush, they have Max Webster, Bob and Doug McKenzie, and Gowan.  Gold
and platinum records line the walls and some of the Juno Awards are displayed
above the receptionist desk.  One word--shrine.

I picked up a double CD set today of the Roll the Bones Tour recorded in
New Orleans in February of '92.  It has decent sound and contains all of the
show except for the encore.  It cost a pretty penny but it's a nice package.

Anyway, if any of you would like to E-mail me personally for any reason
(collectables lists, concerts, rarities, or just correspondence), my address
is ghost@brahms.udel.edu and I'll return messages ASAP.  (Yes, the ghost in
my address is for Ghost of a Chance).

<A NAME="573010">Subject: Christianity v. Rush</A>

Hi all.

What was that my mother said about never discussing religion or
politics? Hm, I wonder.....

At the risk of oversimplifying, I would have to say that the primary
objection that Christians MIGHT have to Rush lyrics is that Neil calls
any sort of pre-ordained or "divine" ideas into question  (very
effectively, I might add!) and this is STRICTLY against the religious dogma!
If you are interested in the well-known philosophers with whom Neil's
beliefs most closely coincide, I would strongly recommend that you read
Nietzche or Sartre.  Or you could just reread the lyrics themselves and
understand that what Neil is saying is that life is ONLY what we make
it and all the prayer, pomposity and piousness won't make a DAMN bit of
difference.

Best Examples IMHO: Freewill, Roll the Bones ("for the want of immunity
or a bowl of rice").
Cross-reference (just to piss people off): Jethro Tull - Aqualung (side
2, especially My God, and Wind-Up).

Here's hoping the human race grows up and away from the rigorousness
and injustices of what used to be a useful concept...... organized religion!

Sorry if this is awful heresy to some, but I'd bet it's 'music to the
ears' of most of us!!

   Listen closely, then picture Neil slapping a sheet of plywood against
the top of a wooden stool and the air pressure of the slap blowing some wind
chimes around. Don't forget to put a digital reverb processor into your
imagination's effects loop.

Hello Everyone,

Several years ago, I purchased a copy of the Hemispheres LP (that was
before I had my CD player).  Side 1 is fine, but side 2 is some other
group - definitely NOT Rush - Even though the label says so.  The
catalog number in the vinyl on side 1 is SRM-1-3743 A-13, but on side 2 it
says WATERHOUSE-5-B.  I wrote to Mercury, but only received a form letter
telling me where to return the defective album. Not a chance!  Has anyone
else ever had something like this happen to them?  Would anyone know how
to find out more about what is on the back of my copy of Hemispheres?
Thanks in advance.

As I relatively new Rush fan, I can't determine just where Rush fits
into my scheme of things as far as favorite bands are concerned.  After
all the years I've spent listening to others I really can't justify at
this point making them #1.  My top two are:

1. Dire Straits
2. Roxy Music

with several solo artists, but we seem to be talking just bands here.
Rush is circling the periphery, not knowing quite where to land.

By the way, I have acquired quite a few Rush records over the past few
months since discovering the band over the summer.  I've been listening
faithfully, taking notes, and will eventually post some of my thoughts.
Yes, I'm taking their music very seriously.  It's not only a joy to
listen to but exercise for the mind as well. I will say now, though,
that as far as I'm concerned at this point, nothing tops "2112."

Wait a minute! I think we need to explore the question of whether
Christ's death was a suicide. According to the Bible, it wasn't. Rather,
it was a murder and a betrayal of God's kingdom on earth.
Surrender has a connotation...as in, you are giving up what you believed
in before or are no longer willing to fight for it. The song says that
to die in vain is not to be a hero. I agree. If you kill yourself, you have
died only for yourself. Christ died for more than himself. Suicide is NOT
martyrdom. There is a cause involved in martyrdom, but only self in
suicide.

To whomever wrote the article about having a referrence to Pratt,

(or internal cover on CD) on the back of the shirt, you know the
subdivision plan A borough of Schmeng.... kind of esoteric if you
ask me... in fact, I know it would be hard to put on a shirt, but
I think it would be awesome...

Also to Rodge- what kinda Rick do you play? I have a 4003, but I
have a difficult time making it sing like Geddy can... I personally
think my action is too high (strings off the fretboard)..

Another note to bassists - which bass do you think sounds the best
that Geddy plays on. I am a die hard for the Rick sound he had
on ESL, but I found out that he played a Fender Jazz on MP.. I
guess I like that sound the best, followed by the black WAL on
Presto...

<A NAME="573018">Subject: Re: 11/30/92 - The National Midnight Star #572</A>

This discussion about Neil's philosophy, Christianity, and Neil's lyrics got me
to wondering about the phenomenon of descrying as Satanic all world-views which
are not explicitly Christian. I've read Neil's discussion of Satanism, and I've
frankly been exposed to more knee-jerk fanaticism than I care to recall, but I
would be interested in hearing other people's opinions on the [failure of
understanding, fear, misguided motivation, your choice here] that drives people
to call for the [boycott, destruction, denunciation] of Rush's, or anyone elses
music.

What I'm trying to understand here is the thought process that allows someone
to ignore the cultural framework of freedom of expression with which we were
all raised(at least those of us in the United States, your mileage may vary).
I, for example, cannot stand Rush Limbaugh. I find him offensive(and a lot of
other things I won't bother with since I don't think they're relevant). But I
would no more try to have him removed from the air, radio or television, than I
would attack him physically. But somehow certain people(and it is not only the
fundamentalist Christians who can be charged in this way) have lost the bit of
their super-ego that prevents them from calling for the non-existence of
certain ideas. So, where have we failed? What's missing? How can we teach
people true tolerance of other ideas? How do Neil's efforts help or hinder
this?

I watched Saturday Night Live with Tin Machine too. At first, when
I caught a glimpse of the bassist with the SNL band I too thought
it was Geddy...but after a second or two it became pretty obvious
that it wasn't. The guy had the sharp pointed nose and slim face
but his hair was all messed up (unless he was wearing a
disguise....but really now, who would he be trying to fool?). Plus
if it was, I would think that they would at least mention his name
at the end of the show. Plus since Rush is obviously too big a band
to play SNL, why would Geddy play with the SNL band?

This is just a reminder about the shirts...

They should be ready by Friday (Dec. 4), Monday at the latest. I'll start 
mailing them out on whichever day I get them, but only those who've sent me 
money will get one (no advance orders). For those new people, e-mail me for more
information if you need it. Again, it's $15 US, $18 non-US address. Here's
my address one more time:

Meg Jahnke
8671 Via Mallorca, #49
La Jolla, CA  92037
