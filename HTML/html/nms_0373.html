FOR THOSE IN THE S.F. BAY AREA (CA) and INVIRONS:

For those wanting to listen to RUSH inspired music, there
is a band in Bay that fits the bill:

			MAXIMUM INDIFFERENCE
			4951 Croydon Place
			Newark, CA 94560

They opened for Stewart Hamm (and wasn't that just a fantastic show!)
here at the Cabaret, and I (everyone there for that matter) was very
impressed. They really built up to incredible energy levels. Their
music is all instrumental, and they do Rush's "Viva La...". They
probably know more, but they did not have the time to do everything.

The guitarist sounds ALOT like Alex, and the drummer is a virtual
clone of Peart, coping many of Pearts signature lines. The bass player
is more Hamm then Lee, and plays keys and bass pedals. I would say
they were most influenced by Rush's middle period.

Despite their obvious influences, they are developing a style of their
own that is very exciting. See them and you may have a chance to see
a band in its developmental stage, and who knows where they will go?

For information, contact them at the above address.

PS: For those of you impressed with Eric Johnson, check out Eric on
Stewart Hamm's THE URGE lp in the song called LONE STAR.

	96.9 WRRK in Pittsburgh has just announced that Rush is going to be on
Rockline on Monday, December 2.  Note, they said Rush, not Geddy and Alex from
Rush or Neil Peart from Rush.  This leads me to believe that all 3 of the Boyz
will be on.  One can only hope.

The other day I was flipping through the stations, and heard Rush,
so, naturally, I stopped.  At the end of the song, the DJ let us
know about Rockline.  Neil will be on it on DECEMBER 2.  I was
actually expecting to have seen this in TNMS, and wasn't going to
post since it was behind, but after getting the latest and seeing
no mention of it, I had to let you guys know.  For those of you
in Pittsburgh, Rockline is on 97 Rock/Magic 97 (96.9) at 11:00PM.

The Roll the Bones video was on eMpTyV??  I was at someone's
house on Friday, and eMpTyV was usually on (video only, to watch
those incredible girls in the videos...) I was there for several
hours, so they definately aren't giving it the priority that
they give to MC Hammer or Paula Abdul (surprise!!!)

<A NAME="373008">Subject: The New Music Magazine interview</A>

Here's part of a RUSH interview televised on The New Music
Magazine on 11/11/91.  Sorry, but I only caught the tail end.
It takes place on the set of the 'Roll the Bones' video shooting.

Chris Painter (video director) -  "Unlike a lot of other rock and
  roll bands, the lyrics are very, very intelligent in a RUSH song,
  and yet the music is still hard rocking.  And that's what I look
  for as a video director when I want to do a sucessful video.  I
  want lyrics that are more than your typical throw-away lyrics,
  and I want a band that can really rock and roll. Rush is both
  those things.

NMM (to Neil) -  "You have once again tackled some fairly heavy
  things on this album, Neil."

Neil (laughing) -  "I don't think the element of chance in a
  random universe is particularly heavy."

NMM -  "I think it is!  I mean just the verse, almost the opening
  lines to *Roll the Bones* - 'Why are we here?/Because we're here'

Neil -  "Yeah, well that ... it came by levels.  I mean, as I
  started with a simple line in *Face Up* about turning a wild
  card down.  And that came about through word play.  I was just
  thinking about the phrase 'turn it up' which is, you know,
  pretty elemental; a pretty everyday sensual thing.  You know,
  you like the music -- turn it up.
    "Well then I was thinking about turning up other sensations
  and it became a metaphor, and then I thought, well what other
  things do you turn up or turn down?  Well, you turn a card in
  some games.  And I thought, well, that's a wild card, and then
  I thought, a wild card, yeah, and it became deeper.
    "I started thinking that OK the elements of wild card in all
  of our lives, you know, the little --the choices we make,
  certainly-- but, the conditions that happen to be favourable or
  unfavourable to that choice.  I mean, for all of us, the number
  of times wew escape death, you know, as teenagers doing crazy
  things, or heedless things --truly thoughtless things, but we
  survive and there's such an element of chance about that too.
    "So that whole element of chance became such a great, um, it
  was a theme on its own, but also a metaphor for a lot of other
  thoughts.  And the chance for endearing love is one aspect of
  it --how chance can be, uh, for instance: no matter how
  intelligent you are born and how good your genes are, if you
  happen to be born in Chad or Etheopia, or born in Bulgaria
  anytime in the last hundred years, I mean, the odds become
  frighteningly high against you.
    "So all these things came into it.  Where sometimes you can
  choose the odds, sometimes you can certainly improve the odds
  by the choices you make.  And that's one factor that I wanted
  to make perfectly clear, because I didn't want it to seem
  futile.  So that's why I thought _Roll the Bones_ was the
  ultimate title because it is the ultimate statement.  In spite
  of all these questionings, and thinking about contingency, and
  the accidents that happen in life.  The essence of the story
  [is] you can't remain sort of helpless facing a universe of
  futility --you've got to do something, really.  And either do
  something, or not do something, it's both our choice.  So I
  figure choose the adventure."

NMM (to Michael Vander Veldt) -  "Tell me what *Roll the Bones*
  is about."

Michael Vander Veldt (the kid in the video) -  "It's about fate,
  chance, and destiny."

NMM -  "And you believe in those concepts?"

Michael Vander Veldt -  "Not really, but, ah, you know."

NMM (to Neil) -  "Well how do you think musicianship, being a
  musician, being an artist in a sense --because, people who
  write great book, who paint paintings, in some way their
  mentalities affect it, because their work lives past them.  Is
  your mentality affected because you're a musicain?"

Neil -  "I wouldn't think so, honestly.  I've always had a sort
  of sacreligious view of pop music --that its eminently
  disposable and its meant to be topical and it's kind of the
  journealism of the arts.  You know, I don't mean this to be
  falsely humble at all.  It's the way I look at all pop music
  that I like, no matter how much I like it.  It's a part of my
  life now and it's meant to be topical.  It's meant to reflect
  on my life.
    "A friend of mine used the phrase recently of 'the soundtrack
  of your life' is what he expects from a good album, and it
  should come along at the right time in his life to reflect his
  concerns, his passions, everything.  And it should occupy that
  place in his life and then he moves on and needs a new
  soundtrack for a new period of his life.
    "And I think that's a metaphor for the way that I look at it
  too.  It's a passing thing.  Lyrics that I consider should be
  like the editorial pages, but scrawled in grafitti.  You know,
  it is, again, topical and in a year it dosn't mean much.  That's
  what it's meant to be.  It's a reflection of now.  And I
  remember, in the last album, I used the metaphor of a mirror
  moving down the road, and, sure enough, the mirror has to keep
  moving.  You know it can't go back and have flashbacks, and I
  think that's what a lot of it becomes in the past.
    "So I'm quite happy to let the past go, and I'm uncomfortable
  with the whole idea, really, of, um, music looking back too
  much.  It's good to go back if something's been missed and pick
  it up stylistically.  That's all very relevant, but the true
  retrograde music makes me kind of uneasy.  It's like going back
  to the graveyard, somehow."

Hey kids...

I'm pretty sure that the RTB rap is done by Ged..I know for
sure that it is not Neil...they used an Eventide Harmonizer to
mask the voice and make it sound "more black."

And what's this about Neil getting a new kit...did he ditch his
Ludwigs? Anyone got a line on this?

Also...I don't know about anyone else, but I was disappointed to
hear the opening act is Vinnie Moore...I saw them with Mr. Big
last year and Mr. Big were OUTSTANDING. Any other thoughts or
Mr. Big fans out there?

I don't readily recall which song it was on, but for a few seconds, Alex was
playin' the keyboard with his nose!  I guess he was just getting too bored
with his being given the simple keyboard parts.  And to whoever it was asking
about the opening song, Minneapolis opened with Force Ten as well.

   Howdy all!!!!

    Although it was a rainy day here in the Buff, it was shining bright
at 5pm. Tues.  It was announced that Rush Tix are going on sale for the
Dec 15th show at 10am Sat the 16th!!!  The only question is what the hell
are "golden circle seating"?!  Anyway it don't matter, they are comin' and
that's all the really matters!
    Going through the frequently asked ques. list was pretty cool...a few
things were basic knowledge of the band, to me at least, but what was
cool to me was all the info about the inner picture on HYF!  I noticed
couple things like the "15" on the building and the PW television in the
window BEFORE, but the stuff like the clock reading  21:12 and the "Tai Shan"
sign was a killer!  You should have saw me with my HYF CD and program checking
out all the little details!! (But I'm still looking for that hand holding a
gun in the window??)  Talk about ironic...YYZ is on the radio, also on
both the rock major stations here "Dreamline", "RTB", and just recently
"Ghost of..." has been on frequent rotation, gotta love it!!
    So it's pretty obvious that I am looking forward to the weekend, first
the tix on Sat then it's the Monday Nite Fish Fry!!!!!!(Go Bills)!!!!!!
    Hope to hear a few of you will be making the road trip to the Buff.

    Talk to yous later.

This question is whether Neil's lyrics (and by implication Neil) is
pseudointellectual. I think it's pretty clear that neither Neil nor
his lyrics are `pseudointellectual.' This is a quotation of Geddy. If
it were a quotation of something Neil said I'd say it's very relevant,
but it's not. The impression I get from this is that not all of
the members of Rush care about being intellectual; Geddy seems to be
suggesting that there is disagreement in the band on this point.
Alex, for example, doesn't seem to care about intellectual matters,
but likes talking about them now and then but usually jokes about it
too; _he'd_ prefer pseudointellectualism to intellectualism simply
because he doesn't care to be serious about `intellectual' matters, it
seems to me. Geddy seems more interested in intellectual matters than
Alex, and Neil can be deadly serious about them. That's where this quote
is coming from, I'd say. It doesn't say anything about Neil or Neil's
lyrics, IMO.

Saw the Rush Concert in Minneapolis about a week or so back.  Very highly
recommended.  Alex hasn't lost it, as far as guitar solos goes.  He was really
tearing it up.  Neil was a human battering ram and Geddy dancing with his
bass.  Great show.  Eric Johnson kicked butt, too, but they only gave him
about
30 minutes to play.

Well, I've had the privelge of seeing the RTB video, and I can honestly
say that it is the best video of all time :)
No, seriously, It beats the crap out of EVERYTHING!! Very well done. They
are studs. Right-The question is: How can anybody NOT like this video,
and why is mtv only playing it at 3:00am?!
Well, a lot of you are under the impression that just about EVERYTHING
that RUSH plays nowadays is sequenced. WRONG! Jeeez, have a little faith!
The organ stabs on Roll The Bones are NOT seqenced! NEIL HITS THOSE
HIMSELF. Jeez, do a little sequencing, and you are doomed for life and
everybody thinks that every sound in every song is being played by a
computer..........C'mon, guys. They are NOT Depeche Scrode.

In my humble yet enlightened opinion, the mix at the Minneapolis concert
at Target Center was not up to par with Presto two years ago.  I don't 
think it's the hall -- Yes sounded excellent in there last spring.  Alex's
guitar was barely distiguishable; too much in the high frequencies is 
what I believe was probably the cause.  The drum mix was mostly good, though
lacking a little in highs.  Geddy's bass mix was right on.

This may not be the case at other concerts.  The 28 inches of snow we got 
the weekend of the show probably caused things to be a little hectic during
the set up and sound checks.  

By the way, if you look in the tourbook, you'll notice that good old
Skip Gildersleeve, so long the reliable Stage Left Technician has finally
been promoted to Stage Manager.  Congrats!
