Alas, all is not quite right with the world ...

I sent a second Digest yesterday; this was Digest #62, and contained
a special feature too long for a normal Digest.  Also included were
three posts which had come in between my sending #61 and compiling #62.

For some reason, it never showed up at my other address, which I use for
checking the mailing process.  If you didn't receive a copy, feel free
to drop me a line here (I may regret saying this!), and I'll re-send a
copy to you.

I'm still trying to figure out the scope of this new problem...  I'm 
hoping it just affected me and/or people on my machine (the other one).

Manager,
RUSH Fans Digest

   I've been reading the various messages concerning the attraction of
RUSH. I would like to agree with a couple of the opinions I heard. I think
that RUSH is much more than just Geddy Lee's guitar playing - it's a LOT
more. The thing that originaly attracted me to RUSH was their lyrics.  Most
people like a band because their friends do. I must admit I did not "come upon"
Zeppelin, Stones, Floyd, and a couple other bands.. I was "Introduced" to it,
and eventually I've been relearned to love the music.  RUSH was different.
At my High School 3-4 years ago no one liked RUSH, NO ONE. I heard Tom Sawyer
on the radio and decided I liked the music.  After buying Moving Pictures
and Signals...I was hooked.  Funny thing is - when I first heard Signals
I didn't really "love" the music - but I was DEEPLY moved by the words -
a couple months passed - and I realized that the combination of lyrics and
music is very effective in creating an emotional impact on the listener.
RUSH truly is the best band.

   I realize that most RUSH songs cannot be played on an acoustic guitar -
there are a couple that have parts which can be. I am wondering if anyone
out there can play any RUSH on an acoustic? For example, I can play the
acoustic part of "In the End". If any of you know how to play something
even as simple as a few chords - please respond.
