well as a washy hi-hat thing going on.<<

He's alternating between the ride bell and hi-hat. One hand on the
ride, the other on the hi-hat. When it's time for the snare drum,
his right hand comes off the cymbal for the hit, then right back
to the cymbal. It's 32nd notes, so it washes together nicely
giving the impression the two cymbals are being played at the same
time.

Hey y'all,

For what it is worth.....

I had moved to Wichita, KS during the summer of 1984 to live with my
Father and attend Wichita State University (from where I graduated in
1989 with a degree in Political Science & a degree in History). Wichita
is a town of only about 300,000, not big at all, and is more
"Southwestern" than it is "Midwestern". 

Anyway, my Father owned and operated a bar there called "Incahoots", and
several of the players for The Wichita Aeros (the triple A team for The
Cincinnati Reds), used to frequent the place and drink their dinner
there after the games. One of which was an incredibly nice guy named
Brad "The Animal" Leslie, a pitcher. He was always leaving us tickets
for games and bringing in players from the other teams and such, an all
around friendly/class guy.

The night was Thursday, June 13, 1984, the eve of the Rush/Gary Moore
show at the Kansas Coliseum in Wichita. I was there at The Bar, working
with my Father, the place was packed, and Brad came in for his usual
post game festivities with his normal 3 or 4 other
players....Plus......Geddy Lee!

Geddy had attended the game that night, Brad saw him, introduced
himself, quickly made friends with him, etc. etc. etc. Gave Geddy the
VIP tour of a Triple A ball park, threw in a couple of baseballs for he
& his kid, and were then going out after the game to "lift a few". I
spoke to Geddy for awhile, he was very nice and very cordial....(I kept
The Rush talk to a minimum, afterall, he wasn't "on the clock", eh?) but
when I did pose him a music question, I found him to be very candid and
straight forward, not a pretentious "Mr. Rock & Roll" -type, which I
knew he would not be anyway. I got the feeling he would have answered
about anything I would have asked him. 

Whenever baseball was mentioned, he would talk your ear off. He seemed
to be as "in awe of" Brad, as Brad was of he. It was almost like he
could not believe he was getting to hang out with some baseball players.
As the evening wore on, a few folks would come over and ask for an
autograph, to which Geddy would graciously comply. It was no big deal at
all to him, he was happy to do it. In fact, he grabbed a stack of Molson
Beer coasters, and whenever anyone asked, he would peel one off & sign
it. 

I saw Geddy the next night after the show and he remembered me as well.
Brad had to miss the show, for The Aeros had a game, but as fate would
have it, he got called up to The Reds a few weeks later, and Rush was in
town for a Saturday evening show. The Reds had an afternoon game, so
Brad got to attend. When he got sent back to Wichita later in the
summer, all he spoke of was his evening of "Grace under Pressure" with
Rush. 

Brad was a relief pitcher, never really hit the big time, but Topps did
make a card of him in their 1986 set. If you look inside of the credits
for what would be Rush's next album, "Power Windows" concealed in the
credits & Thank You's is:

"On the mound: The Animal"

So Brad Leslie's legacy lives, not in the spirit of Baseball, but in the
Spirit of the Radio, the realm of Rush. 

Just thought someone might be interested,
yours in allegiance,

Bryan C

   [ Didn't want to interrupt the story, so I put my query down here:
     June 13th was a Wednesday, and according to the tour dates listing
     they were playing Tulsa that night. The 14th was a Thursday, but I 
     had Rush playing Wichita on the 15th (Friday). So the listing has been
     changed to the 14th unless I hear otherwise...            : rush-mgr ]

Try the album "Clutching At Straws."  It is a great CD.  Don't expect to
hear much Rush influence in it.  It does sound alot like Genesis though.

covers. >Oh well, maybe next time.

I'm not aware that they do any Rush covers (other than the bits of a
couple of songs on their first album).  However, they do cover Public
Enemy and the song is available to the public for sale.  I may as well
use this opportunity to plug the new PE album.  Not as good as "Fear Of A
Black Planet" but good nonetheless.

>>Hello all Rushians everywhere!

             I'am a bass player, I have spent all my time playing 
Geddy's songs, during four long years, and I want to emulate the 
signature sound of Ged in the HYF lp. I have a Gibson and a Laney amp.<<

My condolences.  ^_^

Seriously, I've never played a Gibson bass.  The only person I've ever seen 
doing so is Adam Clayton of U2 (check out the band photo on the inside 
front cover of the "Achtung Baby" CD booklet).  How is it?
I didn't know Laney made _bass_ amps...  How is it?

Geddy-no soundo on HYF (I assume you mean his _bass_ sound):  Well, I 
achieved a reasonable facsimile by cranking all the volumes and tones on my 
bass (which is how I normally play) (meaning, use both pickups), then 
turning the amp's lows down, the mids up and leaving the treble at 5.  Be 
sure you don't get any distortion; the Wal sound, as opposed to the Fender 
or Rick sound, is a _clean_ sound.

The REAL secret:  You've heard the expression "Tone is in the fingers"?  
Well, that's very true in Geddy's case.  He plays fingerstyle, but he plays 
fingerstyle HARD (if you've seen him play, a lot of times he seems to be 
picking with all his fingers together, probably making contact mostly with 
that middle nail of his), which is why he has such a cutting, aggressive 
sound.  That's somewhat less the case on PoW and HYF, tho...
Also, it would help to get a Wal bass <g>.  They have a very distinctive 
sound.
Lastly, I seem to remember somebody posting a Geddy interview here in which 
he said that he used lighter-gauge strings on HYF.  Makes sense, as his 
bass sound is "snappy" rather than "grungy" compared to other Rush albums.

<A NAME="2046005">Subject: That sound on "In the End"</A>

I brought this EXACT SAME thing up back around Christmas or so.  Didn't 
generate NEARLY this amount of discussion.

The sound doubling Alex's solo is NOT a guitar, I'm sorry.  Maybe it's 
because I routinely listen via quality headphones, but I can quite 
clearly hear distinguishing characteristics of a FIDDLE, a VIOLIN.  You can 
hear it scraping, you can hear the player not _quite_ hit a high 
note at 4:36 and then slide off.  As the solo ends, Alex goes into a really 
heavy repeated chord (perhaps hence the "more distortion than a human 
should be allowed to use without a license" thing) while the fiddle and 
maybe one of the guitar tracks (that solo is at _least_ doubletracked) stay 
on the repeated pentatonic riff until Geddy comes back in.

I've listened to that section over and over, many times, and I just can't 
_not_ hear the fiddle's distinct scraping attack (particularly right when 
it comes in at 4:22 or whatever).  The only way a _guitar_ could do that 
would be with the aid of a fairly advanced guitar synth, which Alex most 
certainly did NOT have in 1975...

btw Remis Ramos, another note: to the best of our collective knowledge, 
even though Rush may not be touring this year, they are not breaking up 
either.

For those of you who care what Rush songs any particular radio station might 
play:
When Signals came out in 1982, WMMR in Philadelphia used to play "Digital Man" 
all the time. I remember hearing it and not knowing what the title was. They 
also used to play the live versions of 
"Tom Sawyer" and "The Spirit of Radio", "Entre Nous"(studio, obviously), and 
I think even the studio version of "Jacob's Ladder" a few times.
Now I live in Boston. A few years ago, I worked graveyard shift at a 
convenience store. Every night at 3am, WZLX does "Long Song of the Night". 
Two times I was blown away to here Rush-the live version of "Xanadu" and the 
live version of "By-Tor and the Snow Dog". That  one really shocked me...must 
have been a request.

Any bass players in the Boston area want to jam on some Rush?

Here in Woodland, California, running for city councilman is 54 year old

It's pretty cool driving around town seeing all these signs reading "Peart

When T4E came out, I thought that "Dog Years" was one of the worst Rush
songs ever.  Now, however, it has turned into one of my favorites on the
album.  The bass line is just incredible.  Just a thought.

I've been corresponding with a fellow NMS'er (Hi Broon...er, Tom!!), and 
we discussed a thread that I thought would be kind-of fun. How many 
NMS'ers have their own Red Barchetta? I recently bought mine...a 1995 red

played in the tape deck? Guess...

On another topic, we've been talking about guests vocalists...what about 
guest guitarists? I, for one, would love to hear Eric Johnson play on 
some tracks with the boys...has anyone out there got Stu Hamm's CD called 
"The Urge"? I highly reccommend it. Anyway, I've seen Eric open for the 
boys, but it would truly be a musical orgasm for me to hear them playing 
TOGETHER...

Anyone care to second this?

Rush on, guys!

hey NMSers out there,

About this time last year I noticed an ad posted
on a bulletin board back at my home school of Virginia Tech.
This ad was about a group that met like once every two weeks
to discuss the works (and meaning of those wokrs) by Ayn Rand.
Recently, while watching South Park (a very low-intel but comical
cartoon on Comedy Central), I noticed the use of Ayn Rand...the
formerly illiterate policeman turned - reader was going to read this
book.  How did Ayn Rand come up?  Furthermore, in a newspaper
down in Virginia it appears that some high school kid was in car
accident and during his recovery he said he would read stuff by
Ayn Rand.  He went on to make a comment on how his friend
had read this book and how this reading greatly influenced his 
friend'slifestyle.

I have heard that Rand's work shows up in Peart's lyrics on 2112
or Hemispheres or AFTK.....one of them...
I would like to think that Neil really did reach people through the
lyrics on 2112/hemispheres.....he/Rush made Ayn Rand more known
maybe,,,,,well, who knows for sure.

(BTW, could someone fill me in on which album has lyrics that were 
influenced by the works of Rand?)

Anyway, just email me if you noticed the use of Ayn Rand on South Park
>.....I nearly died laughing!!!!  

I need to read this Ayn Rand philosophical
stuff now it seems......

Hello fellow Rush-Addicts,

What is it with Rush and the color Red? It seems to be their favorite
color, as it is mentioned more than any other color, here are a few 
of the more obvious Red references:

Red Barchetta
Red Tide
Red Sector A
Red Lenses
"Red alert - Red alert" and
"Take a page from the red book"  (Distant Early Warning)
"We can fall from rockets' red glare" (Between the Wheels)
The Red Star of the Solar Federation 
The Red Fire Hydrant on Signals cover
The men moving the pictures are all wearing Red clothing
Band Name on the covers of Presto, Moving Pictures ,Hemispheres,
     Hold your Fire and Rush 
Entire Hold Your Fire cover

So it seems that Grace Under Pressure contains the greatest number
of Reds.

I don't think that all this Red has anything to do with Communists
and if any of you do you probably work for MTV or Rolling Stones
Magazine.  My guess is that all these references to Red have to do with
the Red Maple leaf on the Canadian flag, that would seem to be the 
most logical explanation.  Who Knows? Maybe Red is Neils Favorite 
Color.

<A NAME="2046016">Subject: Rush = Iron Maiden</A>

This could be an interesting new thread.  A friend of mine who I have made a
Rushian out of has been trying forever to get me to listen to Iron Maiden.
"I'm telling you, man, it is just like Rush.  They are the same!"

Well, to date I have listened to one Maiden album, Powerslave.  I think the
album is outstanding, but I don't see much similarity to Rush.  I think
Maiden falls somewhere between Queensryche and Dream Theater from what I
have heard.  Of course, those bands are widely said to be similar to Rush as
well.

The biggest difference is that they have two guitars and not a whole lot of
emphasis on bass.  Secondly, the lyrics, while interesting, are very violent
and much less intellectual than I think of Rush.  Thirdly, I think the
entire Powerslave album is in 4-4 time, with no variance - something Rush
would never do (Roll the Bones notwithstanding).

The biggest similarity?  They do a song based on a Samual Coleridge poem -
The Rime of theAncient Mariner.

Now, like I have said, I think Powerslave is a great album and I'm certain
to listen to more, but are there any Maiden fans out there who would like to
comment on the statement "Maiden is just like Rush!".  Obviously they are
not identical, but I dno't really hear many similarities at all.

Hey guys,

	I'm back in black with vengence and the creative juices are flowing. 
Now that I've moved into my OWN new place and am pretty much settled,
I'm getting back into the music business.  Since my consulting career
took off, I decided to take advantage of it and invest in a keyboard
setup for jam and stage use. 

	I'm looking at an Alesis QS7 with an expandable rack both for
additional keyboards and rack mounts, 32 mb of ram and the ventage
PCMCIA expansion card for the prog sounds like the Hamond B-3, etc.  The
amp I am also looking at is an Alesis RA-100 stereo amp with .7 stereo
reference monitors.  The thing I was wanting to know is What do Geddy
Lee and Kevin Moore use.

	Also I'm replacing some CDs the exbitch stole.  I was wondering if
anyone knows where I can score a copy of these:  Saga's Worlds Appart,
Autograph's first self titled release, and Taking On The World by Gun. 
Anybody know?

Thanks in advance,

Erik.

On Thursday, May 28th, some desperate fool broke into my car and stole 
every CD I had.  I took them with me that night to the computer lab at 
school to work on my webpage.  The next morning, I discovered that all 
of my CD Folders were taken.  The police have a report, but, really, 
what can be done?  

I admit I was wrong to leave them in my car, but now, I must bear the 
loss of all of my Rush CDs as well as all of ther other great music in 
my collection. 

This was just a heartfelt little note to say how much I miss my Rush CDs 
and can hope someday I can afford them again.

Thanks,

No, it's pronounced  <mar-ILL-eun>. It's short for Silmarillion, the
Tolkien book.
Marillion is kind of a mixed bag but basically it all comes down to two
choices: Fish (original singer) or Steve Hogarth (current singer). This is
the band that pretty much single handedly invented the neo-prog style so
often imitated. Much of their very early work was somewhat patterned after
Peter Gabriel-era Genesis and gradually matured and evolved over the course
of the 4 albums Fish was on ('83-'88). These are considered more "proggy"
than current Marillion which is much more song-oriented with Steve Hogarth.
It's kinda like comparing Permanent Waves period Rush to current Rush. To
hard core fans it's all good but you'll run into some people who prefer the
old over the new.
Fish, as a singer, can take some getting used to if you've never heard him
before. His vocals are somewhat lyrically dense and there's times you want
him to just shut up. Hogarth is technically a better singer though some
feel he lacks Fish's lyrical inventiveness and bite.
Recommendations? I think there's a decent sampler available you may want to
check out just cuz they've been around a long time. My guess is you'll
prefer the earlier stuff, probably Clutching At Straws or Fugazi.

Man, Marillion kicks ass! get any of the albums with singer/lyricist Fish
(later albums have a sappy guy named Steve Hogarth singing and
writing...uggh). The albums with Fish are:

Script for a Jester's Tear (1983)
Fugazi (1984)
Misplaced Childhood (1985)
Clutching at Straws (1987)

Misplaced Childhood and Clutching at Straws are AWESOME, but the other two
are really good too. There's a single which came out in '82, I think, called
"Market Square Heroes" which has an awesome Genesis-esque 19-minute song
called "Grendel," but "MSH" is going to be almost impossible to find.

FYI, Fish is a pissed-off, drunked Scot who sounds like a Phil Collins with
too much 'lager'--in other words AWESOME!!! much better than Hogarth....

Actually, it's very easy in a studio.  Doing it at home is not hard. 
Doing both parts at once requires a serious stereo rig and/or mixing board.
Got a friend with guitar gear? have him max everything out on gain and
turn up the treble.

Hello All,
     Someone asked if it was possible to nail a "third arm part" such as
in the last verse of "Hyperspace" within "Natural Science."  The answer
is, YES.
     Neil is playing 32nd-notes between the hi-hats and the ride cymbal,
striking the downbeat with his RIGHT hand.  Now that you mention it...it
could sound suspect for an overdub.  But...as we all know, Neil is
infamous for laying down ENTIRE drum tracks for an album within 3 to 5
days.  I imagine it took him longer in those days...though he is a
purist in the studio...careful to record what can be played live.  He
used that pattern for the song during the "Test For Echo" tour.

believe).  It is Geddy and Neil, exchanging helmsman duties.  I forget

Hey,  Geddy to replace Ginger ... what about it ?

Who's your favourite spice ? 

Okay. Long time no post. However, the kids on
Rush thread has dragged me out of lurkville.

Despite my persistent and best efforts, my
seven year old daughter has become a Spice
Girl fan.  Oh the pain.  You have to understand
that I didn't necessarily want her to become a
Rush fan ... I simply wanted her to make up her
own mind rather than mindlessly follow the
hoardes and all that pop drivel that gets
endlessly thrown at you.  The power of
marketing indeed.  And now she's a spice girl
fan... the Fabrictaed Five (err four).     
    
My 3 year old son parties to everything from
Barney to Spice Girls to Black Sabbath. 

However last night the family had a Rush
moment. 
Let me go back .... 

This moment traces back to Sunday's golf
round.  My buddy reached the green in two
shots on a long par 5.  I thought to myself 
"Superman".  Then,  instantly, for some
unknown reason, I began singing the line
"Superman, in super Nature
Needs all the comfort he can find
Spontaneous emotion
And the long enduring kind" ... you know the
tune. 

So I have been harbouring a desire to hear that
tune since Sunday.  Last night while the kids
were in the tub I fired her up ... loud you might
say. 

The kids arrived out 7 minutes later in time for
"Totem",  which happens to be a family fave. 
We then went through Driven, Half the World,
and Colour of Right.  I was lead and rythm
guitars, my daughter was percussion,  and my 3
year old wild man was the body surfing mosh
pit fan kinda guy.  The wife worked the lighting
board ...err switch.

Ahhh, it's nice to get the kids off the Spice
Girls for a brief diversion.

subjects that have been lurking around the NMS for way too long. Kinda'
like they do in sports with their jersey numbers. Once it's retired you
can't use it again.

Subjects I'd like to see retired are:
        -  Neil has/doesn't have cancer
        -  Rush are/are not satan worshipers
        -  What's the sound in YYZ
