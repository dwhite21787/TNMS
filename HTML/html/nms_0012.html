Here's something I've always wanted to run past fellow Rush fans:  I think that
Grace Under Pressure is Rush's WORST album (even behind Rush Rush).  I get
depressed every time I attempt to sit through it, and the sheer REDness of it
bothers me.  Does anybody else have strong opinions about P/G?  Am I missing
a deep (red) philosophical message or something?

Does anybody remember Ron Kleiner's album poll from this spring?  I had many
of the albums that wound up on top, but I'd never bought a Peter Gabriel album,
so I went along with the poll's recommendation and tried to buy Peter Gabriel
(Third Album).  Unfortunately, he's got at least 2 untitled albums, and I had
trouble figuring out which one was III.  I wound up with the album with Games
Without Frontiers on it... was I right?  Its a fairly good album, but I'm not
sure what made it one of the best-of-the-best.  Any Genesis/Gabriel fans want
to clue me in?

It would be fun to see another poll like Ron's come around, but it might get
more response if we wait for the ".edu" crowd to come back in the fall.

BTW: Favorite album = Permanent Waves, Fav song = Something for Nothing.
