By the time this goes out tonight, we should have another 50 or so members
added to the list.  I'm chewing through the backed-up mail as fast as my
little fingers can type!

Once again, please let me say (echoing several people's feelings) that the
people doing the T-shirts are coordinating their efforts!  I've counted
at least three people who've mentioned that they are willing to do it, and
one person even quoted prices!  You might make it open for ideas for a week
or two, then compile the best into a couple of designs, or just go for one.
Any pictures could be converted to GIF and uploaded for people to peruse
in advance of purchase.  Send me mail at the admin address if you want me

Hello again.

	I'm not sure anymore of who all I've sent mail to for NMS
shirts.  Just to let them all know, I'm definately interested in
one, or two, or three.  Just as long as they don't shrink as much
as the black tour shirts designed by Pushead.

	As usual, anyone who's got a bootleg of ANY of the RTB
shows, please lemme know!  I've also seen talk of Caress of Steel
boots.  Anyone owning one, or maybe a boot of the 2112 tour, again
lemme know.  I'll provide the postage, blank tape(s), and a little
bit of trouble $$.  Tanx!  Keep flying in the night with grace,
under pressure!

Uhmmm, somebody mentioned a poor showing at Baltimore on the Presto Tour.
>From all the complaints I have read about being no Baltimore show, sounds
like we all could have filled the place!

Anyhow, I was planning on taking a class on Sys Admin in Baltimore the
week of March 8th (what timing) but since there is no show there on the
11th, how's about any confirmation on the 3/8 show in Hampton, VA or the 3/10
show in Richmond, VA that someone listed in the rtb.tour.dates on syrinx?
Anyone?!?  All you Marylanders and/or Virginians should have some info I would
hope.  Are these places far from Baltimore?  Please email direct as I need to
make arrangements for my class now (maybe I can go elasewhere if Rush goes
elsewhere :-).

[ It's about 2 1/2 to 3 hours from Baltimore to Richmond, depending upon
  how low you tend to fly.  :-)  The Richmond show is already on sale, FYI.

Hi guys,

	Anybody aware of any other Primus albums except
	Suck On this, Sailing the seas of cheese and Frizzle Fry. ?

	And count me in for the T-shirt, its a great idea.
	Why not have all the Rush album covers on the back of the shirt ?
	Should be cool huh, right from RUSH to RTB, in chronological order.
	Or it might be a better idea just to have about half of them,
	so that we can have pictures of the boyz too.

	I think RTB was the best cover to date, any other opinions about
-- 	that ?

	Keep up the great work on the T-shirt front, looking forward
	to wearing it soon.

I would like a t-shirt, but am not committing to any one person
out there. Until the three parties involved sort things out and
there becomes an "official TNMS shirt" there is going to be a
strong reluctance on the part of the general populace.

I vote for the tabloid look. In particular, Hans Gruenig's ideas
from TNMS #428. I also like the names on the back idea. How about
email addresses?

Ever notice that some folks are getting all concerned over copyright
stuff and others are begging for Bootlegs? Just an observation, not
a commentary...

Just to add my mostly irrelevant facts to a few questions:

	About ads:  well, Neil advertises for Zildjian (oh God, I know I
misspelled that) and Promark sticks, Alex and Geddy both endorse GK amps
and related equipment, Alex's name has been on list-type ads for Martin
or Gibson acoustics (not sure which), and Geddy had a long ad campaign
for his string company (Rotosound?)  And, of course, Neil endorses Schwinn...

	My vote for a cool bass line:  the fills in the last verse of "Time
Stand Still"

	There is indeed a new Queen album coming out.  The tentative title
is _The Show Must Go On_, and the single of the same name has been out
on radio for a month or so.

	Those of you in the Boston area, who like Rush/Yes/ELP/Genesis,
there's a Berklee band called Raymaker (_not_ The Rainmakers) with a CD
in the local section at Tower.  The bass player is phenomenal...(flame
shields up) he's better than Geddy, IMO.  Check them out...cheap CD,
interesting songs.  FYI their live closer is a 17-minute song (cool!)

Did anyone catch the Day in Rock on Monday or various news clips on MTV on
Tuesday?  Well if you caught it you can go on to the next post, but if not
let me tell you all what are good old friend Kurt Loder had to say about
dem boyz.

Apparently Rush donated the proceeds from the second show in Oakland last wee
k to an Aids charity.  According to Kurt, the band and promoter Bill Graham
Presents donated $100,000 to AmFar which is the American Foundation for Aids
Research.  What makes the story interesting (besides the fact that Rush was
actually mentioned on MTV) is the fact that Rush is only the second rock/pop/
rap act to donate money to this important charity (second to Madonna).  In
addition, our man Kurt (I barely smile) Loder had a quote from drummer Neil
Peart (BTW Kurt, that's pronounced like the word Piert not like the shampoo!!)
which said that the band feels they have a responsibility to do something
like this because of the crises which is currently happening with the Aids
disease.

Well, in my opinion, this just goes to show what kind of people the these
guys really are.  Mind you this was not a Canadian charity but an American
charity and it is the first time in a long time I can remember Rush giving
money to an American charity and further, being recognized for it publically!

[ After the second show at the LA Forum, Rush and a local radio station
  both received an award for charity work they'd performed.  Apparently
  the band does a lot of charity work/contributing, but never lets it get
  out to the public.  Classy.                                   :rush-mgr ]

In response to the post about previous endorsements the guys have done, I have
a few GK ads which Alex did and a Roto Sound string ad which the Gedster did.
BTW, the Wal bass company only makes custom basses to order, so they don't ad-
vertise or I'm sure Ged would be endorsing.

In response to the RTB t-shirt having a Meadowlands date, it's wrong!!  I asked
Mike McGloughlin about that early on in the tour and he told me that they make
these shirts up long before the tour gets confirmed so there could be a mistake
or two.  As to why there will be no Meadowlands show, blame it on Ringling
Brothers!!!

Bye.

Oh, hey, I'll agree with that 100%.  There's nothing Erland and, say,
Rod Johnson like more than some undergrad going balls-to-the-wall
defending Rush's position in their personal musical constellation.  And
still people wonder why Rush-related threads get so out of hand so quickly,
and why RushFans (tm) have such a crappy reputation on Usenet.

And before you mail me or the NMS asking what I have against undergrads,
let me tell you something:  5 years ago, I was one of those people who
absolutely WENT OFF at the slightest non-flattering mention of Rush.
I mean, they were THE best band, Neil was THE best drummer, Geddy was
THE best bassist, they wrote THE most complex music, etc., etc., etc.
And I accused other people of being closed-minded about Rush, when
the straight facts were I was closing my mind and limiting myself.

I think these reactions are a function of youth and excitement, and of the
react-or's exposure to other "shapes and forms" of music.  Well, before this
starts sounding too much like a self-help group testimonial, just let me
suggest this:  have enough confidence in your own likes and dislikes so that
you can let the "RUSH SUCKS" postings slide without feeling as though you
need to take up arms in order to educate their posters.  It's just music,
and it doesn't define who or what you are.

Sorry to sound preachy, but I think about it.  My dream is to see one of those
"Rush is the most overrated band in existence" posts expire without a
single followup.  Yeah, I know....

<A NAME="429013">Subject:  NMS T-Shirts</A>

Sure, I'd love to have another RUSH related t-shirt (that will last
more than one washing:)  Here are a few suggestions for the whole
process:

1)  I know that people have already volunteered for the production of
the shirts, but I just wanted to throw one more name out.  There is a
company called Crazy Shirts that makes the best t-shirts I've ever
come across.  The designs are cool, but most importantly, the t-shirts
they're printed on are of the highest quality I've seen.  I've owned
some shirts from them for several years and they're still in good
condition.  They don't shrink that I've noticed and their X-large is a
REAL X-large, not a large X-large.  Anyway, I saw a note on the back
of their catalog one day that said they print shirts up (in quantity).
If anyone is interested in looking into this, e-mail me and I'll send
you the address.  Just a suggestion if production plans are not
firm... (By the way, the normal price for a Crazy Shirt is $16-18, but
it is absolutely worth every penny for the quality and it's cheaper
than concert shirts)

2)  As for the design of the shirt, I'd love to see a collage of
different RUSH related objects on a black background, sort of like the
inner jacket to the _Exit... Stage Left_ CD.  Of course, we could
include some of the newer things.  Suggestion list:

    1) Man stepping into pentagram (2112)
    2) Owl (Fly by Night)
    3) Brain (Hemispheres)
    4) Dog near fire hydrant (Signals)
    5) Men moving paintings (Moving Pictures)
    6) Box with "RUSH" and "43" written on it (Caress of Steel)
    7) Rabbits (Presto)
    8) Dice/Bones (Roll the Bones)
    9) Man juggling fire (Hold Your Fire)
    10) Cartoon version of the boyz
    etc

    These are in no particular order and I realize that not all of it
would fit, but it's just an idea.  Like it?  We could still work in
the NMS World Tour idea, but instead of putting names down, how about
servers?

                             DARTMOUTH.EDU

     I like the tabloid idea too, but it's been used recently by Guns
and Roses.  I like GnR, but if I'm wearing a RUSH shirt, I want people
to recognize it for what it is and not say that we copied GnR.

     There it is... comments, additions, flames?

Yo, Rushians. For what it's worth, the following review was
posted on CompuServe's Rocknet forum a few days ago. The guy's
not 100 percent right about everything, but since it's
overwhelmingly positive, I thought you hyperdefensive, overly
touchy Worst Fan sorts might like it. :-)

Enjoy - and for those who haven't caught this tour yet, DO IT!
You won't regret it.

Bruce

   (January 31)
   Being in a touring rock band can be a tedious job. Same songs,
same lights, same generic arenas, night after night.
   But every so often, a group will have a magical evening onstage,
when all the components mesh together and both the band and crowd
know it.
   Rush had one of those evenings Wednesday night at the Oakland
Coliseum.
   Guitarist Alex Lifeson once told me "that every once in awhile,
you look around at the other guys and know its happening," so it's
obviously happened to the group before, but this was by far the
best Rush show ever put on in the Bay Area.
   It was a greatest hits-type retrospective, with the band digging
deep into the vaults for both songs and staging, but it was also a
back-to-basics sort of performance, as Lifeson and bassist Geddy
Lee stuck to playing the instruments hanging around their necks and
not relying as much on floor pedals (both bass pedals and keyboard
signals are used, allowing the band to remain a trio onstage).
   It started with the set list, a collection of band staples
("Big Money," "Subdivisions," "The Pass'" "Tom Sawyer"), the best
of the new "Roll the Bones" album (the title track, "Dreamline,"
"Bravado," "Ghost Of A Chance") and a few gems ("Limelight,"
"Freewill," "Xanadu") that are taken out of storage every few
tours, dusted off, played, and then put away again and brought back
another time.
   The real suprise was the encore, when the band mixed together a
medley of "The Spirit of Radio," "2112," "Finding My Way,"
"La Villa Strangiato," "Anthem" and "Red Barchetta." It was a real
treat for fanatics, since "Anthem" and "Finding My Way" haven't
been played live since the band was at Winterland in the mid-'70s.
   The lighting and staging were exquisite, as usual, and it helps
to have most of the same stage crew employed as the band had on
its first tour. The last few tours looked like the band and the
crew were just going through the motions, but this tour, with the
great set, seems to have lit a fire under the light men and stage
hands, as well.
   The group used a film collage of live footage and animation shot
onto a huge screen located at the back of the stage, as well as
laser lights and other special effects. A series of backdrops were
employed, and the bobbing, inflatable rabbits from the "Presto"
tour also made an appearance, adding a humorous light to the usually
serious band.
   The band members were much more animated on this night as well.
Lifeson was his capable self on guitar, but just as playful with
the crowd in front. Lee, looking more and more like John Lennon
every day, with his long hair and granny glasses, was just as
animated, hopping around on one foot when he could get away from his
pedals, and playing a very solid bass as well. And his voice, once
the bane of many critic and fan, has come back down to earth. He is
singing in a register that seems to be much more comfortable for him,
and dropped the Daffy Duck on helium voice that was used in the
early days.
   Drummer Neil Peart was a rock, as usual, and he is one of the few
drummers whose solo is an anticipated highlight and not a reason to
go to the restroom.
   The band was spurred on by a younger crowd than it normally draws,
many there to see Bay Area openers Primus, but others out for a night
of great music, and they got it. Regardless of what you may think of
Rush, when the band is on like it was Wednesday night, there aren't
many groups in the world who can touch it.

I heard on MTV News today that Rush donated the proceeds from one of the
Oakland shows to the American Foundation for AIDS Research, thus becoming
only the second musical act (after Madonna) to do so.

Hello One And All!

I know that I am speaking to a well-established "Rush Crowd."  That is why
I must come foward with the following items.  It seems that I have been
selfish over the last five years.  Let me fill you in:

Five years ago, a friend of mine (whom worked for Polygram Records in
Indianapolis) had the opportunity to grab some old reels before they were
discarded from the PG vault.  What were these master-peices?  They were/are
commercials promoting RUSH albums and tours.  Most are stereo, but a few
are mono.  One even promotes a concert tour.  The dialog is something like
this...Hey Jim are you going to the RUSH show?  Gee Jane, I don't know.
The tickets are going pretty fast! (This was for Permanent Waves).

Each reel (1/4" @ 7 1/2 IPS) is about thirty seconds long.  I think the
original RUSH (album one) commercial is one minute.

I have these at the studio, so I will get back on tommorrow with the actual
reels that I have.

Later,
John Vester

Sounds Unlimited Recording Studio

BTW, in responce to the first RUSH show.  Mine was on the Signals tour and
every show at Indy since then.  A friend, saw RUSH on the RUSH tour with
John Rutsey and they opened for Sha-Na-Na!  Times really change!

                                                    ...that's a wrap!

<A NAME="429019">Subject: DEM T'S</A>

First of all I prefer the tabloid format for the design.
Possible headlines that I've come up with are:
  DRUMMER CURED OFCANCER BY CLIMBING MYSTIC MOUNTAIN
  WILD SNOWDOG WRECKS HAVOC ON TORONTO
  PSYCHO AXE-MURDERER SAYS "I DID IT FOR MONGO"
  RAID ON GANGSTER BOAT CYIELDS NO DICE
  CITY FIRE HYDRANTS ATTACKED BY RABID DALMATIAN

  I'd also prefer pre-washed cotton, xxl if possible (I'm
that I'm not the only 'big' Rush fan out there).

  I like the world tour idea but I feel that there may be
a problem  withh everyone requesting their dream location
and date (so many members, requests for the same dates,
etc.).  However, what about making up a tour slate with
locations from Rush albums themselves?  For example:
        Tai Shan Ampitheatre
        Manhattan
        Toronto International Airport-runway 3
        Bangkok
        Paris (on Bastille Day of course)

I'm sure that a full slate could be created in this manner.
The locations would have meaning to all members rather than
just those who are from Rough and Ready, Pennsylvania (yes
that is an actual town here in PA).

  Also, if possible, let's have the couple of subscribers who
are working on this little project get together and share ideas
and connections.
                                   keep us posted,

   Saw a blurb on Rush on MTV news a couple of days ago. Kurt Loder was 
"reporting", and said that Rush had dedicated their proceeds from one of the 
California
shows to AMFAR (American Foundation for Aids Research). According to Loder,
they are only the second major Rock Performer (After Madonna!?!?!) to make
a public contribution to the Aids fight. Rest assured, I think this proves
that the boyz are not only 1st class musicians and intelligent performers,
but genuinely good human beings as well. Warms the cockles of my heart...and
their gesture seems even to have won the grudging respect of the normally
dour Kurt Loder.

In the spirit of democracy, I'd just like to add my $0.02 about the T-shirts.
I think the tabloid idea is beautiful, and I really like Hans Greunig's
suggestions for headlines.  Also, if possible, it would be really sweet if we
could get all the subscribers on the back - but that would be an awful lot of
names to print.  Anyway, with or without the names on the back, I like the
idea.

Also, just a side note.  I think the Baltimore situation sucks rocks!  Any
word on rescheduling? (or perhaps a show at Merriweather?)

Someone posted an idea about listing a bunch of cities that Rush is not
going to play, but that we would like them to play on the back of the
shirt. How about having a list of names from Rush songs that are cities,
or sound like city names? For example:

Lakeside Park
Willow Dale
Megadon
Mandrake
Nome
Rome
Bangkok
Bogata
Acapulco
Morocco
Lebanon
Afghanistan
Katmandu
Nepal
Tia Shan
Middle Kingdom
Eden
La Villa Strangiato
Bacchus Plateau
Panacea (p.s. Theres a town in Florida called Panacea...cool)
Tobes of Hades (???)
Manhattan
Cygnus X-1
Zion
Babylon
Avalon
Lamneth
Olympus
Middletown

I'm sure there's more, but thats all I can think of for now. I think you
get the idea though. We could use the suggestion someone else made and
preface the list with something like NMS World Tour 1992 (or how about
2112???). What does everyone think about this idea?

On another note, just for fun, who can identify all the songs I got these
references from?

To Will Stocker's request:

WS>What was the first ever Rush concert all of you have attended...

Mine was the 2112 tour at the Santa Monica Civic in LA, I believe, the year
that 2112 was release. Since those tender years, at the age of 13, I have
seen EVERY tour with the exception of Moving Pictures - I was out of the
country.

In fact, I was not even aware that Moving Pictures had been released.  I was
stopped at a red light when another car pulled up next to me.  I heard
nothing more than the last 15 seconds of Red Barchetta - the part when Alex
is playing harmonics and Ged is moving around on the bass - and I knew
instantly who it was.

Great show last night here in Seattle. A few quick observations:

1.) Better sound. In my estimation, the sound quality was so much
better than for the Presto show. Each instrument was cleanly mixed.
I was happy to hear Alex's guitar work for a change :-)

2.) Boyz's attitudes! The guys seemed very happy and relaxed. Geddy
didn't say more than a half dozen words during the Presto show.
During last nights show he was very animated, smiling, laughing,
screaming those Yeah, Oh Yeahs!! Lots of joking between Ged and
Alex. Even Neil cracked a few smiles!! That day off before the show
agreed with the guys. Tons o' energy for those 38-39 year olds :-)
Gads, I'll be there soon :-) :-)

3.) Geddy's bass. Very little keyboard playing...lots of fancy
bass gyrations!!!!

4.) Neil has been lifting!!! He looked great in the tank top and
bandana. His drum work is as sharp as ever!!!

Highlites for me:

Where's My Thing
Limelight
Xanadu
Finding My Way and Anthem!!!
THE RHYTHM METHOD!!!

Lowlites:
Those giant Bunnies need to go!!!!
No tunes from CoS :-(  Maybe next time.......

	Hey there!  First off,to Mark I am certainly in for the shirt idea.
I think the star idea is cool, simply for the design.  I also like the idea
of the NMS member list on the back.
	I want to ask again that anyone who has any CoS boots PLEASE let me
know.  I also saw that ridiculous Sam Goody thing.  I was extremely pissed.
We all know that RUSH may not get the most press, but who cares.  We are all
dedicated fans and the fact that there are more RUSH fans from all walks of life
than manny bands could ever hope for is enough to calm me.  Sure we all get
offended and hostile at anti-Rush news, but hey, aren't these people just to
ignorant to really understand. 'Nough said.

I really like the T-shirt ideas!!!  It's too bad we couldn't list
everyone's names with a roadie job next to it, i.e. lighting assist.,
carpenter, personal shreve, or something.  The ideas I like a lot are
the tabloid ones -- fantastic!!!  There are so many possibilities.

I just thought of this -- if names on the back are too much, how
about, as someone mentioned,

			NMS World Tour 1992

and then have the list of cities in which everyone is from, and name
it in such a way that the route of cities could pass for a tour.

My 0.02.  If I think of anything else, I'll definitely mention it.

Keep up the good ideas...

I'm new to this forum, but am a long-time Rush fan.  Rush once again put on
an excellent show in Seattle last night.  I've seen several requests for
the set list, so here's what they played:

Force Ten
Limelight
Free Will
Distant Early Warning
Time Stand STill
Dreamline
Bravado
Roll the Bones
Show Don't Tell
The Big Money
Ghost of a Chance
Subdivisions
The Pass
Where's My Thing
(Drum Solo)
Closer to the Heart
Xanadu into Superconductor
Tom Sawyer

Encore--Montage of the following:
Spirit of Radio
2112:Temples of Syrinx
Finding My Way
La Villa Strangiato
Anthem
Red Barchetta
Spirit of Radio (wrap-up)

Like others have commented, they had a good time on stage.  Geddy was quite
interactive with the audience and was all over the place, and Alex had
quite a collection of keyboard and pedal equipment.  I guess my only
complaint is that they're using some of the same old videos I've seen on
the last two tours, but the light show was excellent.  As usual, this was a
show not to be missed.

I would love to get copies of tapes that are out there.  Please let me know
if there is some sort of tape tree or trading system going.  Unfortunately,
I have no Rush tapes to trade, but my husband has a huge collection of
Grateful Dead tapes if you are interested.
