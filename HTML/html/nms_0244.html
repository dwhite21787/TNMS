	Crippen and Young flew the first mission aboard the Shuttle Columbia,
and you hear their voices (or at least one of them) on Countdown, talking
through the landing.

Do you people really think "Need Some Love" and "In The Mood" are really love
songs? Maybe carnal lust songs. Do you also consider Poisson's "I Want Action"
to be a love song? Call me old-fashioned but these songs (to me) sound more
like a pack of animal-men on the search (nothing wrong with that, but...)

Two more quick questions...

1) Since I'm sure there's some Genesis fans out there, have any of you heard a
'clunker' on the boards in Duke's "Behind The Lines"?

2) In the ASOH video during "Big Money" the finale has a sort of pause like
the boys "taking a breath" so to speak. Is this just my video or is it there.
I think it sounds cool, sort of like being back in high school band...

That's It for now...
KEEP SHAKIN'!

Agreed here.  I always loved the song, but hated the pace of the ending.
It ends too abruptly!  I almost like the ending of the story the song
was based on better.

Hello out there...

Someone asked about Young and Crippen.  Young and Crippen were the
first Shuttle astronauts, and of course, as Fate would have it, I've
forgotten their names.  I think Crippen's first name is Robert and I'm
totally blanking out on Young's name (assuming I've even got Crippen's
name right!).  Anyway, if I'm not mistaken, Rush went to see them on
that historic first flight. (jealous, jealous)  And being totally awed
by the event, I guess they (or Neil) wanted to thank Young and Crippen
for, maybe, simply doing what they were doing and being a very
inspirational pair.  Anyway, hope that helps (and maybe someone else
can tell you more!).

Speaking of space and stuff (<-- Carl Sagan lexicon); this is just an
astronomical observation.  For any and all astronomy nuts out there,
has anyone ever gone stargazing with Rush music?  If you haven't -- DO
IT!  It is so much damn fun!  It's like being at a private Rush
concert!  Of course, your favourite Rush album is usually best.  But
maybe it's not too surprising that they go together -- Rush has a lot
of "space stuff" in their songs, right?!  Anyhoo, just thought I'd
pass that on to my fellow (if any) astronomers.

Off to my private Rush concert...

Being the NASA child that I am (both parents worked for NASA), I felt
kinda compelled to answer the Young & Crippen question posed by
Matthew Deter - they were the 1st 2 Shuttle astronauts & the
conversation between them & Mission Control during the liftoff and
flight is the main background for "Countdown." For you trivia buffs,
the flight was from April 12 - 14, 1981, and lasted exactly 2 days, 6
hrs & 21 minutes. They traveled approximately 933,757 nautical miles
(1,074,567 statute miles) in 36 orbits of the Earth. They flew the
Columbia and Young was the commander & Crippen was the pilot.

On to other things! Cool idea, Shane F. for the "You know you're a Rush
fan when..." list proposal!! My contribution:

You know you're a Rush fan when you teach every parrot you encounter
the intro to "Witch Hunt" (without the owners' permission, of
course!!).

Yeah, me.  From what I remember, rolling bones is a method of divining
the future used in many voodoo and Rastafarian religions.  Gee, do you
think The Boyz are Rastafarian.  Can you see Geddy in dreads a la
Lenny Kravitz?  Oh well, that's my $e/100.

	Oh.  That sound.  My educated guess is that it is the "t"
	being repeated, using some sort of reverb, most likely through
	a tape player.  Almost identical to the sounds we got from the

Greetings,

   All this talk about Rush Love songs got me thinking about something
one of my friends said about them once.  A couple of us were sitting
around listening to music and he said that it was his theory that guys
are searching for women who like RUSH.
   There does seem to be (for some reason) a disproportionately small
number of female RUSH fans.  We all thought that this was kind of funny and
I pointed out that all the women I've dated _have_ been RUSH fans.  I was
just interested to know if anyone out there might have an interesting
story about this.  Meet someone/fall in love at a RUSH concert?  In a
record store?  Etc...

Just wondering,

	I have to agree with the people out there that say that Queensryche
is an excellent band.  For those out there that haven't heard any of thier
songe (except, of course, Silent Lucidity), you should check them out.  In
comparing them to Rush, I would say that thier songs are just as thought
provoking.  Queensryche's music is more "in touch" with modern American
society.  Also, Geoff Tate probably has the best voice in music. (He was
trained in opera).

	Well, enough about my SECOND faviorite band.  Just thought you might
want to give them a listen.

Rolling bones is/was a method of predicting the future by Asian(big ?)
priests/shamans.  I don't quite remember the specifics.  I believe
the bones were human and that there was possibly writing etched into
the bones.  They were tossed on the ground and a spiritual person
could tell the future by the configuration of the rolled bones.

I put out a plea in TNMS 240 for someone to take over responsibility
for operation the mail based archive server (MBAS) that I operate at
ingr.com.  No one has responded, so I thought I would try once more.
My last day at Intergraph is May 29th.  At that time, the server will
disappear.  I will keep files available on my bbs, but no fetching
thru email.  If you would like to become the keeper, give me a call.
Work days (205) 730-8614.  I may implement a MBAS on my bbs as it is
linked into Usenet, but that will take some time and I'm not sure if
my feed would support it.  Pretty iffy talk I know, but that be that
way it is.  If you want items from the MBAS, get your orders in now.
They will be processed at midnight and noon each day.

Howdy to all! I've finally begun receiving TNMS. I hope I'm not jumping in so
far in the middle of a thread that I am completely out of line by saying it,
but I've always been quite partial to "Madrigal" as a love song. A hard day at

While lyrically this may be true, I have to say that I have always gotten the
feeling of desperation from the music. And maybe sitting in your living room
isn't the right place to get the feeling of fear and the adrenalin rush of
being chased by, say, the police or any other gun-weilding maniac...:-)
