Sorry, I am new to the list...

by anyone anywhere.

   [ First, there is no official Rush website. Second, yes the issues are

<A NAME="2030002">Subject: My own humble opinnions......</A>

Before I guve my opinnions, I would like to tell my story....

I was eight or nine when my brother brought home one of his first Rush 
albums. It was AFTK... He played it all of the time, I got the songs 
stuck in my head, just generally LOVED it. I would  take it and listen 
to it all the time... Then, I realized that my brother had more albums 
from this wonderful band RUSH.... I listened to all of the albums at 
least once, picking out my favorites, listening to those... I bought my 
first Rush album a few years ago (I was sort of dissapointed, T4E... It 
would be phenomenal for any other band, but it's sort of Sub-standard 
for rush in my opinnion) Then just this past Christmas I received 
Chronicles for Christmas (which I simply ADORE!) I am the youngest  
recorded Rush fan, I assure you of that... (at least on this mailing 
list) At the young age of 15, I really relate to thier music (believe it 
or not) Now, whenever you think, "What is this world coming to??" just 
remeber there are still children out there who think... and listen to 
Rush.

Favorite albums) Hard, but probably a toss up between RTB and AFTK... 

Favorite song) I have a mix tape of 20 songs and I could never pick a 
clear winner..... Probably somewhere along the lines of Madrigal, 
Xanadu, or Bravado, Fly By Night, Passage to Bangkok... (I'll stop while 
I still can)

Least favorite album) Perhaps the self titled one (lack of Neil= lack of 
intrest) or even T4E.... Caress of Steel wasn't too bad.

Least favorite song) I am the most radical Rush fan... I never did like 
the song Tom Sawyer.... *l*

A few quick things.....
I'm fairly new to the area (Rockville, MD)  and I was wondering if
anyone out there knew of any good Rush Cover/Tribute bands in the D.C.,
NOVA, Rockville, Baltimore area(s)  I would love to hear some live Rush
while waiting for the new project!

Also, I am a beginner (VERY BEGINNER) Bassist and was looking for some
people to start a cover band with at the end of the summer (obviously,
people from the same area...see above).  I just finished a music degree
(sax) and will now devote my entire music interest to the Bass Guitar.
Of course, a summer is hardly enough time to become especially
proficient on the instrument, but I already have an okay start and the
'music' aspect has already been established.  I obviously love Rush, but
have a ton of other influences that I won't go into here.  I just want
to have some fun playing some decent music as a hobby, I'm not looking
for rock stardom, just weekend excitement.  I work hard to learn parts.
If you are a Guitarist/Percussionist/Keyboardist/or Vocalist, over 21,
no drugs, and mature about 'learning' music, let's talk.  Again, I'm not
looking right away, I want to get some more Bass work in first (scales,
blues riffs...fundamentals)  Late summer or fall is the agenda.  E-mail
privately if you are interested, and please include a list of some
artist you may like to cover.

<A NAME="2030007">Subject: Gentle Giant/King Crimson</A>

Mike Mejido was asking about Gentle Giant & King Crimson CDs. A good place to
start for GG are Freehand & The Power & The Glory. Both of these CDs are from
mid career GG and feature their trademark vocal stylings and instrumental
work. Their music had a very medieval flavor to it then. Earlier CDs did not
always hold together as well (unless you can find the hard to get In A Glass
House) and the later ones became spotty with song quality. The live Playing
The Fool is also a good place to start and shows that, yes, they could play
those intricate arrangements live. 
For KC, Discipline is the most consistant of the 80s version. It has great
writing and moods. Lark's Tongues Aspic is great for the 70s band as it has
beautiful melodies and weird stuff. Of course, In The Court of The Crimson
King, the 1st release from 69 is great too, but very different from any
subsequent versions of the band. If you have the cash, the 4-CD box set Frame
By Frame is a good place to taste all the 60s-80s versions of the band and get
a great book written by Fripp that gives a glimpse into the inner workings of
the band itself. As for the new 90s version, Thrack gives a good idea of what
this version is all about. I hope this helps.  Michael Bettine

<A NAME="2030008">Subject: Camera Eye intro/Superman - The Movie</A>

i tested this & i know it to be true.  the very beginning to Camera Eye
(street sounds, "fresh fruit", the typewriters) is from Superman  -The
Movie.  i am a Superman freak (same goes for RUSH) & i have that first
movie practically memorized...every word, every sequence, every sound. 
part of  Superman I was filmed in Canada (actually the Smallville scenes,
not this particular one)...don't know if that has any relevance.....well,
let me just explain the test, and whoever doubts me can do the same.

CRANK UP the beginning of Camera Eye (not a bad idea, eh) but b4 that synth
hits you might want to turn it down just a tad.  you hear street sounds, a
street vendor saying "Fresh Fruit!', and then a myriad of typewriters.  t h
e n, go to the scene in Superman I where Clark Kent is dropped off in front
of the Daily Planet (right after the Fortress/Jor-El sequence).  the cabby
says, "Here you go, mack, the Daily Planet."  immediately after that - the
street sounds, a street vendor saying "Fresh Fruit!", and - here's the
twist - Jimmy Olson looking through a "camera eye" focusing on different
people while a myriad of typewriters are punching away in the background.  

SEE for yourself.  happy discovery fellow RUSH fans,

Hey gang..
I'm know I'm gonna get flamed for this one, but I just had ta comment..
Regarding this "Neil smokes Winston lights" thing.. First off, who cares..
Second, I'd rather he not smoke anything. Anyone who stretches his body's
limits like he does, (biking all over the freakin' world, drumming like a
maniac) should take better care of himself. Think what he could do without
black lungs.. Granted, he has a right to do what he wants, and I'd fight to
protect that, but I almost lost my mom to lung cancer last year, and I've
been on an anti-smoking kick since then..

It's his Jazz ... he used it live too.  The rest is the Mini-Moog
through the Yamaha 1010 delay (and Alex & Neil, of course).
The Steinberger didn't make its appearance til the end of the
Signals tour.  OK!

Here in Mew Mexico, the ONLY radio station to play Rush in the
Albuequerque area is 94.1 "94-rock". So I listen.  They play off the
beaten path stuff too, at 5pm during the traffic rush hour they often play
a rush set!

Late the other night they played working man.  Excellent!  I was driving
on the highway & loved it!  It palyed through the screaming guitar, bass,
drum jam,
and right before it broke back into the trademark chord progression
towards the end, the song skipped back to the beginning of the jam, and
played through the whole thing again! :)  And skipped at the same spot,
back to the beginning of the jam!  :)  I was in heaven, wondering how long
it would take them to figure it out, hoping it would be a while.

It was.  I lost count after 10 jams!  Apparantly a power problem, not a CD
problem, but who cares!  It made MY night!  About 40 minutes of a rush
jam!

Just wanted to share with those who could appreciate it! :)

<A NAME="2030015">Subject: A Postcard from Neil to me</A>

Good-Day fellow Rush Fans. 

What I have here for your viewing pleasure (should you be interested)
are scans of a Postcard written by Neil and addressed to me regarding
a letter I had mailed him. I was only 13 years old at the time. 

One day I'm flipping through my father's address book of Worldwide
Members of the Ferrari Club and there staring me in the face is Neil's
address. Home address!!! None of that record label in-care-of crap. I
figure he must've purchased a Ferrari and joined the club. After
obtaining my father's permission to write Mr. Peart, I do so and ask
him if he is in fact the "Neil Peart from Rush" and I get this
postcard as a response. You have to remember, being a drummer then (13
yrs old) & now, Neil was my all-time idol and still is. I even modeled
my kit to match his (who didnt) minus the percussion. I was on Cloud 9
for months and carried this postcard around with me everywhere I went.

Now, you may be saying to yourself, how do I know Mr. Peart handwrote
this postcard himself. I dont, but I'm gonna believe he did and here's
why. We all know Neil answered mail personally until he got flooded
with it via the 'Net, and having something to do with MD Magazine,
then he stopped. This was in 1996. I'm going way back to 1981 AND
(dont forget)  I sent a letter directly to his home, not MD magazine
or his record label.

Further proof for me to believe this is legit is that the postcard is
postmarked July 6th 1981 and sent from Milwaukee, WI which is the
vicinity where Rush was on tour. Maybe he had some spare time &
answered some letters???

Anyways, that's my story & i'm sticking to it. 
I hope y'all enjoyed it. 

Go here for the postcard: http://members.xoom.com/pimpdad/pieman.htm

   [ Ah, I was *just* talking about adding in a postcard section on the NMS
     web page! "Five Minutes Of Fame" or something like that, if you don't 
     mind your postcard will be the first added to this new section! :-)

In my ultra-fanatic Rickenbacker years, I'd have said
his Rick, but I bet it was really his Fender Jazz with
a pretty rich mix of effects:  compression (almost 
distortion), phasing, and/or possibly flanging.  It
sounds quite similar to his playing in YYZ.

He "played" the J-bass in the video.

Probably yes, but Geddy diddn't play one until GUP.

Re-issuing issue # 1 is really dumb.  First of all, you can get it very easily
by sending a blank e-mail  Second of all it should be more special than that.
Rush should play some role in this.  Someone here must know someone who could
get in touch with them or their people.  I find it hard to believe they
wouldn't either submit to a short interview or compose a message for us or
something.  It is an off period for them, and this digest represents several

<A NAME="2030019">Subject: I/We garbage</A>

Hi everybody.

All this debate over the I/we lyrics in Cygnus/Hemispheres is kinda
interesting.  Leave it to us to take a simple ordinary thing and blow
it up way out of proportion.  Reading the liner notes to Chronicles,
it seems to me that this is one of the reasons why Rush stopped doing
the epic songs.  Something about 20 people saying 20 different things
about the same song.  Personally, I think our "explanations" tell us
more about ourselves than they do about the songs themselves.

But for what it's worth (or not), here's mine:

The narrator is the owner/pilot of the Rocinante, but not the only one
riding it.  Perhaps the narrator had a flight crew.  What happened to
the crew?  Maybe they perished along the ride.  Maybe they ended up in
some alternate universe.  Maybe they were sitting alongside the nar-
rator while he/she was telling his/her story.  Maybe Neil just threw
that in there to mess everybody up. :)

But the fact remains ... Hemispheres is probably my all-time Rush fav-
orite.  Cygnus X-1 is probably my all-time Rush least favorite.

called Tiles.  Guitarist Chris Herin used to send messages to this
digest awhile ago, but I´m still in contact with the band.  Terry Brown
mixed their newst CD ("Fence The Clear", 1997).

Next is a small paragraph I copied from their official newsletter:
"<Fence The Clear> was recorded at Stages Recording in Novi, Michigan
and produced by Chris Andrews and Kevin Chown.  The CD was mixed by
noted producer/engineer Terry Brown at Town Music Studios in Toronto
with technical support provided by Dave Townson.  Terry is recognized
for his work on the first eleven (11) Rush albums and has releases by
Fates Warning, Blue Rodeo, IQ, Cutting Crew, Max Webster, Voivod, Moist,
and Larry Gowan to his credit.  Most recently, you can find Terry's
production and engineering on the excellent new Fates Warning CD <A
Pleasant Shade Of Gray>".

Hello everyone!!!
Last year, I posted a letter asking female Rush fans to write to me, and
hopefully be rush buds. I received quality response (Many Thanks Tina,,
erica and jen!!!.), and actualy, became close to a few. I noticed there are
more women rush fan on the NMS than last year, and those who'd be
interested in correspondiong with a great male rush fan, may do so. I've
been a Rush fan for...god, 16 years, been to every tour since GUP, have
collected lots of Rush stuff and memorabilia, and am looking forward
(somewhat) to Rush's upcoming live cd. If you wished to share their Rush
experiences with me, or wants to meet an interesting Rush guy, feel free to
e-mal me any time. I'm open to almost anyone and any conversations that you
might have.

Thanks,

Hi folks!

Just writing you guys to inform you Dream Theater was in Philly last Saturday
and put on one whale of a show.  Lots of tasty-technical-power music.  Portnoy
(drummer) needs a valium.  I did notice many fans wearing RUSH tour shirts of
the various tours of past years.  Another thing I noticed is the huge
proportion of guys to gals......another trademark of a Rush-type band.  I
wonder why that is.  

Anyway....
The other thing I wanted to mention is that I went out and bought this Cathy
Wheel album called Chrome and listened to it.  The first couple of songs are
alright I suppose, but I came away disappointed.  Then I went out again and
purchased that album with Spirit of Radio.  Sadly it was the only song I
enjoyed.  Flame me CW fans if you will, but I didn't like them.  King's X is
way, way better, at least for my money.

 -KG

In the 12-CD changer:
1.  Deep Purple - Purpendicular
2.  King's X - Dogman
3.  Rush - T4E
4.  Dream Theater - Falling Into Infinity
5.  Dream Theater - Awake

<A NAME="2030030">Subject: A Rush Movie . . . Uh . . . Yea</A>

Not wanting to be the skeptic regarding the Rush movie - it has made for 
some entertaining posts - I nevertheless remain, well, skeptical.  But 
then, not wanting to be the one to piss in anyone's Cheerios (please don't 
ask where I got that phrase from) I suddenly staggered onto an enlightening 
thought.

Back in 1980 or so, there was a Beatles movie called "I Wanna' Hold Your 
Hand."  It was about a bunch of screaming Beatles freaks who were looking 
for a way to get into the taping of "The Ed Sullivan Show" to watch the Fab 
4 play.  My wife loves the movie.  I think it's stupid.  We argue about it 
often.  We really should go outside more often.

Anyhow, I was thinking, rather than wait for a movie about Rush - which 
would premier about the same time Hell was chosen to host the Winter 
Olympics - why not propose a movie about the Rush fans who go on these 
absolute "pilgrimages" to see the Boys and/or Toronto?  Judging from some 
of the posts I've read, and some of the experiences people have had, that 
could be an interesting movie!  Think "Wayne's World" meets "Fear and 
Loathing in Las Vegas."

C'mon, stay with me:  An eclectic conglomerate of Rush fans, crammed into 
an orange van, driving from say, San Diego to Toronto, to see the last Rush 
concert ever performed at Maple Leaf Gardens.  Along the way they have all 
sorts of wacky adventures.  The band has a cameo at the end.  Then they 
drive off a cliff at the end, a la Thelma and Louise.  Mmmm.  Scratch the 
last part.

OK, OK, so shoot me. The whole thing sounded good in my head.  Then again, 
so do all those voices.

(Whatta' ya think Dan-O?  Want to co-author a movie??)

I'm happy to say that, after much support and therapy, I've recovered from 
my Available Light obsession . . . for now.  But now I can't stop looping 
the segment from 3:12 to 3:52 in "Middletown Dreams". MY GOD, DON'T YOU 
LOVE IT.????!!!! GO LISTEN TO IT RIGHT NOW!!!  Listen to Alex's 'chirping' 
guitar!  YESSS!!! Man, where are my candles??  Yikes, my Rush nerd-ship is 
growing like a pasture of ivy.

Oh well.  Cheerios.

I personally thought this was one of the most fun songs Rush has ever
recorded.  Just listening to it, it _sounds_ like they had fun recording
it.  I think it is very instrumentally diverse, and pleasant sounding.

It is a very groovy song =)  I'd have chucked Countdown though.

He's right and true.  This makes me think of the times I compared
formats of songs.  Most rock music by 1980 was ground out in a
single format--AABA:  A:lyrics, chorus (repeat A) B:guitar solo,
and back to A.  This boring format was beaten into the ground by
artists.  The first time I heard Rush songs like 'Jacob's Ladder',
'Xanadu', and 'Vital Signs', I realized that these guys did care a lot
about their music, and recognized ('One likes to believe in the free-
dom of music, but glittering prizes and endless compromises shat-
ter the illusion of integrity') that they could alter the course of
rock music and heavy metal by injecting intelligence into their
work.

As near as I can tell "Gaia" is another name for Earth, or more specifically,
the energy that fills the Earth.  Like a supernatural Mother Nature kind of

I think Rush should produce a video of all their videos.
Not exactly ASOH, but--I've never seen a video for 'Red
Barchetta'.  I saw 'Mystic Rhythms' and 'The Big Money'
on MTV--every single song lends itself to visual appeal.
Imagine 'Rivendell' on a 'Lord of the Rings' movie.  With
production values like we have now that alone could
shine.

 -Notice: My longest post yet!--

I notice in the posts from Ted Gudermuth <tguder@galstar.com>
and Brian T. Peterson <brianp@mcn.net> a thread--musical taste.
Today people have done things with movies that musicians were
doing in the 70s with moogs, amps, pedals, synths, etc.  Rush
makes great music.  I live in a middle-sized town (actually, right
down the middle--at 50,000 sans college students) where kids'
parents and fast-food mgrs have enabled them to purchase some
of the best sound equipment ever made for autos, including car
trunk CD shufflers with 200w amps that rock.  Yet these young
[ruffians-heh] shell out tons of dough for a sound that has no-
thing going for it other than a steady THROM-THROM-TH-TH-
THROM of rap.  Forget Roll-the-Bones or any intelligent music.
Here we have a new noise ordinance just for the purpose of
paying the commission-based salaries of police who don't even
enforce this law, which should be called the 'lack-of-musical-
taste law'.  When this law was introduced [by the priests] they
used some expensive complicated equipment to measure sound
waves coming from autos.  We learned later that this was just a
careful 'ratings' ploy to get attention.  You never see anyone
pulled over for breaking this one.  More later, gotta drive...

The only Rush concert I was privileged to see was
Power Windows in '86, where the band performed
almost every PW song.  My favorite moment was
when, at the end of the show, when the huge baf-

with the deep-base synth-attack from 'Tom Sawyer'.
The crowd came to life and roared.  I liked that...

I haven't seen this covered for quite some time, so forgive me for dragging

listening to a particular Rush song, and all of a sudden you get chills?
One of mine is, the part in "Anagram (for Mongo)" off of 'Presto', towards
the end of the song, the part where Ged sings the last, "the saint turns to
sin", and Neil does that REALLY fast drum fill.  Maaaaan, I get chills down
my spine *every* time I hear that drum fill!
