Hiyas all

	I've got a quick idea for something to add to the NMS CD.  How
about putting some live material from CoS?  I, and several of my friends,
have been looking and sending Email EVERYWHERE with 0 responses...we'd
love to hear ANYthing from the Down the Tubes Tour, and I'm sure there's
lots of you reading this that would too.  I can only imagine how The
Necromancer & Lamneth would sound live...

	Well, just a little somethin to think about.

	Later!

<A NAME="603004">Subject: whipping up the bootleg mania ...</A>

My few hundred pesos' worth of input on the subject of the Great
NMS CD Boot Project:

1. Best idea: "Gangster of Boots" as the title. This is
*perfect*! Just obscure enough to confuse the masses, but
something that all us die-hard phreaks will understand
perfectly. And the band would love it (see below).

2. Worst idea: Crediting contributors by name on the CD or the
insert. Gee, folks - while we're at it, why don't we make it
REALLY convenient for the G-men and record companies, and provide
all our addresses and phone numbers as well?? :) Seriously - dump
this one. Best go with handles and aliases, if anything - and the
more obscure, the better.

3. And now for something completely different: If we really love
the band as much as we all say we do, we should consider sending
them (anonymously, of course) any income from this project that
exceeds the costs. It might not amount to much, but at least our
integrity would remain intact, and it would prove we're not in it
for profit. (And we could throw in a free copy of the CD - they'd
have to be highly amused by the GOB title.)

4. Another idea altogether: Any enthusiasm out there for
compiling a collection of *video* Rush rarities? I'm thinking of
such things as:

  ** Production videos that haven't been released, only shown on
     EmpTV (the FAQ lists several of these, from "Anthem" to
     "Roll the Bones").
  ** Unreleased concert footage (just a handful of truly
     *quality* pieces, preferably of truly interesting/rare
     performances).
  ** Any decent interviews from over the years.
  ** The best from _Exit Stage Left_, which is no longer in
     print.
  ** Miscellaneous Rush-related material. (For example, I'm
     pretty sure I have a copy of the original SCTV "National
     Midnight Star" sketch. And it would be easy to get things
     like the "Telegram for Mongo" scene from "Blazing Saddles.")

If there's any indication that:  a) there's a lot of interest in
this, AND  b) there's enough material and willing contributors to
make a decent compilation, I'd consider tackling the task of
putting it together. (I have hi-fi stereo dubbing capabilities,
but would gladly yield to anyone with more sophisticated editing
equipment than a couple of VCRs.) I would probably be willing to
provide copies of the final product to anyone willing to cough up
a blank videotape and a couple of bucks for the postage.

Thoughts? Further suggestions? Looking forward to hearing them ...

True.  They were forced to come up with a tenth song for the album.

Here's a few things that would be worthy of the NMS CD:
1. Geddy doing  "Get Ready" from 'Standing In the Shadows of Motown',
the tribute to James Jamerson.  It's Geddy playing the bass line along
w/accompaniment.

2. The two tracks Neil plays on on Jeff Berlin's CD "Champion"
("Marabi" and "Champion")

Just my $.02
Also, I'd like to see all of "Hemispheres" live and "Natural Science"
live.

I was just skimming TNMS, so I don't know who asked this (although, I think you
were from Winnipeg)..
  A good way to get Rush to come to your town is (yes!) ...A PETITION!!
Shortly after Rush wandered through Oklahoma here, they played a date in Lubbock
Texas, not exactly a huge city.  I didn't actually go, but my roommate's cousin
(how's that for a distant relative?) did, and he said he actually signed the
petition.  I don't know how they started it, or who they sent it to when they 
had the signatures (I would guess either Anthem Entertainment, or SRO 
Management), but it worked.  And the place sold out in under an hour, I was 
told, although it probably wasn't a huge venue.
  Good luck!!

Thanks. How could I have missed them? Well, I don't watch much late

1988?

   I seriously doubt highly skilled musicians and recording engineers
would adjust the tape speed to "fix" the tempo. My theories:

-Some lunk-head bumped the switch that enabled the speed control.

-They tuned everything higher to mess with our minds.

-They mastered it at a higher speed so crazed fans on mailing lists would talk
 endlessly about it, forming theories and thinking they have an inside
 brotherhood with the three they affectionately call The Boyz.

Muff :)

Hi, Guys (&Gals):
	First time I've got something to say, so here 'tis:
	I like the idea of the 'drawer' as a cover for the CD.  For
that, I'd buy it (which means that if anything ever comes of this
venture, put me on the list to notify).
	Symbols:
	All The World's a Stage: Shakespear manuscript
	Exit...Stage Left: Snagglepuss (or whoever it was) doll
	A Show of Hands: some thing to represent voting

	Anybody know what Rushs opinion on boots is?

	BRAVO!!!
	And I do like the humor of 'The Gangster of Boots' -

<A NAME="603011">Subject: NMS bootleg CD</A>

Hi Rush fans!

  Well, it looks like the boys are going back into writing and
recording mode again!  It looks like the NMS bootleg CD is
happening afterall, but I feel compelled to share a few thoughts
on the subject!  Basically, I don't think an "unofficial",
(illegal), CD is such a good idea, for several reasons.  I would
feel a lot better if it was done as a true fan record, with the
approval of Rush.  Many other bands have done this for their
fans.  But if it happens, well, it happens!

  To set the tone for the rest of this post, I want to say that
if somebody wants to make a bootleg CD, fine!  I can't stop them
and I'm not going out of my way to try.  I'm not putting myself
on any pillar of righteousness, I just want to put a little
advice on the table.  I don't want to start another long, boring
thread, or a flame war, or take any heat from anybody.  This
isn't the biggest issue in the universe, but I think it's worth
mentioning.

  Basically, I'm a little concerned about all the recent talk
about the making of illegal bootleg CDs.  This kind of thing is
much more serious than discreetly trading a few live tapes with a
friend.  I think that we really have to draw the line at this
point.  It would be a really bad idea to start distributing
illegal CDs over the Internet.  It runs the risk of getting the
entire Rush mailing list shut down.

  I have made contributions for Rush fans on the Internet now for
over 9 years.  I worked very hard on this, and I even contributed
my own tourdate listing and discography to the NMS listings.
Besides the risk to the NMS, the main reason for my concern about
the recent NMS bootleg CD project is that I think this type of
thing erodes Rush's respect for all organized fanclubs,
newsletters, and fans, in general.  I have heard from contacts
close to the band that they get very upset by the production and
sale of Bootleg CDs, (more than most bands do).  Rush perceives
this not as a tribute to them, or as a respectful gesture, but
more like obscene gesture.

  I don't think this CD business reflects the true spirit of the
Rush mailing list, and of truly loyal fans.  If fans really care
about Geddy, Neil, and Alex, as well as each other, then they
must understand their responsibility to them.  Someone mentioned
that it didn't seem like a good idea to mention any names in the
liner notes of the CD insert, so Rush can't connect it to the
NMS.  If this is the case, then isn't this proof that making a
bootleg CD is somehow a wrong thing to do?  That it could
possibly hurt the band in some way?

  I know I may sound unenthusiastic, but it's time somebody said
all this boring stuff, for the record, (no pun intended!).  Even
though listening to a bootleg CD may be enjoyable, buying,
selling and making a bootleg CD really IS wrong!  (And it's not
so enjoyable if you paid $45 for a terrible sounding recording!).
 Aside from being illegal, it's disrespectful to the band, (most
of you musicians should agree with me here).  What's worse is
that much of the material proposed for the NMS CD comes from
copyrighted sources, like promo records and material from other
 artists, (ie Platinum Blonde, Max Webster, Larry Gowan, etc).
This is NOT bootlegging.  It's called PIRACY, and it's serious
stuff!  You can already buy all these promos and LPs at stores
and through Goldmine magazine anyway, and best of all, it's
really fun to collect them!

  The live material proposed for the CD seems to contain a lot of
rough, unfinished material that Rush would feel embarassed to
have the public hear again.  Is Rush likely to perform many more
live demos if they think they might end up as a bootleg CD at a
fleamarket?  Putting this stuff out on CD doesn't seem like a
very nice thing to do to such a great group of guys like Rush.

  I could get into a lot of boring legal talk about the fines and
prison sentences imposed by the 1981 Piracy and Counterfeiting
 Act, or about the rules of the Internet, but it's not worth
wasting everybody's time.  I could mention a whole bunch of scary
details like the court trial in Quebec, where Rush successfully
prosecuted the guy who made the "Rush Around the World" boot, and
a few similar stories from over the years.  That stuff would
probably clog the mailing list with another pointless flame war,
and besides, it's off the topic.

  Anyway, to wrap things up....I'm not mad, I'm just concerned.
I feel that this recent bootleg CD stuff should be kept off the
Internet and that mention of any sort of live boots should be
done as discreetly as possible, (see my last posting).  The NMS
managers and contributors have worked very hard over the years to
create a totally kick-ass mailing list that Geddy, Neil and Alex
ought to be proud of.  But I feel that the planning of illegal
CDs really casts a dark shadow over everybody's efforts, (plus,
it creates a lot of incriminating evidence!).  If any of you guys
feel the way I feel, don't be bashful about voicing your
opinions, (somebody back me up here!)  If you don't agree, that's
OK too, but please, no flames, (hold your fire)!

Rock 'n roll!

- Chris

After reading the last NMS and knowing the album liners pretty well, A
good name for the CD (while keeping the collage idea very well intact)
would be "The Omega Conern."  It's "weird" like ush but cool like Rush.
Give it some thought, eh?

Whoever is in charge of the NMS CD....I have a record (yes, a record!)
called "Through Any WIndow" which is a bootleg from the Power Windows
tour.  It is of pretty good quality, especially if you have a good
stereo system. ANyway, one song on it, "Middletown Dreams" is just
excellent, and would make a good addition to the CD (IMHO)
Anyway, this might be something to check out. I know there are copies
of this boot around, but if another copy can't be found, I can donate
my copy.

Hey Rushians, hope you're enjoying the new year...

        I don't know if this has been discussed before, but I noticed something
cool in FBN and COS. There are two guitar riffs from these albums that sound
almost exactly like two that are found in Led Zeppelin II and III.  The opening\
(oops) guitar riff from Beneath, Between, and Behind on Rush's second album
sounds just like guitar in the middle of  Bring it on Home from Zeppelin's
second album. Also, the accoustic guitar from the very beginning of The
Fountain of Lamneth from Rush's third album sounds exactly like the accoustic\
guitar at the end of Thats the Was from Zeppelin's third album. Any one else
notice this?

        Also, the very beginning of a Van Halen song called "You're No Good"
the guitar part sounds identical to the guitar in the middle of the epilogue
of By-Tor and the Snowdog (right before the long drum roll).

        Any comments?

	Well, it's looking to me as if this "Rush in Seattle" sighting may
only be a rumour......
	Last week when it was looking more and more like they were really
here, I began a "find the boyz" crusade.  I called every major hotel in
the area, and asked for Lee, Lifeson, Weinrib, etc, etc, to no avail.  We
called "Bad Animals" where they're supposedly recording, and the person
there was SURE that Rush was not recording there.  He said that he
had been getting all sorts of calls like this, asking if Rush was
recording there, and he was not sure where people got this rumour
from!!  He also said there was a similar rash of calls about three
months ago asking the same question (about the time of the earlier
sighting?  End of November?)  A call to the radio
station, KXRX, that made the original sighting, revealed that it's not Bad
Animals where they're recording, but a "secret location".  I called the
competing rock station in town, KISW, and they had no idea that Rush was
even in town.  I'm curious as to why this one station is the only place
that knows of Rush being in town.  We called information, to see if there
was any phone line registered to any of them (in case they had rented a
house) and there was also no listing.
	I guess the last thing I'm going to do is call the DJ who actually
supposedly SAW Geddy, and pick HIS brain.  I'll post info as it comes to me.

	ONE MORE THING.  For anyone who has heard the 1982 Nassau
Coliseum, NY bootleg, I was wondering if you could help me figure out what
is going on during "Temples of Syrinx".  It seems as if Alex is saying
some "new" lyrics which are absolutely cracking Geddy up.  Can anyone help?

<A NAME="603018">Subject: NMS cd Names and Cover Suggestions</A>

I haven't been keeping up with NMS too much lately, but I have become quite
interested in the cd idea.  Here are a few suggestions.  I have thought of
a few names, mainly coming from lyrics, etc.  Here they are in order of best
to worst:
        1. Glittering Prizes
        2. Sailing Into Destiny
        3. Performers & Portrayers
        4. Willows In The Breeze
        5. Wide Angle Watchers
        6. Modern Day Warriors
        7. Finding Their (or Our) Way
        8. Best They Can

OK, a few years ago I got really bored and came up with a Rush logo that was
supposed to find its way onto t-shirts for my friends and me, but it never
materialized.  That logo is hanging on the wall here in the dorm, and it
struck me as being a good possibility for the cover.  By the way, the knick-
knack drawer idea is cool, but maybe a little difficult to pull off.
Actually, both could be used, with my idea directly on the cd, perhaps.
Anyway, I'm putting it on the server as nmscover.gif in the incoming dir, so
take a look, everyone.  I used "Glittering Prizes" as the title, but
that can be changed, as well as the colors of the logo.  Well, that's my
proverbial two cents worth, I hope you like the logo.  E-mail me for
suggestions if necessary.

It's been a long time coming!  You know that feeling when your staring down
at the inside cover of an LP or CD and reading the lyrics and credits to your
current favorite RUSH album and fantasizing about stuff, well it does my soul
good to know that many others stand forthright as RUSH fans.  I just wish I
had been Online before with ya'll!  Well....hello and hope your having all
good years to date!  I'm not too much into details just deep, thick loud Rush

know if there is anybody from SF Bay Area interested in local Rush fan
consortium...concert going group.  Drop me a line.
Thanks rush-mgr for your hard work!

Hey, fellow Rushians.  I was walking around town (Ann Arbor) the other day
and I saw a Rush shirt which I immediately bought.  It's black with a gold
"star and man" logo on the front with "Rush: Special Edition, October 1, 1992"
on the sleeve.  Just wondering if anyone knows just what's so special about
this special edition.
Also, anyone have a list of the posters that Rush has put out? I
have seen RTB, p/g and PeW, but I'm sure that there's gotta be more.
Oh, yeah - since I haven't posted in a while, I'll do the top 5 band thing...
1) Rush
2) The Black Crowes
3) Billy Joel
4) Genesis
5) Nine Inch Nails

Hullo. I also liked that idea of a lot of rush-related stuff in a drawer
(sorry I can't give correct credit) as cover art.
I thought of one minor detail that shouldn't be overlooked, though.
We can have a lot of fun with the digits in the (fake) UPC bars on the
back! I generated a JPEG image that I'll put in the syrinx incoming
directory that uses the digits 1001001 and 2112 ... any other good
choices???
If any of y'all have Pozkanzer's Portable Bit Map toolkit, there's a
thing called pbmupc that whips UPC's out.

         Hello TNMS'ers

         I have been reading TNMS for 5'ish months... got all the most
         asked questions lists etc.

         Ged inspired me to play challenging Rock Bass lines. Nice
         hefty power with alot of melody thrown in.

         Has a play list been drafted for the TNMS CD and if so, can
         someone post a listing? 

         Some of our views are spacious, and some are merely Space..

Wow!  3 Posts in a row. . .

	Just when I thought I had seen the perfect title for the CD. . .Stoned
To The Begeezus Belt. . .We have Gangster Of Boots!  Good call, Matt!  This
is possibly the best suggestion I have ever seen on this net!
	About that Time Stand Still video- I disagree with he who said to skip
it.  You must see the humor which abounds in it!  Looks like something Wayne
& Garth would cook up on public access TV.
	Help for Mr. Winnipeg(OK, enjoy the streak while it lasts!  Can you
say 26 straight winning seasons in Beantown?).  About a year ago, I received
many complaints from James, of FTP.NEVADA.EDU guitar archive fame that while
Nevada is full of Guitar Tabs, it is sorely lacking in Rush Performances.  I
turned for help to my friend who has all the radio station numbers programmed
in his memory phone and won 3rd row seats to the New Haven show, right in
front of Alex.  Between songs, and to the roadies as they were cleaning up
afterwards, we would scream at the top of our lungs "PLAY LAS VEGAS!"

			IT WORKED!

They played Vegas, and James lived happily ever after.  If you promise to root

if I ever get that close again.

I'm probably not the only one who heard this, but in a radio interview about
a year ago (I think it was on Rockline), someone asked that same question. 
Geddy responded that although Neil may have privately published a few of his 
memoirs for some of his friends, there is no collection of poetry or other 
writings by Neil available to the public.  However, I read in alt.music.rush
a few months ago that there *is* a book by Neil which has been published, and
the guy who posted the message also gave the title and publisher (I think it
was University of Toronto Press).  I don't have the info with me right now, but
if anyone is interested I know I have it somewhere.  The book was basically
a collection of memoirs from a bicycle trip he took through the Rockies.  The
guy also claimed to have read the book (so he didn't just hear about it).
