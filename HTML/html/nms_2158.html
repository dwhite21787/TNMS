This was a total surprise Rush moment. It happened last Wednesday, around 
6 p.m. or so...

I was driving home from a particularly rough day at work and happened to 
switch channels to 93.1 Arrow, here in Southern California. It is an 
oldies-type station, rock and roll 60-70s stuff.

I was completely surprise to here New World Man...I don't think I have 
ever heard that song on the radio...others may have, but not me.

I sat there enjoying the moment and then triply enjoyed the DJs talking 
about how great Rush *is*, how wonderful they are as muscians, and Neil 
as a writer. It was great (one of the DJs was Joe Benson...late of KLOS 
and probably KMET???). I should have not been surprised but I was to have 
such a great moment and so out of the blue!

There is hope yet... :-)

I've been making it a habit to burn a copy of every cd I buy because mine
always get scratched/broken/overplayed/stolen. I just file the originals in
my closet and burn more as the copies wear out. It's a nice benefit to
having a burner, and it keeps the covers/inserts/etc in mint condition.

December 14, 1998

To all Rush fans,

Okay.  I must make an observation.  I went to see Rush in Atlanta during
the "Roll the Bones" tour, and I must state that it appears that true
die hard Rush fans are older, married, have college educations, and are
conservative.   Yes, I've spoken with many true Rush fans, and they all
seem to be "thinking" people. 

It pleases me to know that this fact.  I think I'm the greatest Rush fan
on the face of the Earth--I'm sure some of you would kindly
disagree--however, at least let me think that I am!	:-)

In conclusion, I just wanted to point out that Rush is the "Thinking
Man's Band."  I know plently of Republicans who concur with me.  And we
all know that Republicans are really the only one's in the Congress that
have any real sense.  You know, "I think; therefore, I am Republican."

Have a nice day.

Matt Maholchic said the the first Rush epic was 'Xanadu'".  

I'm gonna have to disagree with your policework  there, Margie (bad Pulp
Fiction reference).  I would say that weighing in at over 8.5 minutes, "By-tor
and the Snowdog", from FBN, would be the first epic song.  Unless that doesn't
break the epic barrier (as far as length is compared).

This may have been answered by now, but...I remember from a recent interview
on TNMS that the Odeon show was originally  recorded for a radio broadcast but
Ged didn't like his vocal performance at the time.  I assume that they had the
full array of recording equipment for that show that wan't typically present
for every show.

Yea, really. He must be listening to DS on a $39.95 Ghetto Blaster from
an undisclosed discount store!

Like I posted before.  Just listen to Test for Echo.  At least on my system,
Neil's double bass about blows you out of the chair!  I think this is one of
the best recorded LIVE CD's I've owned.  Compared to ASOH, much better.
Compared to ESL -- FAR BETTER.  * I think that recording sucked!*
ATWAS is better.

I think the sound quality of DS is great.  I would find it hard to do better
than they did.

*BTW*  I'm a broadcast engineer (TV) and listen to HIGH end gear all day.
This CD
thru all of our rooms that CD's can be listened to ( 7 ) is awesome.

But ANOTHER note here.. Something I've noticed..
Closer to the Heart..

In Alex's lead section there is a "white noise" type thing.. Only present
through the lead section and
then it fades away..  Almost like "tape" noise..

Anyone ELSE noticed this?

I'm not saying anything is taped. ( I'm sure its not!! )
But it's just ODD to me.. This NOISE...

Pretty harsh words Rob.  I must have really caught you on a bad day.  The
fact is, I knew it was a joke, everyone knew it was a joke.  You told us it
was, remember dildo?

Rob, why don't you read MY post.  I never said Rush didn't belong in the
ROR HOF.  I said we shouldn't want them in there because, given the mass of
undeserving rif raf that is in it, Rush is too good for it.  If you want to
twist my words to fit your intention, then run for political office as a
liberal.

And in keeping with your liberal-like illogic, you seem to veil the
suggestion that a dissenting (mine) should not be tolerated on the NMS,
i.e. if I dissent, then I better get the hell of the reader list.

<snip because all you did was agree with me>

Who's stopping you?  Oh yeah, the ROR HOF called me today, said they saw my
post and used it as the determining factor to deny Rush's induction.

>If you don't, then fine just step aside.

Here we go again with the censorship thing.  "So you don't want Rush in the
HOF, then get the fuck off our NMS!"

Hi Matt!  I found that post very interesting and actually quite insightful.
The one problem I had was with the parting comments on GuP.   I realize it
was partly in jest and EVERYONE has a right to their own opinion and all
but, it being one of my favorite Rush albums I wanted to comment a bit...

 paste-
You wrote:

20) Grace Under Pressure (Rush's black album, released in the Reagan vs. the
Evil Empire/"The Day After" early 80s...this is the band's weakest effort,
with dinky drums, a feeble attempt to sound like a mainstream 80s pop band
like Night Ranger or Journey, and pessimistic, Floydish songs about the
aftermath of the dreaded global nuclear prom.  Let Floyd play Floyd...Rush's
only song that conveys their message is 'Kid Gloves'...the only song that
doesn't leave you with an impulse to slash your wrists).
 end paste-

I agree!  GuP *is* Rush's "black album"!  I just don't see anything wrong
with that though! Sure they took a darker course but those were darker
times.  For instance, the Cold War, the confusion in air as to "what is
right" politically and spiritually across the globe, and don't forget the
death of their close friend that led to the song Afterimage.  That song
means alot to me personally, the words convey their meaning well without
being contrite IMHO.  I definately disagree that they were trying to be
"Pop" though, yes they cut their hair and were going through an 80's
"High-Tech" phase (i.e. The song Body Electric had a sort of pre-Computer
Age aprehension about it, Alex's guitar effects, etc..) but they would
never degridate into Night Ranger or Journey clones!  Yikes!  I agree that
the drum mix was a bit dinky but I believe the drumming on the song Red
Lenses was very creative IMHO. Also, the song Red Sector A is one of my
faves, despite the heavy subject matter lyrically, musically it keeps an
upbeat tone to compensate.  It *is* their darkest album but I don's see
that as neccesarily bad.  It's just a phase they pushed through.  Anyway, I
enjoyed your post!  It freaks me out when i anazlyze Rush this much but I
wanted to throw it out...

Gang,

Am I the only person who was a little disappointed with the quality of 
the remastering of Hemispheres? Specifically, the tape hiss at the
start of La Villa bugs me. I know on the Led Zeppelin Remasters they
did an exceptional job of cleaning stuff like that up, so my question
is was Geddy, Alex or Neil involved in the Remastering, or was this
all done by Mercury?  In the case of the Led Zep stuff, Jimmy Page
himself was heavily involved in the remastering process and I suspect
that contributed to the excellent job done.

As far as I can recall I didn't notice this sort of tape hiss in
Rivendell, so would this have something to do with the level of
dynamics in La Villa?

Rush-mgr, 

Someone in this forum stated that DS, with the ODEON 3rd disc was a
LIMITED edition.  Is this true ?  I personnaly don't think that it's true.
I mean, why are they going to re-release DS with only the two CP and T4E
shows ? Well, maybe it's for this reason why the third disc is boxed
separatly ?

Anyway, I bought a second copy of DS (18.79 $ at Future Shop, a deal
anyway!) just in case!

Thanks

Hey Imanaz,

did you ever think of simply programming your CD player with those 7 songs
(app. 7-8 buttons) and just READ how long 2112 actually is on the display ?
And you don't really have to be obsessed about 2112 to do that.

<A NAME="2158017">Subject: Deeper Into the Rhythm Method</A>

Hola Rush Fanatics,

Pining the hours away now that the marching season is over and performance
juries are finished, I've taken some time to break down the Rhythm Method. 
Of course, I deem this a WORTHY waste of my time solely because I hate
studying for finals.  Apathy, thy name is B.J.

In response to Keith's post in the #2157 issue:

I've taken a closer listen to the section you were mentioning.  Amongst the
groove, I did notice a couple synth snare-ish inner beats that may have
constituted your buzzing, but then, listening close,r I also came across
something most drummers take for granted:  The HI-HAT!  Yesiree, at 4:11
Neil digs into the offbeat hi-hat "snips" that usually go unnoticed.  It
helps keep time and adds more to the groove up until the backbeat (2 and 4)
enters at 4:40.  Perhaps that's what you're referring to?  All the filler
stuff around it is all synth percussion, except for the toms.  Your hi-fi is
working just fine.  Good ears.

I analyzed the Rhythm Method using Theme and Variation.  It's actually done
in 3 "movements" with 4 distinctive themes (maybe more) and their
variations.  It's pretty cool, too, because Neil's stays relatively
consistent with doing changes near the minute or :30 second marks.  I think
he's timing the whole thing, but I could be wrong.  I never was much good in
that-there theory class I done took (Huk! Spitooey!), so critique all you
want.

The Rhythm Method

1st Movement - The Neil also Waltzes
0:00  -  Theme 1 - Waltz theme
0:58  -  Variation 1

2nd Movement - Solo Trading
2:00 - Theme 2 - Straight rhythms
2:31 - Variation 1 - Trading licks with marimba
3:04 - Theme 3 - Set off by 1st "horsetrack" motive
3:30 - Solo Variation 1 - Set off by 2nd "horsetrack" motive
3:55 - end of movement

3rd Movement - Musicality Matters
3:55 - Introduction - Reverberating toms
4:10 - Theme 4 - Street beats

I've got to say that I think it is rather arrogant of us to be
commenting on whether Rush would like to be inducted into the HOF.  I
don't mean that we shouldn't express out opinion, but I think the real
issue is how would Rush feel?  
It would be recognition by the industry and the fans of their years of
hard work, amazing contribution to music, and inspiring many other
bands and musicians.  Just because we would like to think that we are
unique because we are Rush fans (and I include myself in that group),
it doesn't necessarily mean that Rush would feel lessened or
denigrated to be acknowledged and honored for their achievements by an
established and popular institution.
I'm sure that almost all of us has been honored for something at some
point in our lives, and I would dare to speculate we felt pretty good
about it whether or not we were enamored with the entity that
recognized us.

ThomLarsen@aol.com wrote:

"What do you mean BMG discs are inferior?  I'd heard this before, but I
thought it was determined that the CD's from the CD clubs (ie. BMG,
Columbia House) are of the same quality of those you buy in the store?"

BMG tends to "Remaster" the DC from a copy of the master tape.  You will
notice on many BMG releases, the Song lengths (time of the cut) is
different, and when you A/B the BMG release to the original, you'll notice
a difference at the point the fade starts, or even sometimes the order of
the songs.

Someone else (perhaps the same person) wrote:

"How have you arrived at the conclusion that the sound quality of BMG
products is inferior to "standard run" disks?  A CD is a CD, and
digital is digital.  Manufacturers don't make separate CD pressings for
retailers and marketers like BMG or Columbia House.  If you disagree, I
invite you to prove me wrong."

Some of us (especially a seasoned musician) can tell the difference right
off.  And don't let the simple fact that both are CD's and both are digital
confuse you to believe they are simply the same.

A CD is "pressed" from a "Glass Master".  How this glass master is produced
will determine how the end product will sound.  A Glass Master is produced
by running the mastered DAT (Digital Audio Tape) or other source (these
day's, sometimes even a mastered CD) through the Glass Mastering machine,
and cutting the Glass Master.  Now, the quality of the input between two
different Glass Master machines could be identical, but the output onto the
Disc could be wide ranging depending on:

1)	The saturation of the digital signal into the Mastering Machine
2)	The quality of the Analogue to Digital and Digital to Analogue
	converters in the Mastering Machine.
3)	The quality of the sound source, as many master tapes used to make
	these "Remastered" discs are inferior to the orignal.
4)	The quality of the presses that reproduce the CD's from the
	glass masters

Here's something else to consider - and it's technical in nature.  Now, I
feel I'm a bit qualified to discuss this because I do some mastering of
locally produced CD's in the Greater Cincinnati Area:

There is a process when mastering a digital sound sourse (tape or CD) to be
pressed for CD or Cassette called "Dithering".  Dithering actually adds a
small amount of "distortion" to the final mix.  It's inaudible to the human
ear - what it does is makes the CD "warmer sounding" and a bit less harsh
to the listener.  If you were to take a product that was previously
Dithered and try to remaster it, the sound will suffer once again.

Let's just say that the only way BMG is going to make money off of material
that has already been released by a major lable, or a major hit at rock
bottom prices, they're going to have to cut corrners.  The sound quality
will suffer.

I see it now:  "Yes, Attorney General's office?  I arranged to buy
contraband merchandise from this guy, and..."  How will you prove he
offered it?  How will you prove you paid him?  How will you prove
anything?  And BTW:  the CD's only cost a buck a piece.  The labor and
acquisistions cost much more, in terms of time invested.  Perhaps your
time is volunteer labor.  For those of us who don't live in our parents'
basements, we need to be paid for the hours we invest.  May I suggest
you pursue a career field other than law or business?

I really do feel for you--it took 15 months for me to finally get
Experience to Extremes from him.  But there are risks in dealing with a
bootlegger, and if you think the law will help you, you are a sucker. 
And unless he made a point of flashing his income around or depositing
it in large chunks to his account, not even the IRS will waste time
trying to nail him--not worth the effort, based on hearsay evidence.

Agreed, but collectors do not value them much.  Simply becuase it is
licensed, and not the "original" market, DOES detract from it's value. 
Much like the difference between a print from an artist, and a print
from a marketing agent like a gallery.  It just isn't the same as far as
origin.  Feel free to call a collector or rare record store and ask.

BTW:  BMG is hiring shipping people for the holidays--come to Indy and

I was watching a video feed of  MTV-2 at work tonight.  (I work at a TV
station that has a satellite broadcast center so I see a lot of feeds.)  

There was a video on that I thought was absolutely a riot.  Yo La Tango was
the name of the band.  I've heard of them but I've never really heard their
music.  The video was centered on a school that turned geeks into rock
stars.  Unfortunatly I did not catch the title of the video.

The head instructor was dressed like Paul Stanley from KISS, (including
make-up) but acted like an English schoolmaster.  

During the video all kinds of situations were played out.  While the class
was outside on the lawn having a discussion a different "teacher" pulled
out a vinyl copy of "A farewell to kings." as his textbook.  The cover is
featured prominently for at least 2-3 seconds.  Then you see him reading
from the liner notes and lyrics sheets for a little while.

I was dying laughing and everyone else thought that I was crazy.  I guess
the irony is that Rush's members are not really "Rock Stars" in the vein
that was being acted out on the video.

Just thought that everyone might get a kick out of this.

notes per beat.

Alex doesn't quite fit in this group. He is quite the crafty guitarist =

Taken from the December 10-16, 1998, Los Angeles New Times at page 74, this is a
blurb from a Journey concert review that mentions Rush in passing:

Journey...

>..The guys are writing new songs, they have a new drummer in Deen Castronovo,
and most importantly, a new nut-buster vocalist--some guy named Steve Augeri,
who always wanted to be Steve Perry when he grew up and now gets his shot.  As
for former lead schnozz Perry, a hip injury from a hiking accident squelched his
interest in touring and prompted his departure in 1997.  That's the official
reason, anyway.  More likely, his departure can be chalked up to the fact that
he always took the silver medal in the I-sing-so-high-only-dogs-can-hear-me
sweepstakes to Rush's human vacuum cleaner, Geddy Lee.  That'll sink a man, fer
sure.  So might the realization that methodical torture with power tools might
be a more rewarding experience that seeing his band perform.  (Neal Weiss)

Oh, very witty, Craig.  This person asked a simple question about why
his/her CD-ROM would not read the enhanced portion of the disc and instead
of giving the person a constructive answer, you felt it necessary to
belittle the person for not having as much computer knowledge as yourself.
Why?

To the person who originally posed the question:
There's a good chance that your CD-ROM is a little bit older and cannot
read both parts of the disc.  This happened with my drive at home.
However, when I used the CD-ROM here at work, the disc could read both
parts fine.  If you have access to a newer PC, try the disc in that and see
what you get.
