   The RUSH Crossword Puzzle No. Two,
   submitted by Dave Webb, Warwickshire, UK

   This puzzle is found in the Signals Tourbook, and is quite large (and
   quite hard!)  Only the most well-rounded Rush fan will get all these.
   Due to the size of the puzzle, I was unable to put the clue numbers in
   the puzzle itself, so they follow the puzzle.  I apologize for any
   errors that I have made.
