Hey.  I'm new around here, so...

Anyway, someone asked about guitar tabs.  I went to the music store and the only
ones that the catalog had were RTB and Grace Under Pressure.  Also, in one of
the back issues of one of the guitar magazines (I think either Guitar or Guitar
School), there was La Villa Strangiato - I think it was printed in the mid 80's.
I have the Chronicles book, and its really not that hard at all to go from the
chords shown to what Alex is playing - especially when you consider that the
songs from the first album are guitar parts transcribed for piano.  They also
have Rush Complete - all the songs from Rush to Signals.  Hope it helps.

If anyone know about anything else...

     I sent a concert review in to the NMS yesterday, but the last 2/3 of it
appear to have been lost somehow.  :(  Oh, well, if I get a chance I'll
re-type it.

  [ You're right, and it looked fine when I edited it! I guess the "From" 
    thing screwed up the post again. In the future anyone typing in articles
    please try not to put "From" and the beginning of a line, or put a

G'day!

Well, someone asked how big the guys were.  I'll exert serious and
unrelenting effort to keep the "vulgar" comments out of this one!!
:-)  (I'm sorry, it's hard to resist with these three gorgeous men
running around... sigh.)

Alright, alright.  I'll be serious...

Neil is about 6' and is the tallest of the three.
Alex and Geddy are about the same height, I think.  Somewhere on the
order of 5' 6", or something like that.  Someone on here should know
more precisely.

Incidentally, that sort-of reminds me, concerning Neil and his brother,
Dan.  Is Neil older, or is Dan?  And who *is* that guy on the GUP
video credits under 'VTR Operator'?  His name is Bruce Peart.  Nephew?
Uncle?  Father?  Another brother?  Anyone know?

<A NAME="553004">Subject: Boot dealers</A>

There have been several questions about dealers of unauthorized live
recordings since I last posted this information, so I'll repeat it.

I have been compiling a list of North American CD boot dealers, including
addresses, phone numbers, prices, and evaluations of service and
reliabilty. There are about 35 dealers on the list right now, which is
just about ready for its first non-beta test distribution. I'm just
waiting for some definite info on Goldmine subscriptions and a couple more
evaluations.

This list has been *very* popular on the Police mailing list, and I got a
fair response the last time I posted about it here. I concentrate mostly
on Rush when I evaluate the dealers. If you have an earlier copy, chances
are it's much more thorough and extensive now. I'll send copies to anyone
who wants one; just mail me.

<A NAME="553005">Subject: Rush and the Critics</A>

I am glad that people have brought up the critical response to Rush's music
by some unenlightened fellows.  I have done extensive research to track down
reviews and interviews concerning Rush.  The general consensus among critics
is that Rush is a pompous, self-indulgant, arrogant band with nothing fresh
or exciting to offer listeners.  One review stated that with PeW, Rush were
simply "permanent cliches".  Another claimed MP was "pseudo metal" and
although it was techinically well done, it had no merit overall.  The
criticism goes on and on, but it is necessary to look at why so many critics
feel this way.  My theory is that Rush represents part of a music "elite".
This does not refer to talent but to their cultural standing.  Rush's music
is not easily understood or grasped by the average music listener.  Their
experimentation, odd-time playing, and progressiveness is not easily
understood by participants in populist or "pop" culture.  People generally
react hostilly to ideas or forms of music they do not understand.  Pop
culture thrives on a simplicity and generally non-intellectual approach to
music.  John Q. Public normally does not want to sit down with a lyric sheet,
put on headphones and really analyze and take in what is happening in a
complex musical setting.  He wants to go home, take out an ice-cold beer,
crank up the stereo and relish in what a Zen Buddhist would call "no-mind".
Thus, Rush, with all of its "pompous self-indulgence", is not his idea of
a good band.  The public sees complex, experimental music such as what Rush
produces as an elite art form which is deliberately designed to go over their
heads.  They react negatively and with hositlity toward the band and its
music.  A critic who believes that the Rolling Stones are the epitome of
great music is obviously working with a different set of criteria than the
dedicated Rush fan.  There is nothing wrong with his choice or opinion, but
he almost certainly would have trouble understanding the "elite" nature of
Rush.  Now that I've stated my theory, what does everyone else think?

<A NAME="553006">Subject: Re: lots of stuff</A>

Hi all!  This is a reply to a number of different threads

About Hine/Broon/new-old Rush controversy:

since i am new I figure i get to say once what i think about this, so I will.
I like ALL Rush from RUSH to RTB.  The style changes over the years and i think
that is one of the cool things about Rush: they have a lot of facets.  i don't
think you can expect people who have aged 20 years, had kids etc. to write the
same way throughout their careers.  Their lyrics especially reflect this change.
What impresses me is that throughout all of this they have stayed together and
continued to be (mostly) happy and productive. I do see a dividing line between
"old" and "new" stuff,  especially the synth and Geddy's voice dropping an
octave!  But I like things about both eras, i don't understand why people expect
Rush to stay the same.

As to producers: am i the only one who thinks that this is up to Geddy, Neil
and Alex?  As I said above, they've been together forever and have obviously
achieved a stable working relationship and a way to adapt to changes; if this
involves changing producers instead of breaking up the band, hear hear! This
is also my response to whoever sounded doubtful about Neil faxing stuff when
they are writing....hey, whatever works: RTB proves they collaborate effectively
this way.

Re: Free for all and "Neil's Dimensions"
My money was on Alex all the way until I read the post about Neil being a BIG
guy. ??? Anyone know how tall they are?  I once tried to figure out Geddy's
height.  I had a picture of him standing with his bass on end in front of him.
I stood my bass on end in front of me and tried to estimate using my height
and how far the bass went up on me-- most of the way :) -- and by comparison
estimated Geddy at 5'8" tall.  Ah the things we will do to avoid homework! :)

Re: subject of Madrigal
Sounds to me like it is about a certain young man who has managed to fall
in love and make it as a touring rocker both at the same time and has found it
slightly inconvenient :)

Can anyone tell me an author and book title if i want to check out "A Nice
Morning Drive" despite its bad reviews here?

  [ It's by Richard S. Foster and was a short story published in "Road & Track" 
    November 1973. The full transcription is available for anonymous ftp on 
    syrinx.umd.edu in the special directory, called "nice.morning.drive"
								   : rush-mgr ]

Re: Alex and backup singing
I have also noticed that backups on Presto and RTB sound very much like Geddy.
Someone (not Alex) is credited with backing vocals on Presto; I figured Ged had
finally found someone who sounded like him and on another listen it didn't
sound EXACTLY like Ged.  I figured it was this guy again on RTB, but then why
isn't he listed?  What does Alex's voice sound like anyway?

oops will continue in next post (net disconnect)

OK, back on....

Re: Xanadu
Fun to see all this philosphy! Thanks to Randy for citing "Purchas his
Pilgrimage" as what Coleridge was reading.  Anyone have more info? I believe
Xanadu is a staple of eastern myth (not sure what region) and that it is
linked to immortality in the original legend; sorry, don't think that was
Neil's contribution.  For the Xanadu fact filer: LOTS o' work for you!

A brief female perspective on "where are the female Rush fans?":

I don't know!  It took a couple of years for me to figure out how small the
female minority really was, especially since the first rush fan I ever met
was a girl (she is the only other female Rush fan I know.) it didn't completely
hit me until I went to a gigb y the Rush tribute band Free Will and realized
of 100 people I was one of about six girls. ( And the other five had a look on
their faces like "this is your night hon, tomorrow *I* pick.) Anyway i talked
to the Free Will guys who --mildly surprised to see me-- informed me that I
was indeed in the minority.  They are really cool BTW.

I would guess it has a lot to do with the emphasis on science in Rush songs, and
is also directly related to the fact that relatively few women play electric
guitar etc.; Rush are sort of musicians' musicians. Science and moderate-to-
hard rock are both portrayed in our society as not for females.  Fantasy and
sci-fi used to be all male as well but it is changing.  I think this cultural
bias is really the only reason.  Women participate in plenty of other things
where the protagonists are male (i.e. most of Western Civilization) and fan
makeups of many other music groups (i.e. alternative) are really almost 50-50
even if men do most of the performing and writing (though this is changing
too) I also don't think Rush expresses some primal adolescent exclusively male
fantasy (or else there would be more sex, eh?)

As a female who has always been fascinated by rock (or whatever Rush is!) and
science, as well as SF and fantasy and just plain good writing, I found Rush
an awesome band in all those areas.  I relate very much to Neil's lyrics;
they describe my life and my musings pretty well.  I think if other girls
had grown up the way I did, in a somewhat less sterotyped environment, you'd
eventually end up with Rush fandom being 50-50 guys and gals. :)

Sorry this was such a huge post! I promise, they will be MUCH shorter in the
future!!!!!!!

	Hey all....
A few thoughts about a 'free for all'

Neil appears to be the taller of the three... 2112 picture ....
As well as fairly well built and defined .... Presto Photo ....
So to Alex and Geddy.... to qoute a popular arcade phrase .....
			" You Lose "

That is of course if Neil didn't paralize then with his 'Glare' anyway.....

Greetings phellow phanz,

     This is probably old hat to most of you, but ever since I bought RTB, I've
been pondering on this:  just what is the Gangster of Boats Trilogy?  I know
Neil is known to be witty and all, but am I just missing the boat (sorry)?
Also, do parts I, II, and III exist?  If so, does anybody have them?

Like you said, the only thing to think about while reading the review
is to realize that both nights sold out up there (if memory serves!!).
In fact, my brother lives in new york city and he said a friend walked
by right when the concert let out, and it was just a mob scene of the
greatest order.

I think we should get a conspiracy going and try to plant as many NMS
subscribers as we can into Newspapers around the country as record
and concert reviewers. Whatdoyathink?
