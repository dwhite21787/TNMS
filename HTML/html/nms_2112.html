         The National Midnight Star, Number 2112

It's taken us nearly 9 years to reach issue 2112, and at times I thought
the digest was defunct for good! I wanted to say thanks to everyone who's
stuck by us for so long, put up with a month-long hiatus (twice!), and
those of you who have conspired to bring us up-to-date news from the Rush
front. And a huge thanks to those of you who've been around since the very
beginning, and put up with all our growing pains, lost mail, multiple copies
of the digest, and an occasional meltdown and rebuild of our subscriber
database.

Although there were a lot of good ideas for issue 2112, most of you lost track
of the fact that this issue is a *DIGEST* matter; this should be a tribute
to the digest itself, the fact that we were able to plug away to even reach
2112 issues, and not a tribute to the band. Even though the band is why we're
all subscribed here, *WE* got ourselves to 2112!

So in that vein, I thought I'd give a brief history of where The National
Midnight Star came from. Some of you have seen this before, but you're gonna
see it again! (it's very brief, trust me)

Originally TNMS had no name. It started out as a mail reflector run by 
Jimmy Lang (the infamous one) from his UCSD account. He started it because
at the time there was no alt.music.rush. In fact, there were only TWO music
news groups, rec.music.misc and alt.music.rock-n-roll. Many sites didn't get
the alt.* groups, and r.m.m. was as anti-Rush as you could get. Jimmy contacted
a few people he had seen post positive things about Rush, and the mailing
list was born on November 10, 1989. A week later, David Arnold donated his
time and his machine syrinx.umd.edu, and the mailing list turned into a digest.

And so it ran, nameless, until the fall of 1990. Then a naming project
was begun -- people submitted names, and votes were taken. The National
Midnight Star won the poll, with Signals coming in a close second (TNMS won
by *ONE* vote!). The digest was revamped, got a new look, and looked much 
like the current digests today. The very first issue of TNMS was #83, which 
you can find on the mail server (#82 will show you a list of the other
contenders for names).

So TNMS was born, and ran quietly until I took it over in the summer of '93
(David had gotten too busy to handle the continuously growing number of
subscribers). And thus it has been ever since, minus the slight move off
of umd to tnms.com :-)

We have seen the formation of alt.music.rush. We've been through 4 studio
albums & tours, a compilation, and are coming up on our first live album.
We've seen the number of music mailing lists grow from 20 to thousands.
We've seen the triumph of the band, and the grief. And we've more than lived
up to our name. Througout it all, we've always been here as a dedicated 
outlet for fans.

We were one of the first. We're one of the largest.
And we're still one of the best.
Congratulations on issue 2112!
