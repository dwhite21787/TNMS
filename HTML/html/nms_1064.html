Hi
You know your a Rush fan when you over here someone talking about Rush
saying "That racist sonuv'a bitch" and then you jump in the middle only
to find out that they were talking about Rush Limbaugh and then you go
shot yourself in disgrace.

	Fbn is quiet an intersting album.  Rivendale, the song about the
hideway elf village, is also interesting, for Elrond the half-elf leader
of the village was an Eldar of the Noldor tribe of elves.  (I read the
Simarillion)  The Noldor had a curse on their house, because they killed
their own kin.   Isn't ironic that they would write such a peaceful
song.  ( O.K the elves at Rivendale were good in the Hobbit and The Lord
of the Rings.)

	It seems to me that By-tor and the Snow Dog is really about  The
final battle in the war Wrath (also in the Simarillion.) where Manwe
tosses out Morgoth out of Angbad and sends him to the void forever.

	You know when your a Rush fan when you name your three kids Gary (geddy
is just to weird) Lee, Neil Peart, and Alexa (Alex) Lifeson....Your last
name here.
Just a few rambling thoughts

I've always dreamed about Rush releasing a live box set that includes
every song played live but never released on a live album.  A good tour
to start with would be the AFTK tour.  Imagine stuff like Cygnus X-1 Book
1 and Book 2, AFTK, Natural Science (which I have live! :)), the Fear
trilogy, Chemistry, Digital Man, Middletown Dreams, Grand Designs, Lock
and Key, etc.  It would be an amazing thing!  Why don't they do it?  ahhh!

Hi,
	 This is not a start of a rumour, just my opinion.

Puanani said "I dunno -- their idea sounds like a live album
without the "live".  It's an odd idea..."

Well, maybe the old material reworked could be some of the
stuff resurected on the last few tours, eg Hemispheres, Analog
Kid etc.

It's always possible that the reference Neil made, was to a
new live album, with reworked material on it.

I don't know, but would be happy for any release in the future,
near or otherwise, but the sooner the better. In any case, until
there are words from the Rush Mgr, who was spot on with Counterparts,
I wouldn't have much faith in rumours, even those printed in magazines.
Remember the Evening with Rush idea that Alex mentioned on Rockline.
Enough said.

Thanks
James

I try to read as much of NMS as possible and I don't recall this being
discussed lately.  I obviously love RUSH but I also am a car nut.   I first
heard Moving Pictures the night before it was released in record stores on  a
local radio station and when I heard Red Barchetta I knew immediately it was
based on a story from Road and Track.  I looked through my old issues and
found it, I was right!  When I bought the album the next day I saw that the
story was referenced.  It made me feel smug.  Anyway, I was wondering if
anyone know what cars the boys drive.  To some this is a boring topic, but to
a car nut it is interesting and i don't think it is too nosey or personal.
Humor me.  I believe you can tell a lot about someone by what they drive:  do
they have more money than taste?, a poseur?, a true afficiando?, etc.  I have
heard Geddy had a Porsche Turbo, but I don't know otherwise.  I checked the
FAQ.. nothing.  I would guess that Geddy has the latest Carrera 4 (4wd, good
on Canadian winter, can outrun pesky fans), that Alex has a Ferrari (targa
top, great engine sound, not too practical) and Neil I place in a Range Rover
(quality but not very flashy , bike carrier on top of course).  Anyone know?

I guess for me the realization of being o Rushaholic
happened last weekend.  The wife, 2 daughters, and parents-
in-law were on our way from Severn, MD (where I live) to
visit my sister-in-law.  On the ride up, my dearest wife
turned on 98Rock (Baltimore station) and Freewill had
just started.  YES!  So my mother-in-law says, "Who
is this guy? It sounds like he's trying to pass a
kidney stone."  I immedeatly slammed on the brakes of
our minivan and told her to get the HELL out of
my car!  This happened somewhere around the Belair
exit.  So if your driving up Interstate 95 northbound
and happen to see some old bag who needs a ride,
look for a mud puddle and splash some mud on the
old nagging bat.

Thanks for listening

<A NAME="1064006">Subject: Re:Rushaholics Anonymous</A>

In a message, cs_lundquist@ccmail.pnl.gov said that the first step should
be "Admit that you are a Rushaholic" Here are the true 12 steps as they
apply to Rushaholics.
	Step 1. Admit that we are powerless over Rush, that are lives
can't be manageable without them.
	Step 2. Came to believe that the National Midnight Star could
restore us to Sanity.
	Step 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to
the Spirit of Radio as we understood it.
	Step 4. Made a searching and fearless Passage to Bangkok
	Step 5. Admitted to Dirk, Lerxst, and Pratt the exact nature of
our Nuerotica
	Step 6. Became entirely willing to listen to Hemispheres.
	Step 7. Asked that the "trinity" remove all doubts that they are Gods.
	Step 8. Made a list of all people we know who like Rush and
became willing to hang out with them all (what do you know, A concert!)
	Step 9. Made direct recordings of all these shows except when to
do so would injure them (Rush) or others.
	Step 10. Continue to listen to Rush daily and when we didn't
promptly did.
	Step 11. Sought through Dreamline to improve contact with Rush as
we understood them.
	Step 12. Having found a Panacea as a result of these steps, we
carry this message to other Rush fans, and listen to Rush every day of
our lives.

	As this is my first post also, as seems to be the custom, I will
say a little about me. I first came to this Fellowship in 1990 when I
heard Hemispheres and was entranced with Geddy's Bass playing. I then
went out and got everything Rush I could get my hands on. I saw them on
Roll the Bones tour, and have played mostly Rush covers in a band with my
bewst friend, also a Rushaholic. I play bass and keybaords and sing (and
NO, I don't want to be like Geddy :-))

  Once again, Rush have gotten ganked out of a "best rock instrumental"
Grammy they deserved.  "YYZ" was beat out by the Police's "Behind My
Camel"(I like the Police, but that song is montonous), I think Satriani
beat out "Where's My Thing?", and Pink Floyd's "Marooned" beat out "Leave
That Thing Alone!" this year.  With every year, I am convinced that the
Grammy judges wouldn't know good music if they slept with Geddy Lee.

    Hello everyone. This is my first posting.   I am so ecstatic to be a part
of this wonderful newsletter. When a friend of mine told me about this I
immediatly joined in! This is wonderful! Rush deserves whatever recognition
they can get in whatever medium.
    Because this is my first posting (of many I hope), I'd like to tell you
some of my favorite songs and albums. I started as a Rush fan with HYF. A
friend of mine lent it to me in 1987 and I still have not returned it! (Sorry
Geoff). Ever since then I have been an elated passenger on the Rush
Bandwagon!
     I believe, like many of you, that Rush fans are truly amazing fans. For
the most part they are highly intelligent, thoughtful people. They care about
the music, and the message more than the presentation and the pomposity. That
is becoming more rare these days. When you think about it, it is EXTREMLY
rare for a band to do EXACTLY what they want, year in and year out, and still
sell records.The only similar situation I can think of is Frank Zappa. That
is a testimony to you and I i.e. THE RUSH FAN! We should all be proud.
     I liked the comment of Rush fans being members of a union of intelligant
conversationalists. (I forgot who said that but Nice Job!)
     Now on to my favorite albums. It has got to be  a tie between HYF and
Power Windows. I agree with the B'Man when he said in the Rush Biography
"Visions" that PW is as close to perfect as an album can get.
     Although I sincerely love all Rush albums, I must say I am quite partial
to the time period from Signals to Presto. I like the sequencing and lush
keyboard arrangements. Although it is nice to see that the band is
continually evolving! Counterparts was a HUGE step up from Roll The Bones in
my humble opinion.
     Rush is very important to me and has helped me through some difficult
times in my life. If any of you would like to e-mail me, please feel free to
do so! My e-mailbox is always open to a Rush fan! Thanks for listening!

<A NAME="1064009">Subject: If you like Rush....</A>

	Well, I think it's safe to say that the rumors of a Rush relase this
spring are false (especially since I personally called Anthem Records,
and they verified that there is NO ALBUM due out).  With that said, I'd
like to perhaps suggest another band that I've recently gotten into who
I thing really WILL appeal to Rush fans.

	Their name is Echolyn, and they have a new album entitled 'As the
World' due out on March 7th (that's this tuesday) on Sony, and it should
be available in record stores near you.

	Much like Rush, they take superb musicianship and excellent lyrics, and
combine them into a very cohesive whole.  Since you can't have Rush this
Spring, why not give these guys a shot.  I'd say the odds are heavily in
your favor, that you'll like these guys if you like Rush.

Dare I even say that they are comparable to Rush?

In case you want to hear them live (to supplement buying their disc, or
prior to getting it to check them out first), here are a list of Tour
dates for the immediate future.  Admission has been dirt cheap ($3 in
Pittsburgh, $4 in Cleveland earlier this week), so you can probably get
a nice evening for like 5 bucks.  They even have a 2 song sampler of the
new ablum that they are giving out for free, so be sure to grab one.

3/3/95- Toledo, OH - Frankie's
3/4/95- Detroit, MI - The Ritz
3/6/95- Grand Rapids, MI - Reptile House
3/7/95- Ann Arbor, MI - Blind Pig
3/8/95- Kalamazoo, MI - Rick's Cafe
3/10/95- Philadelphia, PA - Theater of Living Arts (Album Release Party)
3/16/95- Washington, DC - The Bayou
3/17/95- The Insect Club - Norfolk, VA
3/23/95- AKA - New York City

I'm not officially affiliated with the band, but rather I'm just a
pretty big fan, who honestly, hasn't been this psyched about a band
since I first got into Rush.  Rush is my favorite band of all time, but
these guys are running a close second.  There is no higher praise as far
as I'm concerned :-)

If you'd like more information, please feel free to email me at
jsbh@andrew.cmu.edu, email the BAND THEMSELVES at echolyn@delphi.com, or
even check out the Echolyn home page (yup, I broke down and created one)
at:
http://tarkus.ac.acs.cmu.edu/echolyn/echolyn.html

And for all you Canadian fans out there, they have a tentative release
in Early April, possibly with a tour of Ontario/Quebec...

I beg all your indulgences for this not-really-rush related information.

Chris,

Just wanted to let you know that Simon Phillips did indeed play with Judas
Priest.  He is the drummer on the album "Sin After Sin."  He's credited
more like an extra player than an actual member of the band, but he's on
there.  Just thought I'd clear this up.  No flame intended.  Sorry for the

  OK, Ok, so this is my first post.  So now you can skip my letter.
  I have almost all of the Rush CD's.  I know shame on me for not trying hard
enough.  Well I did better.  I just bought some LP's of QUALITY for Cheap.
 It is amazing.  2112 is not as good as the Remastered Gold.  But it
definatly pumps out the low bass that the Cd can not.  Quality again.
  The Lp's that I baugth are 2112, All The W.A.S., ESL, PW, and Mp of couse.
 The Moving Pictures cover says that it was printed in West Germany.  So does
this mean that it is of more value.  The store had "Import" printed on the
plastic cover.  I hope I did good.
  My main post is that I am pleased with quality of the records.  You get
more pictures and clarity.  Blasted dust.   But the only negative thing about
it is the limitedplay on a side.
  I guess I am wet behind the ears for most of you here.  But at least I now
know what you folks had to appreciate.
  WOW!!

Hello all.
I would like to start by apologizing to Aaron.  Sorry, I guess I took you a
little too serious and I was quick to defend the best band around.  I now
realize it was all in fun.  Anyway, I had a great idea (wonder of wonders!).
Lets do a reader's poll of you guys' or gals' 2nd favorite band.  Email me
direct and tell me your favorite.  Then when i get enough responses I will
post them up here.  Even tough Rush kicks, we need a little diversity some
times right? My other favorites are Primus, Pink Floyd, and The Beatles.  So
Email me and I'll calculate the results!

        i agree that nms is GREAT!  though, i suspect there are many lists
        that discuss their favorite music in-depth.  on of my faves is the
        grateful dead list "dead-flames" - lots of interesting & thought
        provoking stuff there.  however, there are WAY too many flames.
        the lack of flames is one of the best things about nms.  everyone
        has their own opinions and a right to voice them.  similarly,

        OIMGOD!!!!  i haven't though about those mini album covers in
        YEARS!  i, too, had the PeW one (& probably still have it
        somewhere).  i remember these were the perfect size for barbie
        dolls (though i was 15 at the time - usually a bit too old for
        barbies - though i personally think you're NEVER too old....but
        that's a different story altogether...)  anyway, it's too bad they
        didn't make mini versions of ALL the rush album covers back then -
        i would've gotten them ALL!

     >...I've been collecting a lot of magazine articles...

        i, for one, would be interested in seeing your list.

played for Judas Priest.  Well, you didn't do your homework.  Please let me
restate - I *KNOW* that Simpon Phillips played for Judas Priest.  He was the
drummer/percussionist on the very first JP album that I bought back in 1977
 - an album called Sin After Sin.  Man, aren't you embarrassed? ;)

Anyway, I'd like to take my original post about the BfB drummers to private

I mean I have been listening to them forever, and I have loved ever thing they

what an awesome idea. I just hope it continues. As for the country rumor, I

	My name is Brian Fuller and this is first posting (so bear with
me).  I am a graduate student in English and I teach first year
(freshman) reading and writing.  I have found Rush be an effective tool
in drawing students out on some issues.  I use "Territories" and "The
Trees" to teach a textual analysis unit.  I read in FAQ that "The Trees"
is meant to be just kind of a "fun" song, but my students really find a
lot of meaning in it.  Both songs serve well to spark discussion on the
evils of racism, sexism, war etc., etc.  It's also great for teaching
figurative language.  Whether Rush had a message in "The Trees" or not,
it certainly seems too well crafted and thought out to be "just a song."
I think the band may be pulling the same thing Coleridge did after
writing "Kubla Khan" (i.e. "oh it was just a piece of garbage I thought
up after an opium trip")  Not so!
	Anyway, I'm all for using Rush in teaching and couseling.  Many
times kids won't listen to parents, teachers, or couselors; most of them,
however, will listen to music.
	If anyone's has any ideas (or is interested in my ideas) about
using Rush to teach, send me a message.

P.S. - "Everyday Glory" IS an awesome song.
P.S.S. - Everytime I tell people I'm part of an internet group for Rush
	 fans they say, "He sure hates democrats, doesn't he?"  It's
	 annoying.  Maybe we should change Limbaugh's name to "Ralph?"

<A NAME="1064020">Subject:      Yet another lurking newbie . . .</A>

Hey, y'all.

After lurking in the shadows for a few weeks, I'm sending my first post.

The standard format seems to be "How I got into Rush" which, for me, was
late '70s/2112 (I'm 35... that sound you hear is my prostate enlarging).

However, I think a better story is my younger brother's induction.  I lived
in the basement (typical late teens habitat) and his room was directly above
mine.  After a few years of listening to his floor vibrate, he came down
and made off with FBN, COS, and 2112 (this was shortly before Hemispheres,
I believe).  His path into rock was through Kiss, et. al.

Well, my ceiling vibrated for a few days, and then he reappeared, albums in
hand.  With a puzzled look on his face, he summed up what I think was the
essential lure of Rush at that time:

"You know, hardly anything repeats in *any* of these songs."

Simple, yet trenchant.  I do enjoy latter-day Rush, but the trend towards
repetetive fadeout choruses is a bit distressing.   It's just so *normal*,
and wasn't the inclusion of odd elements the initial attraction?

Nice to know you all are here,

my first post so I will try my utmost not to annoy anyone!  I have been a

  Before I go I have to reply to a posting by a Mr. Chris Pardua...Yeah I

As an aside. . .

Many people on this list seem to be foaming at the mouth for lyric sheets.

I don't even own a CD player (horrors!), so I would advise anyone who is
still in vinyl mode (or has that capability) to scour used record stores.

I live in Kansas City, and at a local "used" record store I found:

2112, on vinyl, foldout, in original shrinkwrap: $6.00

People in the store gave me a wide berth due to my prominent neck veins,
but I was able to purchase it and leave without incident.

Many other Rush albums from the 70s/80s were there also, in the same con-
dition, and for the same price.  Even if you don't own a turntable, a
square foot of artwork is a gorgeous artifact to own.  According to my
ex-wife, the best thing about 2112 is the bulge in Alex's silk pants.

(That opinion is *definitely* not my own)

  winning a country music award based on a country acoustic version of
  "Cold Fire".  Since the first time I heard the song (one of the best on
  the CD.... tho I destest stand country rubbish), it had a country sound
  to it to me.  Did they (Rush) ever mention a country sound they were
  trying to obtain in the song?  The opening music, ie the guitar, of
  "Ghost of a Chance" also has a country sound.

No, I am not a lurker.  I have not just recently become a Rush fan, nor
have I been one since Geddy was born.  I have never been to a concert,
but I own bootlegs.  I have posted before, and I also realize that the
"country album" jazz was a joke.

If I remember correctly it was Geddy who said in response to someone
asking about "Part IV of the Gangster of Boats Trilogy" on Rockline, "It
was a JOKE.  We thought people would get it, but I guess not...  I guess
we also better admit that Neil is still a part of the band..."

But.... I digress.  On to the point of my post:

I don't know how many Rush fans are Catholic, but since I am, I feel I'll
share something with all who care to read my post.   I decided, for Lent,
that I would attempt to not listen to Rush at all.  Not on the radio, not
with a tape, CD, 8-track, or record.  Nada.

Well, I have made it three days; only 37 more to go.

	You most certainly know you are a Rush fan when you begin to
notice everyday noises and clicks and think that they sound like a Rush song.
	You may think this is far-fetched, but check it out:  I turned on
my portable CD player to listen to Hemispheres.  The player spins every
CD to get the track list and stuff, like most CD players.  Well, when I
put on Hemispheres, the CD player makes a "shk-shk-shk" noise which sounds
exactly like the intro to Cold Fire!  I did it three times just to make
sure, and it works.  I tell no lie.

Greetings to all the Rush fans out there!!

I've been a reader of NMS for awhile now and maybe once a year something in
this hits me or my wife (we both read this more than the local newspaper) in
the right way that I get up the gumption to send email from AOL land.  And
your "You know you're a Rush fan when..."  is a perfect example.  It's great,
it's like how many ways can you interweave the Boyz into your daily life?

Anyway, I was inspired to such a quote when I heard my wife mentioning how
Rush is coming out with another album eventually.

"You know you're a Rush fan when...

You hear about a Rush album eventually being released and you already start
getting excited about the prospects of a Rush concert.
OR
You use a "RUSH" stamp pad on all of the mail you send out." (Or did someone
mention one like that already?)

I hope everyone keeps them coming, I like the concept of waking up, working,
eating all three meals, and going to sleep with "Rushisms" floating through
my cerebellum.  Keep rockin'!!

Jon and all!

I know exactly the phenomenom to which you refer.   Just because Rush has
become a part of my identity to the point of fanaticism, doesn't mean I
expect every nitwit to have the capacity to appreciate them. Yet many will
take the opportunity to cut down a band who they know nothing about! I quit
defending them in High school. They know not what they talk about, so what's
the point?
    I am  especially amused when a person will criticize first that
"everything they do sounds the same" (a rediculous comment by itself) and in
the next breath "I don't like any of their new stuff, they changed too much."
 or something to that effect. Yes this has occured on several occasions.  I
just smile and shake my head.  What a relief to have TNMS! We know the

Ron and Corey,

I am a high school teacher, and have also found Rush, (lyrics, mostly, not so
much playing the songs) Useful when counseling students.  Of course I am not
really a counselor, but it is inescapable in this profession.  I run into
alot of youths who are unmotivated, depressed, etc. and they seem to be able
to relate to song lyrics at this time in their lives, just as I did (and
still do).  I have been known to search relentlessly through Rush lyrics  for
the most appropriate quote for a particular student.  It seems I always find
someting appropriate, even when I don't have anything imparticular in mind!
 (I feel a reference to "the Bible" coming on but I will resist the
temptation).
Maybe it's just because they were such an inspiration to me when I was in
High School.  Maybe it's better therapy for me than for the students I'm
"counseling". Any way...
Hope is epidemic
