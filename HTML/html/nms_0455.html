I was teaching this week, and there aren't enough hours in an Earth-day!

I'll try to get the admin. mail caught up by the time this goes out,

Hello fellow Rush Fans!

I am putting together a Rush laser light show at the Roger B. Chaffee
Planetarium in Grand Rapids, MI, to be shown this May - July.  It will
be one hour long and I've tried to choose songs that would appeal to
die-hard Rush fans, rather than just a "Greatest Hits" show.  It's just
your basic laser show you see in many planetariums, so I wouldn't drive
cross-country to see it, but then again it is Rush!  If anyone living near
here or visiting here at that time wants to see the show, drop me some
e-mail.  I'll put you on the list of out-of-staters who want to see the
show, and will send you more information.  If you mail me and I don't
reply, mail me again.  Our system can be unpredictable!

Incidentally, I know there is a Rush laser show right now at the Cranbrook
Institute of Science near Detroit, MI.  Anyone living near there may wish
to check that one out too.  I personally don't think it does the music
justice though, the people who made it weren't Rush fans.

        As my class went over the lyrics of Xanadu in class, my teacher
made a comment that hadn't occured to me before. Forgive me if this is
something you have heard already.

        The Xanadu(perfect society) in Coleridge's poem was a result of a
medication he took before writing it.  He supposedly woke up from
sleeping after taking the medication and found he had written the poem.
He was also deeply hooked on opium. If Kubla Khan was drug induced,  then
the Xanadu mentioned in his poem is the physical effect of the medication
on his creative mind.  In the RUSH version, when the narrator is looking
for Xanadu, this could be looked at as the ultimate high. At the end of
the song the narrator is trapped by the drugs( he is possibly addicted)
"Prison of the lost Xanadu."  My teacher interpretted it as an anti-drug
as opposed to pro-drug message. If one does not get addicted or harmed

I would like to post a congratulation to my roommate (although he doesn't
use a computer and probably would never see this anyway) for winning the
Powercuts contest to see RUSH.  We still don't know which venue he will
be attending, but I will post details when we get back.  The postcard
which he sent in to win was an enlarged photograph of a banner he painted
for the Oakland, California show.  It had a picture of a flying saucer
with the circle-star (pentagram) design on it shooting two "bones" (dice)
propelled by laser beams.  It was quite a piece of artwork; then again,
he's quite an artist.

If things work out correctly, you all may be seeing his artwork on the
next RUSH album cover.  I will keep you all informed.

BTW:  Did anyone catch the allusion to David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" at the
bottom of the credits on Roll The Bones?

Now it's dark.

<A NAME="455007">Subject:      Bandana</A>

Dear digital men,
I would like to say my opinion on why Neil is wearing bandana.  It's so
weird that there are some people saying Neil is going bald so he is
wearing bandana.  Any person who has a 10 sentences long knowledge on
Rush and Neil would never say something like that.  An individual like
Neil would never ever have a pshchological weakness to hide some physical
change like that.  As we all know this album touches subjects like chance,
destiny and fate and in daily life we have this people called gypsies and
bandana is one of their normal accessories.  Gypsies have a lot to do
with chance, destiny and fate, they even make money on other peoples
hopes, fears and psychological weaknesses by reading their horoscopes and
other stupid stuff.  So very obviously, the bandana on Neil's head is
just a metaphor for the main subjects he made clear on RTB album.

   Shane (Shane Faulkner), if you are reading this, please email me as
soon as possible, I've been trying to reach you for so long!

Since these songs were on their first single, released before the first
album, I think it's a good bet that they played them when they were still
doing clubs and bars. It would be interesting to know why, when they
thought these songs were good enough to release as a first single, they
left them off the first album, and didn't even play them when they toured in
support of the first album. (Even though they were still doing an occasional
"cover" such as "Bad Boy".)

Dear Rush-Heads,
     With all of the talk about the boyz using drugs, I thought that this might
be appropriate.  I recently talked to someone who had toured with Rush.  They
were with the catering service and they spent about 15 weeks with the boyz.  He
told me that they were great guys.  Then he mentioned, to my suprise, that he
had smoked opium with them several times.  Now, according to Visions, they have
smoked marijuana before, but OPIUM!?  That's getting a little more heavy duty.
I personally could care less but it is very interesting.

You mean they have never played the entire 2112 song live?  Gee,

And I coulda sworn they played Presto when I saw them on that tour
but I must be wrong...

Hey there, I have been a reader/subscriber for a couple of weeks now, but never
 found any thing of note to post, well, (obviously) I have now, so here goes:

1. I remember that when _Presto_ came out, Atlantic Records released an essay a
bout the album, by Neil.  It was published in a local music magazine in South F
lorida, and I just recently dug it up.  It is two pages long, and explains how
the band wrote the album, as well as Neil's interpretation of the three hands m
otif (BTW: I haven't seen this 3 symbolism on any lists yet) as well as the "Ro
ck Paper Scissors" game... He quoted a Zen Farmer in the explanation of "Rock P
aper Scissors" too, I believe... Is this a common article?  Or was it a rarity
that my local mag was lucky to publish? If it is common, well, then excuse me,
but if it is rare, then I will be glad to send it in to the NMS digest... Lemme
 know someone....

2. I was surprised to *not* see this question on either of the FAQL lists, so I
 ask it now:  Who is the kid on the RTB cover?

Hello everybody,

     I was just curious about the availability of the song "Battlescar".
The only place I've heard it is on my hometown radio stations 96.5 WCMF and
96.9 WGR (97 Rock).  Now that I'm in Dayton going to school, I never hear it :(
So, if anyone could tell me if it's just a single or if it appears on some
other album and possibly which record store chains might carry it, it would
make my life so much better.

I also saw Alex's son (I believe his name is Julian???) at both New Haven
and Nassau (for that matter, he was at Hartford in December as well).  He
certainly has a head of hair on himself.  From what I understand, he is
about 17 or 18 years old.

Has anyone received the brand new mailing from the Backstage Club?  Apparently
they note several of the new ly announced summer dates.

Can anyone confirm any dates at the beginning of June (i.e., Phoenix or Irvine
Meadows).

BTW, I was told that June 16th the boyz will return to the Maryland, Wash.DC
area to play Merriweather Post Pavillion.  Also, I heard a rumour that the
Star Lake Amph. date in Burgettstown (Pittsburgh) is now June 21st.  Any
confirmation on this???

If anyone has a copy of Primus from Dennis Miller, I would love to get a
copy.

Finally, GOAC was released as a cassette single here in the USA.  It is still
getting played on about 14 or 15 top 40 radio stations across the country and
it got a great review in the March 23rd edition of Billboard.

Thank you.

I got this out of the new CD releases list posted regularly
to alt.rock-n-roll:

>19 May *  Firehouse                       Hold Your Fire

GIVE ME A BREAK!  Don't these guys know that Rush has already
applied that title to a well done CD?  Will Rush get royalties
for the album :-?  I say we should all write BOTH bands and express
our dissatisfaction.  What do you think?  I say Firehouse is showing
little respect for rock and roll's past on this one.  I can picture
the front cover now: Some cheesy bimbo holding a torch or something
like that.

So...I was listening to CoS a few days ago, and I came up
with the strange idea that you could actually mosh to
Necromancer, The Fountain, etc.  Some of the songs remind me
of Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction playing suoer fast and
screaming out the lyrics.  (Imagine YYZ played by the
Ramones or Motorhead and you might get the same idea.)
Even the beginning and end of 2112 has a good moshability.
(I know that this is a Rush fan mail list and not a
heavy-metal list, but these are just curiosities I have in
my mind.  Any flames can be sent to either of the e-mail

Just got word that, June 14th is the date for Charlotte, NC.  The boyz will
be playing at the Blockbust Pavillion.  This is confirmed, although I am not
sure when tickets go on sale.

Later.

	Any recommendations about any particular Jane's Addiction,
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pixies, Souixe and the Banshees (spelling ?)
albums ? Also , has anyone heard the School of Fish album ?

	Sorry for this nonRush related banter, reply directly to
aahuja@eve.usc.edu .

	Thanks a heap.

	Also, any news about Rush's LA dates in June ? 95.5 KLOS in
LA announced some dates it seems, anybody get them ?

-Atul

P.S. Saw Primus in concert last Saturday at the San Jose State Events
Arena.. Awesome as usual. Fishbone opened. Bloody expensive tickets
--$25 .
