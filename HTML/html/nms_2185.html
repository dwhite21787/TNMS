Typically for many many home games this season "YYZ" is played just
prior to the pregame skate & warm-up session.

"Where's My Thing" is also played during the starting line-up
announcements.

"Limelight" has also been used as bumper music prior to face-offs.

During the pregame "YYZ' I notice many AIR DRUMMERS in the crowd. It's
neat to see all the arms flailing in unison.

Hello all--

Regarding the decrease in ticket sales on the Test For Echo Tour--I
remember the ticket price for the Test For Echo tour was nearly double
that of the Counterparts Tour. I only took one friend to the two T4E
shows I saw. But I picked up a few extra tickets on CP. Can't say for
sure if that was always the case, just my experience...

No.  Rush do not own "Le Studio" (It is privately owned).  I was just making
a comparison with Triumph who recorded many albums at their own Metalworks
Studio (Allied Forces, Never Surrender, Thunder Seven, Sport Of Kings &
Surveillance).

As Rush fans may know, starting with Permanent Waves, the band has utilized
"Le Studio" for many recordings : Moving Pictures, Grace Under Pressure,
Presto, Roll The Bone & Counterparts.

I had never really *liked* rock music of any type prior to Rush..  I mostly 
listened to classical music..  it was my freshman year of college, back in 
'94..  back when BBSes were still hip...  I checked out a BBS called 
"Rivendell".. I logged on because I figured it was Tolkien..  turned out to be 
Rush.. anyway, as I got to know the SysOp, I finally asked her, "So, what's 
a good album to check out?"  She suggested 2112...

I bought 2112 that weekend..  first time I popped it into the CD player back 
in the dorm..  It blew me away..  and that was just all the fancy synth 
effects..  

I drove my roommate nuts..  his only experience with Rush was when Geddy sang 
the Canadian national anthem at the World Series when Toronto played..

I listened to 2112 some 40 times continuously before my next paycheck that 
week..  then I bought MP..  again.. blown away..  again, listened to it a 
good 40 times..  it took me no more than three months to get the rest of the 
studio albums plus E...SL..  

Unfortunately, this was after Counterparts had already been through, so I 
missed a live show..  TFE was during finals and not in Jacksonville, so I 
didn't get to go..  I may die without seeing a live Rush show if they don't 
hang around for a little while.. <g>

Wow, this is the third time I've tried to send a post - previous two
have Cygnus-X1'd on me...

Anyways, I want to defend Ryan Whitaker from the barrage given him by
Rob Miceli. Ryan is an OK guy, a Rush Fan, and a provider of some of the
best Rush/DT etc boots out there. I have dealt with Scarred Records
several times and never had any reason to complain. I'm sure Ryan has a
perfectly legit explanation for a late delivery.

And anyway, four weeks is not that long to wait, especially given the
fiasco that was Prism Records. Some of us waited over a year for any
response at all, and I believe some are still waiting. BTW, Ryan has I
believe taken over some of Prism's backlog - an unenviable task, but I'm
sure Ryan will do a good job of it.

<A NAME="2185007">Subject: Each of us, a cell of awareness...</A>

I just wanted to take the opportunity to expound the virtues of Rush fans. 
I've been a fan since '78 or '79... I don't remember the exact date when I
first heard All the World's a Stage,
but growing up, it has always seemed rather difficult finding Rush fans
where I live.
We're a very rare breed indeed, it seems sometimes, and i'm very grateful to
have this forum
to talk about all things (and nothing to do with) Rush. 

The past four months of my life have been tumultuous, to say the least. I
haven't been very
productive, and i've had a hard time moving on with certain issues. (long
story short, my old 
girlfriend broke up with me on December 4th... i'm not very good with dates,
but that's one that
has been seared into my mind forever... funny how life is sometimes.) 
I've been lost in the darkness, so to speak... it's been very scary
sometimes. 

At any rate, whenever I see a message on here regarding anything to do with
where I live, I like
to email that person and test for echo, so to speak, just to say 'hi, you're
not alone, there ARE other
Rush fans here too!'

I had the good fortune to actually start a wonderful correspondence with a
REAL RUSH FAN (a really really
really good one at that too, one who actually talks about Rush whenever they
can and stuff, like me!)
and this person has been the ONLY one who actually said things to me that
actually made me feel good
about myself once again. Someone who clearly understands, accepts, and most
importantly, cares!
I finally met this person this past weekend, and for the first time in four
months, I was truly happy.
It has been a really good weekend... finally. I think ... no, I KNOW I'm
going to get through this now.
It didn't seem ironic to me that we were able to click right off the bat. I
never had any expectations other
than knowing that this is someone whom i'm naturally going to get along
with. It's so refreshing! It's very
exciting! These problems I have faced are now no longer problems that I
alone have had to deal with... 
My eyes have been opened, and i'm going to forever be thankful...

You know who you are... and I wanted to just say, once again... THANK YOU!

Just wanted to offer my defense of Ryan Whittaker and Scarred Records.  I
ordered a CD from Scarred about a year ago and within a week it was sitting
in my mailbox.  That's good service kids.  In his ordering screen it says if
you have problems contact him via e-mail.  I have contacted him via email
before (not for problems) and he promptly replied.

Well, I don't want to get any hopes up, but I did hear something...

A friend of a friend who has a band in Toronto recently booked some studio
time.  While doing so, the band noticed that Rush has the same studio
booked for the month of April.

That's all I know.  I don't know how much truth there is to that.

Cheers, all.

Hi peeps,

lines.

This one took my fancy.  I am not really big on lyrics, I must admit,
but I always love the "They shoot without shame...." part in
"Territories".  Great atmosphere in that song too, even though I am not
a big PW fan.

Take care all,

Taking the bait on Rush intro's.....

1982.  My brother returns from University (Hull, UK) with a compilation
tape made by his head-banging friends in his digs.  First song was SoR and
by the time I got to New World Man (end side 1), I was hooked.  After that,
there never seemed to be ENOUGH Rush albums to buy!!!

begining of April...start checking the "Rush Fanline" at
(905)923-5855.(call after hours so you don't get the receptionist). Good
news should be out then indeed..and please don't pesker me to say

Also, Rush mgr, would you be interested in trading links from our
official, and only, www.tomcochrane.ca site? We have ALOT of Rush fans
coming through. please email James@tomcochrane.ca if you wish. (You DO
know that Tom and Alex are great friends...and that this list and your

Spock's Beard is awesome!!!  They are one of the best bands I've
heard in the last 3 years.  Their latest studio release "The Kindness
Of Strangers" has been in my car tape player for over a year.  I just
don't get tired of it.  The new one is supposed to come out this week!

There is definitely going to be tour in May.  The dates/cities were 
released last week on Thoughts, the SB mailing list.  Email me if you
want them.  I'm going up to Bethlehem, PA in June to see them at the
NEARFest prog-rock festival.

Other cool prog-rock bands worth checking out are Salem Hill and 
Mastermind.  Mastermind is a lot like Rush, Salem Hill more like 
Genesis.  Check out "Under The Wheels" on Mastermind IV, it reminds
me a LOT of the song "Test For Echo".

Spock's Beard fan over here!  I discovered them about a year ago, just 
when I was getting into PROG in general.  I like them for many of the 
same reasons I like Rush.  Prog-rock with an emphasis on the ROCK.  I 
like Genesis and Yes and Gentle Giant and all that fun stuff, but they 
just don't rock like The Beard, or Rush.

I hope they really do come to Milwaukee [and/or Chicago] this summer 
like they say they're going to!  Hey, new album out March 23.  That's 
tomorrow!

Hello in Rushland,
	I haven't posted in a while, so I thought I would put my 2 cents in on a
few subjects.  
First, I get goosebumps any time I hear a Rush intro in my hometown. I was
sitting in a bar (drinking a coke) when I heard the intro to Freewill off
of DS. I was so excited to hear a Rush song that I almost fell off the
barstool. I used to hear TS a lot in the 80's and I would actually sing
along (not even realizing who Rush was, cripes I wasn't even a teenager.)
I guess that was my intro to Rush, but I don't really count it as such. In
1992 I was on a band-trip (high school marching band) to Cape May, and one
of the drummers was playing RTB on the stereo. He then played 2112 and I
was hooked. I ran out after the band trip and snagged myself a copy of
2112. I didn't get anything more, though, until I went to college and my
boyfriend reintroduced me to the band. (Even though you're probably not
reading this, I'll thank you anyway, Dave.)
	Hmm... the Ultimate Peart Lyric... Hmm... 
I don't believe in the stars or the planets, 
Or angels watching from above, 
But I believe there's a ghost of a chance we can find someone to love, 
And make it last. 
(Actually the entire chorus to Ghost of a Chance.)
	Okay, this is embarrassing, but my first album (cassette) that I ever
owned was Michael Jackson's Thriller. I was nuts over MJ at the time for
some unknown reason. (Probably the same reason I liked NKOTB in middle
school.)
	As for the anality of the fans, Everyone is anal about something. Let it
be. Also, being the *best* at something is purely a subjective, relative
state. I was the *best* oboe player in my high school, but when I went to
Regional band, I was the second-to-worst oboe player there. 
Okay, this post is getting to be too long. If you read it this far, thanks
for the attention. :)

Love, Peace, and Rush to all!

Hello people..   I sent out an email apologizing to RYAN at SCARRED MUSIC...

If you noticed I can't type for shit, lots of spelling mistakes...
oh well at least I'm happy.. :)

You know I'm still receiving emails about that.  I think maybe we should give 
it a rest.  And for the fan who called me  a jerk, don't ever call me that 
again..  Ryan had a right to not you..

I think I made Ryan some extra profit with all of what happened.
So let's just say it all turned out for the best....

RUSH MGR.. i'm going to release an interview done just a few weeks ago at 
Geddy's House..  A friend of mine did the interview and I have a copy of the 
un-edited version.
Nothing really positive came out of this interview,  but I'll biref 
description of Geddy's lifestyle.
 
His home is very large on the inside but doesn't seem that way on the 
outside.  He lives in a very classy area central Toronto.
When someone comes over he always offers them paper shoes.
Not slippers but paper shoes.    Who know they could be made
from Gucci or something..  

He as we all know, is a wine freak.  Loves wine like ALex.  
He has a den which is locked up with all RUSH stuff..  he didn't wanna walk 
in that room because  "It brings back memories.."

has a bang & Olsun stereo system.  Anyway's that's all I really know..
Rush MGR get a hold of me it's best I fax it to you..

<A NAME="2185027">Subject: OMYGAWD! A New Thread & A Response...</A>

OMYGAWD! Rob Miceli, in his apology to Ryan "Scarred Records" Whitaker,
finishes off with a bit of Rush news:
"things are looking good.  They asked Geddy if they would play at the
NEW Air Canada Centre...  He said yes."
This is true? Could it be that the rumors Rush's demise have been
greatly exagerated? This is great news (if true). Rob, aren't you the
guy that hangs at the Orbit room? Keep us posted.

A new thread! Brian innocently asks, "For tourists: How much fun did you
have in Toronto?" Well, I had a great time. I was there for the Canadian
International Marathon last October. I photographed all the Rushy sites;
i.e. Massey Hall, Danforth/Pape, etc. What's funny is that I
photographed the Parliment bldg. (cover of MP) DURING the marathon. I
brought one of those disposable cameras with me. The marathon finished @
Parliment, so in essence, when we finally were going up the street
toward the bldg., I was DYING. I was in pain. I was tired. I was angry.
But, when I saw the bldg., all that I could think of was, "Gotta get a
couple of good shots of that bldg.!" How's that for dedication? I really
enjoyed my time in Toronto. I would like to go back on a longer trip.

Ike had this to say about opening bands,
        ...we did have Primus in Pensacola for the RTB tour...  They did
*not* win over the crowd, to say the least.
        Don't give me any of that "trash-the Southerners" crap,
either... it just wasn't a good show.  The two biggest
        hands they got was for the bass riff from Cygnus, which Les
dropped into a time-stop;  and when Rush's
        roadies carried a bound-and-gagged Les Claypool and dropped him
in the middle of the stage in the middle
        of a Rush jam (I think it may have been CTTH).
Man, on the CP tour, when Primus opened in Mpls., they had the crowd
rocking. I mean, the crowd was really into it. I kid you not, people
were mildly moshing up front during Primus. What was great was that this
energy caried over into the Rush show. People were going nuts in the
first 20 rows (where I was). Of the 3 Rush concerts (I know, that ain't
many) that I've seen, this one was the best, and I can't help but think
that this is due, at least in part, to Primus. Oh, Ike, I DO like the
last part of your quotation. Pretty funny.

<A NAME="2185028">Subject: Intro to Rush and First Album</A>

Hello all!
	It's real interesting to see all of your first experiences to Rush.
The first time I heard Rush was when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I walked
into my brother's room and I heard La Villa Strangiato on the record player.
When he bought a CD player a few years later,  I would go in there and make
tapes of all of his Rush cd's and go listening to them on my cassette
player.
	The first album I heard all the way through was Permanent Waves and
I was totally hooked then. Natural Science was by far my favorite song on
the album and I was so excited to see it on DS. It is probably the highlight
of all 3 Cd's.
	A couple of years back I drove from Tampa, FL to NY and I brought
all of my Rush CD's with me (excluding Live albums) and I listened to them
in consecutive order. It's amazing how much Rush has changed over time, but
yet continued to make amazing music.

Dear Rush folk,

I would like to rise to Ryan's defense as well. I've had dealings with Scarred
and Ryan and have never been disappointed in my service. Please remember that 
Ryan is a poor college student like many of you out there. Trying to balance 
his busy school life and Scarred is no east task I'm sure.

     And no, like Will Collier, I've never met Ryan. I have had several business
transactions, and shared emails with Ryan, and never been concerned he was
scamming me. I have always gotten what I was promised by him. Ryan is a credit 
to us Rush fans. He does a great job, and can be trusted. Any questions??? 
Please feel free to email me privately in regards to this matter.

     Robert it was big of you to appologize publicly to Ryan,  you seem like a
pretty smart guy. We all can be reactionary, but then we are often left with a 
bad taste later. It is the lesson we learn that counts us worthy oof 
forgiveness >........ or not.

    Down off soapbox.

    I hope the everyone is right about an upcomming DVD/Video. That would be too
cool. I have some news too!

    Neil was over to dinner last night and promised a new Rush album with 15 new
songs, two of which will be 15 minutes +,  by next weekend. He would not 
elaborate on the title since they have not written any songs yet. He did let 
it slip that he will be signing lead on one song, and also a duet with guest 
vocalist David Gilmour on another! They will tour starting 4/29, another 
evening with Rush since it went over so well laast tour. This time it will 
be a five hour show, kind of a Rushapoluza thing. There will be a contest 
will be conducted in each city. The person who brings the most canned food 
items will get to sit in Neil's kit with him during the show! He might even 
give you a stick to bang around with and even let you trigger a few effects. 
I'm Psyched!!!

   The new millenia is looking up!

I enjoy reading/studying philosophy as much as I can outside of work. This
is an interesting concept. However, don't these extremes in tensions have
to hold to the laws of logic, ie, The law of Non-contradiction, etc? You
can reply to me off-list Deborah if Rush-mgr feels this doesn't belong in
this forum. Thanks.

Now for some minor Rush-content...crossing my fingers on the DS Video. The
CD has not left the CD player since the day it was bought! Absolutely
awesome!

Hi Brian,

back in 1995 I stayed at a hostel called Karabanow Guest House and Tourist
Rooms, a really quaint 18 room guesthouse. Owners are relocated Russians.
Its location is on Bloor and Spadina, 6 blocks away from Yonge and also not
very far from the Moving Pictures building. The people were very nice and
the rooms clean. Good coffee shop just around the corner, metro station
there as well. Phone: (416) 923 4004.

Do check out The Orbit Room especially when The Dexters are playing. Which
reminds me: Back then Internet wasn't very big yet. I'd phoned up a few
weeks earlier to see who or what was playing and happened to talk to Tim
Notter, co-owner (it was 10 AM in TO due to the time difference). So in TO I
went to the place, first night in of course, and at the bar asked whether
Tim would be in. They said yes, but who's asking.. So I tell them that I'm
from Holland and on TNMS  etc etc. Guy says so, you're that internet guy
from Holland! Turns out Tim'd been flabbergasted that I had called, from
overseas, and told everybody about it. Needless to say I had a good time
after that...

Have fun.

According to my experiences with Scarred I totally have to agree 
with that. I suppose it was Rob`s first order of footware via the net.
Believe me Rob four weeks is nothing and I will not start talking

I totally have to agree with that, too. I discovered Spock`s Beard
last year. After listening to "The good don`t last" I went out and 
bought everything they have released. I saw them in concert last
October in the Zeche, Bochum and they just blew me away!!
You know Rush always was my favourite band and they will ever
be, but life is different after you have experienced the Beards.
Check these guys out. They`re worth it.

Ummm...lessee...
1) During the interlude in "Turn the Page" when Geddy says "We
disengage...We turn the page..." Specifically, the little synthesizer
riff after that. That is SO PERFECT!
2) Virtuality's intro. I was in a pool hall late at night with a
couple of friends and I saw TFE in the jukebox. I put in a buck (for
three songs), and the first song I picked was Virtuality. It was so
loud and powerful it almost literally blasted me off my feet.
3) Ged's lyricless improvised singing in the DS version of TSOR amazes
me.
4) Alex's guitar solo in the DS version of Discovery. A perpetual
reminder as to why that man is my primary influence.
5) Analog Kid Solo, both live and studio. Enuff said.
6) The DS intro to LTTA. I don;t know why, but I love that synth.
7) Double Agent. The whole song.
8) The part in Prime Mover that starts with "I set the clouds in
motion..." and goes through that part that's just synth, drum and vocal.
9) The guitar solos to Dreamline and Roll the bones both.

hey all,

Pat Berry nailed it in his post to #2184 when he said that one really couldn't 
ever get bored with Rush.  

Yeah, I got bored with RTB and didn't listen to it for several months, but it 
was easily replaced with 15 other Rush albums.  Eventually its time came 
around again and now I really have to say, most heretically, that

WHERE'S MY THING is the best Rush instrumental!

Maybe its because their music is simply so damn interesting, so filled with 
textural, textual, and sonic nuances, (and sheer power and beauty) that 
there's always something there (to remind me) to draw your attention, no 
matter if its the 8 millionth time you've tingled to "Limelight"

cheers,
