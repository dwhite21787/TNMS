    I just read the Rolling Stone reviews of about 5 Rush albums that
    are posted on the FTP server.  They really p*ssed me off.  It seems
    like the critics are just out to stomp all over Rush.  Almost every
    review referred to Geddy's "shrill" voice and how he should
    "control" it.  The critics also seemed SCARED of Neil's powerful
    lyrics- it seems that they would enjoy the lyrics off Rush's first
    album better.

    I just don't get it.  How could Rush be so popular with reviews like
    those?  One of them even said "One Rush album should be enough for
    anybody (preferably Moving Pictures)."  Are we (the readers of NMS)
    just weird mutants?

    I think the critics just have their heads up their a**.

Hello again fellow list members.  With the summer approaching us and the
school year for many of the members coming to a close, a lot of us will
lose Internet access and our accounts over the summer months.  For some
it might be a needed break, for others, I guess you could find yourself
craving for some NMS and Rush news over the summer with the new album
on the horizon.  Here's some help for those of you who still wish to get
the NMS over the  summer months but have no means to do so.

The alternative is to find a public access Unix system in your area,
apply for an account and re-subscribe to the list.  Briefly, public
access Unix systems exists in many states and are generally connected to
the Internet in some way (usually they are fed via uucp by bigger hosts
actually on the Internet), and its users can send and receive email from
the Internet as well as read some USENET news.  A majority of these
sites are free! (some do charge small fees - a few bucks a month)  Many
have smart mailers on them so you can send email just like you regularly
do : mail rush-request@syrinx.umd.edu  to resubscribe for example.

If some of you are interested in finding out more about this, please
feel free to drop me a line (jlang@syrinx.umd.edu) and I will help you
locate a Public Access Unix site near you.  For those of you familar
with ftp, you can get a copy of the public access Unix machines from
mars.ee.msstate.edu in the ~ftp/files/Tex.techie/nixpub file.

Hopefully, some of you won't "really lose" your access to NMS if you
choose to go this route.  If you are going to mail me about it, please
be sure to include your area code (IMPORTANT!) so I can locate a system
near you.

Thanks.

To take this discussion to the extreme, what would Rush sound like without
any of them? Just think... the band breaks up, but they're still under contract
for another album. Neil sends them a blank tape, and says that the silence
represents the new minimalistic philosophy of the band. He tells them that
the fans will understand his meaning, and will love the album, especially
since it will contain over 70 minutes of "music" on it. Hey, anything's
possible!

(Sorry, my brain's sort of in that fried finals mode.)

Hey there!  I'm a new subscriber and wouldn't have posted so soon if I
hadn't understood that there's an apparent lack of material on TNMS
lately.  Anyway I'm glad I'm on the list now and really wish I was
earlier.  But what can you do.

Actually what I'd really like to know is if there are any more of you guys on
the list who go to Johns Hopkins (like I do) that I don't already know of.  It's
always good to meet more fans of the Big Three.

[ See my note in the administrivia section.                       :rush-mgr ]

Hopefully, I'll have more interesting topics to discuss on TNMS later if my
mind doesn't dry up after finals.  So until then, Adios!

I think you've summarized Alex's stylistic progress pretty well.

For myself, I was never an enormous fan of his Jimmy Page-esque
solos from the early albums.  I first started to really like his
solo work on parts of the AFTK album: specifically, the solo to
ATFK itself is like an early precursor to the 'quirky' stuff he
would start doing much later, and the solo near the end of Xanadu
(which never fails to put me on the floor) shows the first signs
of melodic control which he exhibited more of on the following
albums.

I guess I like his slow, extremely melodic work the best.  But
the quirky (great description) solos are close behind, especially
really odd solos like that in "Chain Lightning".  It takes real
courage to branch out and try stuff that different in a solo, and
somewhere along the line Alex has apparently gained a level of
courage that most rock guitarists never approach.  In fact, I
think that's what makes Alex a guitarist to be reckoned with.
Technically he's not the world's most skilled guitarist (though
don't get me wrong; he's still in the upper strata, particularly
with his rhythm work).  But he's trying things that no one else
in the field is.  He's pushing the edges of the envelope.

> Where is he going, musically?

I guess only Alex knows.  B-)

> What can we expect on the next album?

Something good, I'll warrant.  B-)

<A NAME="232008">Subject:  Comments and questions</A>

A couple of questions for you all:

        Has anyone noticed Neils repeated use of the color red in several
songs?  Any idea why Neil seems to be partial to that color?

        I have heard several rumors about the education of the members of
Rush, everything from high school dropouts to Phd's from MIT.  Can anyone
fill me in on the education of the Boyz?

[ With sources, if possible; we can get it in the FAQL then.      :rush-mgr ]

        The suggested album title "Throwing the Stones"  would certainly
be a title that could be jumped on by the bible thumping Rush-is-the-
anti-christ group.  But then I suspect that Neil recognized this double
meaning also. . .  his penchant for doulble meanings in lyrics is well
documented.

To Terry Stedman: Neat Logo!

In response to Brett's question about meeting Neil:
        I have a great deal of respect for Neil and RUSH.  I also respect
Neil's desire not to be worshipped.  I suppose that if I ever meet him I
will say something like "I really respect your work.  Keep it up."  I do
not think it would be proper for me to voice any feelings, even positive
feelings, about the guys personally because I don't know them at all. All
I know is their work and I would choose only to comment on that.  I view such
things as autographs as rather pointless.  People who collect autographs
have bought into the packaged bigger-than-life persona that record companies
and movie makers try to sell to the public.  It isn't reality, as Neil
commented in his interview a couple of years ago.  (see TNMS about 5 issues
back).

Strong disagreements are always welcome.  Flames are discouraged.

To TNMS mgr:  Good work and a tip of the hat!

<A NAME="232009">Subject: 1984????</A>

I really seem to remeber the show in question was 1986, not 1984.
It would have been really tough for Territories to have been the
lead in to that show (Territories, mind you, not Mystic Rhythms)
if it were 1984, considering the two above mentioned songs weren't
released until late 1985..... Anyone????    Just a little time
inconsistencies.

As far as other Rush blurbs, I hear working man, at the 'noon time
blocks' on  a Buffalo radio station.  I also heard the last chord of
Chain Lightning as a part of a station blurb and really get a little
ticked, because I actually think that they are going to play it, and
then don't do it.

I have seen at least four different Max Webster CD's here at the
Record Theater here on UB's campus.  They are about normal Cd price.

I certainly can't wait for the next album/tour.  I'll probably get to
three or four shows again.  (Toronto,Buffalo,Rochester, and maybe one
more)  It is cool being here within 80 miles of three concert sites.

I honestly didn't know that it was common knowledge that Big Money is
played tuned to F#. I've always played it in straight E and have never had any
problems. Are we talking about a live version by any chance? The harmonics are
still possible in E and E matches the tape version perfectly. My brother plays
bass really well and never has any problems playing it in E. Maybe you have a
fast CD/tape/record player!!

It's been a while since I last posted....

	To the person who was asking about the second chord in Fly By
Night, I think I have the answer- but see if you agree that this is the
first chord:

	E   A   D   G   B   E

	X   X   O   -   -   -       (1 fr.) )
                    *   _   *       (2 fr.)
         (3 fr.)

X = Do not play string;  O = Open string  * = Fingering

This chord is a simple D chord.  OK?

Here's how I play the second chord, (it *sounds* right, when listening)

	E   A   D   G   B   E

	X   X   X   -   -   -       (1 fr.)
		    *   -   -       (2 fr.)
		        *   *       (3 fr.)

So really, all you are doing is moving (or adding) a finger on the high
E string to the 3rd fret.  Does this help?

	And one other thing:   If   *I*    could meet the band, I would
ask Neil/Ged/Alex:

	1)  What the hell is the time signature for Superconductor?

	2)  How the hell do you play it??

<A NAME="232013">Subject: How old is the NMS?</A>

Hey rush-mgr, according to my brief extrapolation the NMS has been out for
about 2 years now - is this about right? I've been reading the NMS since
issue 170, and I have this sudden burning urge to ask questions like,

 - when did the NMS start?
 - what gave you the idea to start the NMS in the first place?
   (other mailing lists, or all your own idea? Did anyone encourage/
   attempt to discourage you from starting it?)
 - how many (do you know?) members are still reading the NMS that have been
   reading it since it started?

Many new (or relatively new) members on this list might like to hear a story
of how it all began. I would anyway. Any chance? You might wish to put some
notes in the FAQL, come to that.

BTW, who is the oldest member on our list (age)? And how long have you been
listening to RUSH? Come on, own up!:)! Is there anyone on the list who
saw their first concert? Where was it, and what did they play?

More! More! More!! And Details!! I want Details!! 8]

<The All Seeing I>
Iieee! The NMS! The dark goat of the woods with a thousand rush quotes!

[ Ok, I'll try to keep this short.  The NMS came into embryonic being in
  the fall of '89.  It evolved through various (sometimes painful) in-
  carnations to reach it's current place.  If you check out the back issues
  of the NMS #98 & #99, you'll find the two-part first anniversary issue.
  This contains a history of the list, and some info on the original members.
  This also answers your second question, and the third question will be
  (eventually) answered by the poll I'm currently considering.  As for age
  of members, the survey will hopefully answer this; I can tell you that
  we have at least one or two members who have crossed that big 3-0 mark,
  and I'm hot on their heels.  :-)  Lastly, a list member did post some-
  thing about seeing an old show from one of the first couple of tours,
  but I'll let them tell the story (if they want).

As for Rush working with Mr Big years ago. As far as I know
(And don't quote me on this ) Mr Big have only been around for a few
years.

Does anyone read the Books of William Gibson?
        Don't know why but last night whilst listening to Signals
I thought that I could see a relationship between the song
Digital Man and Gibson's Book "Neuromancer"
references to 'Zion and Babylon' etc
Both are places in the Neuromancer book.

Then again this could be the deranged ramblings of my mind.
Then again it could be a new topic _ Shock Horror _

Any way Chew that one over for a while

I don't know how serious of a consideration this is but let me get my

by and contributed to only by

a) die-hard fans
b) people who are VERY interested in learning more about the band
c) people who already know a lot about the band
d) all of the above

If the NMS "goes public" as a newsgroup, there will be flames about what a
great band Bon Jovi is and how Neil couldn't play his way out of a wet paper
bag compared to ______.  You get the picture.

We true RUSH fans don't need this kind of noise interferring with our e
electronic adorations.  The list remains open to anyone with an internet
account (back me up on this mgr.)  This means only folks who are real

There is now anonymous ftp access available on Syrinx.  The network
address to ftp to is:

    syrinx.umd.edu       or       128.8.2.114

When you've connected, userid is "anonymous", password is <your userid>.
Once you've successfully logged on, change directory (cd) to 'rush'.

There is also a mail server available (for those unable or unwilling to
ftp).  For more info, send email with the subject line of HELP to:

    server@ingr.com

These requests are processed nightly.  Use a subject line of MESSAGE to
