Caress of Steel on the radio? Believe it or not, I did hear Lakeside
Park here locally on a harder rock station that plays Rush on rare
occasions. Probably a highlight of my life :)

If it wasn't for Hold Your Fire, I'd not have ever gotten in to Rush.
I had gotten the first live album and not liked it, but I got HYF and
slowly grew to love it. There are some GREAT songs on it!!! No one can
say that Mission, Turn the Page, Force 10, Time Stand Still, and such
aren't great songs. They're not the Fountain of Lammewhatever, but
they're great. And wonderful *live* numbers.

Of course, I like most of the songs on Roll The Bones! And I like the
older stuff. My problem is that I can't get too much music -- I like
to listen to all kinds of it, and good bands are good no matter what
format their songs take.

The Rap: hey, Rush is *PROGRESSIVE*, remember? Anyway, if they didn't
try something new occasionally, they might as well quit. The rap is
certainly lyrically more intelligent than most rap lyrics. You need
something occasionally different. It isn't "rap" anyway as much as
speaking in rhyme, poetry.

Flame wars erupt like dormant volcanoes awakening:

About the grammar/spelling: written communication is facilitated by
clarity. If people are trying to puzzle out what you're trying to say
through all the mistakes, it severely detracts from your point. Even
one mistake makes you look illiterate at worst or lazy at best to a
reader. (Sorry, but that's true. That's not an opinion.) Sure, TNMS is
not a resume, but you can run a spell checker and then proofread your
post before mailing. Use a text editor to compose your message. Use
the 'look' utility if you are on a UNIX system. VMS systems with TPU
have slews of aids. Have a dictionary handy. Get a pocket dictionary.
It never ceases to amaze me how many errors there are in posts to
mailing lists and Usenet, especially considering the bulk of the net
is composed of *college students* who ought to be proficient in basic
grammar and spelling.  (Don't colleges have entrance essays and
required freshman language courses anymore?  Mine does!)

The biggest problem on the net is "its" and "it's" -- I can't
*believe* no one knows the difference. "Its" is posessive, "it's" is a
contraction.  Posessive: "Hold Your Fire is a great album because of
its diversity of songs." Contraction: "It's great to be a Rush fan."
Their, they're, there and other homonyms are big problems. Spelling
isn't that much of a problem, for some reason. Maybe spell checkers.
Spell checkers will *not* point out incorrect usage.

One of the worst Geddy Lee imitations I have ever experienced was when I went
toa Karoakie (Sorry, I don't know the spelling) show at my school.  They
had only one RUSH song (Tom Sawyer), and the guy who was singing it was AWFUL!!

I have NEVER heard anyone sing that tune that low (Were talking baratone voice

	The longest time before Geddy starts singing? Well that would
probably be 2112, but since the Overture is a seperate part, let' snot
consider that. The candidates then are: Cygnus X-1, Jacob's Ladder, Camera
Eye, Hemispheres(first section). My guess... Cygnus X-1. Is someone going
to check on all this and post the answers? I'm too lazy.
	I have another little quiz for y'all: what was the last song not
written by either Lee or Lifeson or Lee/Lifeson? i.e. the last song on
which Neil didn't contribute? My guess... Chemistry (1982).
	Other thoughts and questions: is there a collection with RtB
videos? I haven't seen them yet! Is there a Signals disc that has been
re-mastered?

RUSH CASSETTE BUREAU NEWS!

Hi, folks, it's me, Beezus.  There's a new RCB policy that maybe some of you
may enjoy hearing about:  You no longer need to provide an initial recording
in order to recoup whatever you'd like from the RCB catalogue.  That's right,
kiddies!  The RCB is, and sort of always was, a Rush clearinghouse and
archival base for those "rare" and "imported" Rush recordings that are just so
gosh-darn expensive and risky to buy.  We want to pass the savings onto you!

E-mail me, beezus@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu, if you'd like to have the latest RCB
catalogue e-mailed to ya'.  It's about eleven recordings long now.

THE "RAP":  It's great!  I laughed my fool head off when I heard it for the
            first time.  Granted, it's more of a spoken-word dialogue than a
            representation of what we're all used to hearing the Beastie Boys
            put out every four years or so, but it's still pretty damn silly
            to hear in the middle of a Rush song.  IMHO, I would've enjoyed
            hearing John "But He's NOT Pining!" Cleese do it.

THE REST:   I had hope for the Astros, but now I'm not so sure.

            "The Jerky Boys" CD is a must-have!  I procured "boot" copies of
            some of those calls two years ago, and I must say that it's great
            to hear Saul Rosenburg and Frank Rizzo in the clarity that CD
            technology offers.

            "Red Lenses" is still one of the greatest Rush compositions ever.

Enough for now!

We've all seen the "best guitar solo" thread, so now it's time for
the "worst guitar solo" thread.  I've never really thought about it
until this morning when I popped COS in my car's tape deck.  The
end of the Necromancer has to be the clumsiest guitar solo I've ever
heard.  So clumsy, in fact, that it reminds me of me.  :)

Anyone else have any thoughts?

annoying I'm sure to see a subject line that simply says
"TNMS Issue #blah blah" (or whatever it says).  PLEASE USE MEANINGFUL

In  05/20/93 - The National Midnight Star #684
there was a post from Moon Roach which contained the following:

Now typos (typographical errors) and misspellings are one thing, (BTW,
I'm all for corrections as I think we all should be in a continuing
effort to better our grammar and vocabulary), BUT to misquote the very
artists that are the subject of this unique newgroup? Come on! The
lyrics were available via FTP even as you were posting that message.

Well, I don't want to sound too harsh. I know we all make mistakes.
But as time goes on and I get more and more information from various
newsgroups on the net, I begin to appreciate the really well written
posts.  IMO one must think twice about just how many people
will be taking time out of their day to read this stuff.  It may only
take a minute or two write, but since thousands of people (possibly
thousands, maybe more, who knows??) read it, it is seriously worth the
time to double check our writings before we post.

Please, this need not develop into a full-fledged discussion or
thread, but if everyone just puts in a little effort, the results
should be obvious in the *much* more interesting and enjoyable
discussions about our mutually appreciated and uniquely inspiring
super trio - RUSH!

<A NAME="685011">Subject: rush mods, HYF, etc.</A>

Moon Roach <saallena@ultrix.uor.edu> asked if there were any Rush mods.
Yes, there are a few. I have some of the mods including The Trees. If I
have time and I remember, I will try to send them FTP to the syrinx
anonymous ftp in the rush directory.

    I want to put in my support for HYF. I think HYF is a great album. Sure
it is not the same style as some of the older Rush, but it is still a very
good album. Also, I would like to say that GUP is probably my favorite Rush
album. Different people like Rush for different reasons, they are a very
diverse band. There is no need to slander any of there albums or insult the
people who prefer one album over another.

    As for digitizing rush songs using a SoundBlaster, it is possible.
However, you must realize that for a good sampling of songs, the resulting
files would be rather large (10-20 MB). This in itself is not a big problem
since many people (myself included) have tape drives with 120 MB tapes
which can be used to archive the files (tapes are about $20 each). I would
be willing to do this except at the moment I do not have a stereo (the
quality of the sampling would be dependent on the quality of the analog
signal provided).

<A NAME="685012">Subject: GUP, HYF, PW & S</A>

Just wanted to second DOVE JAMES BRIAN's positive comments about these
wonderful Rush albums.  One of the things I love about the band (and
BTW this can also be said of my other fave Queensryche) is the way they
never cease to grow and change.  Each new album explores an exciting new
musical direction.  The only quality they all share is excellence.
Basically I see Rush as having two major periods, pre-Signals and post-
Signals (I could also be convinced that MP is the dividing point), and
I love them both for different reasons.  PW is probably my favorite
post-Signals album, but I also really like HYF and GUP.

As for Rich Kellerman's statements about the "Psuedo poppish"(sic) nature
of HYF, frankly I don't see how anyone who calls themself a Rush fan could
believe that they are CAPABLE of writing anything because they think it
will be a 'hit'.  As far as I'm concerned, the musical integrity of the
three gentleman is beyond reproach.

Rich asked for comments about his post, here's mine... you're welcome
and encouraged to state your opinions, but I would suggest you refrain
from insulting people who disagree with them, it only makes you look
childish and closed-minded.

Yes, Neil Peart has been influenced by Manu Katche' of Weather Report.  He
mentioned this in his last Modern Drummer interview.  A brief list of his
influences includes: Phil Gould (Level 42), Stewart Copeland (Police), Keith
Moon (The Who), Gene Krupa (of big band fame), Michael Giles (King Crimson),
Bill Bruford (Crimson, Yes, Earthworks), Buddy Rich, and Alex Acuna (Weather
Report, studio cat).  Aimee Mann has just released her first solo album, and
it's receiving some decent airplay on eMpTyV and WIQB here in Ann Arbor.
Personally, her music is not all that wonderful, but it looks like she
might hit it big.  WIQB followed up her single "I Should've Known" by playing
"Time Stand Still" to make it a double dip of Aimee.  For Steely Dan fans,
Donald Fagan has a new solo album coming out next week and it features most
of the cats from Steely's past sessions.

In response to a couple days ago - someone asked what else Terry Brown has

He produced Max Webster's 1977 LP "High Class in Borrowed Shoes" - an

I'm not sure what else he did, though.

Weather Report is a fusion (kind of,) jazz group from the late seventies (don'
t know if they're still around.)  My brother, a jazz musician from North Texas
State University (GO EAGLES!) listened to them a lot in high school and
college.  From what I remember of them, they were pretty good, not that silly
pop-jazz you hear from the likes of Spiro Gyra or The Manhattan Transfer.
This stuff was *real* jazz.

P.S. Did you know the rock group, The Eagles got their name from North Texas
State U.'s mascott, an eagle?  Yep!  Don Henley's from East Texas too.  (I *
think* maybe Joe Walsh is too, but I may be wrong...)

You're absolutely right, Rich!  Hold Your Fire is unfortunately *the*
penultimate POP album of our generation!  It just makes me sick that the band
sold out for the Big Wedge and the "Top 100" airplay on the easy-listening
radio stations.  Songs like "Force Ten" and "Prime Mover" are so mellow that
they always remind me of "Careless Whispers" by Wham.  And "Time Stands
Still" sounds like a Til Tuesday song or something - what's up with that?
Plus, I *hate* the two power ballads, "Mission" and "Second Nature", with
heir puppy-love lyrics -- we get enough of that from Bon Jovi and Def Leppard.
And what about "Lock and Key", which is all about *sex* of course, and
the former Billboard's "Number #1" and Grammy winner song "Tai Shan" ---
just what was the band thinking of when they wrote that trash?  Also,
musically, the songs are atrocious!  I'm sure all of Geddy's bass lines
were just sampled from old Jackson Five hits!  And what's with the drum
machine?  Was Neil trying to be like Phil Collins on this album?  And
where was Alex?  I can't hear a single guitar riff on the whole album?
Is Alex dead?

Compare every song from "Hold Your Fire" to "Lakeside Park" from
Rich's favorite album, "Caress of Steel", and you'll wish that Rush had
never left its trash-speed-metal phase... Damn, that song is *wild*!
And the lyrics to that song about baldness are just *MIND BOGGLING*!!!

Rich Kellerman, *you* are the greatest music critic in the history of rock.

If I'm not mistaken Peter Erskine played drums with WP in the early '80s.  I
have
a WP tape from '82 (self-titled, features Dara Factor I and 2, Volcano For
Hire, etc) and I think he  played on that album. If I'm not
mistaken this was the last WP album
that Jaco played on before he was killed in '83.  Can anyone verify this?

HYF is a great album, much better than POW, IMO.  Open Secrets is a great
tune (listen to Ged's bass in the intro and you know why).  Mission is such
a beautiful song is gives me goosebumps (I know that songs hokey, but, I can't
describe it any better than that)

<A NAME="685020">Subject: 'rap'</A>

G'day, all.

No offense meant to anyone, but I thoroughly hate rap.  However, when I
first heard the *spoken section* of "Roll the Bones," I thought it kinda
goofy, but interesting.  Therefore, I tend to think of the
aforementioned spoken section not as rap (which I thoroughly hate), but
as a spoken section (which I kinda like) to a very good song.

In addition, I have always considered the spoken section to be more of
a slam against "traditional" rap "music" instead of being rap itself.
Reasons: (1) The distorted voice used seems to poke fun at the vocal
"talents" of rap "artists."
	 (2) The lyrics of the spoken section seem to suggest that rap
"artists" have trouble facing the facts in their "songs."  E.g.: 'You
better run, homeboy/A fact's a fact from Nome to Rome, boy'
	 (3) The dancing skeleton in the video clip used on tour also
seems to poke fun at the stage antics of popular rap "artists."

Think about it, people.
Again, no offense intended, merely a few opinionated observations.

G'Day guys and gals,

    'Bout time there was a posting from Oz. I have been reading the recent
bantering on HYF and CoS recently so here's my A$0.02 worth.

    I think HYF *kicks*! I was listening to Force Ten today and I suddenly
realised why it is like it so much..... the song is 95% keyboard-free!! The
boyz went back to their roots of 1 guitar, 1 bass and a mammoth drum kit and
had to create music that was full. Result : A 'grungy', 'hard' guitar sound
and a wicked bassline! I think I'll talk my new band into covering that..!
LOVE that song. I also like Open Secrets. I guess this is because( like a lot
of people) this song means something special to me. I listened to it after my
girlfriend broke up with me :(( and I took heart from the meaning..."Time
will do its healing......let it go...". There was something in there that made
me think the end of the world was NOT nigh, and it made me happy. Basically,
the whole of side one is great!

    COS. I listened to this last week after a LONG time. SOOO long I could
hardly remember the material. Side 1 is fine. Side 2 was VERY dodgy. Some of
the stuff was WEIRd - especially that bit right at the end of a track (can't
remeber which) where GEd and someone SCREAMS real fast and the track ends.
BIZARRE material....quite hard to listen to. Didn't like it. Panacea is OK.
BUT don't worry boys and girls I'll just listen to it again and It will no
doubt grow on me...

    Oh well, enought from Sunny Sydney (yes, even in winter!). Some of you may
like to know (Meg, Jimmy, Chrystyna) that I am DEFINITELY coming out to USA
for th next tour (early '94 I guess) and I'd really appreciate someone to stay
with and handle some logistics at your end for me! Any offers ??

No worries mate(s)!

+ What is The Sign of Eth?
+ 
+   - This is what Muff (smills@umaxc.weeg.uiowa.edu) posted to the NMS:
+ 
+     I remember looking up "eth" in the dictionary after I found my
+     brother's FBN album in '74 or '75. In fact, I looked up a LOT of words
+     from that album back then. :D  From American Heritage:
+ 
+     eth   n.  Variant of edh.
+ 
+     edh   n.  1. A letter appearling in Old English, Old Saxon, Old Norse, and
+     modern Icelandic to represent an interdental fricative.  2. The symbol in
+     the International Phonetic Alphabet representing the interdental voiced
+     fricative, as in /the/, /with/.
+ 
+     An edh looks like:     \_--~\
+                                \
+                             -~~-
+                            /    \
+                            {     }

+                              ~-~
+     Well, sorta. Like a lower-case "o" with a wavy propellor. What symbolism
+     an edh has in By-Tor's tale, I have no idea.
+ 
+ 
+   - Also, Josh Beatty (iqm265@uriacc.uri.edu) wrote the following:
+ 
+     "Eth" is a letter in the Old English alphabet that was dropped from
+     the alphabet as it evolved into Middle and Modern English.  It repre-
+     sented the sound /th/, as in "cloth" for example.  It looked like a lower-
+     case "o" with a cross on top. Capitalized, it was like a "D" with a horiz-
+     ontal line through the straight part.  This was also the symbol used for
+     a capitalized "Thorn", another Old English letter representing /th/.
+ 
+     "Thorn" was adapted into the Old English alphabet from a Germanic rune
+     of the same name.  The rune, in its turn, was associated with the Gothic
+     (as in the tribe of the Goths, not cathedrals) word "thurisaz", which
+     meant "demon".
+ 
+     So "Eth" itself has some historical background in representing demons
+     and hell, obviously appropriate in the context of the song.  I suppose
+     I see "The sign of Eth is rising in the air..." in two ways: first, that
+    it represents simply the demonic power in the Tobes of Hades, and secondly,
+     that it represents By-Tor himself and that when the sign is, rising,
+     By-Tor is coming forth from Hades to do battle with the Snow Dog (don't we
+     assume usually that Hades is underground?  By-Tor would have to rise to
+     get out of there to most anyplace?)

  = Questions about _Permanent Waves_
  
+ Has anybody ever noticed that the signs on the right side of the _Permanent
+ Waves_ cover say Lee, Lifeson and Peart?  (Apparently the Anthem Canadian
+ release doesn't have the band members' names on the signs.)
+ 
+    Yes.
+ 
  Why was the headline on the newspaper on the cover of _Permanent Waves_
  blocked out?  (Note: The Anthem Canadian release does not have this problem.)

  What is a barchetta?
  
!    The barchetta is a type of Ferrari race car.  Check the ART, maintained
!    by lloyo@vmtecqr2.qro.itesm.mx (Luis Loyo), for more information.
     Barchetta is actually pronounced "Barketta", according to 2 Italian
     friends of mine.  Another source of information is:

     They were the astronauts on the first shuttle flight.
  
+ What are the voices at the end of "Countdown" saying?
+ 
+   - Ok, this is a combination of what Russell Marks (mr1cy1@gre.ac.uk),
+     Fletch (FLETCHYYZ@delphi.com) and Chris Bush (u6x22@crcws4.bgm.link.com)
+     think the end sequence on 'Countdown' goes like...
+ 
+     Columbia is now reaching precise window in space for main engine cutoff
+     Mark - 2 minutes, 40 seconds...Columbia now 39 nautical miles altitude,
+     42 nautical miles downrange...
+     Columbia you're lookin' a little hot, and all your calls'll be a little
+     early...
+     Young and Crippen really moving out now velocity now reading is sixty-two
+     hundred feet per second
+     What a view, what a view
+     Glad you enjoyed it
+     Jay, how does it all look?
+     Columbia to Houston, er, we have forty seconds still... left; configure
+     LOS, you're looking good for an over the hill, we'll see you in Madrid
+     And we enjoyed the music Bob, thank ya
+     Ah, we enjoyed it, we just wanted to share something
+ 
+     And Fletch says "LOS, if I remember my brief bout with 'shuttle & space
+     frenzy', is Loss Of Signal". This apparently is when signal loses contact
+     with ground control due to some kind of 'blind spot' - when the shuttle
+     went somewhere over Madrid, in this case, they'd get signal back. None of
+     us is really, totally certain about much of this, but I, for one, reckon
+     it's about right.

  Who was Absalom?
  
!     He was a character from the Bible, son of King David (the one who killed
!     Goliath). He killed his half-brother for raping their half-sister.  Then,
!     he tried to over-throw David and get the throne. A battle resulted, and
!     (against David's wishes) Absalom was killed by King David's Mighty Men,
!     when his hair was caught in a tree and suspended him above the ground.
!     David grieved for his son by lamenting, "Absalom, Absalom, my son." I
!     have thought about this story's connection quite a bit. Perhaps it is
!     about David, and how he had the "weight of the world" on his shoulders and
!     he was worrying about Absalom.

     that ASCII 73 is a capital I and read significance into that,

     _opinion_ is that 1001001 was used because it fits and sounds neat.
