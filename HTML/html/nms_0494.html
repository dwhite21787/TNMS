I think the prisoner series has been mentioned here once before but
it was a while ago. I believe the album on which Neil is seen
sporting his No. 6 pin is _Power Windows_ but I'm not certain. It's
really hard to see on the cd cover but there is a poster from that
album where it is pretty clear. I dont know about the album sleeve,
havent seen it. The line from the RTB tour book is "I am not an
existentialist...I am a free man!" My friend and I got quite a
chuckle out of that one.
	Just a side note about the revised set list from the last
show I saw. I had heard here that they were playing Cygnus X-1 in
the encore. This was one of the parts I was most looking forward to.
I was quite disappointed when I caught the snipet they played. I
barely noticed it in there. I was expecting at least a minute or
two. Oh well. Such is life

About Rush playing Analog Kid at the Shoreline show.  That wasn't just
the first time they had played it in the Bay Area since Signals; that
was the first time they had played it in thr Bay Area ever.  You see,
Rush (I refuse to call them "the boyz"!) skipped the BA on their

Hello All:
----------
First post to the NMS!  Thankx to whomever is responsible for bringing US
RUSH types together.  'Round here, whenever I mention the name and/or folks
see my HYF poster / picture of Geddy from _Bass Player_, they generally
grimmace and walk away mumbling something sarcastic of the "get a life"
flavor. :-)

WIND AND WUTHERING.

IMHO, I think this is bass-ackwards.  I'm more inclined to agree with
the following:

\ END fmoore --------------------------------------------------------------/

It's interesting.  I'm not a big music fan, but I am a BIG RUSH FAN -- kinda
like it's just about all I listen to.  So I don't keep up much with interviews
of other bands.  Has anyone ever heard someone (like Summers, The Edge, or
someone else of that caliber) ever say "yah, Alex Lifeson was a big influence
on me" --or-- "I started out trying to play the bass line from Tom Sawyer, so
I'd say Geddy Lee was the genesis { no pun intended :-) } of my musical
style" ??? or some such thing?  It would be really interesting to know who
credits the band with being a major (or even a minor) influence.

I saw the RTB tour in Jan '92 in San Diego, and again in Jun '92 at Irvine
Meadows.  Aside from the fact that Irvine (as well as Primus!) sucks, the
boyz were in rare form that night -- the show kicked a*s!  "The Trees" and
"Vital Signs" were cool additions to the set, but I have to join the chorus
of folks who've already posted saying that "Analog Kid" blew me away.  Hadn't
heard it live since SIGNALS; almost forgot about it (horrors!).  The
opening riff LITERALLY knocked me over (I turned to my friend and said
"hey, Analog Kid, holy shit, do you believe this... " and fell backwards
on top of some unsuspecting Metallicahead who kept saying throughout the
show "no way maannn, Metallica was way better".  Just shows there's no
accounting for taste.  The guy next to him kept shouting "...bring on the
bunnies...bring on the bunnies..." then went WILD during "Superconductor".
It's by far the best RUSH live I've seen -- seemed like the Presto tour
(saw it in L.A., on my birthday no less) was bland, uninteresting...
as if they were just going through the motions.  But in Irvine, GAWD
WERE THEY INTO IT, AND ON TOP OF IT, AND BENEATH, BETWEEN BEHIND...

So that's it.  Again, thankx to those who keep the NMS alive.

Firstly, I am thrilled to see the return of TMNS after it's hiatus!

Secondly, Frank Moore writes:

Andy Summers has been playing guitar on people's albums since
the sixties (when the estimable Mr. Lifeson was still in high
school).  Anyway, just because you get a recording contract
doesn't mean you stop being influenced by the other music out
there, right?  In fact, I think Alex himself has acknowledged
Summers as an influence.

What's important is that both Lifeson and Summers are tremendous
guitarists.  The more the merrier!

I agree with this sometimes, but I also think a lot of people get
carried away with their interpretations.  There's a fine line between
Neil's word and the influence of individualism and someones'
interpretation of Neil's word and how it influences the electrical flow
produced by speaker wires passing through asbestos.  (I know - horrible
example but you know what I mean.)  Sometimes people just read too much
into it.  It's great to get some insight but it gets ridiculous if you
carry it too far.  (The NMS debates over the dogs barking in Dreamline
come to mind.)

Keith Estanol says:

Check out CD sounds on Miramar Road (next to Roberto's), they carry
Marrillion CD's (with and without former member Fish) and the newer
imports.  Has anyone heard Fish's new solo album?  Not bad eh?  it's
hard to find in the US, but most good import stores can get it for you.
Much superior than Marrilion's latest IMO.

Bill Dunn Jr. says:

As far as I know, I think Neil wrote those words, if you mean the story
about Father Brown and the priests, and the quotations on the original
album sleeve.  Anyone know for sure?  They sure aren't from any Rand
books that's for sure.  (At least not in Anthem, as I've read that.)
			----------------------
On the issue of Alex and Andy Summers, I would say that during PW/MP, it
sounds more to me like Alex was influenced by Summers rather than vice
versa.  Summers and the Police were doing rock with reggae/ska overtones
long before Rush went into the studio to do stuff like Vital Signs.
Check out Police's early albums:

Outlandos D'Amour
Regatta de Blanc
Zenyatta Mondatta

Sorry if I misspelled anything, don't have the CD's with me.  You could
tell just by listening to those that the Police was definitely *not* as
influenced by Rush as vice versa.  I remember in an interview in Modern
Drummer around Permanent Waves, Neil mentioned that he really liked the
"young drummer Steward Copeland".  Point is, Police came out with their
music first, and only later did we hear Police-like music on Rush's
PW/MP albums.  During the end of Spirit, you could hear Neil drumming
with a bit of reggae/ska patterns.  On Vital Signs, you could hear
a bit of Summers, and even on Signals (1982, several years after the
first Police album came out), on Digital Man you could hear the
similarities.   Speaking to a fellow drummer he too agreed that Neil's
drumming and some of Copeland's style and playing back in PW/MP were
along the same lines.  I still conceed that Summers/Copeland had more of
an influence on Alex/Neil during that period.  Anyone else
agree/disagree?  shed some light?  Maybe the next best thing is to ask
and get an answer from the horse's mouth himself!!  I'll have to
remember that next tour :)

   I am curious to find out what the lyrics to You Bet Your Life are
about. Neil writes at one point "the odds get even". Someone brought

Hey all,

	This is the ole first post to your fabled newsletter, and what
a bonus it is. The funny thing is, I've been @ UMCP for 3 years and still
knew nothing about it! Oh well, that's the way that lady luck dances.

	Anyway, I happened to get 3rd row @ the Merriweather show and
7th row @ the Cap center. I remember alot more from the Merriweather
show. Our seats were directly in front of where Alex usually hung out
to jam, and they were excellent indeed. I would have to say Alex is the
biggest character out there (except of course for Neil's windmill- what
a bonus laugh). Some of the things that were quite hilarious. He had a
nerf bow and arrow fight with some techies up in the lighting. During
one  of the songs, he held a minute long conversation with a guy right
in front of me. This other dude down the way was wearing a fishing
hat similar to Col. Henry Blake from M*A*S*H, and Alex went through
the motions of casting his rod, etc. Plenty more fun things, but I
don't quite recall.

	Anybody know if Alex recently changed his cabinets during the
tour. I don't seem to recall those GK's on the first part of the tour,
but his sound @ Merriweather was simply incredible. That was an incredible
sounding show IMHO, even where I was sitting, which is usually a sacrafice
in sound.

Oh well, enjoy all, and keep the killer postings coming-
