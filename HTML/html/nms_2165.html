Don't forget, Rush'll be on Rockline TONIGHT at 8:30pm PST/11:30pm EST!
If you need a list of radio stations carrying the show, check out Dr. Chuck's
Rockline page at:

http://drchuck.simplenet.com/rockline/

Many of the radio stations listed have realaudio feeds, so if you can't
get the show in your area, you might be able to listen via the internet.
And I just found out yesterday that San Diego will once again have rockline
through KGB (which also has a realaudio feed at www.101kgb.com)
If your city hasn't had Rockline for a while, be sure to check out the
station listing -- a LOT of major cities are picking up the Wednesday show
(NYC, Chicago, LA, San Diego, St. Louis, Philly...)

I think I can finish that one...at that show, Neil was Sparky Anderson,

  I have been so close to responding to letters in the TNMS and yet this is
my first. I must admit that this commentary strikes home so much! I have
been listening to Rush for 20+ years myself and have a 'personal soundtrack'
that has been influenced by the band...or even more acurately, by the
presentation of the lyrics. Lyrics that are clear to me and yet so
interpretive and intangible as the ideas that influenced them. I have been
excited, educated, entertained, amused and even motivated by Rush as a whole
and will continue to do so even if they stop with the current body of work.
   The only part of 'Morgan F's' statement that I have is that they did not
so much chose their current profession as a livelihood as they seem to have
chosen to stick to their proverbial guns and were lucky enough to let the
profession make their livelihood. 
   As with music in the whole, I will always be grateful for Rush and the
aura they present along with the knowledge that they appear to have done it
their way!

p.s. Morgan F....if you read this, my wife (whom seems tolerant of Rush) to
whom I read your letter, asked if I wrote it myself.

referring to. I hope that is appropriate.)

<A NAME="2165008">  Subject: in the end</A>

  Much has been made of the possibility of the imminent demise of the 
  musical entity known as RUSH. I have no insider knowledge, I don't 
  personally know any of the band members (although one of them and I 
  share a mutual friend), and yet I too have the same suspicions that the 
  era of RUSH may be about to come to a close.

  I have appreciated the musical genius, technical brilliance and 
  challenging messages of RUSH since my high school days. When my friends 
  were listening to Wild Cherry and Chic, and were playing Crime of the 
  Century to death, I was burying myself in the sonic coccoon of Fly By 
  Night, Caress of Steel, 2112 and All The World's A Stage. And their 
  music has been a part of my life ever since.

  I guess one could say that RUSH provided the soundtrack for my life.

  Now I'm 38 years old, with a wife and a mini-van and a 100 lb dog and a 
  credit card bill and a mortgage on a house in the 'burbs, but the 
  soundrack is as vibrant as ever.

  I know in my heart that music is a business, often fun, sometimes 
  tiresome and brutal,and that the members of RUSH chose this as their 
  profession. They are wonderful players, to be sure, but they are more 
  than that. They are human beings, with failings and vices. They are 
  members of families, with the requisite ecstasies and agonies. Like
  all of us, their professions are not the sum total of their existence. 
  That is how they  have chosen to make their living, and we are all 
  immensely richer for it.

  Now, because of circumstances of which we are all aware and I shan't go 
  into here, we may have to say farewell.

  And if they do make the choice to close the final chapter of RUSH, this 
  retirement  does not necessarily mean the end of their musical careers. 
  The producer's panel, the pen, the baton, the classroom - a whole range 
  of possibilities awaits. For a door that  is closed to one room simply 
  opens up to another.

  But if the day is coming when that choice is made, I would like to take 
  the opportunity to say the following:

  Gentlemen, thank you. Were it not for your musical influences and 
  lyrical challenges, I may not have ever read Ayn Rand, or found out what 
  Rocinante was, or delved deeper into Greek mythology. I may not have had 
  the wondrous opportunity to re-read 'A Tale of Two Cities' with a new 
  eye, or fumbled my way through the opening riff of 'Bastille  Day' on a 
  $35 guitar. I may not have ever wept at the power of 'The Pass', or 
  borrowed some lyrics from 'Entre Nous' to woo a girlfriend, who later 
  became a wife.

  The list is almost infinite.

  \So, when it's time, I shall not join in the cacophony of pleas to stay 
  together. You yourself know in your hearts the wisdom of your choice. I 
  shall, however, raise a glass of fine single-malt scotch direct from the 
  highlands and toast the years together, with gratitude and a warm heart. 
  For you have given so much of your lives to us, we cannot ask more of 
  you.

holy crap.

I'm taking this post-world war one history class this term. we were talking
about the Red Scare in the early 20's. Immediately I was swayed away from
the discussion at hand and moved towards Red Lenses.

I never realized that Neil made such an obvious historical point there. Red
Lenses encompasses the whole Red Scare thing, right away. "Says the
National Midnight Star"

The media faked the whole thing!

Talk about trippy.

Hi folks
Haven't written for a while - but I'd like to get into a drummers debate
here.  Having loved Rush for nearly 20 years I'd like to know why Neil Peart
can't loosen up on his kit.  I mean if you see him live everything seems so
intense.  OK - so he's concentrating but there must come a point in his
playing where he handled the percussion without thinking.  Phil Collins on
the other hand is so ridicilousy relaxed at the kit it's unbelievable!!!  I
personally think that Collins is technically the better drummer - utilising
more percussive sounds from electronic kits etc.  Peart makes drumming look
difficult - Collins eradicates any problems about drumming.
What do you think?????

Fish Island is in the Maldives, native name Bodufinolhu. It's called
Fish Island because there are lots of turtles...which attract the fish.
It is a very popular place for tourists, who obviously take lots of photos.
So I think Limelight is drawing a parrallel between living in the Fish
Islands and being on stage. The Bodufinolhu locals definitely feature in
many camera eyes...

I was reading somewhere on the internet the complete story about how Rush
got started.  In the same material a little further down the story, it said
Geddy got thrown out of the band.  It was when John Rutsey was still in
Rush.  What I would like to know, is why the heck he got thrown out.  I
don't know how Geddy is but he doensn't seem like the kind of person that
would start trouble, but I really don't know.  If anybody has info on this
let me know!!!

Il,
Neil uses double-bass drums often--more so recently but even as far back as
Best I Can where he accentuates quarter note cymbal punches with 16th notes
on the bass drum right after the line "Well I knooooow what I am".

Other examples of double bass fills are:

At 3:51-3:52 of Roll the Bones, double bass fill with toms just before the
2nd rap section.

At 2:37 of Where's My Thing?, double bass fill with toms toward the end of
the bridge section.

Throughout the chaotic screeching parts of Test For Echo.  He's hitting
hi-hat #2 quarter notes on the beat while filling in 16th notes around the
toms and on the snare.  All the while he's pounding out 16th notes on the
bass drum.

At 2:15 & 4:01 of Totem, double bass fill w/toms before "I believe in what I
see...".  Note that each of these fills is slightly different from the
other.

At 2:56-2:57 of Totem, double bass fill w/snare & toms just before solo.

At 1:12-1:13 of Dog Years w/snare & toms just before "in the dog days".
Snare & toms keep the beat (1-2-3-4) while double bass fills in triplets
between the beats (1-x-x-2-x-x-3-x-x-4).

Many points in The Rhythm Method from Different Stages.  In his solo he's
got several great examples of double bass technique--most of them are played
along with snare, toms and/or cymbals, but give a listen to the whole
section from 3:11 to about 3:55.  It's packed with double bass!

It's funny how in 1991 he removed the 2nd "large resonating chamber" (the
other bass drum) in favor of a double pedal played on a single bass drum in
part because he said he rarely uses the second bass drum.  But his playing
double bass drum fills and rhythms has increased quite a bit since then.  Oh
well, another reason he gave for the switch was that he was always
interested in the 2 bass drums sounding exactly alike, which is very hard
with 2 separate drums, but simple with a double pedal.

As far as your other question is concerned, he uses single bass drum almost
all of the rest of the time.  I hope this helps.

Ooooops!
This is CLASSIC!! So you don't like Soundgarden either?

Ooooops! the Sequel. Son of Ooooops.

Oh, alright. I'll go along. You must be saying that the fact of a player
trying to *cover up* sloppiness is the justification for demoting him/her
to level of 'amateur' - and not the sloppiness itself. Because, you see,
otherwise this is a tautology. I am assuming it isn't and you don't intend
to waste anyone's time - even then, the point is zany... 

Does it occur to you that there may be musicians who don't give two hoots
about perfect picking and use the sat. dist. as a means in itself, to
obtain a texture to convey their ideas? And that these musicians may have
changed the rules overnight and earned the status of living legends and
influenced thousands? Could these ppl be the ones you refer to as 'amateurs'?

As for your comment on Kim, what if I were to tell you that I think Ayn
Rand was a stale fascist snot, but I love and respect Rush in spite of
that? Would you come down from your high horse? No. Didn't think so.

Ashim.

For sure I'll not be the only person to respond to this post, but add
this one to the list of misheard lyrics.  The actual words are, "Living
in a fish eye lens."  I've always wondered exactly what Neil meant by
those words, but they were printed on the vinyl sleeve when MP was
released.  Check it out.

I've mentioned this one before, but it was so funny to me that it bears
repeating.  From that same release, an old boyfriend of mine misheard
something also.  He thought the verse in Camera Eye that mentions a
"mass of New Yorkers" was "Massive New Yorkers."  :)

Yes I remember them.  Back in college, I started a tradition in my fraternity
house, by stapling all my Rush boxes to the ceiling directly above my bed.
The rest of the ceiling received similar treatment forming a mosaic of CD
boxes, but the "shrine" was directly above me.  They're still there today.

Does anyone have any NEW info on the Orchestral Rush CD?  Is release still
planned for mid-April?  The most recent news I have said a website for
preordering was to be up for Christmas.

Happy New Year All,
Morgan F....your post was eloquent, bittersweet...and echoed my
sentiments exactly.  WELL SAID!!!  You sir, are the consummate fan,
regardless of how many boots you have, how many sticks you begged Larry
for, etc.  What a gentleman!!! :)  Nice Post!!!
 
NOW...on to the matter of John Rutsey.  For 3 years I have sat back,
listened & read to a number of unflattering, insulting things about John
that need to be addressed.  Since John cannot defend himself against the
tounge-in-cheek barbs of a few, I will.  I am NOT going to engage into a
debate with anyone about this, give out his phone# or address, or stoop
down to the lowest common denominator in a flame war...so all you
"doubters" out there...you will be barking in the woods...
*all by yourself.*
I am simply providing a JUST commentary on the gentleman's whereabouts.
SO JUST RELAX and read...:)
*John is alive and well in Toronto.
*John is HUGE.  He was a weight trainer for a while, and competed in
weightlifting & flexing competitions for a time (if you look through old
"Weight & Fitness" mags, you might find him in a pic or two, under
"Canadians." I am uncertain if he is still competing.
*John did a photo advertisement for a vitamin supplement and/or weight
training nutrition supplements around 1989/1990.  It was a
face-shot/shadowed/beads of sweat photo, and he had a crew-cut (nearly
shaven head).  I saw this ad ONCE...I do not have it.
*John has/is (since '95)been working on a multi-media project with
several audio/visual people centering around the controversial "Warren
Commission/JFK" trials.  I do not know the status of this project...as
*John is a busy fellow, enjoying his life.
*John *IS* still playing drums.  I do not know who he is playing WITH as
of 1998/1999.
*I lost contact with him in 1997, after his mother passed away.  I DO
KNOW that he is doing well for himself, and he thinks we are all silly
(a good silly).
*He is a GREAT person (I've only spoken to him by phone/no face-to-face
meetings)...and he deserves a little more respect than he recieves.
Please be nice...AVOID barbing a defenseless-NICE-guy.  Barb someone
like Michael Hirsch (Lurch)...he was a JERK at a show once, throttling a
friend of mine for smarting off to him.  He's VERY lucky my friend (at
the time, pre-law) did not sue Anthem's ASS off for assault & battery.
So...barb that guy!  *HE* deserves it!!!  Or...barb John Colfield(the
projectionist during the Presto tour)his nickname was "Pork Chop &
Elvis" because of his HONKING sideburns...and he told raunchy jokes.
:) Enjoy!

> Top number= number of beats per measure

But also, the names of the types of notes are derived
principally from a 4-beat measure.  This is why a 
"quarter note" is a quarter of a measure, a half note is
half, and a whole note is a whole-measure note.  Why do I 
point this out?  Because to those unfamiliar with time sigs, 
the idea of a whole/half/quarter note may not give an 
accurate idea of what's really going on.

An eight note is an eighth of a 4/4 measure, but not
necessarily an eighth of a 3/4, 6/8, or 7/8 measure.

If the stars were aligned and the gods not malign, then a
half note would properly be called a "half-measure note," a 
quarter note would be a "beat note," an eighth note would be 
a "half-beat," a sixteenth would be a "quarter-beat," and a 
full note would be a "measure note."  Time sigs would be 
written "4/1," "3/1," "6/.5," "3/2," and "7/.5" instead of 
4/4, 3/4, 6/8, 3/2, and 7/8 (respectively).  Or at least
that makes sense to me off the top of my head at this given
moment in time...

It's weird, for one thing the whole note will consist of
three half notes.  I bet it's used for slow tempos.

Hey Rushians,

Especially all female fans!

My comments in TNMS #2163 were not meant to be stereotypical comments. 
I have never had the pleasure of meeting a female that liked Rush.  I
subscribed to TNMS this past September.  I was pleasantly surprised to
see many female fans.

I hope that when the day comes that I meet the woman that I spend the
rest of my life with, that she loves Rush as much as I do.  Or at least
puts up with my love of their music.  That was kind of the point behind
the comment.  It was a failed attempt at humor.  We all know how
fanatical we all are about their music.  I am sure those of you that are
married, and their spouses don't like Rush, can relate.  I have heard a
few of those stories here on TNMS.

I didn't want to offend anyone.  I don't believe in all of us flaming
each other.  We are here because of our love of their music.  Not to put
each other down, or create the controversy that starts it in the first
place.  Please forgive my incredibly bad attempt at humor.

Sorry.

Rush is by far, the most underrated group in the history of
music."Different Stages" peaked at #35 on the billboard charts, while
Garth Brooks new live album went to #1 immediately. What is wrong with
this picture? I'm sorry folks, but Geddy, Alex, and Neil have more
talent in their fucking pinkies than all of the crap that makes the top
ten these days put together!!! Oh well, what can I say, I'm proud to be
a part of the Rush minority!!! My deepest sympathy to Neil for his
traggic losses. I don't mean to sound selfish, but I really hope Rush
will continue on touring and making albums. Mayby it does make me
selfish because I wan't them around. But I mean this with all respect to
Neil of course.

The words are "Living in a fish-eye lens". 
They go quite well with the next line "...stuck in the camera eye..."
I was going to slam you, Grasshopper, but I figured the following:

TNMS, so...
        B: I'll take it easy on him because I'm a nice guy.
        C: If the internet was around when I was younger, I probably would
have thrown out lyrical questions            like this looking for answers,
too. (The only reason I say "younger" is because that's when I was
searching for Rush lyrics, when I was 11 back in '81. God, I sound like an
old man!)

Don't feel bad, though. It was a couple of years before I found out Geddy
was singing things like, "Well weathered leather, hot metal and oil.." in
Red Barchetta and "...in the theatres and bookstore shelves." in Witch Hunt. 

One last thing. To the person that posted the tip about DS and the 800.com

A couple of weeks ago I asked if there were any sites that stream rush
music over the net.  Well I think I have found the place ;-)  The thing
is it streams rush b00tz MP3z.  You will need atleast winamp version
2.06 which supports the shoutcast streaming media.  The site is
http://yp.shoutcast.com/cgi-bin/newlistserv.cgi?genre=Rock  A few
bad things tho: the site only streams at 24kbps so dont expect perfect
sound...its mono.  Also it has a max number of users set at 4.  Maybe
if more ppl listen to it, they will increase its throuhput and max
number of users.  The cool thing is that the shoutcast server is free
for noncommercial uses, and I dont think streaming b00tz is "illegal".
I mean where else can you listen to the necromancer played live but
over the net? ;-)  This will really be cool when/if it supports stereo
sound
