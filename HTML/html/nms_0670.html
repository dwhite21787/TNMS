re: Rocinante

Yes, Rocinante was the name of Don Quixote's horse.  I believe the name means 
something to the order of 'old nag'.  I always took the name of the ship, then,
to be something of the same order of humor as it is in Cervantes' book.  
Picture Don Quixote the valiant :) warrior riding into battle on his majestic 
steed the Rocinante (read: tired, about-to-die horse).  That's all for my 
$.02...

  I am impressed by the number of people who know the story of Don Quixote.
BTW, did you know that Rocinante was the name of his horse?  That was sarcasm
in case you missed it.  For those of you who don't know Spanish, a "rocin" is a
work horse.  Anyway, someone mentioned, I think Jeremy, that the lyrics on HYF
were the best.  I think I agree, although MP comes pretty close.  The lyrics
for Limelight and The Camera Eye are exceptional IMHO.  Also, although Rush is
undoubtedly my favorite band, I'm also a huge Bob Marley fan.  Is there anyone
out there other than Eric Jarmon who is a Marley fan?  Later--

I have found all the rush albums on vinyl, including the red
hemispheres, and archives.  They are not too hard to find, just go into
any half decent new/used record shop, and you should find some albums.
I dont have a record player either, but find the value in the covers and
pictures inside.  Some live albums have tripple fold-outs.  You can
often find these records for under three bucks.  I just got the origonal
'RUSH' on record for $1.99.  I think 8 bucks is a bit high, don't you?

<A NAME="670007">Subject: Unplugged</A>

Well,
I was reading the NMS yesterday and fell upon the post about the
difference in guitar sounds and techniques in Alex's playing. Couldn't
agree more. First of all, I have a hard time seeing the three of them just
sitting around playing on a stage with acoustic instruments, with the
crowd yelling and cheering and snaping their fingers in 7/8 time to Tom
Sawyer!! 2nd: yes, alex's sound would have to change drastically. He uses
to many large sustaining chords. Those chords sustain so long because of
the amplification, and they would sound hollow. A good point was brought
up about alex's tendency to use the tremolo system. I think he first
started using it about PeW. The dive in the Spirit solo. He's pretty much
used it since then, whether it was the Strat thru GUP, to the Signature up
thru Presto, to the PRS's he uses now. Have you noticed that he uses the
bar a lot more in concert than in the studio? Right off the top of my
head, the version of Marathon on SOH has a lot of whammy bar stuff _with_
sustained chords. Another thing I've noticed is that when bands do this
unplugged thing, they usually slow down their songs or blues them up or
both. Ever noticed that the majority of bands playing there are blues
based, or at least blues progressions and/or blues scales (pentatonics and
the blues scale) ? IMHO, rush isn't blues based, at least, not any more.
They used to be, but anymore, the rush I listen to (usually middle rush to
HYF) seems to be more blues or fusion based than anything else. I don't
believe this lends itself well to the unplugged format. I just don't think
that it would be too hot of an idea, they just don't seem the band to do
it. It would never happen anyway. eMpTV only covers the new and trendy,
not masterful and classic(except Clapton!) Anyway, sorry to ramble on
about a moot question. Let's get those flames going!! :)

<A NAME="670008">Subject: slow songs</A>

i agree with chris from yesterday's NMS: i like the slowdown to SDT alot,
especially the intro, and in general like songs when they are slowed down.  it
gives me the impression of more deliberation, for lack of a better word.  (a
good word, actually.)  on the other hand, i also like when songs are sped up.
that gives the impression of raw power.  as an example, the version of "Temples
of Syrinx" on the bootleg of the same name (from the P/G video i believe, and
the same as _Currently in Vogue_, _Life Under Pressure_, and whatever other
boots have been taken from that video) is roughly 140% of the speed of the
studio version, which wasn't too slow to begin with, and it just ROCKS.  which
brings me to a question i have, which will certainly cause a lot of responses
(i like starting threads): what bootlegs have particularly good versions of
songs on them?  i'd like to know so that i can look out for them, because i
really don't want to buy a bootleg and have it sound almost exactly like a
studio album.  take _A New Reality_ for example.  good boot and all, but "Tom
Sawyer", "Red Barchetta" and "Limelight" are MP clones.  which is
understandable, since it was recorded right after MP was released, but you get
my point.  (By-Tor and In the End/Mood make the bootleg worth it--don't think
i'm putting it down.)  so, does anyone know of really distinctive versions of
these songs and others.  i'd love to know.

Hi there!

I don't know whether someon emight have already mentioned this, but on 'Over
The Europe' has anyone heard the Alex bit on Closer To the Heart??  He sounds
as if he's shouting and sscreaming in a sort of japanese voice, and imitates
gun sounds,etc!!  It's really funny!!

I do agree that Over the Europe isn't very good on the singing, but overall
it's still a very good CD to buy  (i paid 25 pounds for it over here) and I am
well pleased with it.   I've got some others too:

Atmospheric
Rush One and Rush two
Spirit of St Loius
Run from the Fans

I'm sure there was something else I wanted to say.......oh well never mind!!

Heyya!
I remember eariler some people were discussing the meaning of the cover
of HYF.  Here is my evaluation.  In The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand (an
author we all know Neil is influenced by, and Geddy also to some degree),
there is a dialogue between two characters that goes something like this:

"So, if you were to create a symbol symbolizing humanity, what would you make?"

"I would have just three guilded balls."

This symbol bears an uncanny resemblance to HYF.  Also, the basic topic of
the lyrics of Hold Your Fire is humanity.  Anyone agree, disagree?

The main problem with an accoustic set as far as the guitar work is concerned
is the matter of sustain, as Allan Murphy pointed out in #669 all manner of
distortion gain, reverb, delay, pitch modulation, chorus etc etc is added to
Alex's Guitar sound - you simply can't get that knid of sound out of an
accoustic guitar, the sustain is a lot less. The prblem is not sring bending,
take a listen to some of the early jazz and blues guitarist who string bend
away like feury on their accoustics, but the matter of sustain.

Equally there has not yet been an accoustic guitar developed with a tremolo bar
(or musically more correct vibrato bar) so you can't get the kind of swooping
sounds produced in solos such as _Spirit of the Radio_.

An accoustic set therefore involves a lot of re-writing of electric guitar
work.

Alan J Murphy writes:

>( corrections welcome, but I think this is right )

The Gibson Les Paul Alex used I think until AFTK had no trem bar, and so much
of the solo work relies on string bending - see above thats not really the
problem with an accoustic set. He then went onto use a semi-solid, I think it
was a Gibson ES -335, but I've never seen a decent photo of it so I can't be
exactly certain of the make or model, that had an old Biggsby Travis trem. on
it this can be heard on _Hemisphers_ onward. And of course the beautiful if
ungainly Gibson SG 12/6 Twin neck.

Signals saw Alex on new guitars - A Fender Telecaster (notable on New World
Man), Strats and the fabled Hentor(on Power Windows). HYF saw Alex using
Signature guitars - which he obviuosly didn't like 'cos he was criticising
them in the HYF tour programme. I think he continued using them along with the
Hentor (a guitar he had custom made) and a Strat on _presto_ . It wasn't until
RTB that he started using PRS guitars, and in my opinion about time too, since
they are some of the best guitars around.

>Secondly, Alex uses stuff like distortion and so on a lot, and playing
>something like Limelight on an acoustic doesn't sound just quite as hot.

I was rather suprised by this comment - in comparison to a lot of guitarists
Alex doesn't use all that much distortion, prefering instead to stick with a
nice "crunch" sound and put lots of effects over it, eg; chorus, reverb, delay,
flanger, etc. OK as he comes to a solo he sticks on the gain a bit for more
sustain, but its not really an out and out dirty sound. Granted _Limelight_ has
got quite a gain ridden solo, but I would have thought the rest of the song
would transfer well to an accoustic, I'll have to try it !!

Geddy's Wal Basses
------------------
Clayton Gould kindly sent me an old posting of this guitar world interview
around the time of Presto coming out, which contains full details of Geddy's
and Alex's set ups and their guitars:

> Guitar World - March 1990 article

>  On the album [Presto], Geddy played his Wal four-string bass (which he first
> acquired for the _Hold Your Fire_ sessions) on every track.

This rather disproves the theory that Geddy used the Wals on _Power Windows_, I
really do not think that most of Power windows even *sounds* like he uses the
Wal (IMHO of course).

Wal thats all for now folks ;-)

As I see it, the connection is subtle, but very logical.  Don Quixote was
famous (infamous) for his unrealistic quests (/to dream the impossible
dream/)  In Hemispheres, the pilot of the Rocinante decides to plunge his
ship into a black hole in search of elder gods in order to bring peace to his
world.  (In Cygnus, just the hope of surviving the trip is enough to make the
flight of the Rocinante a Quixotic venture)

Enough literary input.  Now, I think Rush albums SHOULD HAVE PARENTAL WARNING
LABELS!!!  No, not for sordid sexual innuendo or satanic messages, but because
everytime I play Red Barchetta in my car, I find myself doing well above the
speed limit, and this time, I, ah, well, ah..., I got nabbed and ticketed.
The officer didn't believe I was a product of my evironment (ie. a Rush
fanatic) and gave me the ticket anyway.  C'est le vie...

As one who is working on parodizing several Rush songs, I have no problem with
it, especially since I have nothing against the group. In fact, I love the
music (PoW is #1).

I am parodizing songs because it is a challenge to write something funny
within the constraints laid down by the original writer. For me, both tasks
are a challenge, and it's fun.

People,

	Here's a poll question:

Which two RUSH songs demonstrate two greatest extremes in RUSH's style?

	I hope people think of something other than 'Temples of Syrinx'
and 'Rivendell'.  And they don't have to be complete opposites either.
I was thinking that 'In the Mood' and 'Losing It' would show a change
from basic guitar/bass/drum rock and roll to the intense use of
synthesizers and electronic music.
	Well, you get the point.  Send your ideas to the NMS or to me

Andrew:  Rush on vinyl is not a rare collector's item, at least not yet. But
if you don't yet have those Rush titles on CD, that's a great way to build
your Rush collection within a reasonable budget.  Almost all of my Rush
collection is on vinyl, and I've obtained much of it recently at used record
stores.

Howdy, rush folk.....

I'm a bit behind in my NMS reading, so forgive me if anything here has been
mentioned in the past week or so.  I was listening to A Show of Hands recently,
 and noticed that right before "Distant Early Warning" there's a short little
keyboard-y ditty (which goes into the fuzzy distortion).  Does anyone know
where that came from?  I haven't seen the video in a while, and can't remember
what's happening on the video screen.
#2 - Anybody know a good place to get old Rush posters in the Providence and/or
   Long Island areas?
#3 - Does anyone have a bootleg of the 6/20/92 Jones Beach show?  It was my
   birthday (quite the present, eh?) and 'twould be a really cool momento. On
   these same lines, I've been looking for quite some time now for anything
   with The Camera Eye live. Did they ever play this live?  It's one of my
   absolute favorite tunes, but have been fruitless in my searches.  Same goes
   for Hemispheres, although I'm sure they must have played it during its tour.
   Can anyone help this poor soul?   (respond to #s 2 and 3 privately, pleez)

                  I'm not giving up on impossible dreams,
                              Benjy

Hello weckle fans,

	SCREW weckle... I am sorry to jump all over someone's opinions here,
but I am gettig so sick of reading in TNMS that weckle is better than Neil.
Who really cares which guy can paradittle faster, who's mom is cooler, who
holds their sticks (or stick in weckle's case) better.  They are both great
drummers... but can weckle write the best lyrics in music history (and future)
Does weckle play with guys as awsome as Ged and Alex?  No, No, No............
He doesn't.  How can you compare the music the two play anyway?  weckle and
his little jazzy mombo pretty stuff, and Neil with his, well, I don't need
to tell you what Neil plays... I guess my point is, lets find something else
besides who is better than Neil to talk about.  Don't get me wrong, I am
not shitting on peoples opinions here.  Maybe I'm over reacting.  I just think
that this is the wrong place to make Neil look less than perfect...Sorry

	One more thing, whats all this talk of Rush unplugged.  You all know
as well as I do that they would never do it...  Besides, if they did they
would have to do it on the Rap infested MTV, the station that played the
video for RTB once at like 3:00 in the morning and then threw it away.
It will never happen...Besides, how could you play a powerful song like Tom
on an acoustic...The day I see that anywhere is the day I renounce Rush as
my gods and dust off my sisters old Micheal Jackson Lp's..........

	P.S.  Neil would whoop weckle's ass in a fight...Now thats something
              I would like to see, even on MTV...
