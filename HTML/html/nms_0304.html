First of all, thanks for all the outpouring of support for me and my
efforts.  It's not necessery, but it IS appreciated.

Secondly, I've been behind again in Admin mail, but by the time you see
this issue, I will have read all of the backed up mail on the rush-mgr
account.  If I haven't replied to you and you think I should have, feel 
free to bitch me out.  :-)

Thirdly, all the tabs I've received are out in the 'rush/tab' ftp dir,
now with the *correct permissions*, so you should be able to get them
now.

Fourthly, thanks to all of you who point out problems like the ftp permis-
sions, the "stale file handles", and all the rest.  They're simple to fix,
but I need to know about 'em before I can fix 'em, right.  If you get on my
nerves by mail, I'll probably let you know, do don't worry about it - 
report those bugs!

Lastly, due to an unexpected swell in membership, we're teetering precariously
close to 800 members currently.  I think with the fall sememster we should
get pretty close to 900.  I can't wait for the day I can say we have a cool
thousand members.  I'm amazed, considering the humble origins of this forum;
what say you "originals" still out there!?!?!  :-)  Remember when we shared
that .mailrc file... ?

And now, Roll the Bones, Roll the Bones...

Well, it seems that the boys in Mr. Big have been mighty influenced by
the boyz in RUSH over the Presto tour.  The new Mr. Big album (entitled
_Lean_Into_It_) is much better than their self-titled debut.  The guitar
is more textured, a common description of Alex's guitar playing.  The
guitar also has more a variety concerning tone; I'm sure Alex had some
tips to share with Paul.

Their was also quite a few mentions of RUSH in the 'thank you's.  In the
Mr. Big thanks column they say "the Rush band and crew mates".  Pat Torpey
thanks "Neil Peart", Billy Sheehan thanks "Geddy Lee", Eric Martin thanks
"Pratt, Lerxst, Dirk", and Paul Gilbert (just as in a guitar interview)
obviously forgot to mention Alex.

Mr. Big's lyrics aren't covering anything new, but the music is definitely
getting better.  BTW, I saw a whole bunch of Atlantic stuff at the Moorhead
Best Buy Co. and they were in a discount bin--compact discs for $4.99!!!
I bought Mr. Big's debut, _Gutter_Ballet_ by Savatage, and almost bought
me an extra copy of _Presto_ for no reason (other than increasing sales).
These were all Atlantic, so this must have something to do with this
company (someone has already mentioned overdistribution).  So I'm not
worried about RUSH selling so little discs that they have to price them
down to $4.99 to sell them.  I think it's Atlantic's fault.

You know you're a RUSH fan when...every answer you give to a game of word
association is related to RUSH.  When my psychology teacher gave us "red",
I went insane!

   I'm sure that we all know that Neil is playing on Rush's 1st live-LP
some songs from the Rush's first album. They sound horrible.

   Well...have any of you ever listened to Dire Straits' LP called
"Brothers in Arms". There's a song called "Ride across the River", which
tells something about the soldiers of fortune...are the bells ringing,
huh?
   This is my own theory, not an official rush-mgr -statement (Best

   I believe that if Neil would be reading more of NMS he'd try to do
something that could bring us all back to life again.
   This list is great. I'm also a member of a Marillion posting list and
these two lists are enough to me...I also would like to join to some
other lists like Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd etc. but I don't have enough
time for all of these.
   I'll stay as a member of this list as long as I think I'll know
enough of Rush.
   But to us all: there's a real world out there.  Yes, a real one...
(What? Oh: that's my morning paper which just dropped to my floor...what
time is love, I really should get some sleep now)...anyway, we all
should live our life and see a lot of different things around us...if
you just mess with something in 24 hours/day you're in a deep deep
trouble sooner or later...that's why I listen a lot of other bands
nowadays, even that Rush is N:O #1 in my heartm as it has been over 10
years (since the first time I saw the "Limelight"-video and heard that
song for the very first time"...what can this strange difference
be...1...2...only 3 guys playing all of this?!?")

   I'm quite tired right now and I may also be wrong, but...
   Is it possible that that "The Body Electric" would also be a name of
one Star Trek -episode? I've also known that my favourite sci-fi -writer
Mr.  Ray Bradbury has written a short-story which carries that name (+
"I sing...") and I've been trying to read every novel + short-story that
I can find written by Him but He's not so popular here in Finland except
the books "Fahrenheit 451" + "The Martian (?) Chronicles" which have
been translated to Finnish language...
   Perhaps a ST-fan could kill this evil rumour before it goes around
the world. I'm not sure if it's true, but I have to ask it, anyway...

       I was at the local TOwER BOOKS today and saw something extremely
cool.   On the cover of the the latest Bass Player Magazine at the top
there was the headline      <<  The Best Bassist of 1991  >>
     Or something like that  and then   the picture of Gedd from the
Presto CD.  Inside it said that the new Rush album was almost complete
and that the title was still undecided. It was also said that it would
follow in the same direction as Presto did,  Less keyboards and an
emphasis on the trio atmosphereof Bass, Guitar, and Drums.  Geddy also
said that more time was put into preproduction of this album then before.

       Anyway I am glad that the band is still trying to change and try
new things.               Hurry up  sept 3rd!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You asked about 'The River' -- in the novel Huck Finn, (I hope I am
right :) ) Huck and Tom are basically traveling down the river,
learing about life. In every lit class I've been in, 'The river'
has been taken to stand for life itself,and traveling down the
river, is traveling through life.
So the modern day tom sawyer is riding out the days events..the river.
The day's events are the river of Mark Twain's day. The same thing-life.

Yes? No? :)

Oh, you asked about the list of listened to albums. I dunno who started it
first, but I recently suggested the idea instead of arguing about
Rand's philosophies.

Live long and prosper, be excellent to eachother!

Awesome! I love jamming to "Need Some Love" (Partly, of course, 'cause it's
something I can play, the rythyms are easier on the earlier albums) I was
slightly bummed that the B-Man in _Visions_ brushed off "Need Some Love"
as "not aging well".

If anyone's interested, the tab for Freewill was published in... uh...
I forget, but it was one the main guitar mags a few months ago, had an
interview with Alex. In the back it says how to set your pedals
(medium chorus, and just a little flanging and distortion, I never would've
guessed there's flanging in there, but my ear's getting better...)

Hey, Jason, how come no Rush songs in the drum machine :-)  ?
BTW, still waiting.... [now is Friday eve]. What songs are you working on?
Is anyone doing Circumstances or In The Mood ?

| They haven't done that since "Entre Nous" (PW), What You're Doing
                                           ^^^^^^^
Uh Oh, what's the penalty for this severe NMS transgression :-) ?
Wasn't it something like:

Article VII, Section 3.42.7 (A) (iii), paragraph 9:

>....and the most heinous acronomic violation is the lone "PW", which
may only be atoned by purchasing for all members the next major release
from Rush.

Yeah, something like that - CD for me, please!

Someone wondered what older songs they may revive for RTB tour. Funny I was
wondering the same thing about two days before I read it. I confess with
great humility that I missed the Presto tour, so if they did any of the
songs below last time around, then I'm wrong.

My guess: (one of:)

Jacob's Ladder
Natural Science
The Camera Eye

Help me choose a new username. I've been rjshaw for seven years now (they
do go by, don't they? 'member when p/g was the "new" album?) and I'm
going back to grad school in September, when I'll pick a new one.

Any Rush-related suggestions?

Yes, Neurotica is on Beat by King Crimson.  Funny, I had just finished listening
to that tape when the mail came in.  I don't believe Rush is doing a cover
version, however, since it's not really their style.  Parts of this tune are
really chaotic, with spoken lyrics.  Speaking of cover tunes, I'm dissapointed
that the Boyz aren't playing "Tumblin' Dice" by the Stones on this record! :)
And, for the record, my hard drive volume label is "lerxst".

I agree that tabs may be easier to write on an ASCII terminal than actual
musical notation, but these "requests for tab" make me think some folks
never learned to listen even though they've mastered the finger muscle
movements necessary for a guitarist. C'mon, faster solos notwithstanding,
ALL of Alex's guitar parts can be picked up on the first-second listening,
and the solos only take some more.

Also I would like to see Gregg Jaeger and David Sandberg take their Mission
debate to E-mail, I for one have no interest in reading the sort of analyses
Neil would say "get a life" about here at 1200 bps.

Anyone coming to Finland soon? August 17 is my birthday and we're planning
to play 2+ hours of Rush with friends (me on bass, vocals, keyboards, a
17-year old prodigy on drums (does everything Neil does and more!!) and
a guitarist friend)..

Hey, yo. I can't believe my eyes! They actually wished Geddy Lee a happy
birthday on MTV! I never would have known those losers knew who Geddy Lee
was, since they barely play anything remotely close to real music. They
should call it One Hit Wonder TV. On the 29th, they gave out a bunch of
happy birthdays to a bunch of people, including Michael Anthony of Van
Halen(Y'know, He doesn't even need his left hand, since he does all of
his playing with his right only, on the top string-WOW! He's real good!)
Then the last birthday they announced was Geddys' and then they showed a
clip from Exit, Stage Left and in BIG letters on the bottom of the screen
there was "HAPPY BIRTHDAY GEDDY!!!!". Wow. Must have been a night janitor
who is a big rush fan who snuck into the control room late one night and
set that up. Maybe MTV is having a change of heart? Nahhhh. They still
SUCK!!!!  By the way, has anyone seen that new WINGER Video? How about
the new SLAUGHTER Video? POISON? WARRANT? MOTLEY CREW? ENUF Z'NUFF?
TIFFANY? DEBBIE? NEW KIDS? FAGS!
Well, I got all all of that out of my system for today, fells good.
By the way, I think the new Van Halen sucks SH*T. It sounds just like the
last two albums! Don't they ever talk about anything else besides Sex,
girls, tits,drinking, and girls? It gets very tiresome, I think.
And we all know what a killer bassist Michael Anthony is! Yeah, RRRRight!
Later! Thanks again, james, for those boots you sent me! The Permanent

Sure, Sri. This is a nice one which reminds me of ``Who can face the
knowledge that the truth is not the truth  Obsolete  Absolute,'' which
threw me for a loop on the first few hearings. There would be a
contradiction if ``the wise'' were omnicient, certainly. But even
very smart people are susceptible to vanity, especially if they are
_told_ over and over that they are smart. For a beautiful person the
word ``mirror'' is meant literally, but for the wise I see the _mind_
as the ``mirror'' of wisdom reflecting back on itself. I think that

	Good day fellow Rush fans.  Forgive me if I seem out in left field
on recent Rush happenings, but I've just recently returned from a stay in
Germany, and an otherwise busy summer break.  I've been away from TNMS
for a few months, and resubscribed a couple of days ago.  I would
appreciate it if someone could update me on the new album.  I would like
to know when it is supposed to be released, and maybe some other odd info
like title and such.  Last I herd, the new album was to be released around
August or September, I was wondering if that still held.  Classes start in
two weeks, and thats the only thing that I'm looking forward to this fall.
If there are any of you thinking about going into Electrical Engineering-
DON'T- it's hell.  Oh well, enough complaining, I guess its time to clear
my mind of fawn-eyed girls with sun-browned legs, and get ready to hit
the books.....yea.  Anyways, if someone could end the ining, and bring
me up to date on the new album, I would be very much obliged.
	Oh, and remember to always hold the red star proudly,
high in hand.  Later ---------- Brian ------ ladage@ecn.en.purdue.edu

Yo there, everyone out there on NETLAND. I just received my issue
of Bass Player today. And guess who's Reader's Poll award 91 winner?

Yep, its the Gedmeister. He certainly deserves it. For those wanting
a copy of the mag. its the Sept/Oct. 91 issue. He also talks a little
about the new album too. He basically says they went back to the
guitar, bass, drum power trio w/ very little keyboards. He also, is
using a NEW custom made Wal bass. To quote Mr. Lee, "One thing that's
different about the new album is the sound of my bass. I have a new
WAL w/ a slightly larger body, and it has a deeper, more luxuriant
tone. I'm quite pleased w/ it, and I think it's given the group a
bigger sound overall." Finally, he says the album is in the same
direction as Presto but a little different. Can't wait to hear the new
bass and album :). Talk to ya all later. Hi, Pete any news yet???

Hello!  I'm a new subscriber to this newsletter, but I have an answer
to a posted question, and a question of my own:

As for the baseball-strike question:  As I recall, there was a baseball
strike in '83 (and one was narrowly averted in '82).  Not surprising that
Geddy would reword "Spirit of Radio" during that year.  (From previous
post for the great unwashed: "One likes to believe in the freedom of
baseball.")  It could have been worse -- GL could have been a Cincinnati
Reds fan during that year (the only year when having the best record
meant NO penant).  But enough baseball, here's my question:

I know that at one time, the boyz would like to play "3 Stooges" shorts
before their set.  I have heard that one particular short would be used
quite often because a relative of Geddy's appears as a minor character.
Is there any truth to this, or is it just a well-worn rumor?  (Or am I
spouting lunacy that can only be compared with the false rumor about
smoking banana peels?)

And oh yes, one final note:  At one time, Rush LPs and cassettes were
carried by Columbia House, as were other PolyGram/Mercury artists (e.g.
Scorpions).  Apparently, some time after '82, C.H. and PolyGram had a
falling out of sorts.  (Why do I mention 1982?   That's when a friend of
mine received his copy of Moving Pix from C.H. -- I think I still have
the very same cassette...)

The fact that this question showed up on this list leads me to believe
that "Roll The Bones" is going to be a concept album based on this short
story. I could be wrong. Please correct me if I am.

Anyway, to the person who asked what anthology it is in, it's in
_Dangerous Visions_, edited by Harlan Ellison. The story is by Fritz
Leiber, and it won one or two awards. The anthology is no longer in
print, but check around the local secondhand stores. You'll come across a
copy eventually.

<A NAME="304320">From: David Sandberg <sialis!dts@cs.umn.edu></A>

One last short comment about the Mission lyrics:

About the lyric "if their lives were exotic and strange", the
Neck Romancer writes:
> Neil wrote "If" as the first word, inferring that their lives
> *aren't* exotic and strange.

I don't happen to agree for a number of reasons; for one thing,
that implies a change of tense halfway through the sentence,
which is bad form and certainly unlike Neil.  As I see it, the
usage of "if" here is another common literary device; substitute
"allowing that" for the if and you'll read what I believe was
intended.  Another example would be "If Louis IV was king, he
was an unwilling king."

Unfortunately I don't have the time to go any deeper into
explaining this right now, so consult your local English prof
for additional info if you're interested.

Finally, I should add that the variety of interpretations of
the lyrics is of course a positive thing, as others have said.

Speaking of parties, there are less than two weeks left to the party in Buffalo
there is no place for us to jam.  I would like to get a list together of people
who are interested in partying with us.  As I said, we still need a place.
So, NMS readers in the Buffalo area, if you or if you know someone who has a
place where we can jam/party, please send me email soon.  I will be leaving for
Toronto on Saturday the 10th so I would like to know beforehand who is going to
show for the party.  C'mon Buffalo, it's time to do your "Rock N Roll Duty"

  It seems to me that Alex Lifeson doesn't get the recognition that he
deserves.  On a previous post, someone stated that Geddy was the best
bassist, Neil the best drummer and Alex... well     one of the best
guitarists.  I know that this is in no way putting down Alex, but in my
opinion Alex is just as good at playing the guitar as Neil is at drums
and that Geddy is at Bass.  Just because Alex doesn't tap all over the
neck of the guitar or play at 1,000,000 m.p.h doesn't mean that he isn't
as talented as Geddy or Neil are at their instruments. He plays just what
is right for the song. He also has the incredible feel that is so
important to music.  I just think that Alex should get his fair share of
compliments that he deserves.

WHJY-FM in Providence, RI, premiered _Dreamline_ at about 10:30 p.m. on
Friday, August 2. I had heard them talking it up for a while, so I managed
to get it on tape. I heard it again on Saturday. Needless to say, IT'S A
GREAT SONG!!! It's very Presto-like (the album, not the song) in its style -
it opens with a DEW-like wave sound, then Alex with a staccato intro, then
the single eighth note bass line and Crash! (the power chords). Overall I'd
say it's very reminiscient of Chain Lightning, but faster. If this is an
indication of the whole album, we're in for a good time kids! Again like
Presto, the guitar and bass are up-front with less of a role for the
keyboards. There's also a killer patented Alex guitar break. Has anyone
else had the pleasure to experience NEW RUSH?? :) :) :) :) :)

Two quick items of general silliness (scroll past if you want...) that should
go to whoever's collecting "You know you're a Rush fan when..." things -
I was in a craft store with my wife, looking at fake flowers, when I
spotted this spool of stuff called "Fiber Rush". "Fiber" was spelled in
blue, "Rush" was in _red_ - _EXACTLY_ the same style as on Hemisperes
(like written in blood). I picked it up to see if it was a Canadian product,
but it wasn't - it had "Made in the U.S.A." written in a circle around a
red star. (!!!)  one of you gals/guys out there works for this company, right?

secondly, my wife - who like a few other noted previously is not too fond
of Rush - was caught whistling  "La Villa Strangiato". Don't give up hope!
It's taken eight years, but she's starting to play Rush now because she
likes 'em!

I heard the new Rush tune yesterday afternoon as my girlfriend and I arrived
at the local mall where she lives...I made her stay in the car so I could hear
it.  She doesn't like Rush very much.  She really only likes Tom Sawyer and
Show Don't Tell.  She also can't stand Geddster's voice. ;)

Anyway, about the song...It was on 94.1 WHJY in Providence RI and they said that
they were the only station in New England to have this tune.(Yeah right)

Well, this is the first Rush tune(not song) that I have liked on the first
listen.  It was great.  It had sci-fi lyrics and it sounded really crisp
and clear.

It sounds like a good driving tune too.  Very fast paced song...and
there is also , guess what,...A GUITAR SOLO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It does follow the typical rock song format...

Intro, verse1, bridge, chorus, vers2, bridge, chorus, solo, bridge, chorus, end.

September 3rd can not arrive too soon.

My humble interpretation of these lines is that Power and Wisdom is
internal, and can't be seen in the mirror.  A wise or powerful person
who looks in the person will not see a reflection of that power or
wisdom.  In effect, the mirror lies.  On the other hand, people see
what they want, so someone who wants to be perceived as powerful or
wise may look into the mirror and see themselves as powerful or wise,
but the mirror lies about their inner attributes....

Hey, for all you Rushans who haven't heard Dreamline, it's awesome...
I hope the entire album has the same up-beat sound to it.  This song
seemed to sound alot 'happier' then some of the more recent RUSH
releases.  I definately give it two thumbs up...

I especially like, and I quote, "Learning that we're only immortal,
for a limited time"

I've always interpreted the wise in this usage to be those that believe
themselves to be wise, meaning that it is quite easy to delude oneself if the
mirror is the sole source of one's feedback.

In case you haven't heard, we are trying to get a Rush party together for
Saturday August 17th in the Buffalo/Toronto area.  We are having a problem
finding a place to hold it though, due to the fact that there will be live

If anyone in the Buffalo area would be willing to hold such an extravaganza,
we would be very appreciative.  When I say "host", I don't mean you have to
phone the caterers or anything, all we need from you is a little space for the
day... Also, this will not be a large get-together by any means.. probably no
more than 15-20 Rush fanatics.

Hope to hear from someone.... e-mail me if you can help.

     "Neurotica" is the name of a King Crimson song from the album _Beat_
and it is EXCELLENT.  I too was wondering if there was a connection (it
couldn't be a COVER, could it? :-/ ).  DO check this stuff out!  Great
stuff!  I like KC even more than Rush (gasp!  no flames please).  Which
reminds me of the "ten most listened to albums" lists so prevalent lately.

     7. "Three of a Perfect Pair"  King Crimson
     8. "Show of Hands"  Robert Fripp and the League of Crafty Guitarists
     9. "Mobo Splash"  Kazumi Watanabe

As I see it, it follows the previous line, which (though I haven't
looked at the lyrics lately), ends in a colon (I think).

"riding out the day's events:
 the river"

This makes it a reference to the original _The_Adventures_Of_Tom_Sawyer_
by Mark Twain. For the boy Tom Sawyer, a day's events revolved around
"the river." The Mississippi River.

BTW, an excellent book and my favorite Twain character. The best parts
of _Huck_Finn_ were the ones with Tom Sawyer, IMO.

I've just received a sheet advertising the new Rush fanzine
that Shane Faulkner mentioned in Digest 295.  It is run by
Steve Streeter and is called `A Show of Fans.'  If you want
the address, it is P.O. Box 292, Canton, Connecticut 06019.

The sheet I've got says: "Roll The Bones is out now.  What an
album it is, eh?! ..."  Either I wan't meant to receive it
until after September, or Steve has heard it already.  A bit
further down it says:
 "Why are we here?
   because we're here
    roll the bones
     Why does it happen?
      because it happens
       roll the bones"

Is that a quote from the title track, do you think?
I'm sure those of you with an imagination can start finding
hidden meanings in it, or imagine it as rap ...  :-)

Andrew.
