	The future of Rush set-lists?  Hard to tell...

	One thing I don't think is going to happen is that Rush drops the
songs Tom Sawyer and Closer To The Heart.  Although some of the fans on the\
list may think they're old, it logically doesn't make sense to drop them.  I
mean, they're their two most popular songs (I didn't say best, just most
popular).  Although die-hard fans may have seen Rush infinite times and are
tired of those songs, the fans who see them for the first time would say,
"Great concert!  But why didn't they play Tom Sawyer?  Or Closer To The Heart?"
	(I said something to this effect at the ELP show, when they didn't
 play Hoedown, one of my faves!)
	As for By-Tor and the Snow Dog, I think if we hear any of it, it'll
 be part of the instrumental section during the encore.  It's possible, but
 who knows?
	I think the big problem is that with 17 albums or so, it's hard to put
 representative songs from each album (+5 or 6 new tunes) in a 2 hr. concert.
 With the 5 or 6 tunes they'd do from the new album, + Neil's solo, Tom Sawyer,
 Closer To The Heart, Ghost Of A Chance (that'll be on the next tour, thanks to
 all the airplay it's gotten), and (maybe) Roll the Bones, that's half the show
 right there! (or there about...)

	How about we run a survey of what people would like to be on the next
 tour?  Just a thought...

I found a copy of Dream Theatre's Images and Words?? in a used CD bin and got
it for $9 and picked it up do to the recommend I found here.  It is not bad
(worth keeping) though I am glad I didn't pay full price for it.  I found
it to be somewhat Rush-like but perhaps a little too close to being glam in
some of its songs for my tastes, though there are definitely some worthwhile
songs.  My CD does the same sudden ending to song 1 which at first I thought
was a skip, but which I now think is a deliberate (and neat) way to end a
song.

It's a variation on the line "Candygram for Mongo" from the Mel Brook's
movie _Blazing Saddles_.

Inspired by Neil's play on words (as I often am), I felt this song gave
me yet another opportunity to try a parody...

I just bought a new set of golf clubs
thay all look very nice
had to have my name engraved
to protect my merchandise

there is tic and toc in my wristwatch
initials in my seal
my stuff is all identified
my name I won't conceal

There is no safe seat that I see
Even the shoes on my feet
Must practice writing thin
I'm using all of my pens

do the darts with persistence
keep a steady hand
tried to do my wedding ring
but diamonds turn to sand

sewn on the front of my sweater
the letters from my birth
middle one's the largest
although it's of least worth

They say I'm partly insane
love the sound of my own name
Must practice writing thin
I've used up all of my pens

things I lose will have their claimers
some will make it home
each of my initials are
on everything I own

Just did the car's front fender
License plate was just fine
Towels, luggage, and
my shorts are clearly marked as mine

A fear in the weight of my heart
That I and my junk might part

I must write thin
I need one more pen

         Hello Rush Fans,

I was wondering if anyone knows where John Rutsey is now, or what
he has done since leaving Rush.  I just bought the first album on
actual vinyl at a used record/tape/cd store here and was looking
at John on the back and wanted to know.  I have the tape and cd of
that one too, as many people do.  The actual album is interesting
with the pictures on the back.  I think paying $3.50 for the album
was a mint buy because the album is in perfect condition.  Does anyone
agree with me that the original Rush album is really a great one.
 It is quite intense compared with some of the other stuff.  Where's
John Rutsey now...boy, did he miss out...Neil Peart is still the
best in the world and always will be in my mind.  He is amazing,
not only how he plays, but his lyrics.  Does anyone know the truth
about the rumor of Neil having cancer?

This is just an opinion, but I believe this was done because the songs
is about death which always comes suddenly and without warning.  The
song ends this way too.  I thought it was pretty cool.

I agree that Dream Theater doesn't SOUND like Rush, but they fall under
the same 'progressive metal' category and many people who like DT also
like Rush.  They've been getting good publicity here, nonetheless :-)

First of all, I think it's ironic that someone posted a message about
female Rush fans or lack of them, now 30-60% of the posts on NMS are
by females.  Go figure!

Second, I would definitely attend a Rush convention, maybe help out a
little, and I'd drive some people if carpools were set up.

Third, since a new thread here seems to be "the best of" songs, Here
would be my lineup:

Working Man
In the End
Fountain of Lamneth (not the whole thing)
2112 (Discovery-Soliloquy)
Xanadu
Closer to the Heart
Circumstances
Spirit of Radio
Natural Science
Red Barchetta
Analog Kid
The Weapon
Grand Designs
Middletown Dreams
Prime Mover
Mission
The Pass
Presto
Superconductor
Dreamline
I always seem to get carried away when I try to make 'best of' albums,
but there are so many good songs it's hard to choose.
Later, all.

Amy!!!! Your aren't the only one whose father introduced them to rock music...
mine did too!!!

in the early to mid seventies, my old man was listening to...
Emerson, Lake and Palmer
Yes
Genesis
Black Sabbath
Led Zeppelin
Deep Purple....and by process of mental implantation, I became into them as well
but I only became interested in Rush two years ago....

Thats not because i didn't like them, just that I hadn't heard of them til then
(I live in Australia, where hardly any good o/seas music comes anyway)

anyways....bye all!!!

In response to recent posts whether anyone would actually go to a TNMS
convention, count me as a hearty yes. I just started reading TNMS in its
current incarnation a month ago, or whenever it was, and I think it's (for the
most part) really worthwhile. I'd like to meet the people whose opinions I
read and who love the band that I have gotten so much from.

I go to school in Connecticut, so Toronto is a multi-hundred dollar train
ride, but I'd go up for a weekend or even longer. I'm also willing to help
organize whatever I can--maybe a New England caravan or something.

Just my 2% of a buck---

well, this is truly a tough decision, and I'd have to say that it just
isn't possible to fit a ``best of'' for RUSH into only 90 minutes....
so I'm going to stretch things a bit time-wise.  sorry, but again,
it just can't be done in 90 minutes.

[list of choices deleted to save space....]

you left out some really critical stuff....

IMHO, the following simply can't be left out (no particular order here):

   La Villa Strangiato    (NO WAY this one can get left out!!!)
   A Farewell to Kings
   Xanadu
   Cygnus X-1 Book 1 --- The Voyage    (aka simply Cygnus X-1)
   Cygnus X-1 Book 2 --- Hemispheres
   Dreamline
   YYZ
   The Enemy Within
   The Weapon
   Witch Hunt
   Countdown (*)
   Losing It
   Chain Lightning
   Show Don't Tell

(*) yes, I realize that there are lots of people who don't like
    Countdown, but then, I still remember quite clearly when I was
    in pre-school, and my (then best friend, now brother/step-brother)
    kicked and screamed until they let us go inside and watch the first
    manned moon shot....since Countdown is dedicated to the next step
    in that voyage, well, you get the idea.....

of course, there are some in the original list that also (again, IMHO)
can't be left out:

   The Spirit of Radio   (title corrected....)
   Closer to the Heart
   Freewill
   By Tor and the Snow Dog
   Lakeside Park         (originally from CoS...not ATWAS)

ok, so does anyone who is in the mood to add these up know how many
90 minute tapes we're up to now?  :-)  and I know I'm still going to
kick myself later on and ask myself why I didn't include at least a
few more (if not quite a few more).

oh well, I think I hear a nice game of Harpoon calling....gotta run.
type at y'all later.

<A NAME="515013">Subject: Yet another " The first time I ..."</A>

Hello all, this is my first posting ever to anything ( save the applause )

I thought I'd throw in my "how I got listen to Rush" story. It was late into
my sophomore in (very) high school when I started getting into my older
cousin's music collection. He was into Rush for years and thought I ought to
give them a listen. At the time I was a stuanch U2 and Police fan, so I wasn't
paying attention to that "obscure metal stuff". I ask him what would be a good
start and he grinned and lent me his 2112 tape. And so I listened to it not
knowing what to expect ( I wasn't familiar with the radio playing Rush, or
so I thought ). I thought it was pretty cool, even though it sounded a little
dated ( like a 70's band trying to sound futuristic, whoah, what a
coincidence-they were ). I remember thinking what a cool idea of an album
having a theme, thus my fondness for concept albums. I listened to 2112 for
some time without a major urge to get more Rush until about a year later when
I caught Time StandStill on MTV. I fell in love with the song and prompty
bought HYF. That album became of the gems in my then fledgling music
collection. I still think that Open Secrets is one their best songs, Alex's
solo has that soaring quality to it.
Before the end of the summer of 87, I had most of Rush on tape and I started
discovering songs I heard on the radio. I remember hearing stuff from MP for
the first time and yelling, " I did't know that was them !! ". Ah, breaking
the Rush cherry, beautiful isn't it ?

The rest is history ...

One more thing, I'm a Marillion fan and was wondering how many times they
opened for Rush ? I heard they opened up for them in 85 or 86, but I'm not
sure. Did anyone see them, and how were they ? I think those two bands
together would make a spectacular concert.

                                          Later

<A NAME="515014">Subject: More on the Rush Convention</A>

OK.....

Last issue, Lisa posted a bunch of really great pointers for setting up
a convention type thing.  However, to go any further on most of them, we
need a number of people that are interested.  Rather than a net head
count, (since I don't have a large enough memory quota to accommodate a
couple of hundred email messages, I'm going to ask that if you're
interested in a NMS/Rush Convention in the beginning of the summer in
Toronto, send me a small postcard (via REAL POSTAL MAIL!!!!!!) with your
name, address, email address, phone number, and and ideas you'd like to
see, and similar advice, comments whatever (specifically good dates for
the convention). THIS is NOT an official reservation, etc.  It is just
to provide an estimate of how many people are interested, from where and
demographical info. If anyone has access to those fanzines and what not,
please forward the postcard request.

	My address is (I hope this isn't a mistake):

	John Santore
	1071 Morewood Ave.
	Pittsburgh, PA 15213
	U.S.A.

In a month or so, I'll try and make some preliminary phone calls to
hotels and stuff in Toronto (based on those numbers) and see if I can
come up with some useful information.

OK.... now's an official call for volunteers for help on organizing this
behemoth of a project.  I guess for now, I'll try and coordinate stuff
(but hey don't take this as an attempt to usurp the position or
anything.... if anyone else REALLY wants it, I'll step down in a sec).
I'm looking for:
	an events coordinator
	a transportation/logistics coordinator
	a legal advisor
	a promotions coordinator (also to coordinate with Anthem records)
	anyone else that would like to help

at some point I'm assuming that the planning will be taken off the net
(although we may ask for feedback on something now and again) and
discussed among the above group of people until we had tentative plans
set up, and then announcments made, etc.  Once again this is not to be a
jerk or anything, but it would be VERY inefficient to discuss every
little thing on the net.  If ANYONE wants a status report, feel free to
send me mail (at jsbh@andrew.cmu.edu) (or to any of the other
coordinators who's addresses will be similarly posted

For now, keep the discussions going. When we get some more feedback,
I'll try and formulate a tentative outline.

Ideas/events that warrant discussion (we need some discussion, people):

	Do we actually want a convention HALL or what?
	or just a loosely organized thing where people show up and do their
        own thing?
		how formal should this be?
		How many an what kind of stuff do we want there?

	Organizing the picnic to Lakeside Park (obviously this is an event)
		Location?
		Food/Catering? Everyone for themself? (remember cost....)
		Hiring of a sound system?
		Security?
		Permission (permits etc)?
		anything else?

      An official THIS IS HAPPENING document
		Sent to all fanzines and applicable newsgroups when something
         		concrete is set up.

	Acquisition of a Rush tribute band for the event
		cost?
		the actual deciding of the band (Only one I've heard about
		is Free Will, and I've never heard them personally)
		logistics pertaining to that (sound system, etc...)

	how exclusive is this convention going to be?
		just Net people?
		anyone?
		what about people who just show up there vs. people who pay in
		advance

	Money and stuff....
		Registration?
		Cost? (obviously we need something more concrete to determine 
		      this)
		Policy on people showing up?

anything I miss?
(from either this post or the last couple)

Anyone, EVERYONE, feel free to chuck cool ideas out for discussion....
Remember this will only happen because of you.

Yes, another nostalgic romp through more simpler times.  (*gag!*)

Try to stay awake through this one...I realize it's kind of late, but I had
VERY little time over the last month to read NMS's, therefore I just finished
reading THREE WEEKS worth of NMS's.

I think I was in seventh grade, right about the time Moving Pictures came out.
Surprisingly, it wasn't MP that I first heard.  In fact, it was my older
sister who unknowingly started me on my way.  I kept hearing her talk about
a song called 2112.

"2112?"  I thought to myself.  "What the hell kind of name is 2112?"

One night she asked me to tape it off of the radio.  One of the local radio
stations (K-SHE 94.7 St. Louis for the kids at home) was playing it in it's
entirety and I was the only kid in the family with a radio/tape player (you
know, the kind with only one speaker...anyone over twenty-one probably had
one of these at one point or another).  Under fear of physical violence I did.
After the "weird space intro" I lost interest and fell asleep (I was Y&D...
that is, Young & Dumb).  Later, talking to fellow cattle...or rather students
>...at the school I realized that it wasn't just my wigged out sister who
liked Rush.  So I decided to check it out.  I was impressed with how complex
and LOUD the overture was as well as the finale.  But what really got me
was what was in between.  The Discovery, The Presentation, The Oracle...that's
what hit me hard.

After years of listening to that crappy copy I finally started saving money
from mowing lawns and bought P/G which had just come out.  (Yes, I waited that
long.)  Then MP, CoS, AFTK, and Hemispheres.  Notable thoughts...

MP:	Side (yes, side) 1 -
		- WOW!
		- Whoa!
		- Wait a minute!  Roll that back!...What?  No lyrics? (like I
			said, Y&D)
		- YEAH!!
	Side 2 -
		- Yawn... (Y&D)
		- *Snort!*  What the HELL is that?...Ooo, cool!
		- Fu-nky!

Hem:	Side 1 -
		What?  (Y&D...as you can tell, I wasn't really up to snuff as
				a Rush fan back then)
	Side 2 -
		- Is that French?
		- Hmm!  Thought provoking.  (What can I say! I was a study-boy!)
		- What was that middle part? (Y&D)

(Note:  I think I may have got the order of songs wrong on the second side
of HEM)

The rest you can probably guess.  I'm happy to say that all the songs which
had Y&D next to them I now thoroughly enjoy, and that the only bad thing that
happened concerning Rush was that I learned my sister was just a fashion
monger and only liked 2112 because her friends did...heritic!

JUST KIDDING!!!  (please don't flame this very bad comedian...)

Incidentally, I noticed a lot of people relating how MTV used to play Distant
Early Warning and Big Money "every 5 minutes"...what MTV were you watching?
I used to have to work to catch one of those vid's!

Oh...right...I was a book worm...never mind.

     Don't get me wrong- I am a HUGE Rush fan.  I own all their pre-1982 albums.
I learned how to play Bass because of Geddy Lee.  They are my favorite band in
the world.  However, I can't help feeling that Rush was taken over by
record-company zombies sometime in 1982.  Everything after moving pictures
sounds like a different, much less talented band.  Gone are the intricate
musical structures and forcefull guitars, replaced by generic-sounding
mainstream pap.  I guess it's just another case of success ruining a great band.
I can't help feeling bad, though, because pre-1982 Rush is the best rock music
ever recorded, and since then they've just been producing the same sappy crap.
I pity the "RUSH" fans I meet who started with Presto, and know nothing before
Grace Under Pressure.  Truly sad.  Many of my friends feel this way, but the NMS
seems to like all the new stuff too.  Does anyone else care to dissent against
the rationalizers ("well, just because it's Rush, it's OK...")?

  Ahoy fellow Rush Fans around the world!!!!!!

  Good to be back and NMS'ing again.  A few things I'd like to respond
 to from the past issues:

 1.) First time I heard Rush
-----------------------------
    I was in 7th grade, a time when MTV was just becoming popular and
  there were no people my age who liked 'progressive' music.  I heard
  'Mystic Rhythms' for the first time, and absolutely went wild with it.
  I bought PoW and let everyone listen to it.  They thought I was nuts
  that is until they saw it on MTV.  I was appreciated a lot more ever
  since, although some people lost interest in Rush after PoW.  Oh well,
  some people ever learnn.  :)

2.) Stuff I'd like to see next tour.
--------------------------------------
    While it would be very disappointing to a lot of people...I'd think
  it's time to give Tom Sawyer the boot from the setlist.  Along with
  Closer to the Heart and Red Barchetta.  Some songs/additions I'd like
  would be to hear all of Xanadu and La Villa Strangiato, add Marathon,
  Mystic Rhythms, The Weapon, and Lock and Key.

3.)  The possible Rush conference in Toronto.
---------------------------------------------
     Simply put, wait until I hit the lottery...then I'll be able to go.

4.)  The 'NSF' on the square in the 'Big Money' video.
------------------------------------------------------

     Just a thought, but it could also mean "Not Sufficient Funds", mean-
   ing you'd lose some money if the board was actually a real game.  It's
   a thought.

5.)  How do you a make a .sig?
------------------------------

     Could someone just email me on how to do this.  I'd appreciate it.

                     That's all for now...  --> Jay Cook (aka J.C. Rush)

Hi all--
	I've been watching the discussion on here for awhile and finally 
decidedto stick my 2 cents worth in.  First, I think the convention would be a 
cool idea and I would *love* to go, but I'm not sure I'll be able to.  As I 
find out I'll let you know.  I hope this thing gets off the ground, even if I 
won't be able to attend.
	Second, I too have made a collection of Rush songs.  I didn't bother
buying Chronicles (hope this isn't a sin :) )  I decided to make my own.  From
having bought other released compilations before I usually find that I don't
particularly like the selection *or* the order of the songs.  So I do it
myself.  Is this illegal??  :)  Anyway, my Rush collection ended up taking up
3, 100 min. tapes, simply called _Rush vol. I (II, III)_  Is anyone interested
in seeing the track list?  I'd post it now, but it is three volumes, so if you
want to see it, I'll post it.  :)  I have also picked some less "popular" 
songs,some that haven't appeared yet on other lists, and of course, some of 
the classics.
	I can't really figure out how to end this thing so, I'll just stop now.
:)
