   Well someone in the last digest was saying that Alex was getting tired
   of touring well i was surprised to hear that Alex was playing with
   Gowan here in Toronto last weekend at Ontario Place ( i didn't go since
   my fantasy football draft was that day ! )I don't know if this was the
   only show Alex did with Gowan but if it wasn't, he 's definitly not taking
   a well deserved time off.

   Is Chronicles going to be released in sept here in Canada???

Howdy....
I spoke to my main rush contact on the phone the other day and got some good
info out of him. he was in Toronto last week and made his usual stop at Anthem
Records on our beloved Carlton St. He found out from the lady there that there
is to be a video released in conjunction with the Chronicals album. From what
I understand it is to have some of the older videos on it.

He also found out that they are prepared to start work on the next album in
November. Which may relieve some of the less optimistic of our clan.

He found Alex's place of residence in northern TO. I guess he rode by and
checked it out. I went with him by Geddy's house last year(a fairly large white
house/mansion with some debris in the front yard as well as a baseball...it
figures!!!!) My younger brother even got out of the car and knocked on the door.Talk about embarrassed...I was hiding under the seat. Some guy with shaggy blackhair answered the door , my brother asked if it was the Lee residence..the guy
said it was and my brother asked if Geddy was home. NO DICE!!!! Oh well...what
an awkward moment to say the least.

Finally...to the guy that inquired about Rik Emmett. I have the album...if
you want me to get you a CD send some cash...check...whatever and your
address to me. Send me e-mail here first for my add.

Just a quick comment on the brewing Deep meaning vs. just for fun
controversy.  It does seem to me that many (all?) of the individual
lines have some small message, but there really doesn't seem to be
a single unifying theme.  SO-called "anti-materialism" is only there
in spots (RUSH describes themselves as VERY capitalistic, by the way.)
and I think some of the attacks on religion are more just comments on
general moral decay.

Just my 2 cents,

Hear'n'Aid was a Heavy Metal benefit album for the Armenian quake, I think.
Ther are various (previously released) tracks on it, including "Tom Sawyer"
(I think) and "Owner of a Lonely Heart".  The main feature is a cover of
"Smoke on the Water" by Chris Squire, Keith Emerson, and many others.  One
or two of the Rush lads might have helped with the song...

Perhaps I'm confusing two benefit LP's.  Nevertheless, I am sure that the
Rush song on Hear'n'Aid is a previously released, studio version.

NEIL JOINING RUSH--Neil joined the band on July 29, 1974.
Signifigance: Geddy's 21st birthday!

[ ZAP.  Nailed it right on the head.  Ten points for Hinano!  (I'm 
  not surprised it was you!)                              :rush-mgr ]

RUSH MUSIC ON TV SHOWS:  There is a Canadian show called "Degrassi
High" (formerly "Degrassi Jr. High) which is basically aimed at
teenagrs and the kinds of problems they face.  There was one episode
whre this one guy, Joey, goes down to the local radio station to ask
if they could play his band's tape.  While he was there, they were
playing "Force Ten".  I was so happy!  Rush on TV!  It was neat to
hear.

ANAGRAM:  About my statement concerning the fact that Anagram had no
meaning:  I was being sarcastic...(!)  Thanx for the analysis, though.
I mentioned Neil wrote it for fun because that was what he said...just
quoting.

In response to davida's trivia question about Neil joining the band:
I don't have my source with me here at work, but the answer is in
the intro that Neil wrote for the "Complete RUSH" music books. He
either joined or played the first show (in front of 18,000 people?)
on Geddy's 21'st birthday, namely June 21st (I think) 1974. Which

[ Second place goes to Kent.  Sorry, missed first by 4 hours.  Also, it's
  July, not June.  Five points.  :-)                            :rush-mgr ]

puts Geddy now at a ripe old age of 37, if I can add (which I often
can't). But hey, some of the Stones are over 50, and they're
still standing, so let's not give up hope yet!! Ciao!

	Well, Geddy's middle name is "Lee".  He dropped his last name.
(I forget what it was--something long, eastern-european, and hard-to-
pronounce.)

I believe the beginning of Mystic Rythms was on the show "West 57th"  which
was not on NBC but CBS.  It lasted one season I believe.  Correct me if
I am wrong.

    Okay, first of all, here's the info on Visions.
    RUSH: Visions. The Official Biography, by Bill Banasiewicz
    Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-1162-2 Order number 44387

    It's a great book, by a longtime fan. He gives a lot of great inside
    info on the Boyz, but just remember that everything is from his own
    viewpoint. Still, it's a definate must-have fer the RUSH fan. Without
    it I wouldn't be able to tell you that Neil joined Gedd and Alex
    on July 29, 1974, which by the way, was Geddster's 21st B-Day. :)

[ Yet another correct answer!                                 :rush-mgr ]

    The sheer amount of trivia, along with that hilarious picture of
    Gedd and Alex in Junior High, make the book worth it's weight in gold!
    The author also mentions Gedd noting that there would come a time
    when the band wouldn't be around anymore. This was around '84, during
    the genesis of P/G, when the Boyz were having some tough times.
    Basically, they aren't having ANY problems getting along with each other.
    It's just that they seem to be realizing that the long months on the
    road are starting to take their toll, and that they'd like to spend
    more time cultivating their relationships with their families and
    friends. Let's hope that they can manage to find a good balance
    between the band and their personal lives!

    Now, can anybody provide some info on "Success Under Pressure" and
    any other books that are available? The rest of us will appreciate
    you guys and gals in the know sharing it with the rest of us! :)

    'Til next time!

Dave asks:

"What date (day, month, year) did Neil join RUSH, and why is it (day/month)
significant?"

Could it be 21/12/7?, where the date is read in the British (and Canadian?)
style:  December 21st?

Didn't think so...  The significance is too obvious.

A long time ago a nice person named Meg took some time to transcibe
the Presto tourbook. I thought this was a great idea and would like to
see more. Would someone who has pre-Moving Pictures books be willing
to do the same? I would be willing to do one or two post-MP books.
If a lot of people all did a different book we could swap a lot
of information quickly.

Comments?

I am old-time RUSH devotee, so I'm not up on the albums since Signals.
Two questions:

    1) Are there any live albums since Signals?
    2) Which of the albums is closest to the FTK-MOVING PICTURES PERIOD.
       (This dividing line is for my purposes only, because these are my
        favorite RUSH albums)

Thanks for any info.  (I'd experiment and buy them all, but my CD budget is
strained).
