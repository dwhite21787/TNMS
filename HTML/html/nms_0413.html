I got the tour book recently. From John's posting I was intrigued about
this photo, and quickly turned to it. Well, if you've seen the tour book
you'll probably realize that the three adjacent photos of the band
members are _jokes_ (I particularly loved the book _MUSHROOMS_ on the
table next to Alex). The photo of Neil I think was to make light of
Neil's intellectualism, just as Geddy has fake noses and ponytails
on the wall behind him. I mean, Neil's seen reading a _paperback_ student
edition of _The Poetics_; if he wanted to be pompous he could easily
afford some ancient hardcover edition to be seen with (maybe Coleridge's
own copy ;> ). I think the shadow is supposed to represent Neil's
Dionysean aspect...

Well...

In the last issue someone mentined that he/she was surprised
that no one had mentioned the narpet/npeart anagram before.
But it was...I definately remember reading that in NMS.

Also...how did the MTV mass call-in go?  I usually fall a week
or so behind, and I found out about it too late...  Also I
occasionally delete an NMS or two if I'm too far behind. So,
did RTB get on (I doubt it...)  And, I just read another attempt
to do this for Jan 1 and 2.  And that NMS arrived today, I think,
the third.  So what we need, if we are going to pull this off,
is a date set a week or so in advance to people like me will
see it, and it will be announced in time.  Let's see...Monday
a week from now will be the 13th.  (Friday the 13th falls on a
Monday this month!!!)  Let's say that the week of the 13th we
will try to flood MTV.  This will have to be the definative
attempt--anything sooner will not give the average NMSer
enough time to find out, and anything later would be to late
to make eMpTyV play it regularly...although around Sept I did
notice them playing NIN's Head Like a Hole a lot, and that song
is OLD, especially for MTV (over a year--and it was played a
lot).  So...there's hope.

Ok.  The Definative eMpTyV Bones Call-In
January 13th through 18th or 19th (one
of those days they don't have the call-in)
4:00 EST
Good _luck_ (I'm not going to try to fit an RTB quote in
with that--too easy...)

<A NAME="413003">Subject: Gangster of Boats</A>

according to Neil on RockLine, the Gangster of Boats is a running joke.  
for the past three albums, Geddy and Alex would bug Neil for the album 
title, long before he came up with a name.  they would then threaten to 
call it "Gangster of Boats" if he didn't come up with a name soon.

so, methinks, this is the fourth time they used the joke, so the part four 
of a trilogy is from "So Long and Thanks for the Fish," book four in the 
HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy.

also the original Gangster of Boats is supposedly the name given to the mac 
they use for ?????????? (Can somebody fill in the blank?)

I also saw the reference to the boyz in the Year in Rock show on MTV.  It is
very easily explained.  MTV did some of the taping of the show on the street
in front of Madison Square Garden right around the time of the two sold-out
shows at MSG here in NYC.  So the camera caught the marquee for MSG.  Simple
as that!  Enough said about that.

I'm still looking for any and all info on the Florida dates, more specifically
I need on-sale dates and promoter information.  Please help.  Does anybody
know if any of the Texas or Louisiana dates are on sale yet.

Please let me know.  Thank you.
I can be e-mailed directly at jalhart@bart.skidmore.edu

Could you please remail your message?  My terminal does not allow lines longer
than one screen and truncates such lines instead of allowing the words to wrap
to the next line.  Thus, I lost most of your message.

This was concerning a request for a dub of the Rockline show.

So is there a good book that looks objectively (NPI) at Objectivism?  I just
watched the Fountainhead last night -- don't have time to read the book... I'm
in the middle of Foucault's Pendulum :) -- and thought the ideas were
interesting, but the way it was presented was too preachy and propagandaish.
So is there a good opposing view to read?  Respond via private email,
please, I doubt most Rush fans care about this sort of thing.

No, it's not really ironic, they just think that Rush changed their music to
get on the radio, rather than wait for radio trends to change enough to get
more Rush on the radio.  I disagree, though; I think both Rush music and
radio trends have changed and sort of met in the middle.  Though I don't
really think Rush ever had any problem getting radio airplay, ever since
"Tom Sawyer" and especially after "Time Stands Still".  But I am glad that
radio is finally becoming more liberal again -- not liberal as in
"left-wing" but liberal as in open-minded -- and playing things like Jesus
Jones, EMF, Nirvana, and Soundgarden.

I guess I am, because I can't stand the new Metallica album...  I definitely
think they changed their music specifically to get more radio and MTV play,
and I don't like the way they've changed one bit.  But I'm just a crotchety
old fan, they don't need me to buy their CD's anymore anyway...

I've heard a more relevant comparison: "Do you still wear the same clothes
you wore 10 years ago?"  I think this makes more sense, because I don't see
anyone wearing fat ties and wide lapels, whereas many people do keep the
same ideology all their lives.  That's why I think Rush has stayed more
consistent than Genesis, because they still have the same spirit, the same
purpose, in their music as they did 10 years ago.  I don't mind the change
in form -- like adding a rap section -- as long as they remain true to their
values: musicianship, songcrafting, and intriguing lyrics, and above all,
integrity.  (Geez, now I sound just as preachy as Rand...)

Anyway, I'm looking forward to a great great concert in Oakland; this'll be
my fifth Primus show, and it looks to be the best!

Hope you all have a happy new year,

     What's up. I didn't see the story on Hard Copy about the groupie but 
I got enough info from the previewws including what she looks like (ugly).
Anyway, she's gonna be on another show (The Maury Povich Show, I think), 
airing here this
coming Monday. Now, normally I stay away from these trashy TV talk shows in
lieu of more valuable programming (Married With Children :->), but seeing as
how there is all this talk about her meeting Rush, etc., I'll be sure to catch
it. I'll post if anything interesting comes up.

RTB)  I am not so lucky as to have a RTB tourbook.  Did anyone ever try
translating the skulls and bones to find a message?  If so, what was it?

GIFs)  Just a note, Paul, but I havn't had trouble with any of the GIFs I've
leeched from Syrinx.  Only trouble I've had with a Rush GIF was a blow up 
of the
2112 cover that took over a meg of memory to view.  Course, I'm on a Mac, too.

Also, still looking for any information on unreleased Rush songs, "Party On",
the regge version of "Working Man", a big book of Rush music, any possible
recordings of the full "Fly By Night", or a transcription of the Rockline show.

<A NAME="413011">Subject: Poll Announcement</A>

Greetings Rush Fans,

  	I'm writing _again_ to ask for votes in a poll I'm conducting.
Excluding the members of Rush, I'd like to know who you, Rush Fans, consider to
be the best:1)Keyboardist 2)Guitarist 3)Bassist 4)Drummer and 5)Vocalist.  I
know polls have been conducted before, but they haven't seemed to be too
succesful.  That is why I am posting this announcement to ask for YOUR votes.
Besides, with a mailing list of over 1100(?) we should get a pretty good
idea of what Rush fans really like.  So how 'bout it, give me your votes.
Your votes can be e-mailed to: smm0264@ritvax.isc.rit.edu
                               smm0264@ultb.isc.rit.edu
                               smm0264@ritvax.bitnet

						-Sean Morrison
PS-  Depending upon the responce, I plan to post the results by 1 Febuary.
I know that many of you have just gotten done with your first semester.  I will
continue the poll long enough so that I will hopefully be able to collect your
votes as well.
