Hi all,

    This is advance warning (for once) that there will be no NMS for
Friday, 5/31/91, as I'll be lounging in the mountains of north-central
Maryland.  The next issue after this one should be next Monday, 6/3.

<A NAME="248302">From: DSchmidt.311@postman.gsfc.nasa.gov!</A>

I missed the Presto Concerts, and I am curious as to which songs they
played.  A friend claimed that they played "A Farewell to Kings" at the
Long Island show.  Can anyone verify or rebuke this?

BTW: If you havn't listened to the first album in a while, check out the
song "Before and After."  It quite possibly might be the most underated
Rush song ever!  It really is a great song!

- saying the words "i think i'm going bald" doesn't seem like such a
  bad thing.

- some one is mad as hell and says they're "seeing red" and you resond
  by saying "not blue" or "it hurts my head."

Well, Wade, I'm not going to jump down your throat, but your
impression of women really needs some work.  Or you need to meet some
different women.  Anyway, most _people_ I know, male and female,
listen to music "casually."  I know more male dance-music freaks,
house heads and mix-a-holics than female ones.  And there isn't
anything wrong with that.  They don't have to live up to any standard
of "serious music," and they might actually be good people anyway!
Imagine that!

Sorry for the sarcasm, but it bothers me when people generalize like
you have.  If there's a dearth of female Rush fans, it might be
because the band is composed of three guys ("boyz") who don't really
speak to women that much (they have said so themselves).  Or it might
be because women aren't given enough of a chance.

On other topics, Queensryche IS a very good band.  If you like bluesy
hard rock, you might also consider picking up Temple Of The Dog, a
band whose debut disc has just come out.  The latest Elvis Costello
album is great, too.  I could go on, but the TNMS might turn into
a copy of "my CD collection."

<A NAME="248006">Subject: Women liking (disliking) RUSH</A>

Greetings Programs,
	Noticing how long this thread of conversation dealing with females
who like RUSH has continued, I felt that I had to put my thoughts (few though
they are around finals) in on the matter.  I have not had much experience
attempting to show other people the light of RUSH fandom since I have only
known about them since _Presto_ came out.  Yes, it was a male who introduced
me to them and led the way to my first (and so far only) RUSH concert, in
Columbus, Ohio where I had seat 13 in row 13 on the 13th of June.  13 is my
lucky number, by the way.
	For a minute there I thought I was digressing but I don't think I
was, though I probably am now.  Anyway, after being converted to RUSH, I
attempted to convince my then girlfriend that they played good music.  She
claimed to like them, but not enough to want to see them in concert.  Most of
my female friends tend to turn up their noses at the slightest mention of
RUSH, though I think they are getting wise to my current tactics, feigning
placid interest until they can distract me from my quest.  My current
girlfriend gave me the most interesting reason for not liking RUSH.  She said
that she did not like them because their music "fits together too smoothly."
Huh?  I'm still trying to figure that one out.  Ah, she is so perfect, yet
she doesn't like RUSH.  It's almost... inconceivable.

Personally, I think they should call the new album "Abdul".

(For those who avoid MTV even more than I do, Paula Abdul has a new video
called "Rush Rush" and they've been promoting it a lot.  Prior to that I
thought they were actually improving a little.	They even run ads for the
Church of the Subgenius!)

Somehow, my bass lost two strings when mailed to TNMS.  The lick is played
on the first (G) string, mentioned to clear up any potential confusion.  If
our esteemed Rush-Mgr decided to edit my article, that's quite alright, it
just threw me for a loop when I saw my two-string bass in the mail!

[ Nope, I didn't edit it.  There seems to be something strange happening
  WRT tab transcriptions.  I'm still looking into it...          :rush-mgr ]

On another note (sorry!), my high school band director told me this story
about a visit to a bank he made.  He was waiting in line at the drive thru
teller, and the car behind him was making quite a lot of noise.  The car was
misfiring, like a spark plug was bad.  The neat thing, however, was that the
car was misfiring in a 7/8 rhythm.  My band director thought, "This guy is
probably a huge Rush fan, intentionally pulling a plug to get the rhythm".
He waited around after his business was over, and was shoked to see Rush
bumper stickers across the back of the car!

One more thing, for all you "Strange Brew" fanatics.  I'm not positive, but
I thingk the MacKenzie's van (is it a van?) has a Rush bumper sticker on the
back.  This is visible when they are underwater, drinking beer and placing the
bottles on the ceiling.  I've seen the movie two  too many times, and can't
bear to check this out, so could someone do this for me? Thanks.

In the last issue someone said that "for our visions of paradise" wasn't
the correct line.  I'm listening to it right now, and trust me, it is.
Listen to it with headphones if necessary, though it's never caused me any
trouble without them.

I also noticed that there is a misprint in the
lyrics on my CD booklet of Freewill from 'permanent waves'.

The same as mentioned in TNMS#247 by Lance Neustaeter.

"If you still choose not to decide
You cannot have made a choice"

But on the CD it is distinctively as we all have heard over and over...

"If you choose not to decide,
You still have made a choice"

The label (Mr. rush-mgr ;-) ) is MERCURY (PolyGram Records 1980)
The CD # is 822 548-2 (M-1).

Yet Another Unsupported Guess At What The New Album Title Really Means!

Perhaps the Boyz are taking an *entirely* new direction with their
music, one that none of us fans could have guessed.  Then "Roll the
Bones" re: gambling could (in one aspect) mean "Hey, were taking a big
chance here, and we'll see how it goes over."

Just a quick Thursday morning thought.

Hi all,

    I was talking to another NMS member (hi Barry), and mentioned that
Saturday, June 29th would be a reasonable date for a party if someone
felt like throwing one.  He mentioned that was a fortuitous date, as
a certain bassist we all know was born on that day.  Maybe a 38th
birthday party... ?

    This *isn't* an announcement, just a thought.
