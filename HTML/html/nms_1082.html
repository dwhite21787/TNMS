Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation...

	In the last NMS, someone asked why Ayn Rand and, by extension,
Neil Peart have been called "fascists" by some.  First of all, I am an
experienced student of Rand, and , you were absolutely right: Ayn
Rand's philosophy *is* about individualism.  In fact, it is as far
from fascism as you can get.  Neil Peart has his own philosophy, which
borrows here and there from Rand, which is equally individualistic.

	Why, then, would someone be so stupid as to call Rand and
Peart "fascists?"  The answer is clear.  Rand and Peart both believe
in freedom and capitalism.  They abhor collectivism and it's economic
manifestation: socialism.  Again, why would they be labeled "fascist?"
Don't they sound extremely anti-fascist?

	The answer is clear.  Liberals hate freedom and capitalism.
Thus, they attempt to smear anyone to the left of Bill Clinton by
calling them "fascists."  Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and many other
conservatives who are clearly within America's political mainstream
have been called "fascists" by malicious liberals.

	C'mon, guys!  Grow up!  Neil Peart is as anti-fascist as you
can get.  He opposes fascism, socialism, and all forms of
collectivism.  He espouses freedom (economic and political) and
individualism.  Liberals just hate to see an intelligent, articulate
celebrity like Neil opposing socialism.

					--"laissez faire"

BTW, the recent discussion of "The Trees" has been excellent.
Clearly, this song is about the horrors unleashed when governmental
force is used to enforce "equality."  Why do people think all the
problems in the world can be solved by making everyone equal?

hey fellow rush fans!  obviously this is my first post...I was first
introduced to rush via tom sawyer on the radio.  it was on of those songs
you really like, but don't know who played it, but i was young and
ignorant.  i went to the CP tour in april at the Target Center in
minneapolis, minn.  i can legitamately say that the concert was the best
i have ever seen!  i have so much respect for all the boys!!!  i had
great seats (main floor, 7th row) and i happended to catch a killer
drumstick that alex tossed out! --i have had a few offers and i am not
interested in selling it either....sorry :) --damn i was stoked!  we even 
brought
the dice out to toss when they played RTBs...about opening bands, primus
opened and they were freekin great!  i have not listened to much primus
but they kicked off the show just right.  unfortunately i was not too
familiar with rush when i went to the concert, i just knew the songs that
were on the radio and a few my roomate played.  i managed to score CP for
$10 and i now intend on completing a rush cd collection.  how is that for
a rookie?  damn good i think...damn good experience, one i will *never*
forget!  sorry bout the length.  =)

pop in some rush and rock out!

<A NAME="1082002">Subject: Rocinante's final flight...</A>

Greetings fellow fans!
  I was listening to Hemispheres this morning in my car on the way to by
8:30 class and I was struck by a set of lyrics that never struck me before.
 Armageddon - The Battle of Heart and Mind
   Some who did not fight
   Brought tales of old to light
   My 'Rocinante' saild by night
   On here final flight
When I first looked at the liner notes at a stoplight (to make sure I heard
Geddy correctly), I said to myself, "Self," I said, "at first perusal, this
doesn't make sense. Neil has jumped time and space in the matter of two
lines. First he talks about guys who didn't fight telling stories, then he
jumps all the way to "A Farewell to Kings" to bring in the Rocinante." But
then I said to the same self, "Self," I said, "that is some brillant
writing. Neil has incorporated a great linguistic/story device that is
seldom used in literature. The ones who tell the "tales of old" are actually
bringing the Rocinante to their universe by their telling!"
  Not bad on Neil's part. I'm trying to recall other writers in literature
that have used this device. I know I read a fantasy novel at one time that
used this. Oh yeah, now I remember. It was Brian Daley's "Coramonde" series.
But in that case, there was a wizard involved. Anyway, I just wanted to
share that with you all. Maybe finally, someone will quote me or take up a
thread I started! Hasn't happened yet, but it hasn't been for a lack of trying!

YKYAARFW...
   You grow your beard (for spring traing...it's tradition for me...don't
ask me why, ok?) and on the weekend before opening day, instead of shaving
the whole thing off, you leave a goatee just like Neil's in the liner notes
of CP (or Counterparts for the guy who doesn't like the abbrev. "CP" :) ).

Later,

  I am undoubtedly one of the biggest Rush fans ever. I saw Rush for the
first time in Pittsburg at the old Stanley Theater. The Heavy Metal Kids
opened, followed by Rush then Kiss. This was April, 1976. All for $5.50.
Fly By Night had just been released. I had never heard of Rush, and
apparently, neither had many others. I immediatly bought Rush (with John
Rutly, or something like that at drums) and Fly By Night.
  Since then, I have seen Rush in Pittsburg again (many times), Charleston
and Huntington, WV, San Diego, CA and Washington, D.C. The only tour I've
missed is the last one, for Counterparts. I was out of the country, and I
knew there would be a performance in the Norfolk, VA area ( I live in
Virginia Beach ). I got back home in May of 1994, only to find out that
the local show had been scheduled for April but was cancelled due to an
illness and would not be rescheduled.
  Both arenas here, The Scope and Hampton Colesium are fairly small. Just
yesterday, the Virginia Beach city council gave final approval for a
20,000 seat amplitheater to be opperated by Cellar Door. It should open
in April, 1996. Hopefully, Rush and many other bands will come to the
Hampton Roads area.
  I'll end this with a statement and a question. First, I think Rush is a
fabulous band with immpeccable talent. Their musical ability is unsurpassed.
The live performances are a real pleasure to attend. Which leads to my
question. Are a new CD and tour in the works ?
  Thanks.

Just to insert my 2 cents, many people mention that they prefer the live
version of 'Beneath, Between, and Behind'. I disagree, personally I like
the studio version better, because it doesn't sound as muddy as the ESL
version. And, I'd personally pay $20 to the person (obviously one who
NEVER heard of the song) who can listen to the ESL version of this song,
and recite back the correct lyrics.

PS- Out of sheer boredom, I gophered up the lyrics to the first album and
read them all. After reading the word 'yeah' and 'baby' at least 10 times
in every
song, all I can say about that album is: "Thank GOD Neil came along!!!":-))

, however, I feel obligated to help complete the list of great bassists that al

<A NAME="1082006">Subject: Anthem and 2112</A>

            Just to throw my two cents into the mix...

I have a copy of the "Rock 'n' Roll Comics" that is devoted entirely to
Rush.  In the comic, there is a section in which the boys discuss 2112.
Please remember that this magazine is not sanctioned by the band, and is
designed merely to give an entertaining history of the band through
cartoons.  I don't know if their info is genuine, but it is another
perspective...

Neil:"We're hardly just a "hard rock band" anymore, Geddy!  We've come a
long way from twelve bar jams and that whole crotch-rock glam attitude!
W're not just POSEURS anymore."
        "Our songs have depth, feeling, complexity...something to SAY!
Which reminds me of some new lyrics I've been working on..."
        "I know we already did a song about this book (he is holding a copy
of Ayn Rand's ANTHEM) on FLY BY NIGHT, but I really don't think it came
across.  I'd like to use it again and fashion a more, well, COMPLETE musical
story around it. Kind of a rock 'n' roll novel"

Alex:"I get the feeling this is going to be a llooonnnggg song!"

Geddy:"What the hell, songs like "By-tor and the Snow Dog" average around
ten minutes long already!  That's the direction we've been moving in."
        "You KNOW the only reason CARESS OF STEEL and the single flopped was
because it got no AIRPLAY!  If we do another side-long song, that's gonna
look pretty self-indulgent."

Alex:"The way I see it, we either a) break up, b) go back to being Led Zep
jr. Poseurs or c) stick with our original mandate and just do what the hell
we WANT to do!!"

This section is copied directly from the c.1992 comic book on Rush published
by Revolutionary Comics.  Todd Loren, President.  The sections printed in
all caps were printed in bold in the comic.

Also, I've noticed Rush as of late works like clockwork.  A new album
usually comes out about every 26 months, and they tour through NC about
every other year in early March.  Granted this is based on only the last
three albums, but based on this schedule, I predict a new album to be out
around Thanksgiving.

Well, here's my two cent's worth of YKYAARFW

 ... after washing and drying your laundry (which includes a Rush concert
T-shirt), you immediately change the shirt you currently have on and put
on the Rush T-shirt, so you're not only putting on a warm T-shirt, but a
warm RUSH T-shirt.

<A NAME="1082008">Subject: Rush lyrics in Yearbooks</A>

     Hello,

        To continue the topic of Rush quotes in yearbooks, my brother's
     senior year at Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, CA theme or
     motto was Time Stand Still.  The class of '89 printed the entire song
     on the inside cover of the yearbook.  They also had clocks and the
     Salvador Dali painting (I forgot the title) in the background behind
     the lyrics.  It looks awesome.

        I became a Rush fan in 1991 so I never noticed this tribute until
     last summer when I was flipping through his yearbooks.  I don't think
     many people noticed it because there was no reference to who wrote it
     or where the "poem" came from.

     Just thought I'd share,

Actually I think that it would be nicer to hear other bands cover
Rush material instead.  Can you imagine a Rush tribute album?
One day there probably will be a tribute album for Rush.  Why do I say
this?  Well firstly, check out all the tribute albums out there.  You
have the one for KISS, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, and even the
Carpenters.  This is just off the top of my head.  I'm know there's more.
But seriously, there are lots of bands out there that have cited
Rush as a key influence.
I'm talking about bands like "Dream Theater", "Metallica", and "Living
Color" to name a few.  Can you see Metallica covering a song like
say 'Tom Sawyer'?   I can't see Lars Ulrich handling the drum
parts as well as Neil though. :)

I must take issue with Gerard Decatrel, who, in issue #1079 made the
following comments regarding "The Trees":

>The song is *not* about taking a little pain for the sake of equality.  It's
about what happens when a group tries to attain equality by destructive and
coercive means.<

Sounds like a very racist and/or sexist-driven statement to me. "a group
TRIES to attain EQUALITY"? Please justify your statement.

>The maples could have occupied a different part of the forest that they
would own outright and where they would not have to compete with oaks for
light.<

And I'm sorry, but that sounds like forced segregation to me. Go be with your
own kind, etc.

I hope I'm misundestanding you, though with the number of insecure racists in
this country, nothing would surprise me.

Now for some Rush-only content. Um, I'm currently listening to "In the End"
from "All The World's A Stage" - good stuff.

Has anyone else heard any word on an Alex Lifeson solo record? Atlantic
Records in LA was clueless when I asked them.

Props to the Rush mgr.

PS - Anyone interested should check out my short reviews of "Power Windows"
and "A Show Of Hands" for the new "Sports" issue of huH magazine, which
should be out now. "Marathon," obviously, is the sports tie-in.

<A NAME="1082012">Subject: RUSH STUFF</A>

Hi Everybody! (spoken like Dr. Nick Riviera from The Simpsons)

  I've just been reading through a number of messages posted on TNMS and
since I live in Toronto i wanted to answer a couple of inquiries I've
been reading about.
  First off, to the person who asked about "Subdivisions" - the city you
see in the video is Toronto.  The first shot of the highway interchange
is (I believe) a change from HWY 401.  The highschool you see in the
video is a school called "Lameroux" (pronounced Lam-a-roo) which is
located in a suberb of Toronto called "Scarborough" (pronounced Scar-bro)
 and is in the Finch Avenue/Birchmount Ave area of the city (about 15
mins from my house).  The rows of houses you see in the video are
subdivisions is Scarborough as well.  If you travel through Scarborough
(not that i recommend it) you'll notice alot of sidestreets which are
designed exactly like that.
  With respect to "YYZ"-  YYZ is the airport coed for Lester B. Pearson
 Airport in Toronto (also called Toronto International Airport), and I
believe the opening sequence (Neil Peart playing his crotales) is the
rhythmic equivalent to the flashing pattern produced by the Airport's
beackon.
  And the reason the song is called "YYZed" is because that is the way we
Canadians pronounce our "Z's".  So, seeing as the airport code is one
from Canada, it is pronounced "YY-Zed" thus the correct pronounciation of
the songs title is "YY-Zed"
  You may notice alot of differnet spellings in my letters as compared to
those from the States..especially the words which end in "our".  Words
like neighbour, and colour, and odour...Americans drop the "u".
  Anyway, I hope this message clarified and questions you guys had.  It's
great living in Toronto.  Did I mention I live in the suberb of
"Willowdale", the suberb in which Geddy and Alex grew up?  Their high

I can't play guitar *at all*, but my personal Alex Babe solos are:

"Limelight" -- that man could melt Antarctica with this solo...
"Ghost of a Chance"
"Distant Early Warning"
"Between the Wheels"
"Witch Hunt", from ASOH -- ho-ly jeezus-god...squirm...melt...squirm...

Hi gang.  Long time, no post.  I just had to tell a quick story about
what happened in my physics lab last Monday...

A friend returned my "Images and Words" CD (Dream Theater) and I had it

to see Dream last fall--are you reading this "Crash?") and the subject
of Dream Theater came up..

Someone "Who do they sound like?"

Me      "Well, kinda like Styx-Kansas-Metallica-Yes-Rush"

Someone else "Thats a great combo (or something like that)

<A NAME="1082017">Subject: Fascism</A>

Back in the '50s or so, and up until about 1970, it was pretty much
accepted as fact that the only alternative to fascism was communism or
socialism.  The idea is still fairly prevalent, but it isn't
automatically acknowledged as true, especially following the collapse of
the Berlin Wall, the USSR, and most of eastern Europe.

Even now you can listen to leftist politicians denounce the right as
fascists (or racists, or sexists, etc.), as if merely uttering the word
constituted a rational argument.

So when Rush (with the acknowledged influence of Ayn Rand, who fought for
capitalism) _don't_ become spokesmen for the cause-of-the-week, or write
songs based on Marxist ideology, and so on, commentators such as the two
who were mentioned jump to the erroneous conclusion that they are (or
were) fascists.  (I'm giving the commentator the benefit of the doubt on
this point.  He may simply misunderstand what they are saying.  But it is
entirely possible that he does understand them, and wishes to slander
them.)

On to better things, and keeping with the thread of "best places to listen
to Rush..."
Earlier this year, I was riding with my grandfather in his '68 911 Targa
(porsche of course), and Red Barchetta came on the radio.  My grandfather
tried to change the channel...nope, sorry gramps, not a chance.  After
making some comment about a chipmunk singing, he agreed to leave it.  I was
enjoying the music, and just when Geddy was " shifting and drifting," my
grandpa starts to accelerate.  When I was younger I used to always ask him
to go fast with me in the car, but he always used to say no.  But as the
engine began to scream going 60 in third gear, he suddenly dropped it into
fourth, and we really started moving.  As we topped 90, "hot metal and oil"
blares, and then the screaching of tires. By that time I was covered in
goose bumps and having the time of my life!!  Although we weren't breaking
any speed records, the song made it seem like we were.  At the end of the
song, gramps slowed down, and said he was only keeping the engine worked
out.  I tend to think that Red Barchetta simply makes people drive fast
regardless of their tatse (or lack of it) in music.  Anyway that's my all
time best venue to listen to Rush, but it's so damn difficult to recreate! : (

If you don't agree with what I said about the Trees, fine.  But don't go
ripping it all over TMNS.  It makes both you and your views (which I
frankly can't understand) look really, really bad.  You can do one of two
things...(1) E-mail me a private flame.  I won't like you much and will
probably kill it, but at least you'll have gotten it off your chest and
harrassed the living bejeezus out of someone who doesn't deserve your
venom.  Or (2), which is much preferred...let it go and DON'T SAY
ANYTHING TO ANYONE about it.  Be cool, be polite, and understand that
everyone has a right to her own view.  You'll come off looking like less
of an ax-hole by far.

A note, which may or may not be relevant...

I can relate to the Maples, being of the "smaller" species (female) and
hating to be in anyone's shadow.  Perhaps a radical plow-down wouldn't be
such a bad idea.  Having fallen through the rips in the social safety net
more often than I care to admit has made me very sick of those whiny old
white men who claim that women, minorities and the disabled are
"stealing" all their jobs.  I'd love to steal a job, but can't even come
by one honestly unless it involves being asked (rudely) if I "work here"
or entails my having to ask people if they want fries with that!  And
frankly, as someone with oodles of talent but little experience, it burns
me to see stupid people get hired for several times what I made in my
last job (salesclerk, min. wage, part-time with no hope of advancement
till hell freezes over) just because they have some dangling external
genitalia.  Our society's hiring practices are neither egalitarian nor
meritocratic, they are just screwed up!  (And skewed in favor of the Old
Boys still, no matter what anyone says.)

Gerard, your pro-separatist (or whatever the hell it was) argument
doesn't wash with me.  I'm in no position to opt out of society, much as
I might like to do so.  I want to see it improved.  And if that involves
cutting some deadwood down to size, so be it.  Pass me my chainsaw!

Apologies to others for the Rant mode and the bandwidth.  No flaming
please.  If you don't agree, you will just have to keep it to yourself.
Sorry!  (And any Maples who care to commiserate, agree, or plan a better

Hi, fellow RUSH FANS,

Briefly, I like almost ALL RUSH (yes even the synth "crap" :). I was raised
on Moog Keyboards :).  I am a Electronics Tech. student at Northern IL
University, and an amateur musician (bass player, midi sequencing).  I've
been listening to Rush since 1987 (it got me through the HELL that was High

The best definition I can give (and it may not help) is music that
doesn't suck :)  Sorry,  couldn't resist.

Seriously though Here's a definition by example RUSH, YES, ELP (Emerson,
Lake, and Palmer)

To further ramble on it is ROCK and ROLL that involves complicated
drumming, sometimes the use of different time signatures other than 4/4,
borrowing of stuff from Classical and Baroque Music.

<A NAME="1082021">Subject: Bass Players</A>

As an ex-guitarist, I'm not qualified to judge bass technique, so if a
bassist wants to critique Geddy's chops, I have to say he's probably at
least somewhat correct.

On the other hand, regarding his comment on Geddy's being deficient as
part of a rhythm section, I have to say this: When you've got Neil behind
you, you've got all the rhythm section a three-piece can handle! Also,
could you imagine how thin Rush would sound if all Ged did was keep time
with an open E ;) ? The way his playing complements Alex's is a lot of
what makes Rush Rush! (Yeah, and Neil's, too!).

There are as many ways of playing an instrument as there are musicians;
most guitarists, nowadays, do not finger "correctly:" death grip on the
neck, dead pinkie, etc. Alex, like it or not, is one of them. I feel
a lot of that comes from self-training---learning from an old schooler
would probably not have permitted such lack of discipline. On the other
hand, that same type of discipline would most likely have killed off any
attempts at expressiveness, and we all know this is the KEY to Rush!

Enough. I'm really surprised though that no one mentioned Chris Squire of
Yes---I mean, he practically invented melodic bass! You younger folks
should grab old Yes albums and listen close; you'll think you're listening
to Ged's older brother! Right down to the Rick with Roto's, except that
Squire uses a pick.

Enjoy,
Mark

	There is generally a misconception that a belief in the
existence of G-d necessitates the belief in certain mythologies
which are a part of traditional organized religion. This is not
so. It is possible to both not believe in angels and to believe
in G-d, and to believe in G-d and not believe in angels. There
were, in fact, certain people in the eighteenth century who
believed this way--they were called Deists, and included Thomas
Paine and Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, among others.

	This is not to say that I think Neil is a Deist, however (I
actually think he's agnostic).

	Just my $.02.

  Some on the board are so eager to point out Geddy's lack of technical
bass playing.  Rush is a trio and that's why their music turns me on - a
collective set of inputs, which in turn, outputs fantastic
releases.  'nuff said about that for I possess muscial ignorance, I just
know what sounds good via bass - aka Geddy Lee!
  About LTTA on CP:  It's the _only_ CD which causes(the bass) my lights
to actually ficker!  I must turn the lights out and flatline the
equalizer and not turn it up over 50%.  And I do live in an electrically
adequate wired home(for all the electricians out there).  CP seems so
purely mixed and is also the only CD that doesn't cross the volume(1/2)
line.

changing around Rush lyrics is quite ironic.  I would say that twisting
"Freedom of the Radio" is verging on blasphemy, especially by someone who
is dumb enough to be a Rush Limbaugh fan- "Rush fan (the band and the
man)".  Well I'm done here, don't think I'm anti-God or anything else,

I'm sure I'll endure.

	To the second Ed- go back and crawl under the musical rock from
whence you came.  Adam Clayton!!!- I laugh with great amusement at your
idea of a good bass player.  Get ready for sarcasm- Gee, isn't it
wonderful how he doesn't even change notes for bars after bars in most
songs.  I don't know if you have ever played any musical instrument, or
even really listened to music with an ounce of brainpower, but one would
suggest sitting down and thinking about it for a few years before ever
speaking your mind again.  "Better to remain quiet and let people wonder,
than to open your mouth and remove all doubt"- I forget who said this but
it certainly applies.

Will Collier gave us some excellent and eloquent information on Tolkien and
his possible influences on Peart, and I found his post to be quite interest-

However, I read somewhere (unfortunately I can't remember what this appeared in,
but I remember the content quite clearly) that Neil said the "three travellers" 
were meant to be the "three boyz" in the band, and that Willow Dale was a
small town somewhere in Canada.  (More info on this would be appreciated)
As for the other references/influences from Tolkien, I'm sure that, just as
with his references/influences from Rand, some of it was conscious and some of
it was unconscious.  We're all influenced to some degree by our life exper-
iences, and I'm sure Neil is no different (though probably quite a bit more
talented).
