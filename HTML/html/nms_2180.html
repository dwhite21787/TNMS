There haven't been any digests for a week or so, we moved all the files off
to our "new" syrinx machine and should be good to go! I'll be plowing through
the admin mail later today. I don't believe there were any bounces, but
if your mail DID bounce just resend it.

And we finally have more news on the symphonic album! I have to wonder if I
should even bother updating the web page anymore, since a few people wish
that "there was a page that had ACCURATE rush information"... *sigh*

  9. The Pass
  10. Afterimage

This will be available only through the Internet via a special website that 
will take credit card orders, but will also give a mailing address to send 
checks and money orders to. A special advertising campaign will begin in 
magazines and websites throughout bookstores and the Internet. 

There is still mixing going on 2 tracks "Xanadu" and "High Water", and 
the artwork for the album is still in the beginning stages.

The website was due to start as previously noted at the end of December but 
is being designed and set up for instant credit card access.

25,000 copies are being pressed and an order number will be available
also by 1-888. The new release date is for July 20, 1999. Orders
will begin June 14, 1999. The 1-888 number and website will be turned on the
same day.

<A NAME="2180004">Subject: Clock ticking on Rush....</A>

Hello fellow Rush-heads!!	

I was sitting here at my trusty computer and gateway into the Rush kingdom
while listening to the Winamp stream (brilliant idea Rush mgr) and wondered
whether our boys will release another studio album.  I also considered the
last two albums and tours and wondered whether that might discourage them
from stepping into the next millennium.

Consider these figures:

The "Test for Echo" tour sold 339,911 out of 465,090 tickets (73.1% of
capacity) while the Counterparts tour sold 565,202 out of 600,624 (94.1% of
capacity).  These figures are only partial and from the NMS website so I
don't know all accurate they are, but there is a definite downward trend.
Personally, their show here in Minneapolis was 1/2 full for TFE, whereas the
CP tour was a sellout.  Also, CP entered the charts at #2, where TFE entered
at #5 and quickly left...I think you get the picture.  I think many of the
die hard fans will continue to go to their shows, whereas the fringe fans
(the ones that only cheer for Tom Sawyer and Closer to the Heart) forgot
about them or decided to just stay home.  

I think that if Rush releases another studio record and decides to tour,
they are going to need a decent AOR hit single, or at least some better
promotion work from Atlantic.

All this talk (?) of The Omega Concern
made me think..........

This hasn't much, if anything, to do with Rush, but it does involve a
music stand and is one of my famous funny (rock and roll roadie)
stories:

Used to be this guitar player in one of my old bands who kept a lyric
notebook at his feet during gigs.  He pitched a royal shit fit one night
because his stupid "book" was out of order.  Bear in mind that this was
not a major production; it was a bar band playing covers and two, count
'em, two originals.  

Well, kidrock was puddling about his little bookie, I am saying what's
the freakin' big deal..."can't you just remember what you are singin'?!"
and our other guitar player is saying:   "Hey, I saw Yes and Jon
Anderson was using a music stand!"

I politely responded that there WAS a difference.  We were not playing
Tales From Topographic Oceans at The Log Cabin Inn.

<A NAME="2180007">Subject: beauty and truth and danishes</A>

hey all,

if I break a mirror, is it a reflection on me?

anyway, I'd like to throw a new thread idea out into the pond and see how the 
ripples lap (or something like that)...

Rush's music almost always has a certain, exclusive beauty to it (and I say 
"almost" is as much as the Police's music almost always has a certain beauty, 
except when you listen to "Mother"...), but some songs and parts of songs are 
simply sonically gorgeous to listen to, nevermind the originality or banality 
of Neil's lyrics.

For instance, "Totem"'s chorus has become the standard of beauty by which I 
measure Rush aesthetics.  That fantastic layering of vocals , guitar 
harmonics, bass line and, far back in the mix, Alex's chords supporting 
everything, all add up to a beauty approached only by a few other Rush tunes.

the first sonically static minute or so of La Villa; the ending Alex lead and 
chant of You bet Your Life (now there's an under-rated, if slightly cheesy, 
tune!); and, perhaps, the chorus of Analog Kid also standout as moments of 
Rushian beauty.

What are your moments?  What music, songs, etc do you find so beautiful that 
they bring goosebumps?

btw, in reply to McDow Mobile's question if Rush fans are as anal as he is; 
well, I'm not sure what standard we're looking at, but since the music tends 
to be pretty anal, I'm quite sure many of the fans are as well.  

I alphabetize my CD's and put them in chronological order according to group 
(Rush's eponymous album first, followed by FBN, COS, ad nauseum).  That's 
pretty anal.

cheers and beers,

Simon

Unofficially, seeing Big Money vid on MTV all those years ago. I had
remarked about the cool graphics with the flying car.

Officially, 1987, sophomore in HS. Picked up Moving Pictures after
hearing Limelight, and was surprised to find the 'new' album (HYF) at
the records store.

Records, remember those? almost as obsolete as my Commodore Vic 20!

<A NAME="2180010">Subject: Intro to Rush/Fight the good fight</A>

My intro to Rush was against my will.  My junior high school buddies and
I listened to a lot of music after school while playing D&D.  Usually it
was Zep or Who, etc.  One summer, one the guys went to a Rush show with
another of his friends.  The next day he went out and bought Moving
Pictures and Permanent Waves.  He played them constantly for weeks and
weeks.  My first reaction was not very positive.  I had a hard time
following such complex music.  Not long though, did it take for me to
catch on, and that was that.  No one compares nowadays, as far as I'm
concerned.

Also, to the guy who asked about "Fight the Good Fight", that  would be
Triumph, another fine Canadian power trio.  Unfortunately, Rik Emmet's
ego eventually ended that band.

Peace,

Long time list member (4 years or so), first time

It took me a while, but I finally finished ripping all
of Rush's studio albums into mp3's (yes, I do own them
all). I did it so I have a something worthwhile to 
listen to while at the office. Anyways, in case anyone
has thought about doing the same, they will ALL fit
onto ONE CDR! L3enc at 128k with a combined total of
638mb (close call, I know). I'm listening to it as I
type...out of town and only had to bring 1 cd for my
laptop. How cool is that??

>Fight the good fight every moment,
>Every minute, every day

"Fight the Good Fight" by the Canadian trio "TRIUMPH" released on their
album "Allied Forces", 1981  Many people compare these two bands as they
both:

1)	are from Canada
2)	are a 3 Peice rock band
3)	have a singer with a hi voice

>it sounds so much like geddy, it's downright ridiculous, please help

That's Rik Emmett.  He still comes to Cincinnati once or twice a year and
plays at a small club called the Blue Note.  He still has his voice, and
can play his guitar like nobody else I know, but whatever you do, DON'T ask
him about his old band mates.  :-)

If you think he sounds that much like Geddy (and I agree with you), you
should have seen the Triumph video for their song "Somebody Out There".
During the chorus, Rik was looking back at the camera with binoculars.  He
looked a LOT like the kid on the "Power Windows" album cover, which came
out about the same time.  Does anyone else remember that?

"Fight the Good Fight" was by a 70's Canadian hard rock band called Triumph.
They were a trio as well, and I believe they admired Rush. I used to listen
to them some, they were actually pretty good. I think they must have broken
up a good while back, but I don't know for sure.

   Hey fellow fans.. I've been meaning to send my thoughts on the latest
album, D.S., but am just getting around to it finally. Please respond,
positive or negative. 
   Anyway...I was thrilled to learn that Rush was doing another live one. I
quickly bought one of the last copies at the record store. As I waited in line
I read the song roster and was shocked to see sooooo many of the same songs
done previously on live albums. I mean really...Closer to the Heart, AGAIN?
How many albums and video's is that one on now? Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer,
YYZ (even though I love that one, I love em' all, actually), Limelight and
Freewill have already been on live albums and took up valuable space that
could have had tracks you will never hear live, unless you caught it on tour.
    As for the 1978 disc. It was great to hear that stuff, to tell you the
truth, I would have rather had 2 of the disc's from 1978. I would pay some
serious money to hear Hemisphere's live. I know they are sitting on those
tapes. Why, I don;t know. Maybe they didn't like they way it came across on
tape....who knows?
    Overall, I like the album, even with the redundant set list, it was nice
to hear them electronically different. I like the fact that the drums had a
nice clear tone and were very present in the mix on the album. Of course it
was wonderful of them to do 2112 in it's entirety. 
    Cheers all....they are about due for another studio album, wouldn't you
say??
     P.S.  Anyone hear of them doing a video to go with this album??

Someone post a story like mind, so I decided to post mind.  I was in

Rush.  I was so sick and tire of earing how great YYZ was, or how 
amazing Neil's drummig was, that I hated that band for a long time, even 
if I never heard any of theyre songs.  Untill one day (in english class) 
those friends played The temples of Syrinx in a presentation.  I still 
remember my surprise when I found out how good this band sounds.  I 
asked one of them to tape me this part of the song.  A couples of months 
later, I've grown tire of waiting, and bought the 2112 album.  Since 
then, I'm a huge fan.....

Thanx JS and Dave!!!:)

Given that the latter two are  dead, I don't know how Roger Taylor
would feel about being included on that list.. but I have to agree,
especially about Cozy.  He'll also be remembered for his work with 
Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Michael Schenker group, and some 
successful solo work in the early '70s.  He was briefly a 
replacement for Carl Palmer in ELP as well - whether he was chosen
on the basis of his surname initial or it was just a lucky 
co-incidence, I don't know.

Paul - I have *no* confusion about basketball and baseball - I
merely used the term "World Series" as a convenient way to
illustrate that Americans have a tendency to believe that their 
country is "The World".  In fact I think that Americans serving
in Vietnam actually used to talk about going back to "The World".
Criticise or flame if you want but I'd appreciate it if you would
not take it upon yourself to apologise on my behalf - thanks.

Question - is there a US international basketball team?  Is there 
a basketball (real) World Cup?

there thought that I was some guy from the production team, so, I stood
there during the entire sound check. I even had the chance to talk a few
words with Mike Portony (I told to him the very truth, "I'm not from the

what he said was: "OK, I don't know what the fuck are you doing here man,

<A NAME="2180023">Subject: A Sort Of History: 1986-1999 In 2 Paragraphs</A>

Since others are posting their "how I got into Rush" stories, so shall
I. I was 13 in 7th grade, and the year was 1986. I had just purchased an
electric guitar; a light blue Strat rip off called HondoII (still have
it). Someone taught me this D chord riff that I played over & over &
over.... It turned out to be the opening of "Fly By Night". I was
intrigued, but my mind wasn't ready to take up the challenge of Rush
just yet. I was still into the Miami Vice soundtrack & Twisted Sister.
Well, I was an MTV/Atari baby, and while playing Missile Command @ full
volume @ a friend's house, we decided to take a break from
saving/destroying the world to watch our once illustrious MTV. I saw the
vid for "DEW". I liked it a lot. Someone dubbed GUP for me, and the next
year I received the album Power Windows as a gift. From those humble
beginnings, a mild obsession was born. By 10th grade I had all of Rush's
music permanently burned into my brain.

Yes, Rush & myself have been through a lot. We weathered the constant
insults hurled by my Led Zep loving older brother. He held that Rush
always was & always will be a Zep knock off (his opinion was based
wholly on Rush's "What You're Doing"). I held my ground when my good
friends in high school & fellow Rush addicts complained that they were
"changing their style too much" when Hold Your Fire came out. In
college, my collection of Rush music & memorabilia was the subject of
many snickering insults by my Jane's Addiction/Ministry/Grateful Dead
listening roommates. Through it all, I've learned to absolutely LOVE
other bands & styles of music, but Rush has been & always will be a
constant in my life.

(sniff) Kind of brings a tear to the eye, doesn't it?

Just a quick thought...

Rush is to rock music what Bill Mazeroski was to professional baseball.  Both 
have had wonderful careers and both have been over looked repeatedly for the 
hall of fame.
For those of you unfamiliar with "Maz" he was one of the greatest 2nd baseman 
to ever to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Perhaps one of the best defensive 
players in the history of baseball.  Yet, for the past 20 some years he has 
been over looked for the hall of fame.
Oh well, none of us are here for fame right?  We're just here because we're 
here...roll the bones...

First off, to respond to the following:

>>>>>>>>>>>

Well, you're not far off.  They're a Canadian power trio, but not
Rush.  That's "Fight the Good Fight" by Triumph.  It's on the album
Allied Forces.  I imagine it's been reissued on CD by now, but I've
never tried to find it.

Triumph were a really great band in their heyday.  Straight ahead hard
rock with a slightly progressive edge to it.  I've got all their vinyl
in my rather old record collection, but I haven't tried to get any of
their stuff on CD (just wasn't as high a budget priority as other
bands!)  They have the distinction of being the only concert I've ever
had front row seats to.  My best friend Chad (waves!) took a flashpot
in the face for our trouble.  Great show, though.  Rik Emmett is a
shredder *par excellence.*

As for my intro to Rush, lemmesee...hmm...in 1980 I was a freshman in
high school, and I was hanging out with this guy who was a friend at
the time, but who I haven't seen since.  He played SoR for me on his
car stereo.  I'd heard the song before, but never known who it was.
So I asked him, and he pulled out the PW cassette case.  Cool, I
thought, maybe I'll get that album.

A coupla weeks later, I went to the local K-Mart and picked up an
8-track of Moving Pictures (they didn't have PW).  No, I'm not
kidding.  Yes, I'm an old fart, don't rub it in. :P  I was 13 years
old and my Sears stereo had an 8-track player and no cassette player.
I'd been hooked on Kansas and Styx for years (after going through my
Kiss phase and then graduating to more sophisitcated music), so Rush
for me was the Holy Grail at the time.  I spent my allowance over the
next several months acquiring the entire Rush catalog.

First concert:  GUP, Tulsa Convention Center, 1984 (right after
graduation!  What a sendoff!).  We had this bitchin' banner we'd made;
we painted a really good Hemispheres logo on one side and a GUP logo
on the other, with "10th Anniversary" written all over it.  Some guy
at the show took our picture; maybe he's on this list.  Who knows.
I've still got the ticket stub around here someplace, I should send it
to rush-mgr so she can scan it.

Well, that's it.  Hope it brightened your day. :)

Now this is a cool thread!

It was '78 or '79 when I was in junior high(has been that long?).  I was 
in school band but was wanting to learn an instrument to play in a rock 
band.  At that time, I was so into "Kansas".  I loved the melodic 
 arpeggio stuff.  I was trying to get my mother to buy me a keyboard, so 
I could be the next Steve Walsh(singer of Kansas).  She would not get me 
a keyboard because of the expense.

One day, my buddy had me listen to a song off an album.  He wouldn't let 
me know who it was.  The first instument I heard was a bass guitar.  All 
of the sudden I hear this distant bass line playing by itself getting 
closer and closer.  It was "Cygnus X-1".  I was blown away.  I listened 
to the whole FtK album and couldn't believe someone was playing the bass 
that way.  I remembered how I felt when I first heard Geddy's sound and 
melodic phrasing.  The next week my mother bought me a replica of a 
Rickenbacker.

I've been playing and listening ever since.

Thanks Geddy!

<A NAME="2180029">Subject: The what, where, when, and how of becoming a Rushian.  =)</A>

Well, way, way, way back in 7th grade (I graduated last year :) ), my
best friend, Chris Thomas, and I, were in a technology class for that
9-week period.  We spent a couple weeks working with CAD, a couple weeks
learning about aerodynamics by working with the school's
wind-tunnel......  Anyway, we spent a couple weeks in the sound room,
learning the basics of running a soundboard and stuff.  Running an
imaginary radio station, doing radio shows that only our teacher would
ever hear.  It kinda sucked, but that's not the point.  

Chris brings in some compilation CD for me to listen to in this class (I
don't know what it was).  He puts it in, and starts playing "Tom Sawyer".
 I was slightly impressed, but not exactly ecstatic......until he said
"The drummer's playing that hi-hat part with just one hand."  *THEN* I
was ecstatic.  (Come on...we were 7th graders.  Drummers in the Jr. High
band.  We didn't think we'd ever get anywhere *close* to that sort of
speed using one hand.)  So, yes -- it was just simply the fact that Neil
could play 16th notes one-handed at that speed that got me to start
listenin' to Rush.

Anyway, later, Chris convinced me to sign up for one of those mail-order
music clubs.  And I made one of my first choices MP, based solely on the
fact that it had TS on it, and I'd heard a couple of great things about
some song called Yyz.  

A couple years later (still with MP being the only Rush CD in my
collection), I checked out "Chronicles" from the local library, just out
of curiousity.  I *loved* the first disc, but I really couldn't stand
much at all from the second.  Regardless, I copied the whole thing onto
three previously-used tapes (which I still have somewhere).

And the next CD I bought was T4E.  I heard "Driven" on the radio one
night, as Q95 was premiering the album, and I ran out and bought it the
very next day.

Of course, I'd had exposure to Rush in between all these events, but
those were the three key events.  (After T4E, it was a steady stream of
skipping weeks and weeks worth of lunch.  I figured if I could skip two
weeks worth of lunch, I could buy a new Rush CD every couple of weeks. 
Unfortunately, my stomach won out every once in a while, and I graduated
before I could get all the albums.  But I'm all caught up now.)

Believe it or not, up until I found the album in a local headshop six
months ago, I'd never heard all of "2112".  

Anyway......that's how I came into Rush.  =)

As for awesome bassists, I'd just like to throw in Les Claypool, of
Primus.  (I'm surprised no-one's mentioned him yet!)  Also, Mike Herrera,
of MxPx.  (One of the finest bassists which punk has to offer.)  And, of

phenomenal bassists!  =)

Drummers:  What about Brain?  (The guy who took over after Herb left
Primus.)  Personally, I think he's actually *better* than Herb was, and
yet somehow, more laid back.

Of course, there's Paul Roraback.  (Come on....the guy covered "2112:

Okay.  That's enough.  I'll shut up now.
