This is the *real* #823...

Yes, for all of those worrying about the multiple digests, that was not digest
#823, it was a repeat. I thought it had new posts in it, but I was wrong. Some
posts might have gotten sidetracked though, but I think that most were either
about MTV showing "Stick It Out" or the LA tix going on sale.

Just so you can get a feel for the ticket prices, the San Diego show's tickets
were $33 (floor I'm assuming, and probably close lower level seats) and $25.50
(for farther back lower level, loge, and terrace). And the rumors of an
in-the-round concert are now dead, the seating is your standard stage setup
like they've done in the past.  Although the actual staging itself will be 
different, or so I'm told.

I'm also working (with the kind help of Bruce Holtgren) to get the NMS posted
to the RockNET forum on Compuserve. Hopefully if this works out, compuserve
members won't have to receive it through email and can just read it on the
forum.

And now for some news:
- MTV is indeed now playing SIO, after having told Atlantic for 2 straight
  weeks they would start airing it, it finally aired!
- Tour dates are close to beeing officially announced, most of the dates
  posted are pretty much on the ball (with the exception of the LA and San 
  Diego order being switched around)
- Tickets I'm told will not go on sale until early January for most cities
- The following cities will go on sale on December 11th:
  Pensacola, New Orleans, Las Cruces, and Phoenix
- The band is still reviewing CD's for the opening act
- Neil started rehearsals for the new tour last week.
- The crew for the tour is assembling in Toronto to go over final details
- The band will start to play together this week and rehearse for the tour
- People check out the AWESOME idea that Robert Russ has (see his post below) 
  as far as what to give the band for their 20th anniversary.  Way to go 
  Robert.  I've seen his work folks and he's a wizard at what he does!

That's it.  More later.

    ENJOY!!

Title : Rush's Approach Is More Organic On 'Counterparts'
By : Michael Zabrodsky

 Approaching two decades together, Rush again is keeping the axe to the
grindstone.
 "Counterparts"  on Atlantic Records is brand new from the Canadian power
trio.  Drummer Neil Peart, bassist Geddy Lee, and guitarist Alex Lifeson,
have taken a different approach to this release.
  It's more organic and not full of overdubbed synthesizers and electric
precussion.  That's not to say Rush over does it when using synthesizers
because they don't.
  It's refreshing to hear a new work by this band.  To see them play live is
like hearing the
compact disc - only louder.  Their knack for reproducing each part as it was
played on the record is uncanny.  But that's what Rush fans crave.  It's not
that they are unpredictable; it's that their music is sometimes so complex,
when playing a song it must be reproduced "like the record."
  A conductor wouldn't have a symphony orchestra and the singers play and
sing a couple
different notes in Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony."  It just wouldn't sound
right.
  And that's my point.  If Rush's music isn't played like it sounds on
record, then it just doesn't sound good.
  You don't hear a lot of cover bands playing Rush in nightclubs, because
frankly they can't - it doesn't sound right.
  Although, I have heard a lot of Peart clones, after watching him play, I
know why he's one of the best.  Aside from having impeccable time, great
fills, the ability to play in odd-meter, good sounding drums, and great
technique, I think one word describes his playing - intense.
  But he is just one-third of the combination that keeps on gracing "The
Spirit of the Radio."
  Geddy Lee is a master bassist.  His ability to sing an unrelated melody
while unleashing a killer bass part has kept him in the front of the low-end
pack for years.
  And Lifeson's use of different-voiced chords always give Rush songs a
unique flavor.
  "Counterparts" has an airy quality that is very hard to achieve.  You may
not like when you first hear it or if you just hear one song on the radio,
but it will grow on you.  It did me.
  Rating: ***1/2  (out of 5).

YES!  Cool, MTV finally played a video that didn't suck... heh!  SIO is cool-a-
rooney man!

I got it taped 3 times already!  But down to Earth and other matters... My 
copies of The Pass and Show Don't Tell are getting wonky.  My question is:  
Has anyone thought about/have compiled the videos from the last three albums 
or any sort of compilation (except those released and "authorized" by Rush)?
I would do it, but over Christmas break when things aren't so busy - finals
coming up... ugh!

Lemme know by E-mail if you've got good copies or are willing to trade/
exchange/whatever...

Just kidding!  Here's a new review of Counterparts which I am about to type in
from The Tampa Bay Spike, Florida's Hard and Heavy Music Magazine, which mostly
concentrates on thrash and death metal.  (An EXCELLENT free mag!)  Here goes:

(by Scott Murdock)

	Depending on who you listen to, the story, more often than not, reads
that RUSH as a unit had reached a point sometime around 1988's HOLD YOUR FIRE
lp when they just about called it a day.  Lack of interest in touring, writers
block, etc. were among the cited reasons, but see, something happened.  Unlike
many other musical casualties, the band was rejuvenated.  The first step back
was a bit rocky, with PRESTO, their first album for new label Atlantic, being
critically acclaimed but somewhat half-heartedly received by fans.  The kicker
is, it was some of their best work ever, topped only by it's follow-up, 1991's
ROLL THE BONES.  Here was the outfit's most focused album since the monstrous
MOVING PICTURES, and radio embraced it lovingly, jumping on no less than four
of the featured cuts.  RUSH backed up . . .BONES with a big ol' tour, and by
the time they stepped off the road and tuned into the World Series, they had
their feet re-planted firmly in the winner's circle.

	Staking an effort to follow . . .BONES must have been tough,
consequently the result, COUNTERPARTS, sounds a bit tense at times.  However,
with a band like Rush, that can make for some fine music.  When was the last
time they employed a guitar riff as heavy and looming as the one in "Stick It
Out?"  '75, '76?  The nervous, yet menacing baritone monotone that seasons
"Double Agent" only made a quick cameo in the last seconds of PRESTO's "Chain
Lightning."  And even though the feel of a tune such as "The Speed Of Love" is
lighter and poppier than the Egyptian-flavored dramatics of the similarly-
themed "Ghost Of A Chance" from . . .BONES, the melody of the former is still
quite a bit darker than it's optimistic lyrics would suggest.  Unfortunately,
it's lifeless arrangement and tempo make it one of the weaker moments on the
disc.

	Not too many more weaknesses follow however.  Neil Peart's work on the
kit is amazing as always(the fills in "Between Sun and Moon" are a drum lesson
in themselves.)  Alex Lifeson's guitar break in "Stick It Out" bursts out of
the restrictive tension of the song and absolutely flies.

	Still, with lyrics such as "Where would you rather be?  Anywhere.
Anywhere but here", you've gotta wonder if something's bothering this troop.
Relax guys - your Jays made the series again, and Dana still worships you as
gods.  No worries, eh?

	That's it.  Any spelling mistakes are the original author's, and I
strongly recommend you switch around all the "its" 's and "it's" 's :)  I
found it kinda strange that a death metal reviewer would list Presto and RTB
as their strongest efforts!!!  Oh well. . .

	Tell me more about this Cynic group. . .the store was out of 'em!

				Party on,

				Aaron

<A NAME="823005">Subject: The Gift, Perot, and #1 song</A>

Just a couple of things that crossed my mind after reading the last issue:

1.  I like the idea of a wall hanging (painting would be cool, or a wood
	carving thing), since it can be very abstract (which they'll probably
	like better since they can attach their own meaning to it).  So add
	one vote to the wall hanging idea.

2. 	Loved the H. Ross Perot parody!  Very funny indeed.  rush-mgr, if
	I do a Rush Limbaugh parody set to Alien Shore or something, will
	you let it in the issue?  ;)

	(there seem to be a lot of touchy Limbaugh fans here!)

3.	Since everyone is naming their favorite songs on CP, I have to
	throw mine in the ring.  Actually, it's a dead heat between two
	songs -- Alien Shore and Everyday Glory.  AS really rocks (good
	musicianship too!), and EG is extremely powerful, IMHO.

4.	Has everyone rushed (!) out and bought the latest issue of Bass Player
	with the Geddy interview?  The interview was great (thanks to whoever
	keyed it all in) -- how are the pictures?

That's it for now.

Rushers;

	Anyone going to the concert at the Meadowlands/Garden? I'm going with
a fellow NMS'er to the Meadowlands. If anyone wants to come with us, I'll buy
the tickets so we can all sit together. Same goes for the Garden (that is if
they're playing both? rush-mgr) I'm planning on going to both concerts so
write me and let me know what's up.

   [ I believe it's going to be one or the other, just depending on scheduling
     and what venue will be available but I'm not sure, I'll try and get more 
     detailed information later.                                    :rush-mgr ]

   Paul, now you know why I think Geddy's playing with a pick on this song.
You're talking about the main verse part, right?  What I hear him doing is
letting open strings ring whenever he frets the D or the G.  There's also
lots of sliding, and, at some points, he plays fifths on the D and G
strings.  The way I play it, starting from the "G" pickup:  fret the G on
the D string, strumming it along with the open G.  Then the A/C/F/A are all
on the D string, sliding to and from each note.  Go down to the A string for
Bb/C/E/D, similarly sliding on all notes.  And let the open D ring along
with the D on the A string.  Then we're back to the G.
   All of you who are picking favorite Geddy solos are missing some good
ones.  There's lots more than "Show Don't Tell" and "Freewill" (that one's
not really a solo, just an incredibly frenetic bass line under the guitar
solo).  Aside from obvious ones on "Stragiato" and "YYZ", some of my
favorites are the little melodic solos/fills at the end of "Red Barchetta"
and near the end of "Vital Signs".  There's also that little bass fill in
the middle of "Prime Mover".  And don't forget the one in "Working Man".
But all this is overlooking Geddy's true talent, which is creating bass
lines which are strong melodic statements in themselves.  Check out the
whole _Hemispheres_ album for starters.  There're also tons of great
interlocking bass and drum fills ("Xanadu" and "Time Stand Still" come to
mind).  I could talk about this for pages but I'll stop now.

Yes, yes, yes, what a dream come true it would be to see Eric
Johnson with Rush on this next tour.  Especially since he is coming
out with a new album!!!  But of course, Brad, you knew I would
agree with you.  It would be nice if ej opened for Rush in order
to support his own new release, and we would be blessed with the
incredible combination of two amazing guitarists in one evening.

*HOWEVER*

I don't think it will happen.:(

I *wish* it would, but for some reason, I feel this is a futile
hope.  You know, it's the 'Rush likes to have talented, up and
coming opening acts' syndrome--and, well, Eric Johnson isn't
exactly up and coming.  Not that he is as hugely popular as he
might deserve to be, but he is a little more established than
*some* of the artists that Rush has had open for them in the past.
Of course, this is all speculation, and I could be completely
wrong(I wish I were!)--but for some reason, I don't think I am.

Also, I've been reading a lot about the 20th anniversary gift and
I've heard the collage idea batted about.  I think there are a lot
of great ideas for the gift.  I did want to mention, if reference to
Rush collages, a painting that a woman named Mandy Streeter did--
it was a brilliantly painted collage of every Rush album cover
(except, I think, 2) on something like a six-foot canvas.  She
gave it to the band and they gave it back, autographed.  Maybe some
of you NMS-ers know what I am talking about and have seen it.  It
was absolutely gorgeous....Just thought I would share that with
everyone.:)

Does anyone else get choked up when they listen to the "Slow part"
of "La Villa"---cosmic music, eh?

once watching a movie which had the song "Force Ten" in it.  He didn't
remember the name of the movie, unfortunately.  Anyways, that's my bit.

Ok, before I get on with the Rush content, I have to
clear up a source of confusion.
Stacey Ksenzakovic is my given name, the name under which
this account was created. My name will legally be Julie Oneida,
and that is the name in my finger file. Because it was there it
showed up as my ID in posts for a while, but suddewnly the local
crudputer systems have decided not to sned it out anymore. I have
no clue why, so please just ignore all of it and call me JUNO.

Ok, I have a theory on why they are in the same order in all the pics,
at least the ones they are all in one picture. Maybe because Neil is
the tallest they put him in the middle, but that doesn't explain--
HEY WAIT A MINUTE!!! That order is the same as their places on stage!!
That could be it!! Of course probably a zillion people figured this out
already, so I'm just repeating things over and over redundantly.

One more thing-- Vortex has probably already responded to this but
someone called her "he" in #822. Vortex is a she! You all notice
my two names, but you don't notice her one name, Niki. I nust be in
the lemonlight or something. Anyway, she's not one of us droolers,
but still female nonetheless.
                             Blessed be,

MuchMusic is Canada's version of MTV.  As I recall, they play like
2 or 3 "shifts" of the same exact videos every day.  It's like they taped
the first shift and left it playing and went on a trip while the first shift
tape plays repeatedly.  Any Canadians wanna tell me why they do that?  Too
poor to hire more vee-jays?

Anyway, since Rush IS from Canada, that's probably why people have been
recommending that MuchMusic does the awards thing (although MTV would
probably want a piece of the action).

Good day, eh?

<A NAME="823019">Subject: ANIMATE: not the song - the GIFT!!</A>

Fellow Rushians,

I've been reading the Midnight Star for about 6 months now without
submitting anything - mostly because I've enjoyed reading everyones posts
so much.  However, all this talk of a GIFT for Rush has inspired me to get
involved.

Imagine for a moment the presentation ceremony to give our gift to the
boys:  Some kind of nifty banquet type thing, hopefully hosted by <fill
in your favorite video music network here>, and preceding the actually
presentation of the sculpture (my personal fave idea so far) the lights
dim and a dazzling computer animation anthology of 20 years of Rush
blasts onto the screen.  Mixed together with a montage of various
favorite songs from our favorite Canadians, we see imagery depicting the
incredible rush their music brings to us all!!

This is all possible.

I and a number of my friends are HUGE Rush fans.  We also happen to be
professional computer animators and instructors.  We have access to high
end computer graphics and video equipment - the type of hardware and
software used to do the effects in Terminator 2 and the Abyss, not to
mention the Magic Carpet and Tiger cave in Aladdin.  (For those of you
into computer graphics, the hardware is Silicon Graphics - the software
Alias Research Software)

We are all completely PSYCHED on doing an animation for a part of the
gift.  The ideas we've kicked around so far are to do some kind of medley
of a bunch of songs, and animate something appropriate for each
sequence.  If the sculpture thing goes, we could create a computer model
of the sculpture (given enough lead time) and include that in the
animation, closing with a shot of the sculpture on screen and some nifty
slogan like "1974 - 1994:  20 Years - What a RUSH!!"

So what do you all think??  We would need to know pretty soon to get
started and schedule with other projects, so any feedback/ideas/thoughts
are more than welcome.  Also, votes for specific songs to include in the
montage (accompanied by ideas for the animation) would be great!!

We are very serious about doing this, and we all have alot of experience
doing computer animation - It would look FANTASTIC!!

   [ Robert this is a killer idea!  Who knows, you might be rewarded for all 
     your efforts :-) *hint*                                     :rush-mgr ]

After all, what more appropriate gift for a band that just released a
song called ANIMATE . . .

Any other RUSH fans in Germany?

Whoever was looking for lyrics can get them from the ftp at syrinx...I
found them and was very happy.  Only brought 2112 lyrics w/ and was trying

Greetings,

I was just having a look-see at the lyrics files on the Gopher site, and
noticed a small bit that looks wrong to me. (I know some of you are saying read
the FAQ, well I have. No mention of this one). It is in the opening of
The Necromancer.

He is the first few lines:

  As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky, the three travelers, men of
  Willow Dale, emerge from the forest shadow. Fording the River Dawn, they turn
  south, journeying into the dark and forbidding lands of the Necromancer.

The things that look wrong:

Willow Dale ---> Willowdale
River Dawn  ---> River Don

The reason I say this is because I lived in Willowdale (a section of Toronto),
and the Don River flows through it. I lived on a road called Parkway Forest,
which joined another road called Forest Manor Rd, both of which were about 3/4
of a mile from the Don River. The area is full of highrise apartment buildings
that cast huge shadows over the area.

Anyone out there in TNMS land agree that the lyrics should be corrected?

If we did a painting, put it on a T-shirt and sell it.  I guess I should've
said his/her, since I don't really know.  This, in my mind, is a crucial
turning point in the whole discussion.  This makes the whole project a lot
more feasible without resorting to someone hiring their Uncle Guido to do
a driftwood sculpture.  On an unrelated note, the local record store,
which has been trying to go out of business for a year now, finally dropped
their price to $0.00 per record.  Well, that's exactly my budget for records,
since I don't have a record player, and anything they still have left must
be unbelievably unpopular.  No Rush, of course, but I did get Rupert Hine's
Waving not Drowning.  (1982)  Like I say, I have no record player, so I can't

First, as a recent addition to TNMS (about 2 wks), and with this first
submission, I'm happy to be aboard!
To business...
Even if this is old news... Who else saw SIO on Headbanger's Ball?  If this
IS news, they played it as about the 3rd or 4th video on the show (good thing
too, I didn't have to go through too much to get to it on tape :) ).  Funny
seeing them right after a Megadeath video... I wasn't watching, but taped it
on a whim that maybe it would play, and since rush-mgr said they would, I
thought it would be smart.  Anyway, Rikki Rachtman (-sp?) says sort of
mockingly before the commercial before the video something like "...and for
all you Rush fans out there, we've got the brand new Rush video coming up..."
and sort of smirks.  It's obvious that he doesn't like Rush, because of this,
and the fact he never introduced or commented on the video.  But hey, there's
no accounting for taste...
As for the video, it's good- as good as a non-live performance Rush video
could be.  Not knocking it, just praising the live stuff...

To add my opinion on some of Neil's best performances (as offered by Matt
Smith, TNMS #819 post)...
-"What You're Doing" (ATWAS): great ad-libs on a song that he didn't even
help make!! (I'm still tryin' to figure out some of it on the kit :) )
-"2112" - live or otherwise...He does so much!!!
-"Didacts and Narpets"
-"Natural Science"- as another fellow TNMSer said "fast,fast,fast!!!"  I
personally enjoy the fact that one can put 7/16 time (music buffs take note)
in a song and make it so appealing to the ear!!!
>...and many more songs. In fact they're all pretty much excellent, if you ask
me.

By the way, Arthur Treacher, "Flat Tire" was Great!!

<A NAME="823032">Subject: first post</A>

To TNMS subscribers,

Well, this is my first posting of many and I might as well start it off with my
review of CP.
The album as a whole: I put it in my top five favorites along with HYF, PeW,
PoW and MP.  The reason I say this is that while many Rush albums have produced
excellent hits (The Trees and Villa on 'Hemispheres' are good examples) few
albums have had the quality in which (almost) every song holds its own making
the listening so much more satisfying.  CP is an album like this.

ANIMATE: Great opening song.  The opening sounds a little like Van Halen's
"Poundcake".  Heavy sound and nice groove.  Great bass line (I play bass so I
love Geddy's stuff).
STICK IT OUT: First impression was "Whoooaaaaa!". They grunge pretty well and
this song is great.
CUT TO THE CHASE: Again, a great song. I like the Alex's solo in this one, not
to mention Geddy's little "WHUUUUUUUMMMM!" preceding it.
NOBODY'S HERO: Alex's solo interludes are really nice.  His sound has developed
nicely over the years.  Lyrics are personal and powerful.
BETWEEN SUN AND MOON: "AAHHH AAAAHHH yes to yes"? HMMMMMMMMM! STill a powerful
song that sounds a lot (better) than some things on the first album (This is
not ment to knock "Working Man" in any way).
ALIEN SHORE: I like the lyrics in this one a lot.  They have a nice catch to
them (competion....job description.....). Nice bass.
SPEED OF LOVE:This one took a while to grow on me.  Now it is one of my
favorite songs on the whole album.  It seems to be what "Bravado" should have
been (although "B" did have great drumming by Neil).
DOUBLE AGENT: I wouldn't have liked it if I hadn't heard Rush explain it's
intentional silliness over the radio.  It screams "Grand Finale" off "2112".
However, I often skip it when I'm looking for nice melody and theme.
LEAVE THAT THING ALONE!: Geez! All I can say is that it's a hell of a lot
better than that Nintendo-sounding instr. off RTB! Great solo and a cool mellow
groove.
COLD FIRE: Although this song sounds the least "rushy" (don't ask--it's just a
'feeling' I get.....) it has some of the most powerful lyrics on the album.
EVERYDAY GLORY: I love this song.  It has that nice happy feeling!!!
Seriously...it is a great ending song,
alot like, but better than "You Bet Your Life". It's very reminescent of a U2
song, especially the Edge-like guitar.  I could almost see Bono singing
it.......mmmmaybe not!
WEll, that's that, but I do have a second hand story from a friend who saw the
RTB tour in Pittsburgh.  Apparently about four rows in front of my friend were
too old ladies who had been escorted to their seats by security guards.  They
were apparantly hard-core Rush fans and knew all or most of the songs at the
concert.  They kept saying things like "OOOooooo it's Limelight!" and "OOOooooo
it's Spirit of Radio".  Keep in mind that these ladies were pretty old, maybe
in there seventies.  I got a kick out of that story.  That about wraps it up
for my first posting.  I'll be back......

In answer to Dave Whiteman's comment about Nobody's Hero, I believe Peart said
in an interview that his friend had died of AIDS and that was what the song was
about . Therefore I think the girl died of AIDS too.  Somebody can correct me
if I'm wrong, but I think that's the right answer.

	Fellow Rush Fans.

	Just thought I'd share a few thoughts.  First about Rush calling it
quits after '3 more albums.'  This would seem less like a tradedy to me
and more like a grand finale.  I mean, how long can you expect these guys
to keep producing great records and go on tours?  They ARE getting older,
touring becomes harder.   They usually do a live after every 4 studio, so
I expect one more studio (hopefully the greatest work to DATE, but unlikely
unless they go back to the 'Hemispheres' style and Geddy starts screaming
beautifully again), then the live and a boxed set of the whole career to
put both the Police one and the many Zeppelin ones TO SHAME.  This would be
a terrific way for Rush to end their illustrious career.
	As for the tour, are they even COMING to the DC area?? From what I
heard they are starting in Fla and doing the West coast, then ending in New
England/New York...no mention of DC area OR the South...that DOES seem
unlikely. :)
	As for the proposed anniversary gift...sounds good to me, the sculpture
idea especially.  I'd go for it I s'pose... :)
	And finally...the cute parody "Put it Out"  Very nice work guys.
Interesting how you even tried to preserve the same rhyme scheme.  I liked
it...
	Just a few thoughts and opinions...hope you are enjoying Counterparts
as much as I!

Anyone know how much a Subdivisions 7" picture disc is worth?  I'm
thinking of selling mine...

Thanks in advance.

Hi...

I happen to be coming to the USA (for the first time!) from about 20
Jan to 27 Feb in '94.  So: is there ANY chance of getting tickets to
one of the LA shows.  How long before tickets are sold out, or are they
sold out already?  And what do they cost?

   [ The tickets for San Diego were $33 & $25.50. Don't know about the LA tix
     though.							: rush-mgr ]

If there is a chance of getting a ticket at this late stage, would any
kind soul be prepared to help me in this regard?

I am prepared to beg :), and remunerate whoever helps me.

BTW: Somebody asked about the Counterparts Special Edition.  Well, it
is even available in stores of the largest CD chain in SA.  (Anybody
want to trade a copy for a ticket? :)

Later

Greetings fellow Midnight Stars!!

I am new to the list, but I've been a Rush fan for years.  To be breef, the
first album I got was Exit...Stage Left back in '85.  Needless to say, I loved
it!  The first song I'd ever heard by the band was Tom Sawyer.  Without being
too long winded I'll explain why I got the live album before I got Moving
Pictures.  I'm the kind of guy who likes to hear what a band sounds like live;
thus, if they have a live album, it's usually the first one I get.  To me, if
a band sounds good live, they're a good band.  Moving on...within about 8 months
after I bought E...SL I had all of the albums that they had released to that
date --and liked them all...eventually.  Some of their albums, I won't mention
any names (Caress of Steel and Fly By Night), took a little getting used to.

Anyway, before I bore y'all (yes, I'm a southerner) to tears, let me get to the
point of my posting.  I have two questions.

1)  Does anybody have tour date info (especially for the Virginia/Maryland
    area)?

I feel stupid for asking this next question 'cause I think it's something I
should know, but don't...

2)  Have Geddy, Neil, or Alex ever released any solo material or have they
    ever done session work with any other bands?

This may seem like a silly question, but inquiring minds want to know!!

Take care all!

Just wondering if anyone has ever called Anthem.  And how did they treat
you?  I just called up there to see if I could find out something about
tour dates.  The lady hung up on me.  I called back and was very
insistent.  She didn't hang up that time, but she said no tour dates had
been confirmed!

   [ Are you sure it wasn't an accidental hangup?  Usually the folks from what 
     I hear are pretty nice.                                     :rush-mgr ]

I understand they probably get a lot of calls from us crazy Rush fans,
and it can probably get annoying.  Still, I think she could have shown a
little courtesy.  After all, if it wasn't for crazy Rush fans, there
would be no Anthem to work for.

Greetings once again, Mein Freunds du l'NMS.

  I may have a strange and wonderful trek ahead of me.  It seems there's
a remote possibility of my seeing the opening show of the CP tour '94.
This'll be my first-ever attendance of opening night on a Rush tour.  I
verily tingle with excitement at the thought.  I'd like to hear from anyone
who's planning on attending the Pensacola show, since I'll be hurtling in
from New York just for the occasion.  Rush-Mgr, the database of who's-going-
to-which-show seems like a very useful idea to me right now!  So if you're
a local Floridian who's on top of the event, I'd love to hear from ya.
I haven't been to Florida in over ten years, so I could use to hook up with
someone local via email.  (My address proper is at the close of this post.)

  Thanks!

  Also, if there are any New Yorkers (or other Northeasterners) planning on
making a similar hike, give me a buzz at the address which follows.
(*Please* don't send to the auto-return address for this particular post!)

        Anxiously awaiting further news of the CP tour.
        This tour will be an experience!!
