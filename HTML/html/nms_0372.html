If you look closely, what looks like "NP" is in the corner of some of the
lyrics (with the "P" actually formed off of the right of the "N").  Also,
if you happen to get your hands on the tour program from Moving Pictures,
similar artwork graces some of the MP lyrics that are on a page of the pro-
gram.

I suspect Mr. Peart is a clandestine artist :-)

If I remember, it was President Ungerlieder (with a small music case full of

:-)

Also photos of their crew (what was it, all of three back then?  Man, how time

And that rarest of birds, Terry Brown.  Don't recall seeing any of the band
themselves on the sleeve.

Correct on those.  Didn't know about the color scheme on COS, but the fold-out
was nice.

No.

ORIGINALLY.  Later Mercury pressings were straight fold-outs.  So nobody knew
who the guitar player was :-).  If you have an original Mercury tri-fold, I
suggest you hold onto it.  Dunno about Anthem releases.

Yep.

If you've ever been to a Rush concert, you should know that the types
of people there are typically different from those you describe above.
(I've never been to a Star Trek convention, but I doubt the air is
filled with "fragrance of Afghanistan".)

I believe you're confusing the 1000 readers of this list with the
millions of fans who buy their albums.  This population sample,
people who subscribe to a computer newsletter, is at least somewhat
skewed.

Hello all...
As I am sure most of you have read the reviews and set lists by now...I would
just like to throw my thoughts on to the pile.
First of all I would like to say that I was heartbroken(for lack of a better
word) after the Hamilton show. 17 out of 23 songs were the same as the Presto
tour. I had high high hopes for a fresh and completely revamped line-up. Guess
not. C'mon guys....you can do better than recreate Presto all over again.

What happened to the days where they used to play all or almost all of the 
tunes from the new album???? On the p/g tour they played at least 7 and on 
PoW they
did play 7 of 8. Only 4 from RtB...very bad!!

Subdivisions.....simply terrible. Not only did they mees around at the start...
(both nights that I saw)...they omitted an entire verse. Why??? They should 
haveomitted the entire SONG!!!!! I've seen it on every tour since it was 
released!!!
When are they going to retire the following songs??
Finding my Way, 2112, Closer to the Heart, Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, DEW,
Subdivisions, Freewill, Limelight, Superconductor, Big Money and so on.
Lets hear..
Before and after, Twilight Zone, Farewell, Entre Nous, Vital Signs, Afterimage,
Digital Man, Natural Science, Available Light, Middletown Dreams......etc.

PLAY A SHOW FOR THE REAL FANS!!!!!NOT THE PSEUDO FANS!!!

Oh and one more thing....I feel that anyone that is not a real Rush fan should
be required to give their seat to someone who is a real fan, if the non fans is
closer. This way all the real fans would have a good view and appreciate things
much more than the pretenders. Thank you....

	I don't know about the Rush lyric, but Hotel California is
	about drug addiction, and the 'stab it with their steely knives'
	line is a needle reference.

	Again, I also don't know if there's any connection to
	'Lord of the Flies'...

I don't want to burst your bubble, but I noticed the anagrams and his
"explanations" straight off.  I guess I've been doing too many "Cryptic
Crosswords" (and probably so had Neil...)

I also noticed some references to past Rush songs in the first two verses of
"Presto":

"ocean flow" -- Natural Science
"heart of the city" -- Camera Eye
"stranger coming out of the rain" -- Cinderella Man
"evening plane" -- Fly By Night
"dust of the stars" and "constellations of light" -- Cygnus X-1 ?
"a million homes" -- Subdivisions
"what you're doing" -- What You're Doing

ABWH did something similar in one of their songs (I forget which, I don't
have the CD with me), where they mention things like "the roundabout".  I
thought "Presto" was a little better, though.

Anyway, though these little twists are neat, I think they are a little too
gimmicky, especially because these two songs ("Presto" and "Anagram") are
probably the weakest on the album.  If they had come up with better music to
go behind the lyrics, I wouldn't have minded as much.  In comparison, the
rap on "Roll the Bones" would have seemed much more gimmicky if the song
around it weren't so great.

Does anyone have a clue when tickets might go on sale for these shows?  I
missed the announcement of the Queensryche tickets, so I'll probably have to
go General Admission...

Anyway, one final request about those concert reviews: please try to keep
them short, since there's going to be a lot of them.  The main thing I would
be interested in seeing is differences between shows, to see if they are
trying to be more spontaneous with the song list or order.  And I still
think it would be great if they did a cover song...

Someone said something really weird about Anagram in the last TNMS. He
pointed out that "image is just an eyeless game", which, according to
him, means that "image is just the word game without an i". Where's
the logic here? Game would be an i-less image but image is not an
i-less game.

Re: RUSH Junos

	The Boyz also won group (I think; maybe album) of the year for
the album 'SIGNALS'.
	They didn't accept personally, but sent a humorous videotape
'accepting this award for baseball'.

Re: New video

	I saw the first of the new videos on Much Music on Monday.
Roll the Bones -- Quite impressive! The mystery rapper is still
anonymous!

Re: other things

	A spotlight of RUSH on Much Music (I guess about a month ago)
had Geddy perhaps suggesting that the group is taken too
seriously:
		"We're taken so seriously!  I've had people ask me
		'What did it mean when you grabbed Alex's nose?'"

	Neil as a pseudo-intellectual ---

	here's a quote from a magazine interview in '89 (Network,
 Jan./Feb.,1989),

		"'As much as we like to get heady or pseudo-intellectual
		',says Geddy,'the reason we play in a band is because we
		like to play rock.  We like to play hard rock.  I think
		that's the one thing you'd get the three of us to agree
		on: we don't want to be wimpy.'"

	I also agree with several readers in their suggestion that
the later recordings sound 'tinny' and lack the full sound
found in earlier records.

	Please Geddy go back to the Rikenbacker !!

	Oops! I ramble on.

You've stated Neil's sportin' a new drum kit with a single bass.  Does he
still have the eletronic kit?  If not, is he all acustic now, or are his
drums actually completely triggered.  This is possible now.  A drummer for
the band I work for has these triggers mounted to the drum heads which run
into a sound generator.  He's got a GREAT sound now, and it doesn't take
ten years to sound check!

Thanks for the info!

I have decided to use the guitar and bass as a reference for the time
changes, as Neil plays the snare virtually on every beat on one time or
another, and can't be trusted to play a straight seven :).  This is especcially
true around the "the role becomes the actor" line in the second verse, where
Neil is playing in four while Ged and Lerxst are in seven.  Here we go:

2 pickup beats (cowbell, snare)
7/4 time through first verse
4/4 time where "Hits you in a soft place" occurs
6/4 time where "That's entertainment" first occurs
7/4 time through second verse
4/4 time where "Hits you in a soft place" occurs again
6/4 time after instrumental interlude (guitar entrance at 2:38 on disc)
7/4 time, same place (2:40.5 on disc)
4/4 time through rest of the chart

I believe this to be correct, and I hope it is hopeful to whoever requested
this. (I can't remember)

Well, the six hour round trip from State College to Pittsburgh was definitely
worth it!  The most striking aspect of the concert, and for me probably the
most enjoyable, was the incredible energy of all of Alex's solos (and his
playing in general).  It looked like the Gedstermeiser was wearing sunglasses,
(it was a little tough to see from where I was at although the mix was
excellent) and he had a lot of hair.  Neil had on a bandana around his head.
(hey maybe he had chemotherapy for his brain cancer or whatever the latest
sad rumor is. .and his hair fell out :) )  Boy, Neil's solo was great,
incredible energy there too, and yes I also noticed that his 'horn' samples
were more electronic than 'big band' sounding.  The crowd went nuts during the
solos for Limelight and Freewill (and about every other one too actually.)
The Pass sounded incredible.  Dreamline was incredible.  The encore was
unbelievable (the mix and match of tunes).  Don't miss this tour.  Later.

[A little prefatory note: some smart guy named Gregg Jaeger criticized my
saying that Barth's Tidewater Tales was a small,  personal version of Dos
Passos' U.S.A. This smart guy said, and I quote: "I think it's ridiculous to
see The Tidewater Tales as like Dos Passos' U.S.A. in any significant way.
U.S.A. is fundamentally sociopolitical, while TTT is fundamentally personal."
As I said, TTT is a small, personal version of U.S.A.]

(And by the way, I think everybody got the anagrams and pseudo anagrams in
Anagram(for Mongo) the first time they heard it. The title to the song sort of
clues you in to the fact that there are a lot of those anagram things; you
know, if they were dogs, they'd probably bite. That's why I think no-one
bothered to even mention them before.)

Oh well. A month to go for Montreal (Thanks Tanguy, you saved my ass by saving
that ticket.). So what's on the NMS? Plenty, it seems.

On Grand Designs, lots of people have a lot of ideas about the "Life in two
dimensions is a mass production scheme" line. Actually, when you get right
down to it, it's not the best line that the Prof. ever wrote; actually, it's
not very good, either, when you compare it to the other stuff in PW. Mystic
Rythms is a LOT better; Grand Designs just lacked a little ruthless editing.
Ditto I'd say with Anagram, one of those tunes that Rush periodically lays on
us: interesting for the directions it's pointing out, but not very good all on
it's own.

I know I'm gonna get an earfull for that last paragraph, so let me explain
something, which we should all keep in mind: Rush is great, maybe the best
band ever, as far as I'm concerned. You can have your Led Zep, and you can
have your Rolling Marshmellows, but the only band that doesn't bore me is
Rush, and I've been listening to them almost every day, for over a decade. But
they're only human. And sometimes, God help them, they screw up. Does anyone
happen to have a copy of Caress of Steel? Check out the tune Panacea: an egg
if Rush ever laid one. Madrigal, anyone? There's another egg, along with
Emotion Detector (puh-leeeze, Neil, what happened? Lerxt, Ged, what IS
this--the Gogos on acid and feeling mellow?), and maybe Chemistry, if you
wanna get picky. But hey, ain't it great that your favorite band has maybe a
handful of possible duds out of a repertoire of fourteen albums? Dude! Other
bands are ALL eggs, with maybe a cool tune or two every decade, like, say,
Queen or the Woelling Wabbits. Rush delivers, which is why I like 'em.

But Rush are human too. And Rush have not always made great tunes, as much as
we'd like them to. And something maybe a lot more important, not all the tunes
that Rush think are the best are necessarily the best, just as the ones they
think the worst are not necessarily so.

Take Signals: the boyz don't like it because they feel that the guitar isn't
really out there up front, and they say that they feel much more comfortable
with GUP. Personally, I think Lerxst took a nose-dive with GUP after shooting
his wad with Signals. I'm a mediocre to poor guitar player, and have no
further ambitions in that direction, so I can make no judgement as to how
complex the material in Signals really is. But as a listener, I think that the
guitar work in Signals was spectacular, probably the best ever. In nine years
of listening to it, I seem to find something new to it almost at every
sitting, the true test of a great album. That's my appraisal of it, and there
are probably other people who tend to agree with me. (Actually, what freaked
me about GUP was that the first time I played it, my mother said she liked it,
something that had never happened before, or--luckily--since.)

But the boyz don't like Signals. OK. But does that mean that I can't like it?
No sir! Likewise, if the boyz pull out a new album, must I adore it
uncritically?

The answer is no, writ large. I love every album Rush has ever made, but every
time I get the new album, I wonder if this is going to be the end of the
affair, quite simply because if I'm going to love everything Rush puts out
JUST because it's by Rush, I might as well not listen to it and simply preach
it, like the Nazis and the Communists and other assorted sycophants. But I
like Rush and most everything they put out not because the tunes are by Rush,
but because I like the tunes in themselves. The boyz must have written maybe
one hundred and twenty songs or so, maybe more, and if each of those tunes had
been written by 120 different bands, I'd probably have gone out and bought 120
albums by 120 groups. Fortunately for my checkbook, I've only had to buy
seventeen albums and assorted videos and bootleg stuff.

 But if I had to, I would buy the 120 albums. That I don't is because Rush,
believe it or not (and y'all better hold on to yer sombreros, buddies) are
like Shakespeare: everything they pull out is good, perhaps to a greater or
lesser extent relative to their own track record, but definitely better than
anyone else's stuff. You know, you can argue and disagree about the merits of,
say MP vis a vis PermWaves, but y'all KNOW that they're both awesome. I had
Van Halen's F.U.C.K. playing before RTB came out, but after listening to the
boyz maybe twice, VH just seemed a tad....trivial; you know--simple, like cute
little monkeys playing harmonicas or kazoos or something. Not very good
performing monkeys at that. But Rush just had good songs, generally speaking
(though I think they should have dropped YBYL). I think that in maybe a couple
of decades, no one will remember VH or any of the top 40 radio groups or stuff
like that; people will probably remember Rush as the definitive band of the
times. It's like this: the first Nobel Prize in Literature was a dude called
Sully Prudhome (I think). Does that name strike a bell? I'd be surprised if he
did. Does anyone know of a certain Mr.Tolstoi, a certain James Joyce, or this
fellow Twain? Probably....and you'd probably be surprised to know that they
all had at least ten chances of getting the Nobel, but never did. And take
Emily Bronte: ignored in her time, she is now the definitive writer of her
times. Same with Rush: they'll probably never win a Grammy, and will never be
liked by any critic--NOW. Later will be a different story, so relax, resign
yourselves to being one of the chosen few to appreciate a great band, and
think of all the fun you'll have thirty years down the road when you can say
"Yes, I saw them live for RTB, sonny, back in '91 or so, in the last century;
and sonny, lemme tell ya,  it was awesome. Now be a good boy and pass me my
false teeth."

Anyway, you'll probably all agree that I've gone on way too long with this
message (actually, I'm drunk out of my mind, so I probably haven't made a
whole lotta sense), so I'll just end it with this: let's not adore Rush like
mindless fools, but adore their MUSIC like bloody idiots. Think big, dream
Rush. Gonzalo Lira, Dartmouth College.

Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but I too have heard
all the rumors about Neil having either brain cancer or
bone cancer.I never believed them. I even talked to a guy
on IRC who says his dad knows Rupert Hine. Supposedly,
Rupert says Neil does have bone cancer. I told him he was
full of shit about 100 times but he kept insisting it was true.
I'll still believe it when I hear it from Neil himself.

And another thing,
somebody yesterday posted a message that said NOT A SPOILER!
Well, he didn't give away any songs, but he did list about
6-7 songs that they DID NOT play!
Dammit! I dont want to hear any of that! My show's not for 2 and
a half weeks and ever since the tour started people have been
putting little bits of info here that I still consider a spoiler.
Please, do not continue to do this.

hi
  I have been following the NMS for a few weeks now and I must
admit that it is a remarkable compilation of articles.  The
analysis of lyrics, the in-depth probe into the musical aspect
leaves me in awe.  However, nobody has said anything about the
mysterious voice in 'Camera Eye' in _Moving Pictures_.
  Well after half the song of 'Camera Eye' ( Dont know the
exact time....i own a battered walkman....no hi-fi set :-(   )
after the following lines:

  Are we oblivious to the quality
  This quality of ....???...in every city street.

After the above lines, listen closely.  Somebody talks...
Mebbe Geddy Lee cracking a joke in the studio....but
definitely someone talks.....Someone out there with a
CD player or something, maybe you will vouch for me.
  I am all agog for the answer to this one.
  Countdown 34 days for the 1st Dec. concert at Hartford CT
show....am going overboard with excitement....

	To anyone who cares:

My brother went to the show in Rochester last weekend, and boy, did he say
it kicked ass.  I can't wait for the Cap. Center show.  it should be a doozie.
My brother didn't even have a ticket until he bought one outside of the

War Memorial for $20.  His seat sucked, but he noticed that a 1st row section
that was empty.  Guess what!???  He got to "Roll the Bones" from the 1st row!!
Bastard!  And I have to wait all night at the cap center to get them???  oh,
well, it'll be worth it.  Anyway, just a mindless story to brighten your day.

Is it true that Rush is changing their opening song from night to night?
I know that it was Force Ten in Hamilton, but I read that it was Red
Sector A in Rochester.  Is this just a mistake?  Hmmm...

Juswt saw Van Halen in Hartford... Excellent show.  THe band was really
on fire this evening.

Hey youns, it's me again

	It might take a keyboardist to have noticed this one, but...

Did you notice that the sequenced organ stabs in "Roll The Bones" were the
same in both places in the song, unlike the studio version where different
chords are played for the first stabs?  In other words, at the Pittsburgh
show both sets of stabs were the same (C chord, G chord), but on the album
the first set is different (G chord, F chord).

Did anyone at a different show notice this one?

Hey I'd just like to say thanks to Nick Mascari for sticking up for us
average, typical American ho-hum rush fans. What's with these
Netherlanders anyways? I DO believe that People who listen to rush and
atleast try to understand in their own way what it all means is in no way
"average" or unintelligent!! In my English class a few days ago, my
teacher gave us a list of vocabulary words to study up on for a future
quiz- I already knew HALF of the words listed, you know why? They were
words used in Rush lyrics that I had never known before and I was
prompted to look them up to understand the meaning of the song. I think I
am absolutely right when I say that Neil Peart is nothing short of a
GENIUS! NOT only can he play the drums and percussion like he is two
people in one body, he writes lyrics that ARE amazing. He is a teacher.
His lyrics wordy? They certainly aren't dull. Take a look a Shakespear.
Tell me his writing isn't wordy.
-------------------------------------
On another subject(still Rush ),
on the video The Pass, is that an Ayn Rand book I see on the 'loners'
table? I've seen a picture of her before and the woman on the cover looks
like her(I think).

AND............I do think that HYF is one of the best albums they've ever
done! Listen to that Bass! Dig those drums! Listen to that synthesizer!
You can'y enjoy those songs unless your wearing your 3-D glasses!
Otherwise, you'll only be seeing it in one-half D!!

Well, Rush has come and gone.
	The show was about as good as Presto. I must say that at my show, Eric
Johnson played his heart out. Sure he might be "just a speed demon" but
he was evoking some emotion up there. - And don't flame me for this, but
the clarity of his guitar sound, and the constraints on HIS
amplification made his chops good competition for Alex's. Alex was
bathing in that high pitched twang for most of the show with the
exceptions of FREEWILL and LIMELIGHT, where he managed to get some DSP
to emulate the sound of an overdriven Marshall stack. Cool! Really deep
bad ass guitar sound. The Encore used this tone too. But his solos in
the other songs were like a bunch of high end screaming into your ear.
His musical statement became a bunch of unrelated words. He did an
extended solo in THING and that was impressive, and the volume foot
pedal playing was nice to hear again.
	As for Geddy, his bass sounded Overdriven! What the hell did he put on
that thing, a DOD distortion/crunch/drive pedal????? He KICKED ASS on
his solos but nobody but a true rush fan could pick out these notes in
all that distortion. He was really going at it though, and at some
points you could discern some tonal quality in a solo. FREEWILL was
great. The whole amplification system was cranked, though and even some
of the samples, like the female vocal in Time Stand Still  were
crackling with distortion. I guess it's an arena show, so you have to
expect that.
	Why did Ged attempt to sing oldies like FINDING MY WAY?? Sure, we all
liked the music, but the songs just cannot be sung anymore. He took some
parts down an octave, and others he harmonized on lower notes (just
below the norm) FREEWILL was great because Geddy knew his limit and
broke into another number just before the unbelievably high, "Each of
us... A cell of awareness" came.  You knew that the band was doing their
homework musically, though. They ripped through that 6piece medley!
Bunnies again.... low tour budget. SUPERCONDUCTOR was great, and so was
SUBDIVISIONS.

Also. TOO MUCH FEEDBACK FOR A PROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL CREW!!!! WHAT THE
HELL!!!!?????!!!!

Overall, the rating is B+, just like presto
(Why do I judge ??
Because I judge. So there,)
