The default assumption that most people would make on hearing the song
is the interpretation of romantic love.  The word "love" itself (as
applied to people) has romantic connotations, and you have to precede
it with "brotherly" or make the context clear to change it.  The evidence
doesn't seem to make it clear that it is platonic love, so I'll assume
it's romantic.

In addition, the line: "Somehow we find each other through all that masquerade"
implies romantic love more than brotherly.  As described in "War Paint" off
the previous album, people involved in a romantic relationship will often
pretend to be different from their true selves. "girl before the mirror
appraises her disguise" and "boy before the mirror checks his camouflage"
clearly refer to romantic, rather than platonic love.  This artifice occurs
less frequently in platonic realtionships, in which the people are generally
in control of their senses.  :-)

Hi everyone & greetings from a die-hard Rush fan,

This is my first posting. The main purpose is to ask
a question. I'm listening to "The Necromancer" right
now and would like to know who recites the prose in
the beginning and again, towards the end.

And speaking of Rush's chart ratings, I don't care if
they don't make it to any charts; Rush is THE greatest
group ever!!!

I think I prefer them not to be on the charts, considering
the company they'll be in & the kind of music tastes
that decide the ratings. But then, maybe I'm just being
an elitist bastard :-)

What? You can't understand what the deeeeeep voice is saying in Show
Don't Tell? It is: "I will Be The Judge" And "Give The Jury Direction"
And Who's to say it is Alex Saying it? Alex's voice isn't even THAT deep.
It's Neil who has a Hella DEEEEP voice. And the voice on Subdivisions say
ing the word "subdivisions" is not A natural voice. It seems computer
enhanced. Everybody has this misconception since they see Alex Step up to
the mike and Lip Sync the word Subdivisions in the Video, that he has a
deeeep voice. WRONG! I've heard his voice and it is not. So there.
Also, I was reading through the credits at the end of the ASOH video, and
it lists one JACK FUNK in the credits, so it seems that he existed way
before the band even thought about concieving a song like Roll The Bones.
Got My Roll The Bones Press Booklet a couple-o- days ago and DoooooooD!!
It is HELLA sweet!By the way, "hella" is the new "in" word. It includes a
black and white photo of the dudes, sort of like what you would get if
you wrote them a fan letter saying, "give me a picture of you guys!"
And it also has Row The Boats, the press release penned by Neil that we
all love so much.

P.S. Pleeeeeeeeze! No more Explaining about how a vinyl disc can have
more or less sound on one side! WE GET THE PICTURE! Thank You.

Despite the subject heading, this is not a parody of "You Bet Your Life."
In fact, this isn't even off rtb.  Instead, I finally decided to write up
a parody of "Witch Hunt" that's been brewing in my mind for the last year.

--| * Pitch Bunt
--| Part III of 'Beer'

 The batter stands
 Without a sound
 The air is thick, and still

 All the eyes are focused on
 The lonely pitcher's hill

Bleachers distorted in the halogen light
The faces are twisted and grotesque
Drunken and loud in the sweltering night
The mob moves like demons possessed
Completely obnoxious, waiting to fight -
Confident their team is best

 The righteous rise
 With blurry eyes
 Unfocused and unclear

 Fat men fed on beer and fries
 To eat, and burp, and cheer

They say there are dangers, to play for us
Gotta dodge that wild ball
But other sports are much more dangerous
Have Bo Jackson tell you all
Those who know what's best for us -
Must try to save us from football

 Quick to swing
 Quick to anger
 Slow to hit the ball

 Being sent
 Back to the bench
 Or worse
 The shower stall

I've started to collect the parodies, but I forgot to save off the earlier
ones, like "Beeresy" (part 0 of "Beer"?) and "Take my Wife."  Is someone
putting together a collection for us Weird-Al-junkies?

<A NAME="347007">Subject: Rush pre-party in Pittsburgh</A>

As many of you know by now, Rush is playing one of their earliest stateside
dates in our beautiful city of Pittsburgh (where they've been playing "Ghost
Of A Chance" all along, Brian Young!).  Since several folks have expressed
interest in having our second Pittsburgh TNMS Rush party the night of the
concert (October 28), and since I'm all for it, I'll immediately eliminate the
biggest problem we faced in organizing the first Rush party by offering to
host Round Two at my apartment.  We won't be able to have live music there,
but (a) it'll reduce my email organizing headache and (b) we'll be going to
hear the real thing anyway!

So what I propose is to have a pre-concert get-together at my Shadyside pad,
which is right across the street from a Negley bus stop, on a direct line to
the Arena.  I'll even spring for a couple cases o' beer (how 'bout that
Glacier Bay, Chuck and Doug? :), but depending on the response, donations may
be necessary (I *am* a poor grad student, after all).  Since it's on a Monday,
I don't foresee it starting till around 5, so as much beer as we can consume
in two hours is all we really need, eh?

If you're interested in attending, email me at the address below and I'll send
you directions to my pad.

"Get busy!"

those of us who live in the ass end of nowhere and probably won't

Awile ago I posted that the three beats in 'Dreamline' sounded like wood
block strikes through some heavy effects.  It's quite possible they could
be sonar pulses or anything else for that matter, except for dogs.
But who really cares anyway?  As for the argument that they were triggered
by Neil, and therefore not dogs, HEY, ANYTHING can be sampled and then
triggered later, in recording or concert!  And as for the people trying to
find some meaning in the pulses, its's JUST a neat drum-fill.  I really
don't think Neil added those beats for some kind of imagery effect, but
think what you will!

 I thought I'd pass along what I know about the Normal, IL show.  First of
all, if you don't already have tickets, forget it-they went on sale two weeks
ago.  Here's my sad ticket tale.  Tickets went on sale Friday, but only to
ISU students.  I quickly called a student friend and we got in line Thurs.
night ~10:00-120th in line.  Then they make "the announcement"-no limit on
ticket purchases!  Needless to say it was a feeding frenzy for the first
people in line.  The first two people both bought 70 tix each.  The fourth
person in line only got seventh row.  I only got second row risers off to the
side.  Geesh-what a stupid way to run a show.  Maybe I'll do better this Sat.
in St. Louis(anybody gonna be in line Fri-see you there)

On a non-related note...
  As long as everybody's trying to figure out various sound effects(dogs,
etc..)
 Someone mentioned the jackhammers at the beginning of Force Ten.  To me
it sounds like fast synth drum roll.  IMHO I don't think it's sampled, it's
too clean.
  Also, and if this has been discussed shoot me, has anyone noticed that the
line "...and the meek shall inherit the earth" from 2112 is two different
takes-one on each channel?  I know, it's trivial, but it kind of freaked me
out when I listened to it on headphones.

Oh well, enough of this, gotta get ready for the ticket expidition Friday.

<A NAME="347015">Subject: "Dreamline" controversy--resolved !</A>

     I just can't understand all the confusion I'm hearing.
Surely any reasonable person should be able to hear that the
sound in "Dreamline" is the mating dance of the dung beetle,
recorded at night, played backwards, sampled, and then sped
up to twice its normal rate.  At first I thought it was the
sound of lemmings smashing on wet rocks, but now I realize
how unlikely that idea is...it would be WAY too hard to filter
out the noise of the waves.

     As for this whole "dog barking" angle, I just don't get
it.  Dogs barking in the distance in someone's hometown ?  I'm
sorry, but isn't that a bit of a stretch ?  I mean, at least
the submarine theory had the benefit of linking in with all of
the subtle underwater references in the lyrics (you know, the
"liquid-crystal compass", a "book of the rivers" [a MAP book],
"a flickering light left behind in the heartland" [obviously
referring to an enemy city fried by a sub-launched missile !]).

     I guess this is really a request to all you well-meaning
but mixed-up "dog bark" believers:  listen to it again, think
about it for a while, and see if you don't agree that it sounds
more like the wily dung beetle (or at least a submarine ping).
You'll be glad you did.

That Dreamline bit doesn't sound like a dog's bark, IMO. The sonar ping
idea is possible, but I really think (read OPINION) that that little
section of noise is just one of the orchestrative touches R.Hine threw
in. Like the "Faith is cold as ice - (bell chimes) Why are little ones ..."
in RTB. Just throwing in noises to keep the songs busy. :)

An extra special thanx to the posters of tour dates!! And to the
scheduling of the Largo date neither night of my classes! (Like it
really would have mattered?)

Lastly - the alternative lyric laddies/ladies. I laffed my butt off at

Now I find myself in Los Alamos, NM for another year and I am seriously afraid
of missing the show.  (*SOB*)

HELP ME PLEASE!!!  :-)
