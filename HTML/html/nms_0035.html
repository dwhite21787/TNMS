I'm sorry if I missed any discussion pertaining to these questions,
but I'm a relative Newcomer to this list, so please forgive me.

I have a series of questions about Presto.  I'll just ask them in
order:

1.) The album cover: Has anyone else commented on this album cover
yet, besides Todd Day in Digest #24 (he basically said, "it's obvious"
but it's not obvious to me :), particularly in regard to the number of
rabbits?  I count 12 rabbits.  Is there any possible correlation
between this number and the fact that this is Rush's 12th studio album
in the Peart-Lee-Lifeson configuration?  Add to that the fact that
this album is on a new record label, and the one rabbit by itself
coming out of the floating hat may gain some significance.

2.) Album name: As I'm sure you musicians already know, presto is a
musical term, an instruction to the performer to play in a fast tempo,
but with the rabbit-in-a-hat image takes on the connotation of the
magical incantation, as in "Presto change-o," and the song "Presto"
contains the lines, "If I could wave my magic wand..." and "I'm not
one to believe in magic."  Is any of this perhaps a commentary on the
new record label; was Rush somehow pressured in any way to produce
this album (pull a rabbit out of a hat), or perhaps directed to lean
towards the commercial side of the fence?  Would Rush ever really
sacrifice their artistic integrity in such a manner?  (I can't believe
they would.)  Due to the references in "Show Don't Tell" to a legal
court experience (judge, jury, witness, etc.) I'm led to ask: have any
band members had a brush with the law recently?

3.) Anagram (for Mongo): Okay, what's the anagram?  Is there one?
Who's Mongo?

4.) Liner notes: "Preproduction work at Chalet Studio, engineered by
Lerxst..."  As mentioned in this list before (Digest #24), Lerxst is
an anagram for Alex.  Does Alex really double as an audio engineer?
The HYF liner notes state, "Recorded...on the Lerxst Mobile, assisted
by Lerxst..."  Does this mean Alex owns the mobile or that he had a
unit named after him?

Thank you all for the great Rush info!  Keep it coming!!!  Thanks to
everyone who responded to my lyrics request.  I'm now the proud owner
of the complete set of Rush album lyrics -- all 13 albums' worth.

Here's a sample from the New & Improved Random Rush Generator:
     To the rhythms of the night
     we twist the world and ride the wind
     It ought to be second nature -

                My fellow RUSHans--
In 1988, as Rush were in England closing out their HYF tour, I came
across an interview of Geddy in, appropriately, a British magazine.
I happily read it over, my nose fully steeped in "words of wisdom",
laughing as Geddy's sarcastic replies seemed funnier than ever; until
I read his last statement.  In answering the interviewers' question
about whether Geddy could forsee a day when Rush would end, Geddy
responded, "I can see it.  I can't tell when it'll be, but I can tell
you we're closer to the end then we are to the beginning."  I did a
double-take, twice.  I thought, "Geddy, what do you mean 'closer to
the end'?!"  I was in shock.  The idea of Rush not being around some
day had never really occured to me before.  Granted, it *is obvious*
but I had never really considered it.  I suppose it's analogous to the
Clapton song which says, "nobody lonely till somebody come" (well, not
that particular line, but you get the idea)--until it was mentioned,
the thought hadn't occured to me.  I felt like I'd been hit by a brick
wall--it was so depressing to hear one of the _Boyz_ say it!  I moped
around the house after that and could not get that statement out of my
mind.

	Awhile later, Presto came out, and my hopes of Rush being
around rose, until I read somewhere that they had come the closest
they have ever come to splitting up.  I was almost in tears when I
realized that my earlier fears had almost been realized.  An idea that
I had had when I read Geddy's interview came back to me and I became
even more motivated to do it--and I thought I'd just pass on the idea
to all of you.

	When RUSH does their last tour, I'd like to follow them
throughout the entire tour and attend every concert.  I pass this on
to you because it occured to me when the existence of the Digest was
made known to me (thanx, Robert!) that someone else might have had/may
be interested in doing the same thing.  If there are enough people who
are interested (who isn't?) or can go, perhaps we can all go together
(Yo!  Rush-mgr, don't think this doesn't include you!).  I sincerely
hope I'm being YEARS early on this, but I just thought I'd bring this
up now--I mean if this *does* come to fruition, it'll be a b*tch to
organize.  Anyway, if anyone is interested in doing this, let me
know.  If you have done somthing lik this before, or know someone who
has, or if you have any questions, ideas, concerns, etc., etc. send
them to the Digest under the subject heading "Last Tour", (so everyone
else can read it) and I'll get up a collection and post it when the
time comes.  This doesn't have to be decided by next week. but when
you have the chance, think about it.  I'll post this every few months
for any/all new members and just as a reminder.   Gotta go.

[ Note: If you want to collect such things & post a composite at a later
        date, I'd have them mail directly to you.  I'd rather keep redundancy
        to a minimum here, please!                                :rush-mgr ]

OK. I've finally found the opportunity to speak out about
something that's been bothering me:

     "Image is just an eye-less game."

No! Game is an eye-less image!

Whew! What a relief.
<end quote>

	Sorry, you've missed the meaning.  Five, less two, is three.
Similarly, "Image", less "game", is "I" (or "eye", with poetic licence.)
Subtle differences in reading the line make a great difference in the
meaning.

Question...
     Is there a book on Rush?
     I heard that there is one titled "Visions"?
     Can anyone tell me more about it... and the author / publisher ...
     So I can order it....
     I have gone to bookstores but nobody's heard of it...

[ I've seen three:  "Visions", "Success Under Pressure", and and old one
  whose name escapes me now.  Yo, Jimmy (or anybody), can you supply the
  info on publishers, catalog numbers, etc.?                    :rush-mgr ]
