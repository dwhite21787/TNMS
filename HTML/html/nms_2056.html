Fellow Rush non-bashers,
I haven't written anything in a while, but I have heard something I didn't 
like-forgive me if this was rumor. I'm with you, William. Boston is a great 
band. Now I love Rush but I think B-man has passed into the outer limits 
here. I enjoyed his book immensely and I don't know him personally, but 
with a liking for music like Rush produces, I couldn't understand his qualm 
with Boston. They have been knocking out some great stuff [few and far 
between-but still good]. Along with Rush and REO Speedwagon, Boston is one 
of those bands I was first introduced to and have liked them ever since. To 
me, they're music is a bit progressive, as is RUSH. I like that. How one 
album forms a kind of story. Third Stage-great album!!

Just a little note here, I'm getting another tattoo this weekend, and I 
decided on our beloved logo. Some may think that's stupid, but I've always 
wanted that. Anybody else get it as a tattoo, out there? Just interested to 
know. 54 days and a wake-up in this sh*t country!!

Later,
Raz

Myself being a big fan of Buddy Rich (and big-band/jazz/swing in general)
(I have to admit...I got hooked on Buddy when I heard 'Burning For
Buddy'), I got to wondering what Neil thinks of sudden onslaught of swing
bands like Cherry Poppin' Daddies.  I mean, does he think this will draw
fans to check out the older stuff (such as Buddy), or will fans do the
same to this music that they do to just about every other music (i.e. say
"Well, that's old stuff, so it sucks, and I won't even give it a
chance...")  

Anyone have any opinions?

I won't bother to quote the magnificently childish post of Bill
Banasiewicz, if in fact that's who wrote said drivel -- you never know
nowadays about fake posts.  I *hope* it was a prankster, because if that
was the real Bill Banasiewicz, it's shameful to admit he typed one of the
few books about Rush.

Then again, Visions was such an amateurish effort style-wise that the
whiny, adolescent attitude displayed in his (com)post makes perfect sense.

Bill, I hope you "write" eighty-seven books about Rush or say, Maturation:
A Mystical Concept, but please, have mercy, don't foist them on the public.
 A second benefit to all that typing would be you'd lack the time to ever
post here again.

What a piece of trash. And for a fellow "Rush fan," this is embarrassing.
This, supposedly, from the person who held a position of trust with a
wonderful band (and a great group of friends), and through his own admitted
actions, screwed it up beyond measure. I submit....

<< I subscribe to lists of many different bands, and it's really "sad" that
the Rush list has the worst content of any of them, by far!>>
Well, come on, "Bill," enlighten us. Since this list lacks so much, in your
opinion, tell us more stories of your experiences with the band to improve it.

<< Now, as far as the rumors are concerned, YES, I did play a demo on the
radio before it's release. And I've NEVER denied such a fact. It would be
awfully hard to deny something which thousands of people heard! Not only that,
but I did it again! The circumstances surrounding the 2nd time really sealed
my fate with the band.>>
One, a bonehead move like that proves that you're more of an idiot than most
people realize, and second, your reputation is in such tatters at this point
that there really isn't a whole hell of a lot that you could do to redeem
yourself. Most important of all. You're lying about "never denying such a
fact," and you know you are. And to do it twice----what the hell is the matter
with you?

<< So it was really the circumstances surrounding what happened, which really
pissed the band off. I made a mistake! I'm sorry! I wish it never happened,
but it did! It's my bed, and I'm lying in it.>>
:::Ding!::: We have a winner!
Between that faux pas and chasing after a baseball and tripping on a wire, I
could not stop laughing. Besides, I know Janis Joplin, and she really is
ticked that no one believed that she signed a petition for Rush to play
Philadelphia. ("Hey, Janis! Some guy named Peart just made fun of you!")

<<. I know more about this band than "all" of you folks at the National
Midnight Slander combined!>>
OK. Nyah, nyah, nyah. Flake.

<< So don't tell me I CAN'T  write another book on the band. I can write five
books! You folks, just may never see them!>>
And you can't ride in my little red wagon. So now we're even. Now, to your
side of the sandbox.

You are too f***ing funny, man. Really.

<A NAME="2056006">Subject: The Tom Sawyer Remix</A>

Hey folks!

Just joined the list again after a long hiatus, and it's nice to be back!!
For my inaugural post, I'm presenting my take on the Tom Sawyer remix which
has been talked about as of late. I found a sample somewhere about a month
ago and grabbed it, too bad i didn't save it (anybody know where this is??
It was a techno/hiphop type of site)

Anyway, the remix!! The sample is the first part of the song, up to the
middle of the first verse. The DJ loops the first few seconds a couple of
times, then it goes into the vocal, all the time being
looped/redoubled/scratched or whatever you call it. I wouldn't say that he
butchers the song, but the constant looping gets annoying and boring REALLY
fast. Plus, the sample dominates the mix, there is nothing thrown in
alongside it, so it quickly becomes apparent that the "remix" could more
accurately be called a "ripoff", as with the Puff Daddy song that used the
riff from Every Breath You Take. I'm not against sampling at all, quite the
opposite in fact. I think it's great that some DJ used a Rush riff as a
sample. I wish more bands would! I just didn't feel that he made very
creative use of what could have been pretty cool!!

good day eh

<A NAME="2056007">Subject: Own your own Red Barchetta!!</A>

While traipsing through cyberspace this evening, I did an Alta Vista
search on "Ferrari Barchetta" and found an Italian company that makes
1:18 scale die-cast models (they have a funny name, like Bburago or
something). One of their features of the month was a 50th anniversary
editon Barchetta... apparently in 1997 the folks at Pinnafarina pulled
out all the stops on this one, because it's a beauty. The model-makers
at Bburago didn't do too bad, themselves. If you want to se it, here's
the address:

http://www.die-cast.com/feature/issues/97-09/index2.html

I have no idea where you might go to get one of these; there's a
speciality store here in Kansas City MO called "Cars the Star" which may
or may not carry them... try giving them a call @ 816/221-1957 if you're
interested. I do know that they ship worldwide, and will accept credit
card orders over the phone. Sorry that I have only the sketchiest of
info, but that's what happens when I surf late at night. If anyone is
interested in procuring one of these, send me a private email and I will
get the pertinent info (cost, etc.) back to you... That way, you can
avoid the telephone charges... and really, isn't that what the internet
is all about?!

Hey fellow Rush-Addicts,

Thanks to all of you on this list that recommended Peter Gabriel -
Genesis,  I went and picked up Selling England by the Pound,  and I
absolutely loved it!  What's the low down on the rest of the Gabriel era?
 Which of the other albums are any good?  I really loved all the 7/4 time
signatures (One of the reasons I like Rush and Dream Theater). Do any of
the other Gabriel Albums have these funky time signatures in them?  I've
also been exploring the realms of Yes - interesting band.  Are there more
interesting Prog bands from the 70 that use funky time signatures (the
more the better), please do share - working on expanding my collection.

For the  Rush fan that recently picked up Falling Into Infinity - that by
far is their most conventional and pop oriented album - making it my
least favorite Dream Theater Album.  My favorites are Images and Words
and When Dream and Day Unite.  Awake seems to be there "heaviest" Album -
Sort of a hybrid between Rush and Metallica (Sorry for the lack of a
better comparison).  A Change of Seasons is also enjoyable and is good
for long scenic drives.  One of the things I like about Dream Theater are
the unconventional time signatures, everything from 13/4 to 5/4 and all
in the same song (Falling into infinity seems to have the most strait 4/4
songs of any album).  Good luck in your DT explorations.

Any Fates Warning fans out there?

Aaron Calder

In response to Martin Urionaguena's comment (and everyone else's) about
Rush's lawyers shutting down the NMS page, I assure you, the attorneys are
not doing anything the Boys and/or their label(s) haven't specifically told
them to do.  I know its convenient and popular to blame the lawyers, and I
know that this unfortunate news has left a bad taste in our mouths, but
remember two things:  (1) an attorney cannot act contrary to their client's
directions, and (2) if you were in Rush's shoes, you'd be doing the same
thing.  Let's all try to deviate from the norm here, and not blame the
lawyers for all the problems in the world, and specifically, for doing what
Rush and their record companies have told them to do.

Donna's comments about rush not being able to get onto snl and not doing well
in new york or boston. 

to expand, the east coast, inbred with liberalism, does not take kindly to
neal's conservative undertones he gleans from living life throught the lenses
of ayn rands objectivism. so it is the elites liberal views that are spared by
not giving rush more exposure.

<A NAME="2056012">Subject: Reply to Jason on Track speed on Xanadu</A>

My rebuttal to you Jason Flynn:

Do you play guitar?  If so, you would find the tuning in Xanadu extremely
unusual.  You would also notice that every other song on A Farewell To Kings
uses a standard tuning.  When Alex decides to use an alternate tuning, he
usually tunes up or down a full tone or semi-tone (e.g. in The Big Money Alex
tuned his guitar up a full tone).
  
Xanadu is strange.  It is slightly sharp - not even a semi-tone.  I can't
imagine that the band re-tuned all the keyboards, guitars and basses to this
unusual tuning for this one song.  Almost every other song on every other
album uses a standard tuning.  

I KNOW they sped up the song intentionally, but I'm sure it was a monetary
decision - studio time is expensive, and this was a cheap shortcut to fix a
perceived problem. 

Keep in mind, vocals are usually recorded separately after the instruments are
recorded.  My suspicion is that the band realized the tempo of Xanadu was a
little slow, sped up the tape and THEN Geddy recorded the vocals.  This would
make his voice sound normal, since he was singing to the already sped-up
instrument tracks.  Keep in mind, Xanadu is only slightly out of tune, which
would not create a noticeable change in the tone of the instruments.  

As for the notion that changing the tempo without changing the pitch is
COMPLETELY impossible - I believe it is entirely possible - that is what
Digital technology is all about (it's all translated into 1s and 0s - you can
do amazing things with computers!).  Would the band care to fix it? Probably
not - I'm sure Alex doesn't jam to his own albums, and therefore hasn't
realized how irritating this is.

By the way, I got several emails from others who have noticed the problem and
also found it irritating.  One email even recommended I check out Denon CD
players, because they have pitch control capabilities similar to the tracking
speed adjustment on turntables.

In a word, no. Things called VSO's (Variable Speed Oscillators) have
existed for decades. Don't ask me how they work, but their purpose is
precisely to change pitch without altering speed.

There are surely more sophisticated (digital) versions of this tool
today. Software that allows you to do this with sound files is common
and inexpensive.

Differences in pitch between "pressings" of vinyl, tape, and most likely
even CD's can and do exist. Sound system components are another factor
that can vary pitch. 

Regarding your comments on Visions, etc. - bravo! 

I'd like to say to Bill Banasiewicz: First, thank you for Visions.
Second, almost any non-fiction work I've ever read had some annoying and
unsatisfying aspects in retrospect; I think the criticism leveled at
Visions here has been valid and literarily- (and not personally)
oriented. Third, I have yet to see anything "slanderous" of *anybody*,
least of all Rush, posted here. Every list (except the ______ list, the
only list for serious Rush fan/musicians, of course) :> is full of
"idiotic crap" (very subjective); if you can't distinguish between loose
talk (it's allowed) and slander (it's illegal, even on the Internet),
you need to think about it a little more clearly.

And fourth, calm down! We dug, and still dig, your ENTHUSIASM for the
band. It's something we share.

This, I'd say, is COMPLETELY impossible.  I don't claim to know about
today's technology, but dealing with sound reproduction seems to be a
fairly simple concept--you have music which contains notes at a certain
frequency.  If you change the speed of the music you change the
frequency of the notes (thus changing the # of waves per second), and
finally the pitch is affected.

Jason,
     You are correct, but when dealing with digital information, anything
is possible. It's how that information is interpreted and then presented
which determines it's audible perception. I have included a link to a
software program that a lot of musicians may find useful which would give
an example of this. The software supposedly (I have not personally checked
it out) is capable of playing CDs at different speeds _without_ changing
the pitch. I can see a lot of musicians out there using this program for
learning difficult and/or intersting guitar/bass licks by looping the track
(or portion thereof) at a slower tempo.

I would like to back up a recent post about Scarred Records - Ryan is

And that's from Texas to the UK. I'm looking forward to getting Spiral,

Superconductor - great song, but on my CD the first clonk on the cowbell
(or is it a timbale or a crotale? I KNOW it's not a triangle!) sounds a
bit wierd...more of a cloink, as if the tape had a slight drop out.
Maybe I'm just having an audial synaptic breakdown at that point (yeah,

My rebuttal to your rebuttal you Swisstpa:

No I don't play guitar and I don't pretend to know anything about Alex's
playing or tuning in general.  I just found it interesting that you
claimed that "everyone has noticed that Xanadu is not in tune with the
rest of the songs on AFTK."  Doesn't that give me license to comment
even though I don't play guitar?  Unless you think everyone *does* play
guitar?

I don't doubt anything you claim to have observed relating to guitar or
tuning.

OK maybe they did speed it up but your reasons for why are ridiculous.
Song speed has no bearing on how much time they spend in the studio, and
on the AFTK album, side 1 is 16:59 in length and side 2 is 20:32.  Why
would they need to shorten side 1 if a time constraint was the issue.
Rush has dealt with time constraint issues in the past--Project 3:57,
New World Man--and the reasons surrounding the problem on Signals don't
apply to AFTK.

OK, that's all plausible.  It's just my opinion that they wouldn't do
that.

I have a hard time believing it can be accomplished with much quality,
but who knows--I change my stance from claiming I know it's impossible
to merely *doubting* that it is possible.

Cool.  I always enjoy messing with the speed of the old record player to
change everything.  Remember, I never claimed that the tone wasn't
different.  I believe you.

<A NAME="2056018">Subject: Ayn Rand Again</A>

Rush mgr.  I'm not sure you'll allow this to become a new thread, but I
figured, what the hell, we had a thread about fractals last year which
didn't have much of a tie-in to Rush, so why not philosophy.

I just wanted to respond to a recent post by John and/or Darlene Heald
concerning some recent comments I made about Ayn Rand.  In their post, they
said:

"James, would you say that the above stated philosophy (objectivism), de
facto, would
support Social Darwinism?  Because this is what I?ve taken from Rand and
I cannot support this posture in myself, others or governments.  IMO,
Objectivism, while the philosophy goes deeper than Libertarianism, can
not be separated from Libertarianism since it?s position supports
Libertarian views."

In answer to the first part, my answer is no, objectivism does not support
Social Darwinism.  The premise of Social Darwinism is survival of the
fittest or that man is a brute animal with no capacity to reason.  It is a
philosophy that doesn't separate man from the savage ( whether it is a
ferocious lion killing its prey or an early primate). Objectivism holds
rationality as man's basic virtue, and it's what enables you to have an
intelligent conversation such as this. Objectivists compete, they don't
prey.

As to libertarianism, I essentially agree.  I wasn't trying to separate it
from Objectivism.  They both share common ground on politics and many
ethical issues.  My point was that the current libertarian movement
basically started from the objectivist groups of the 60s.

You also said you disagree with my statement:
"Again, anyone who follows individualism to the degree that they are hurting
others is following the Nietzche model for individualism, not Rands."

and that Rand's form of individualism was hurting others through inaction.

That's a dangerous contradiction you accept.  First off, how do you define
"inaction hurting others."  If you mean the government not passing welfare
legislation to help the poor, I think that kind of inaction is appropriate.
I believe, welfare, while well-intentioned, ultimately is destructive and
hurts those it intends to help.

Now if you mean not helping someone who is say, being mugged, that inaction
is not supported by Objectivism.  Rand's philosophy  understands and
appreciates the value of human life and wouldn't be in conflict with
helping someone being physically attacked. Maintaining a civilized society
can be categorized as being in an objectivists' self-interest. Of course,
that help can take different forms, whether it is physically preventing the
attack or just alerting the police.  It's an individual decision on the
appropriate form of help.  For instance, I recently came across a man who
was laying unconcious in the street.  While I didn't physically pick him up
and take him to the hospital, I did ask a local store owner to call the
police, which he did.

I remember reading a couple of weeks ago the numerous posts bemoaning local 
radio stations that seem to limit Rush in their daily programs.  I was 
pleasantly surprised by our local station here in Pensacola, TK101.  Last 
evening at 6:00 they had this call-in "Free-loader" contest to win a CD and 
some Ice Pilots (East Coast Hockey League) trading cards.  To their credit, 
they played "Distant Early Warning," "Xanadu" and "Show Don't Tell."  Not 
easily identifiable by the fickle "Tom Sawyer-esque" Rush fan.  I tried to 
get through but without success.  Some stoner-sounding dude won.  So there 
are in fact some radio-types who appreciate "the three travelers, men of 
Willowdale," emerging from the shadows of the room of archived CDs.  Nice 
job, TK101.  I was impressed by the relative obscurity of your choices last 
evening.  MK

Hey Rushdom.

     I too remember the awesome light extravaganza put on by Triumph. I
took a friend to see them for the "Never Surrender" tour.  Both she and
I were extremely impressed by the green lasers. Especially when they
played "World of Fantasy". They bounced one laser each off two suspended
mirror balls. This effect combined with smoke produced the most
spectacular effect I've experienced at any concert and I'll never forget
it.

     It was like the air came alive around us. Millions of tiny points
of light leapt and danced around the floor and everyone on it. It was
wild. For the entire duration of that song, I stood mezmerized as
creatures of light, and seeming intelligence played and cavorted all
around me. You could just about reach out and catch one or two of them.
The three dimensional effect was thrilling!

Just a quick thought on the Bman's recent e-mail...

I must admit, he's right on a few things. There is way too much complaining in
TNMS. Hey, I thought this was supposed to be fun!? 

There's also too much rumor and unfounded info. Find out how "factual" it is
before you post it. This is how the "Neil has cancer" type things get started.

If you subscribe to TNMS, then we know RUSH is one of your fave bands. That's
cool, but stop cutting down other bands and music styles. Just because
somebody likes something you don't doesn't make "them" bad or a moron. Again,
let's have some fun! There's room enough for all bands and music styles on
this planet.

It's not the fans fault that Rush isn't promoted right/enough, or that they
don't sell out all their shows. Times have changed. People have more demands
on their time & money. They can still be a fan even if they can't go to the
show! There's no such thing as a "true" fan - you're either a fan or not.

So let's start putting a bit more positive postings on TNMS. It's a place to
CELEBRATE Rush and, yes, us - the fans. I look forward to reading it as a
break from my day, but when it's all griping and whining....I'd rather hit
delete.

Now for the Bman. It's amazing how he can cut down others while holding
himself high, while at the same time he stoops down to the level he's
complaining about by calling this "The National Midnight Slander!" How can one
respect anything he says when he has different standards for himself and
others? Bman, get real. An apology to all those you degraded is in order! You
need to live by your own standards. We're all Rush fans here, so there's no
need to fight among ourselves.

That's been building up for a while and the Bman's post set it off. Enough of
that, let's have some fun. I think I put on some Rush (it always makes my
day!).

Regard the B-man's latest diatribe and  others...

I am always puzzled when someone comes on and says stuff like "everyone on this 
list is always bitching about the band, or saying this album sucked...blah blah 
blah."  I just don't see it.  The posts in this forum are overwhelmingly 
positive. 

Even a post like "I think TFE is their worst effort to date!" means that the 
person listened to it (probably numerous times) and is familiar with all their 
other work.  And a post like "Alex's playing has really gone downhill" just 
means that that person liked the guitar in the older albums.

Let's face it, folks.  Most people in this world really aren't that into music 
in general.  Most that are really don't have a favorite group.   Those that do 
really aren't so fanatical that they'd belong to an internet newsgroup to read 
50Kb worth of stuff about the band every day.  So it's safe to say that even if 
you perceive somebody to say something negative about Rush in TNMS, they are 
still one of their most fanatical fans.

I got no time for living, yeah, I'm working all the time
It seems to me I could live my life a lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me, they call me the Working Man.

To Douglas Maher:

About your opinions about the Counterparts and Test For Echo Tours, yes,
there has been a sharp decline in the number of people in attendance
during those tours.  I was fortunate enough to see them on both legs of
the T4E tour when they were in Milwaukee---on the first leg, they were
playing the Bradley Center, and they barely filled the venue, but there
was a surprising change on the second leg of the tour.....they played the
Marcus Ampitheatre and damn near sold out the the place!!  And I was happy
to find some Gen-X teenagers, who NEVER saw a Rush show sitting behind me
ranting and raving after the show.  So don't give up Doug, there are still
a few new fans that Rush picks up after every show.

Take care, Robert Walcheske

Okay, so I'm only 18, but I *am* old enough to remember the classics,
like Pac-Man, TRON (anyone else remember that?)...just the basics. 
(Okay...so about a step up from the basics.  Frogger (the original, not
this new 3D crap they keep crankin' out...), Ms. Pac-Man (anyone remember
the Pac-Man Saturday morning cartoon?), Pole Position...all that stuff.) 
Sure, I'm up for Duke Nukem 3D or MechWarrior2 or War Craft or stuff like
that, but it's hard for me to find somethin' better than a good ol' game
of Pole Position (that was always my favorite...might have had somethin'
to do with the cartoon...  ;) ).  And *not* the PC versions of these
games, either.  It's just not the same (although it's considerably
cheaper for those of us who were never very good at the games...  ;) )
