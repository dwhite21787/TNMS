Some of you may have gotten two copies of yesterday's digest.  This
isn't the bug reappearing, rather a consequence of Syrinx crashing
yesterday, about noon.  Apparently when this happens, the mail queue
is re-started from the beginning.  Thanks for the vigilence to those
of you who sent mail.

There was also a crash late last week, so the same thing may have 
happened then (forget exact date).  I didn't think to mention it as
I didn't receive a dup. then on my "check address".

We are still trying to get the software upgrade for Syrinx; more news
as it develops.

I mentioned in a previous post that sometimes when member of a band is about
to leave and go solo, the radion stations start announcing the band as
that person AND the band...Phil Collins and Genesis, Burton Cummings and
the Guess Who, etc...

Anyway, I have heard radio stations announcing Geddy Lee AND Rush, and I
have also heard some rumors about Geddy appearing with some other musicians
on a different album.  I don't think Geddy will leave Rush (Phil didn't
*leave* Genesis, he just started solo too), but I wonder if this is a plot
to get people to listen to the new album when it comes out because they
recognize Geddy's name now.  Comments>

Dear Rush fans,
        Perhaps this is a stupid question, but can anyone tell who is
whispering the lyrics to "Twilight Zone" on 2112 along with Geddy's vocal?
I checked bulletin #154 with the answers to frequently asked questions and
this topic wasn't discussed...

Response so far to my album poll request has been great!  Thanks to all who
cast their votes!  Since I haven't received 600+ responses, I know some of
you haven't mailed in your entries yet.  You CAN make a difference!  Help
turn other Rush fans onto some good tunes.  Once again, the rules:

Please send me a list of what you consider the 10 best albums of all time.
In order to avoid having Rush flood the results, only enter ONE album PER
GROUP.  Please list the albums including the artists from 1 to 10.  I'll
tabulate the results and post them to TNMS.  Don't post your list directly
to the list!  Send them via email to me at 

    dougg@hpptc16.hp.com.  (or,UUCP: hplabs!hpptc16!dougg).

hi, all. what's up? just a few insights(i think) on some of the Boyz songs.
is that a heartbeat that i hear at the end of Cygnus X-I Book I? anything
parallel in Hemispheres? has anyone noticed that the same chord that is at
the end of The Sphere is also the same chord that starts The Necromancer?
Just coincidence? hmmmmmmmmmmm.... I also have another question. does anyone
have a list of what groups(other than Mr. Big) has opened for Rush? if so,
could you e-mail me (jac142@psuvm.psu.edu) the list. tanx.... 8)

[ I can think of Saxon (79), FM (81), MSG (86), & Mr Big (90),  :rush-mgr ]

ho...

to the reader who got the Rush Chronicles Video, mine was in great
condition when i bought it and there were no garbled parts. so my
assumption is that your tape may be defective....what was your
favorite video anyway? I liked it overall but i wish they had some
songs from PW and the Body Electric from Prace under Gressure.

anyhow...later and may the force be with y'all

> Gimme a big break.

Yeah I heard that one, too.  Rush (the drug) is basically fungus
remover, originally used for cleaning things like high-school lockers.
I could be guessing, but I'm pretty sure it post-dates the band's
inception, and was no more named for the band than the band was for it.
I believe the name comes from the "rush" you would probably get inhaling
the fumes.  (BTW, for those impressionable kids out there:  I gathered
this information from heresay and rumor in the San Francisco area (where
it was popular among certain groups of which I am not part), not personal
experience.  It may, therefore, be slightly inaccurate)

Hoping to have dispelled that one, does anybody really know for sure 
where the name comes from?  "Raised Under Satan's Hand" and the like
strikes me as unlikely, but not entirely impossible given the slant 
of the band's first album (leather studs, dog collars, etc).  I remember
Geddy mentioning that the origins of the name "had been lost long ago"
(or at least he didn't want to talk about it during the interview), but
that it is supposed to embody the energy of the band's style. 
Sounds like the "Party line" to me... is there something they're hiding?

        there *is* a blank spot in the first few
seconds of "New World Man".  When I first heard it, I was
worried about defective tapes, too. :)  If it's a defect, it
must be on all, or at least quite a few, of the tapes.

In regards to Scott Slater's question (in TNMS #161)about the origins
of Rush's name, I think the rumour relating it to a drug/drugs may not
be too far off.

\begin{speculation}

The original members of Rush started out in high school, playing 
gyms, basement parties, wherever they could.  Judging from the
photos on the first album, they weren't exactly clean-cut young
conservative Canadians.

The term "rush" is often associated with drugs, to describe the 
feeling when the drug 'kicks in', or 'transports' you to a new
'plateau'.  It's been described as a sort of "whoosh of euphoria".
Incidentally, a rush can be gotten through other channels; it's what
a person feels when they skydive, or bungy jump, or any number of
other exciting pasttimes.

I hypothesize that this is the feeling that 1) they got when playing
their music, or 2) they wanted their fans to feel when listening.  Hence
they made it their name.

\end{speculation}

P.S.  I don't think there's any direct relationship to the substance
      Butyl Nitrate, marketed under the brand name of "Rush".  This 
      was popular briefly in the mid-late 70's, and apparently found
      a resurgence in the gay community during the 80's.  Nasty stuff.

P.P.S.  Of course, any references to drugs or the 70's/80's drug culture
        is purely heresay.  :-)
