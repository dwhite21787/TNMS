Do any of you wonder if this bus driver was rude on purpose?  I mean, it
seems that the members of Rush usually go out of their way to be polite
to their fans.  In order not to ruin that image, you need to have a bad
guy (or fall guy) when you want to be abrupt.

Or, he could just be a jerk...

Hey! Any new Rush album (old material or not) is good news to me; I'd just like
to hear if there's any *official* story on this album Chronicles II. Has anyone
read about it? I've heard some net.rumors but have grown to distrust them. :)

If it's going to be just a bunch of old studio versions mashed together, I won't
buy it. I only picked up Chronicles right after I bought my Discman so I could
have some Rush to listen to while I saved my pennies to get the other 17 albums
-- which I happily achieved two weeks ago! -- on CD. I *never* listen to it
anymore except for "WYD" and "aPtB" which were left off their respective live
albums.

So if it's previously released material, cool. If not, then I propose a 
worldwide net.boycott to teach Mercury a lesson!

<A NAME="504303">From: James.B.McKeon@Dartmouth.EDU</A>
<A NAME="504003">Subject: Bootlegs</A>

This is in response to Jeremy Weissenburger's defense of his 'right' to make
bootlegs and distribute them freely.

I find it sad and disturbing that an alleged fan of such accomplished artists
would self-righteously defend his ability to steal their material.
Fundamentally, Rush are producers.  They do not create goods meant to satisfy
man's physical needs, but his intellectual ones.  They provide the
integration of whole chains of concepts and present them as a perceptual
concrete, a piece of music, for you to experience.  In this process they do
for you an immense intellectual favor - they allow you to grasp that entire
chain of concepts and their consequent emotions directly, providing you an
integration of those ideas you would lack without their work.  It is in this
manner that they provide you with what is an intellectual product.

In return for the considerable effort required by them to create this
product, they demand certain conditions.  Of course, they require
renumeration in the price of the CD.  And in addition, as a condition of
sale, they prohibit your reproduction and distribution of that product
without their permission.  In turn, if you attend one of their concerts, they
prohibit the reproduction of that concert.

As the sole creators of this product, they have the right to set any
considerations they choose as a precondition of trading it in public.  As in
the realm of most physical goods, the terms of a sale are mutually agreed
upon by both parties.  If you purchase one of their CD's or attend one of
their concerts, you are agreeing to their terms of that transaction
implicitly.

If you claim that you don't agree to their terms but make the transaction
anyway and violate those terms, you have engaged in fraud.  Fraud is version
of theft and is, as it should be, punishable under the law.

For these reasons, anyone attending a Rush concert who tapes it is engaging
in theft, regardless of their intentions and future plans for what they have
stolen.  No amount of rationalizations change the nature of the crime.  The
person who illegally tapes a CD or a concert is committing, both morally and
legally, the same crime as a shoplifter or a car thief, and deserves the same
scorn and punishment.

If you think that by distributing bootlegs 'for free' you have somehow
escaped any moral or legal consequences of your original theft, reconsider.
I offer you this analogy - if someone steals a Cadillac, and then offers free
rides to his neighbors whenever they wish, is he then free of all guilt and
responsibility?

I urge anyone trading or making bootlegs against the wishes of the artist to
discontinue so doing.  If you are witness to such behavior, you are obliged
to at least reprimand them verbally.  Your respect for the artist demands it.

Bootlegs seem like something all the fans should just get together and
trade, kinda like baseball cards.. but this business of pricing them is
ridiculous! Sorry, I have enough of a hard time scrounging the $12 or so
for a GOOD quality CD on my student budget, why would I pay these LOSERS
(read: leeches) $28-$40 for quality that sucks????

I didnt know Metallica allowed tape recorders!! Damn, how did that slip
by me??? heheh.. oh well.. should have taped them at RFK.. :(

I have never ventured to find Ged/Neil/Alex after a show, say backstage
or at their hotel.. how does one figure out where they are going to leave
such a large complex as an arena or civic centre? There are usually alot
of exits! And how do you ever figure out which hotel they're staying at??

BTW: If anyone wants a tape copy of Ged's latest rockline interview, drop
me a line.

Slator all..

	Arguing over the bootleg issue is much like arguing over abortion.
Both sides are convinced that they're right and no amount of debate will
change the minds of either.  Freedom of choice allows both sides to be
happy.
	Moral: If you are an anti-boot person, then don't make, distribute,
	       copy, trade, or buy bootleg material.

	As a side note, is anyone still maintaining the ABL (available
boots list)?  I have some stuff I'd like to make available for trades only.

	Although my story pales in comparison to jimmy's and
others, I figured the NMS is not too cluttered, so what the
hey?

  [ No one's story is pale in comparison to anyone else's. A story is just 
    a story, so send them in; it's not a competition.  I want as many 
    stories, good or bad, as you want to share!			: rush-mgr ]

	I say them June 27th at Alpine Valley, the second last
show of the tour.  (I begged and pleaded and tried to bribe my
wife into going to the last show, the 28th, but she could not
get off work :( )  My normal "company" when seeing the boyz
were all their, but I had along two classmates, who were
RUSH virgins.  Mitch has been a fan since he smoked weed
at lunch listening to 2112 in 1977, while Brian likes the boyz,
but really had no interest in them before meeting me.  Now both
Brian and Mitch had been to their share of concerts before, but
never RUSH.  The looks on their faces after the opening medley
said it all.  They were both standing there, jaws open, in awe.
(I remember that feeling from my first Rush show, PoW).  They
both really go into it, and were rockin as hard as I was for
the entire show.  After the show, waiting for the parking to
clear, they just could not shut up about it.  It was an just
an incredible feeling to see the RUSH "Magic" spread like that.
I don't mean to get to sentimental or anything, but times
like those really make a concert memorable.

	On a different note, the concert did not start off
particularily well.  When we got to the lot, we proceeded
with the typical Brats on the Grill, and Homebrew in the
cooler (as Mitch and I both Brew).  Soon, the Alpine
Security dudes came cruising by, informing us that the new
policy stated NO alcohol in the parking lots, whatsoever.
Now this was news to me at a Rock concert!  Not entirely
pleased, we were forced to make sure we finished the
cooler completely, but quite inconspicuously.  (Mind you
we were not drunk, as I hate drunk fans as much as Jimmy,
and also would not want to see the guys while under the
influence, as I get high enough on their music ;)  Well,
I guess cops will be cops.  We saw 25 tickets handed out
while waiting for the show to begin, at 96 bones apiece.
I guess those two cops met their quota!!  Well, as a
homebrewer I feel compelled to spread the word about
this Neo-Prohibitionist movement which is getting all
too powerful.  But enough non-RUSH babbling.  Sorry.

Hi guys!

I've just got a few questions to ask if I may!

1.  Who is the guy on the front and reverse sides of Power Windows?

2.  On my copy of the video The Big Money (Chronicles) about half way through
    he seems to be in suspended animation!!!  I've actually seen the normal
    vid of it, and this doesn't happen!  Could this be a fault?  Has anyone
    got the same problem??

3.  Is it true that the actor playing Unit 1 in The Body Electric video,
    actually played the role of Tarzan in a film from a few years ago???

Any help on these question swould be appreciated!!!

By the way, everyone who mailed me about, taping Rush one,two and the fly
I will try my best to sort you all out, but as you'll probably gather
I had a massive response, and have about 25+ people to tape them for!
*begins to dread asking everyone now*

Anyway that's a wrap!

Thanks to everyone who has responded to the msg I mistakenly signed a "blonde...
ME" -- Please, fellas, this was not meant to be an "SWF seeking..." type ad.
Simply wanted to personalize the whole e-mail experience.  I'll be
answering the replies that mentioned interview transcripts and bootlegs...
More are certainly welcome.

My mailbox is now flooded, but soon should accept incoming again.

Can anyone find me a copy of "The Fly?"  Berkeley music stores are stocked
with rare Grateful Dead presses and indies, but I have yet to see any
by the Trio from Toronto.

Incidentally, are there any WOMEN on NMS?  Every female but me at the concerts
always seems to be someone's (black halter-top wearing) girlfriend.

I have fairly good pictures from the RTB tour (20th row, zoom lens).  
Interested???

Sorry, fellow Rush fans - when was the ball red in "The Prisoner"? It
was white.

Sorry, my mistake.  It appears that the ball in the Prisoner is white.
I based my previous posting on my failing memory (and perhaps a bit of
wishful thinking).

On another note, I saw a special on Much Music a while back on the
Barenaked Ladies.  On the show they did a comedy sketch where one of the
guys made a solo album singing clasic tunes.  One of the tunes listed was
Xanadu.
It appears the Barenaked Ladies are Rush fans.

Boy, after that long dry spell, it's nice to have the NMS back! About a
dozen issues snuck up on me, and I almost got tired of reading them ...
but then I recovered my sanity & dove back in. :-)

It seems to be good timing again! If I was a Police fan, I'd call it
synchronicity - I read the post about "Where's Neil?", and on the way
home, WGRX played "Limelight". Two lines hit me from that song:
"one must put up barriers to keep oneself intact"  and
"I can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend".
So, is Neil taking his own advice? Are his barriers to keep his ego
from over-inflating from being called "God of Drums"? Is it hard for
him to put up with fans who assume familiarity?

I think I'd be disappointed if I said "Hi" to G/A/N and they blew me off,
although there's no way they'd know me from Adam. (Adam Ant or Adam Clayton)
It'd be interesting to see how many of y'all have seen in hotel/spoken to/
shook hands with/are friends of Ged, Alex & Neil. And how many of those
times the person had to chase (or lead :) the bus to do it.

oh well, just another $0.02.   Glad y'all are back!  dwhite

[ This help file and the the Dragon services are being finished as
  you read/use them.  When all seems to be in place, this paragraph
  will be gone.  For those of you that used to request files by
  using the subject line, that no longer works.  Read on for the
  new procedure.   Dated 25-AUG-92 ]

=== HELP ==========================================================

Dragon has a number of features that are available to most people.
Mail based archive server, anonymous ftp, email list subscriptions,
and such.  Some features are reserved for Intergraph people only
due to the nature of the beast.

To subsribe to an email digest or list, read the following text
concerning the /SUBSCRIBE command.  A list of lists is in the
appendix at the end of this help file.

If you wish to make files available or create an email digest,
please contact fordke@ingr.com or send a message via the server per
the instructions provided below.

For those with access, you can use anonymous ftp to fetch files
from the server.  Simply FTP to dragon and log in as "anonymous" or
"ftp".  No password is necessary.  The /pub directory is where the
archives are stored.

The archive server will allow you to retrieve items via electronic
mail, subscribe to email lists, and more.  It has limited error
detection, so study this help file before sending a request.  The
server processes requests only once per day.  This is generally
during the very early morning hours in the US.

To make the archive server do something you should send an
electronic mail message to server@ingr.com.  The body of the
message should consist of one command per line.  The case of the
text does not matter.  /SEND INDEX == /sEnD iNdEx

Command keywords always have a forward slash '/' character for a
prefix.  Lines without this prefix are ignored.  Commands are
interpreted and put into action as they are encountered when
parsing the message from top to bottom.

We currently have the local Rush/SOL/APP archives from node bisbee,
a partial mirror of the SIMTEL archive, and a mirror of the Rush
archives at syrinx.

=== COMMANDS ======================================================

/HELP
-----

   Sends you this text explaining the server commands.

/ADDRESS <address>
------------------

   This becomes the active address for your request.  It overrides
   any previous address specifiers.  This must be a valid domain
   style address by which you can be reached.  If you have any
   doubts about your mail address, you should ask your system
   administrator for a correct domain style address.  Use this
<A NAME="504313">   command if you are not sure that the 'From:' and 'Reply-To:'</A>
   addresses generated by your mail system are reliable.  [/PATH]

/SUBSCRIBE <list>
-----------------

   Subscribe the active address to an email list.  A list of
   currently available lists is presented at the end of this help.
   Some of the lists are restricted.  [/SUB]

/UNSUBSCRIBE <list>
-------------------

   Unsubscribe the active address from an email list.  A list of
   currently available lists is presented at the end of this help.
   Some of the lists are restricted.  [/UNSUB]

/WHO <list>
-----------

   Show addresses of subscribers to an email list.  A list of
   currently available lists is presented at the end of this help.
   Some of the lists are restricted.  [/LIST]

/LIMIT <bytes>
--------------

   Specify the maximum number of bytes which may be sent in a
   single mail message.  Transfers exceeding this amount will be
   split into several messages before sending.  A value of 0 means
   that there is no limit.  The archive server has a default size
   limit of 100000 bytes.  You may change this if you know that you
   have different limits.  Most (but not all) uucp sites have a
   limit of 100000 bytes.  CompuServe accounts have a 60000 byte
   limit on mail.  Internet and Bitnet sites should set this to
   300000 bytes.  [/SIZE]

/QUIT
-----

   The remainder of the message is ignored.  This can be useful if
   a long signature is appended to the message.  [/END,/EXIT]

/SEND <item>
------------

   The specified <item> is looked up in the file list.  If found,
   it will be sent to you by email.  Binary (8-bit) items are
   uuencoded before sending.  The /PACK and other commands affect
   this command.  You must specify the item as directory/filename.

   NOTE: use forward slashes '/' only

/RESEND <item> <part> [<part>...]
--------------------------------

   Resend the indicated <part>s of this <item>.  This is useful if
   not all parts of a multi-part transmission arrived correctly.
   When resending, the /PACK and /LIMIT used must be identical to
   those of the original transmission.  This information should be
   on the 'BEGIN' line of one of the received parts.

   NOTE: use forward slashes '/' only

/UUSEND <item>
--------------

   This command is identical to the command /SEND except that the
   <item> is guaranteed to be uuencoded.  This is useful if you
   know that the return message will go through EBCDIC based
   computers.

   NOTE: use forward slashes '/' only

/UURESEND <item> <part> [<part>...]
-----------------------------------

   This command is identical to the command /RESEND except that the
   <item> is guaranteed to be uuencoded.  This is useful if you
   know that the return message will go through EBCDIC based
   computers.

   NOTE: use forward slashes '/' only

/PACK <type>
------------

   Change items compression to this <type> which will affect all
   SENDs and RESENDs (and UU versions) from this point on until
   another PACK line is encountered.  Choices are NONE, Z, COMPRESS,
   and ZIP.  [/ARCHIVER]

/INDEX
------

   Sends a list of the items with sizes, dates, and descriptions.
   This list is sorted by directory and then by filename.  It has
   the same effect as the command /SEND INDEX.   [/FILES]

/MESSAGE
--------

   Send a message to the administrator of the server.  The
   remainder of the message will be sent, without parsing for
   additional commands.  [/NOTE]

I think a few shows later the bus driver in question was replaced.
I was told he became sick or something like that, he wasn't driving the
later dates.  (Maybe that was why he was so cranky, who knows..)  But
I'm glad to know I wasn't imagining when I thought he was rude to just
me.  The driver they had for the Presto tour was a very nice gentleman
(Randy) he gave me full directions with freeway numbers and all.  They
must have changed bus drivers.

PS. Great names for the buses too.
