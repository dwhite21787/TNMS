Hi there,

Just wanted to to give my opinion of Rush's new cd, i think it is soooo
awesome!!  It has a powerful sound, and Geddy did a great job of producing
it.  Natural Science and 2112 really blows me away, everytime i listen to
them, i get goose bumps.  I just hope Neil is holding out all right.

I also purchased King's X new one "Tape Head", and i must say that is one of
the best cd's i have purchased in several years......highly recommend to get
it!!

"You have nothing to fear, but fear itself"....Winston Churchill or Neil
Peart?..lol

<<You've got a single 90-minute cassette to fill, and you want to make
sure that the band's diversity is represented, yet every track should be
definitive Rush. That is to say, you don't want to omit significant
tracks just to make sure that each album is represented. Can you do it?>>

Given that every Rush-fan has their own ideas for what tracks are
significant, my playlist looks a little something like this:

Before And After
Anthem
Bastille Day
Working Man/Finding My Way (from ATWAS)
Nobody's Hero
Circumstances
Witch Hunt
Limelight
Subdivisions
Cinderella Man (from DS)
The Body Electric
Tom Sawyer
Resist
Analog Kid
Distant Early Warning
Yyz (from ESL)

Obviously, I could've included the epics like 2112, the Cygnus stories,
By-Tor and such, but I'd prefer to save that stuff for second tape to be
made later.  To start with, though, I think I'd go with easily-digestable
chunks of Rush.

Just my two cents, though.

Allo all... it's been a while since I posted, but I've been saving up stuff
(not much really) to say to y'all...

First of all, I wanted to throw a couple names out that haven't been really
mentioned in the
'Who is the best guitar person alive today, ever, by and for the Rush fans'
debate going on.

First of all, I'd like to present to you, for your listening pleasure,
Buckethead!  Check out Praxis: Metatron... this guy is insane. 

Secondly, i'd like to mention a band who's been mentioned here before, Ozric
Tentacles!
The guitar player (Um, name slips me right now, even though I have all their
albums! ack)
is extremely talented and versatile. I don't believe we hear more about him
here in the states
(or people being aware of him) because he's with some obscure UK act...
well, lemme tell ya
this guy completely impresses me. Listen to Live: Ethereal Cereal too, first
track... hauntingly
similar to Xanadu, which is weird, but neat at the same time. His playing is
way fast, and clever
and effective.

And now, for the moment you've all been waiting for, my Rush sighting. It
happened last night.
I was playing some Punch*Out! at my pals arcade last night, and I had just
defeated Piston Hurricane.
My bonus time for knocking his ass out was 21120. It made me look around to
see if anyone else 
had seen it. I think I need therapy.

	This may or may not be a direct Rush reference.  I say this becuase I
know of at least one music store by the name _2112 Percussion_.  Maybe
they're thanking the store, I dunno.

On another note, is anybody else out there working on a transcript of
last week's Rockline?  I started, but I find it incredibly tedious. 
Perhaps we could split it up and combine our efforts.

<A NAME="2170010">Subject: Collins v. Peart</A>

I've read the many opinions on the subject of Collins v. Peart -- I,
too, must now come up and put in my $0.02 in: Collins, yes, is very
talented in his use of the sticks, but I am profoundly dumbfounded by
those that state that Collins is in the same league as Peart! Collins
may be very fluid, but he is also very simplistic in his approach. An
attempt, I feel, to dumb down his music for his "mainstream" audience
who couldn't ID talent if it broke ground and built a home right next
to their own! Collins' look makes absolutely no difference -- he may
LOOK like he's making it easy, but as every drummer has his own style,
so does Neil. Neil's approach to perfectionism should not be held
against him -- I, quite frankly, consider him (Peart) to be the
absolute Michael Jordan of Percussion. Nowhere else can you be a
witness, or for that matter -- be a listener, to what is a phenomena 
happening before our eyes. I cherish the fact that RUSH is still
around creating new and inventive music never letting the grass grow
around their feet! Neil is the pinnacle of the best! Collins is
talented but nowhere near the top 10 percentile of drummers. Be glad
that you have him (Peart) as the standard by which all others are
compared to.

<A NAME="2170011">Subject: Probably not the last word on Collins vs. Peart</A>

Hello all. Here's an aside relating to the Collins vs. Peart debate which
may or may not relate. For those who are aware of him, how does Chester
Thompson (sp?) fit into the mix? I had the good fortune of attending one of
his clinics in Columbus, Ohio years ago and was blown away watching him up
close. He's more of a session guy with a strong jazz background, having
been Collins' back up drummer probably from the start of his solo career.
He truly has more of a "flowing" feel to his drumming than Collins, and is
IMHO, much better technically than Collins, but not Peart. Chester is not
the household name of course that Collins is but would give any modern rock
drummer a run for their money. Again, from what I can glisten from his
playing, he's more on par with Neil than Collins is. Any opinions?

I almost fell out of my chair when I read comparisons attempted between Phil
Collins and Neal Peart.  Next thing you know, someone will be saying that
Nikki Sixx is actually a better bassist than Geddy Lee.  

Oh, and I don't like John Petrucci.  He's too good.  I mean, his fingers are
so fast and dexterous, and he plays with such good emotion and
creativity...and that's bad.  He should suck more, and then I could say that
I like him as a guitarist...

I remember, over the years, threads dealing with what, if anything, Rush owes 
it's fans.  Simply put, I think Neil's 'seriousness' behind the set is 
nothing less than Neil giving us what we pay for when we go to the shows.

Hi fellow Rushians,
	I need to ask some questions. What's the deal with Archives? I put it
in my discography section on my web page because it's an official
(legal) release. But, I've never seen it on cd. I've only seen it on
vinyl. Since no internet cd store carries it, I marked it on my web site
as "discontinued -- no longer available." Does anybody know if it is
available on cd or can anybody give me some facts?

I do agree that Neil is a finer percussianist than Phil, however, I
believe this is due to the fact that Phil has spent considerable time
broadening the range of instruments he plays (Piano/keyboards) instead
of concentrating only on percussion.  Perhaps if he had only focused
on persussion, his chops would be right up there with Neil.

<A NAME="2170017">Subject: Fastest guitarest: whoa, you guys just don't get it!</A>

Okay, first, I'm NOT flaming any of you gents, okay? Truely, I'm not.
The point of this message is to clarify the fastest guitarest lick,
especially as you jazz lovers and the like have started contributing and
twisting it WAAAAY off its original mark . . .

There is NO question as to TASTE guys, we weren't making a point as to
who is the fastest WITH different voicings, sounds, scales, emotion,
etc, NOT! MY whole entire point was simply (and it really is simple) WHO
'physically' do you think can play cleanly the most notes in a beat,
PERIOD. Not how 'tastly' they do it, or how cool their ability is to
'hold back', blah blah blah, its NOT a point of STYLE, its a point of
speed, nothing more, nothing less. yes, absolutely, Yngwie Malmsteen is
a concieted horses ass that plays WAAY too fast to frequently without
taste or emotion, etc; but who (and this really only can be
realistically answered by guitar players and maybe drummers), of all the
artists you've ever heard, whether you like them or their music, who can
consistently play the most notes in a measure?

I'd like to hear some of that Paul Gilbert guy, and I haven't heard them
all, but as a guitar player of 20 years, the fastest I've ever ever
heard, style aside, has been Malmsteen and Buttencort (sp). No,
Malmsteen does NOT play as 'nicely' or 'pleasure to listen to' as the
guy from DT and others, once again, thats not the point, I'm looking for
more of a 'wow, no one on earth has EVER played that fast before, and
may never again' like the Guiness Book of World Records. (And yes, this
again will vary by individual). As a guitar player, I can't agree
Petrucci plays faster, uh uh, nor Di Meola, no way, they may play
BETTER, but not note for note faster.

So come on, lets stay away from the taste issues that are polluting the
original intention of this thread, were looking entirely at clean #'s
here, and nothing more....

Respectfully submitted,

Grundman

     A big thank you to Chris Samaritoni (chris@meantime.com) for
     designing this site and allowing me to take it over.

     Neil Peart of Rush for sparking and fueling my interest in
drumming.

     Special thanks to:
     Interscope, Warner Bros., Sony, Columbia, Epitaph, Altantic,
     RollingStone, Spin, Rip, Guitar World, Guitar, Guitar Player,
     Modern Drummer, Drum!, Seconds, Alternative Press, and ...

etc.

If you go to www.helmet.org you'll get the same page.  Maybe Eric is a fan
of both and wants to bring some of us kicking and screaming to another
type of music!?

Maybe Neil peart is actually John Stanier.

Or, maybe, its a shared love of Rush:

"Stanier's staccato drumming is a Helmet mainstay. His style is the result
of his combined love of punk, hip hop, and Neil Peart."
Modern Drummer: October, 1994

Aaah Music - one big happy family.

<A NAME="2170020">Subject: Yeah, I thought the Rockline interview SUCKED!</A>

this is to Tracy.

yeah, Rush mngr is right, I agree Sunday's interview was for me, the
very worst interview I've ever heard since I've became a Rush fan
waaaaay back before they were popular in the mid 70's. Geddy literally
sounded 'apprehensive' about answering questions, and sounded 'out of
it', like he had just eaten a whole bunch of antihistamines or
something. Bob Coburn, bless his heart, played EVERY CLICHE Rush song
that exists (do I even have to spell it out? What else, but Spirit of
Radio, Closer to the Heart, Tom Sawyer, etc) instead of taking the
excellent, rare opportunity to perhaps turn Joe Public on to other Rush
songs by playing ANYTHING different than the above.

The callers were a fairly pathetic bunch, very "hey doodz! uh, . . . .
duh ummmm" and there were only a few really interesting questions, that
were again weakly answered by our boys. They DID treat Neil's tragedys
really nicely, but I can't STAND the way Geddy answered the question
about what he thought of other current progessive bands like Dream
Theater, to ME (my opinion anyways) it was like he was almost offended
the girl asked and was totally afraid of voicing his opinion on the
subject, kept repeating 'oh, I don't want to pass judgement on other
bands'. Who knows, maybe Geddy is really sad about Neil's tragedy too,
or the whole band thing, or had diarhia from a virus or something, what
the hell do I know? :)

Alex was his usual jovial, joking self, and breathed a little life into
the whole interview, although I was both surprised and disappointed that
no callers nor himself mentioned the upcoming Victor album (you shoulda
plugged it Alex!!!).

So this is MY opinion of the interview, others may disagree, but I
really don't see how any long time Rush fan could disagree that sunday's
Rockline was a pretty poor, unenlightening and rather sad interview of
Rush. My biggest beef is that it was a REALLY bad first introduction if
any new listeners checked in to see what 'Rush' was all about, they
probably would have bailed right early!

Actually, Adam, the woman who called wanted to know what Gangster of Boats
was, not what the "part IV of a trilogy" meant.  Whether or not she knew it
was a joke, she didn't bring it up--the announcer and Alex started talking
about the joke aspect.  I know it's a joke and I figured it was a joke on
9/3/91, but I still want to know what Gangster of Boats is, because it
appears in the HYF credits too (without the "part IV of a trilogy" joke) I
believe.  And I wasn't too satisfied with Alex's & Ged's answers because
they didn't really elaborate.
<<<<

Ok, here is where Gangster of Boats came from.  My source for this is my memory,
which I never quote from unless I'm sure.:)  I heard it or read it in an 
interview...

We all know the Geddy and Alex can get pretty silly (I don't mean goofy, or 
funny, i mean downright giggly silly) at times, especially during recording or 
writing sessions waiting for Neil to do whatever it is he's doing.  I bring this
up because 'Gangster of Boats' is an incredibly silly phrase that makes no sense
whatsoever and is an affront to anyone who is trying to do something literate.  
I don't know where or how they actually came up with Gangster of Boats while 
working on Presto, but they did and it stuck as a silly Ged and Alex phrase.  
Apparently, Neil was having a difficult time in naming what would become the 
Presto CD.  Geddy and Alex would threaten to name it 'Gangster of Boats' to 
*inspire* Neil to quit dawdling come up with an album title.

It happened this past weekend when I took my family to Disney World in 
Orlando.  We went to a restaraunt called "RaceRock" after a long day at 
Magic Kindom.

The music was a variety of various rock songs played very loud.  This 
place had an awesome sound system.  I was trying to talk with the family 
and wasn't listening to the music.  All of the sudden "Freewill" started 
pumping through the entire place.  This is one of my favorite Rush 
songs.  I couldn't believe it.  All the sudden, I started jamming to it 
at the table, playing my air bass.  My kids were trying to talk to me 
and my wife said, "Kids leave daddy alone, he's in a Rush moment."  I 
made everyone stop talking, kids included, to listen to Geddy's bass 
intro/solo before the lead jam.

What a moment.  It made my evening!

Uhh....I think I get what you're trying to say (That Neil rules!), 
but I think you've chosen a bad example to use.

Neil doesn't do toothpaste, sneaker, razor, car, 
inflatable woman, slomin shield, whatever,etc. etc. 
commercials, not to mention bad cartoon/live action movies.
It's because of jackasses like him that athletic shoes are 
150 bucks a pop.

Neil has a bit more integrity than that.

Good evening all.

Bravado wrote that he hoped he didn't offend any Garth Brooks fans. I
got a good chuckle out of that. Wouldn't worry about that too much in
this arena.

Regarding Phil Collins--anyone who has listen to earlier Genesis cannot
deny his skills. Yes, he is a very good drummer (I'm sure he has said so
many times himself). Is he better than Neil? A subjective question that
I cannot answer--which kills me, because Phil Collins really gets on my
nerves. The gradual destruction of Genesis' integrity combined with the
Michelob commercials and Phil's boundless ego really makes me want to
say he can eat Neil's shorts. Unfortunately I can't do that. But the one
place I KNOW Neil has him beat is in imaginative fills.

Hello Rush freaks!

I have not posted in months but I have kept up with all the posts. 
I would appreciate comments on the following issues. Please e-mail me
with possible answers or comments.

1) Did I hear correctly? Dream Theater lost a keyboardist again? I also
thought I saw somewhere that DT changed their name or something. What is
going on in the DT world? 

Also, what size of venues does DT play in while on tour? And, what in
the hell does James LaBrie do on stage during the long instrumental
parts of songs where there is no singing?

2) I have to agree with Antony's post in #2168 on Petrucci. Petrucci's
solo in "Lines of the Sand" is absolutely incredible. LaBrie's vocals
that follow the solo are a perfect compliment. I also love how Petrucci
played guitar at the beginning and middle of "Hollow Years" on the live
CD. Petrucci really knows how to add feeling and depth to his playing. 
DT's "Once in a Live Time," IMO, is definitely a worthwhile live CD to
purchase.

3) When is the DS video due out? Rush-mgr, have you heard anything?
Geddy had stated in the fall that they were working on one.

4) The GrandDesigns website says that "Rush will be returning to the
studios in March to work on a T4E follow-up to be released on 12/31/99."
What is the source of the information and is it accurate? I believe we
will see another studio album from Rush and a small tour yet, it's just
a matter of when.

5) "Analog Kid" on DS was recorded at the Palace of Auburn Hills. This
was the same show that the highly acclaimed "Critical Mass" bootleg,
from Prism, originated from. Has anyone else noticed that the "Analog
Kid" on DS sounds nothing like the one on "Critical Mass"?  For one
thing, Geddy comes in a little late with the vocals on the Critical Mass
version. What's the deal?

I know that's a lot of questions, but I'd sure appreciate any feedback!

<A NAME="2170038">Subject: Re: Red Barchetta on UK T.V.</A>

Just to clear up what's been going on with the barchetta's on the T.V. here.
I've always promised myself one since FIAT started making them in 1995. I
finally managed to dump the company car last year and immediately set about
looking for a red one. (no other colour would do...) They are pretty rare in
the uk, but popular in Germany, so I had one imported here. It's been the
best car I've ever had, and with a proper stereo, amp, and big speakers
there's frankly nothing to compare to blasting down some country lane on a
sunday morning (early of course, before all the crap cars go to church) with
the obvious on the cd player. 

Being a FIAT it's got 'intelligent electrical components', but the engine is
fine except for a sticking varaiable timing component. They invariably get
stuck, and turn the car into a rough diesel at tick-over. Watchdog were very
good at badgering FIAT u.k. and had them agree to fix the problem finally (I
bet...) for free, saving the members of our owners club, and those we
haven't yet linked up with 400GBP each time. 

I'll never sell it, and I strongly doubt my nephew will be getting to drive
it in 15 years time. 

If anyone wants to know more, take a look at http://www.fiatbarchetta.com,
which hosts the main website for all the clubs in Europe.  

Sorry, for those in North America, you can't get one... You'll have to stick
to mx-5's -- they'll probably never go wrong, but they'll never be a
barchetta. Still they look nice from the front, which is the angle most
often seen, in my rearview mirror   :)

<A NAME="2170039">Subject: phrasingtiming/tone/John Petrucci</A>

First, JOHN PETRUCCI
IMO Petrucci cannot be labelled the best guitarist alive. If you're a DT
fan, then really, you're missing the obvious. I'm not accusing him of
plagiarism, NO!! But I have never heard him play a solo that's his own
style--- he doesn't have his own style!! He is an amalgamation of a variety
of different styles belonging to his idols--- namely Al DiMeola, Steve
Morse, Steve Howe, Brian May, David Gilmour, Ritchie Blackmore, etc. I
listen to him, and I cannot help but think "Here he's a mini Steve Morse...
now he's Brian May..." John Petrucci does a very good affectation of all of
those, and he is thus able to combine them. This is a credit, but his
genius lies more in the fiendish rhythmic devices he invents with Mike
Portnoy and also to some extent, the conversations he has with the keyboard
player. In an interview in GW he said that he picked up Al DiMeola songs
from records played at half-speed and that's how he learnt to play.
I don't even think he's a great soloist--- he doesn't have an identity of
his own. I'd place  somebody like, say, Marty Friedman above him, let alone
all the aforementioned idols that are still alive and kicking.

My vote for favourite guitarist alive goes jointly to a) John McLaughlin
('nuff said already)  and b) Steve Morse - who's a blend of diverse
influences, but the result is quite unrecognisable. And man, can he soar.
Listen to 'Sometimes I feel like Screaming..." on Deep Purple's Perpendicular.

GUITAR TONE

Best tone in recent years - Adrian Utley of PORTISHEAD. Trust me, my vote
is highly informed. Eric Johnson is called the 'king of tone' by his
colleagues, and yes, he *is* amazing, but my choice of Adrian Utley is
unequivocal. Utley uses a Gibson ES-335, with a Roland Space Echo, a Big
Muff, and a range of crusty old vintage amps labelled by a BBC technician
as being "70% lethal". Literally.

David Gilmour- for inventing the 'doppola cabinet'. Hear it on Comfortably
Numb, live on 'Pulse'. And die. :-)

John McLaughlin - on the 'Birds of Fire' album. Frank Zappa later
admiringly labelled his tone on this album as 'Stinkin'. Coming from Zappa,
that means something! And the tone *is* perverse.

Robert Johnson- Delta Blues.

These are the sounds I would trade in my arms for!

PHRASINGTIMING

Phrasingtiming- the new buzzword of TNMS. To the guy who gave it to us,
this is not a flame, but that lesson was uncalled for. We were discussing
speed and who is fast and who isn't. We were not discussing who is the
greatest. 
Speed has its place in the Western Classical tradition and is also of prime
importance in the Indian Classical Tradition. I'm sure you've heard of Ravi
Shankar? Players strive all their lives to attain the technique and power
to be able to adequately express themselves.
THE GUITAR IS AN INSTRUMENT --- Technical virtuosity has its place in the
tradition of every musical instrument. Let us not completely abandon age
old musical philosophy, ok?
SPEED IS VERY IMPORTANT. SPEED IS NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS. Once again, I'm
talking about guys like McLaughlin and Jason Becker. Not Holdsworth or
Satriani.

IMO it has been a worthwhile thread --- the question of speed is less
subjective than say the question of who plays with more emotion. ;-)

Take it easy,
Ashim.
