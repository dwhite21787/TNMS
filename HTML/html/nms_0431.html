Just a quickie, then back to the vaporizer.  Sorry about the lack o'NMS
this week, but I've been concentrating on not being totally overcome by a
disgusting cold.  I've been off work for the last week, and it's the first 
time I've been out of work more than three days ... ever.  I'm recovering,
(thanks for the cards & letters), and will be more-or-less back on track
next week.  There will be two NMS's today (missed getting only one by 3K),
but the admin. mail is as yet unread.  If you sent an unsub. message or a
change of addr. message in the last week, I probably haven't gotten to it
yet.  I'll get through all of these before I send out the first NMS next
week.  Now, on with the (cough) show...

Hi there,
	This is my first posting and have a few things to mention here.

Speaking of GOAC radio play, WBCN in Boston has a top 10 requests of the
week on Friday.  Last Friday, January 31, the boyz were #2 with GOAC, up
one position from #3 the week previous.  Will find out how they fare this
week and I'll keep ya informed.  For those local, I think the Countdown
starts at 12:00 noon.

The T-shirt design resembling a tabloid is a good idea and I like some
of the punnies (spelling on purpuse) that are mentioned, but I didn't
like the idea of "Rock Band Plagued by Cancer".  In my opinion this was
too negative.  I liked the "Rabid Sundogs", "Turn the Page" and the
Pentagram references also.
We may want to make the design of the tee's generic, meaning not pertaining
to a tour/album period, so we can wear them for years to come.  Unless of
course the people involved in making the tees are willing to do this during
the next album/tour?  Just my thoughts.

Back on the subject of best shows/tours, my most memorable show was a
HYF show at the Worcester Centrum back in 1988 I think.  I think the guys were
pretty charged up for this show and showed the kind of energy and fun that
I'm hearing from some of you during this current tour; and the balloons
dropping from the ceiling and my seats (2nd row) helped out also.
I guess it just depends on when you catch them and where.
The show at Worcester on the 10th of December was pretty good, but the sound
was off, (couldn't hear Alex's GTR that well, bad acoustics, etc), and Alex
didn't do his _break_dance_ routine.  Oh well.

If anyone has anymore information about the New Haven show please email
me.  I thought someone mentioned that tix were going on sale.

Date: Thu, 6 Feb 92 17:28:14 CST

The guy conducting the poll on rec.music.misc for best Rush albums
thinks he has too few entries for Rush--only 50 something compared
with Pink Floyd's 100+.  I told him it's pretty difficult for
Rush fans to rank all 1* of their albums in likable order.  It is
for me anyway.

[ That, and some of us don't have time for r.m.m and the bashing...
                                                            rush-mgr ]

So, why don't you who care send me JUST YOUR FAVOURITES and I'll
put together a ballot from the NMS?  If you feel like ranking all
of them, post to rec.music.misc, or write me.  If you're like me,
and you don't want to rank them all, send me just the favourite ones.
If you don't want Rush discussed in rec.misc.music, flame them.
If there's going to be such a poll I'd like to see true Rush fans
determine the outcome.

	I just wanted to add my vote to the tabloid idea, especially the
headline ideas submitted by Hans Gruenig.  As far as putting everyone's
names on the back-nice idea, but sounds impossible.  I like Guy Kendall's
idea about listing the names of cities from RUSH songs as though they were
the actual tour dates.  I don't care what they are made of as long as they
don't shrink like the real tour shirts.  With that in mind, either pre-shrunk
100% cotton or 50/50 seems to be the best ideas.  It would also be nice if
the design could be scanned to a .gif file at the ftp site so that everyone
could look at it an decide whether or not they want it.  So far, everything
sounds great.  I hope they turn out to be just as good.

	Adios!!!

Roll The Bones should be released as a single in the UK on 10th February
in the following formats:
  7 inch single
  Cassette single
  12 inch photo pack, with previously unseen photos of the band
  Hologram CD double pack
  Square white disc in a black sleeve with holes in (like dice!)
It is hoped that all formats will contain a previously unreleased live track
and an exclusive interview with Alex, Neil and Geddy.

On 6th April, just before the UK concerts, Ghost of a Chance will be released
in four (as yet undecided) formats.

Thanks to Mick from the Spirit of Rush for the information.

Andrew.

Hello,

This is my first post in a looong time.  (By the way, I have assumed another
identity - I used to be Daredevil :))

I was at UT's AV library, and was listening to Presto when I heard something
that I couldn't believe.  I rushed home (no pun intended) and looked at the
lyrics to Presto.  Though RTB has been in the forefront, I could not believe
that I missed the Mopar connection.

(for those of you non car buffs, this will mean nothing)

"Boy before the mirror, checks his camouflage"
"Polishes his armor, and the CHARGER in the garage"

Charger is obviously the muscle car from the '60s (and my ALL time favorite
car!)

Just another one of my crazy obsessions (Chargers - check my .plan! :))

Well, I"m going to see the boyz in Austin on 2/20; so I'll send in my review
then.

See you!

My first Rush concert -- I will never forget.  They came down to
Hawaii in November of 1984.  They did every song from GUP except
"Afterimage" and "Kid Gloves".  Dammit, I wish they'd come back...

About parents being into Rush -- my parents like Rush; my mom mostly
since my dad's main music is classical (turn it up!).  My mom prefers
their older stuff, but she likes RTB pretty much, too.  My dad is
really "supportive"; after all, it's his computer address I'm using
for this!, and I remember one incident that was really great.  When
rock CD's were just coming out, my dad took me down to the record
store and we looked around for any Rush CD's.  He found "Moving
Pictures" and bought it for me.  We went home and started to blast the
hell out of it.  In the middle of "Tom Sawyer", he happened to walk
past the stereo and turned it up even more!!!  It sounded like a
private Rush concert in the living room.  Damn, that was fun!

I really wish I could have gone to both shows.  Primus are such clowns; you
never know what they're gonna do.  For the first Oakland show, they covered
Peter Gabriel's "Intruder", which no one in the audience seemed to recognize
(it took me a half-minute myself); they did the "Kashmir" bow-thing at the
beginning of "Seas of Cheese"; and they also broke into the intro to
Metallica's "Master of Puppets" in the middle of "Too Many Puppies".
(Actually, they do this a lot, though I never noticed the Puppies--Puppets
connection until now....)  They used to do Pink Floyd's "In The Flesh/Run
Like Hell", as well as the intro to "YYZ", and now there's even a radio-only
single of their cover of XTC's "Making Plans for Nigel".

I'm seriously considering starting a Primus mailing list... do people think
there would be enough interest in this?  I feel I'm qualified to run one
after having seen them for the fifth time...

ObRush: The concert was all-around excellent.  What can I say?  I hope they
keep this up for another 18 years.  I can't wait until they start pulling
out "oldies" like "Afterimage" and "Countdown"...

-- DougO

P.S. Maybe Rush'll listen to Primus's "Eleven" and become re-inspired to do
odd time signatures again...  I can dream, can't I?

P.P.S.  Oh yeah, in case anyone forgot:

Hi dudes,

First of all, does anybody know if/when Rush will be touring Europe ?
And will they play in Belgium ?

RTB got played once on MTV Europe, in a request program called 'Ray's
Request'. It was asked by somebody from Sweden or Norway.
Claiming he was the world's biggest Rush fan.

If at all possible, put me down for a T-shirt too. But I don't know
if that is very practical, Belgium being a long way off...

I think the favourite band poll should be elaborated, something like a top 5
of favourite bands, or rather favourite albums ?
My vote goes to Marillion.

Greetings from Belgium,

One that continually amazes me is the bass line to "Turn the Page",
especially the "off note" in it (us musicians call them "color notes"

"Nothing can survive in a vaccuum...".

One of the things discussed was "Where's My Thing?"

To the person gathering opinions about ablbum covers,

	I have to cast my vote for 'Best Rush Album Cover' to...

	Caress of Steel.

I have a question regarding this cool cover.  I bought my CoS CD in
Tokyo and in addition to all the Japanese lyrics and the intro
paragraph (which I can't read), the back of the booklet looks like the
front except for having a totally different picture.  The front has of
course the Necromancer, the Evil Prism, the snake, and brew-vapors in
the picture, and the back has kind of a nature scene with a river and a
tree, and it looks as if its near a cliff...  I like to call it the
'Bacchus Plateau'. Does everyone else have this second picture on the
back of their CD booklet?  Love to hear from you.  Bye

<A NAME="431319">From: mjt1@mtuxo.att.com!</A>

Hello folks,

> What was your first Rush concert?

Mine was the AFTK tour at the Hollywood Sportatorium in Florida.
There were 2 bands that opened for Rush that night.  First was
a band called Head East...they sucked.  Next was probably the
best opening act Rush ever had - the Pat Travers Band.
All in all a great show.  Tickets were general admission and cost
$6.50.  What a deal!

By the way, this was right after I saw them on Don Kirshner's
Rock Concert.  Thanks Don!

	Well, for all of you people who write in stories about how you
have met members of the band, next time you see one of the boyz, tell 'em
What's the deal??? Baltimore WANTS its share of Rush!!!!

	Oh well... this is a REAL bummer. Richmond is too far of a drive
for me. Guess I will just have to live with the "sweet memories" of the
DC Capital Center show. :(

	BTW.. add my name to those who are looking for RTB boots..

1st: someone was surprised when he/she heard "Show Don't Tell"
used to cut to or from a commercial on MTV's Most Wanted. Well,
several other people have mentioned this, I've heard it myself--
seems as though it's a common riff for them to use on the show...

More T-shirt ideas:
"Axe-wielding maniac seen chopping down trees"
"Insane sports car driver arrested"
"Mr. and Mrs. Reagan drop from society--'the stars weren't
aligned,' friends say"
"How this janitor got rich quick--'they thought I was just
someone to talk to, someone to sweep the floors"

I'll make up some more later...

Just a last minute suggestion on the NMS shirts

If there are going to be articles on the front or back with headlines,
like a tabloid, then possibly the text that goes below the headlines
could consist of the NMS members, just listed on after another. Possibly?

Also I will be transcribing the following

The SPIN article "Confessions of a Rush Fan"
The San Jose Mercury News "Eye"  interview with Neil P.
The San Jose Mercury News "Eye"  Oakland concert review

I will do all those as soon and quickly as possible.  Rush-mgr, should I
send them separate or as one post?  Just a wondrin!

[ Please send them individually to the Admin. address.  Thanks!    :rush-mgr ]

Well New England Rush fans, I have it on good authority that Rush is
coming to New Haven, CT for another show!

My girlfriend works in the music dept. at Lechmere, and in the latest
music notes, they list upcoming concerts, and Rush is listed for New
Haven, CT for March.... I beleive the date is the 16th, but I forget
AAARGH! I'll ask her tonight and confirm it... I don't know if tickets
have gone on sale yet, we're calling this week to find out.

Dennis

P.S. - anyone know if I have to call a different ticket master for New
Haven tickets, or can I call the Boston one?

Even though I can no longer keep up with the traffic on the NMS, I would
still be *really* interested in a T-shirt... would whomever is doing these
please let poor, currently-unsubscribed souls like me know when this idea comes
about?

<As I pore through about three months of back mailings of the NMS...>

<A NAME="431025">Subject: Bootleg List</A>

I am the new person in charge of the Avaliable boots list. I currently
have a listing of the bootlegs avaliable, and who owns them. If any
one wants the list(s), they can send me mail requesting the list,
and I will send it. It *will not* be avaliable by ftp; you will have
to write and request the list. I check my mail daily, so this should
not be a problem. The list is slightly out of date, as it contains
no boots from the Presto or Roll the Bones tours. It also doens't
list any of the CD bootlegs avaliable, so if anyone has these, please
let me know so I can add them to the list.

[ Just for the record, the NMS neither supports nor condones the taping of
  concerts.  PLEASE keep any mail (replies) concerning "rarities" to e-mail.
  Thank you for your support.                                    :rush-mgr ]
