Hey

(in reference to the Republican, conservative = Rush fan debate)
I'm going to respond. Was this Mike who responded to my posting? I don't 
remember.

>While this person definitely needed taking to task, I would argue
>with the assertation that scientists by definition can think--I know 
		I certainly wasn't saying that all scientists are thinking people..  
And I am not as well educated as I should be on subjects like 
philosophy, and I do not want to get into debates about logic. I'm 
pretty irrational, I'll admit that up front.  All I wanted to say- to 
the guy who thinks all Rush fans and thinking people are conservative 
Republicans- is that I am not conservative, and I *am*intelligent and 
educated. 

>But listening to Rush would cause me to give you the benefit of the
>doubt--but I have met some flaming idiots who were Rush fans.
	Well, of the men I have known well who were into Rush, there are 2 
extremely sharp guys, a not so sharp but sweet guy, an idiot who tried 
to hit me, and a guy who was an accessory to the rape of my friend. so I 
wouldn't make any assumptions about Rush fans. Maybe the majority are 
above average intelligence, but that doesn't mean they have a heart or a 
conscience. Or use the brains they *do* have.

I am not a flaming idiot. Thanks for the benefit of the doubt. :)

If I may throw in my $/50, the 3/4 and 6/4 time signatures sound very
different, as far as beat division.

Just for consistency though, let's look at 3/4 and 6/8.  Each signature has
three quarter-notes (or six eighth-notes) per measure, but the strong beats are
placed differently:

3/4:	ONE	&	TWO	&	THREE	&
6/8:	ONE	la	le	TWO	la	le

Notice that 6/8 is divided into groups of 3 notes, giving it a waltz feel.  In
music theory terms, this is called compound meter.  The straighter 3/4 time is
called simple meter.

If the number of beats per measure (numerator) is divisible by 3 but not 3,
then the music is in compound meter (waltz-ish).

I don't know if there is are 'standard' beat divisions for asymetric times like
5/x or 7/x.  Does anyone else know?

Comments welcome.

Some truely strange goings on in the weather report today...

The low in downtown Denver today was 21 F

The low in downtown Colorado Springs today was 12 F

Distance...(the long range filter) about 70 miles between the two 
cities....

Also...did you know...

If Terrell Davis rushes for exactly 104 yards against the 
Miami Dolphins in this coming weekend's playoff game...his 
RUSH'ing total for the year would be EXACTLY 2112 (of course I 
think more than likely, he will have that total by half-time...even on 
Miami...)
  
That would surpass Eric Dickerson's single season RUSH mark by 5 yards, 
oddly enough, 2112 was RUSH's 4th disc, but it did appear on their live 
disc, All The Worlds A Stage...their 5th disc...which is where Terrell 
will be on Saturday afternoon.

Final Score out of Denver this weekend:

Denver Broncos 21
Miami Dolphins 12

Like, it's in the Atmospheric changes....(actually I think the real 
score will be much more of a blow~out)

Denver Broncos 38
Miami Dolphins 17  (That would make the difference 21)

You heard it here first...or was that hear?????  Anyway, we have Ged, 
Alex, and Neil to thank!

Peace en Rushlund

<A NAME="2162005">Subject: Favorite songs and solos</A>

I love extremes, so let's talk about a few extremes right now...

First, I'd like to toss my two pennies into this whole "speed guitar" 
debate flaring up lately.  In my opinion (with fifteen years, three 
bands and lots of lessons as experience), guitar playing is like weight 
lifting and asking out women: LESS IS MORE.  Give me Alex's solo on the 
end of "2112" or "Different Strings" any day over Vinnie Vincent buzzing 
out 9,000 notes in ten seconds like a pissed-off bumblebee.  Passion and 
precision, you know?

The top ten Rush songs of all time, for music, lyrics, solo, drumming 
and composition:

1) Red Barchetta
2) Spirit of Radio
3) Xanadu
4) Different Strings
5) The Trees

The top five Alex solos:

1) Limelight
2) La Villa Strangiato
3) Cinderella Man
4) A Farewell to Kings
5) Closer to the Heart

It's funny...I've been playing guitar for over fifteen years and never 
conciously tried to copy anyone...I consider Eddie, Clapton and Page my 
favorite players...but ol' Lerxst has done more to influence me than 
anyone else, just because I've played so much Rush before.  Not a bad 
guy to emulate.  I think one of Alex's most beautiful solos ever is the 
second one in "Shut up shuttin' up" on the Victor album, where he uses a 
delay pedal.  That's smooth as silk.

<A NAME="2162008">Subject: Music Clubs and Free CD's</A>

Hello,

Okie, here's the deal about mail order music clubs and free CD's. I read
this about a year ago.

In the standard artist recording contract, the contract calls for reduced
(many times significantly) royalties from music club cd sales. For the free
give-away CD's, the artist receives zippo - nothing! The example they gave
was when Eddie Vedder was reviewing the yearly accounting books for one of
Pearl Jam's major cds (-Vs- maybe, or the big one before it), he was
shocked/intrigued to find that a million or so copies had been given away
free in music clubs, of which he received nothing.

I can't remember what percentage the record company gets off of music club
cds, but I believe part of the deal is that they too receive little or
nothing for the free give away cd's. So, the music club would only have the
cost of the producing or securing the cd itself ($1.00 to $2.00). For the
free cd's, you are paying $3.00 to $4.00 or more each for shipping.

Later,

Doug.

*** BEGIN TRANSMISSION ***

Stockholm, 11 April 2037 (REUTERS) - The Nobel Comittee, presided over
by Her Majesty Queen Victoria of Sweden,  announced today the winners of
the Nobel Prize for 2037. The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to
Neil Peart of Canada.

Mr. Peart has long been tipped as a potential contender for the prize.
Widely regarded as one of the most prolific and varied writers at work
today, he is best know for his novels, in particular "Lost Megadon"
(2013), "Looking at a Far Mountain" (2017) and "Trial by Fury" (2029),
which won the Booker Prize, as well as his collections of short stories
and his many editorials for The National Midnight Star and TIME
magazine.

It is often forgotten that Mr. Peart originally began his career as a
uniquely gifted musician over 50 years ago. Having quit high school
early, he began his professional life as a drummer, which first took him
to England and then back to Canada where he became a member of the
legendary Toronto trio, Rush. It was during his early years as a
struggling musician that Mr. Peart developed an affinity for literature
and writing, first as a fan of modern fiction, then as a the ensemble's
chief lyricst, developing a huge body of work unique in the history of
rock music. His lyrical prowess grew together with his increasing
interest in 20th century literature over the 1970s and 1980s, such that
his Rush lyrics are today studied at college level. Together with his
fellow musicians he was inducted into the Order of Canada in 1997.

Mr. Peart stopped performing at the end of the 1990s, following the
tragic deaths of his wife and daughter. Always a private person, Mr.
Peart subsequently retreated into near-isolation, emerging after many
years with his first novel, "Whispered Silence", in 2007, which
immediately began its climb of the bestseller list. Later, Mr. Peart
took on a professorship in English at McGill University in Montreal,
while continuing his writing career. He also set up a number of trust
funds and scholarships to assist young artists and musicians in Canada.

Fellow Rushians,

For as long or as short of a time as I have been a part of this mailing 
I have seen a number of issues come and gone that were either 
irrelevant, boring, stupid, idiosyncratic, a waste of time to send to 
5000 people or cheap.  I can remember a few debates that went on for 
longer than they should in recent history:  whether Metallica has in 
fact sold out (though I believe they did), whether Metallica is a better 
band than Rush, whether Alex van Halen sucks or not, whether Eddie van 
Halen sucks or not, whether a cazoo was used in By-Tor (and I hope it 
was finally resolved that one was not), whether CTTH, TSOR, TS and 
others should have or should have not been included on DS and now we're 
arguing about the demographics of Rush listeners.  For all I know most 
Rush fans may be married, older, conservative.  I don't care.  That 
doesn't mean that Rush fans, here's the key word, *cannot* be single, 
younger, liberal.  My God, why is it that every time someone makes a 
statement as to what they believe on this list, someone has to come out 
and respond to it as if they were directly being threatened?  Frankly I 
do not care whether Rush fans are conservative or liberal and I think 
that this petty debate as to what the fans' political views are count 
for much towards the integrity that this mailing list is designed for.  
That's my $.02.  Oh, by the way, just so you know as for my political 
views, I'm a reactionary.

Now as for semi-Rush material, I have never believed that "faster means 
better."  I have never cared for Joe Satriani constantly whirling away 
riffs that are faster than what other people play.  But since we are on 
the subject, who would you argue is the fastest bass player?  Now we 
have to consider bass players, since we are the most neglected of 
musicians in the world!  Of course, I have to vote for Geddy.  Now, I 
hope some of you can help me out on this.  Man o' War did a rendition of 
Flight of the Bumblebee by Rimsky-Korsakov on one of their albums.  The 
bass guitarist played the main string section.  Some of the finest bass 
work I've heard.  Who is the bass player and what album does this come 
from?

For Rush material, does anyone know where Neil drew his inspiration for 
the lyrics of Hemispheres.  There is nothing concrete about the 
mythology in Hemispheres, but much of what is present in that song is 
intrinsic to the Apollonian vs. Dionysian mindsets that I teach my 
students in classical mythology.  If anyone knows, please give me a 
call.

Take care all.

<A NAME="2162013">Subject: Relayer, and other stuff</A>

I had a good laugh when I read the last digest, and somebody said not to 
play Relayer at parties.  Just imagine the look on people's faces! 
Actually, I don't think I would play any Yes at party, unless the party 
was a bunch of Yes fans :)  The only danceable song by Yes is the 2nd 
half of I've Seen All Good People...and please don't flame me, I'm not 
saying that music has to be danceable to be good :)

Seriously, I was listening to Relayer as I read the recent digest (its 
still on in fact), so I felt the need to contribute my .02.  Even though 
Ged said it was one of his favorites, Its better to get into Yes by 
listening The Yes Album, or Fragile, or a compilation like Classic Yes.  
Even Close to the Edge or Tales From Topographic Oceans is more 
accessable to a new fan than Relayer would be.  I was already a veteran 
Yes listener when I got Relayer, and it took me a few listens before I 
really got into it.  It is one of the best Yes albums, IMHO.

And as far as this Rush fan stereotype thing goes, I do have a college 
education (graduated in May), but I got into Rush my sophomore year of 
high school.  I am single, 22, and I'd have to kill myself before I'd 
classify myself as a Republican, but I'm not a bleeding-heart liberal 
either.  But I am an engineer, so I would have to say that I have the 
ability to think ;-)  It is possible to stereotype Republicans as Rush 
fans...only if you are talking about Rush Limbaugh.

Sorry about the lack of significant Rush content.

<A NAME="2162014">Subject: BTW, What's the difference????</A>

Ok, I'm here again with another question:

And the question is... What's the difference between 3/2, 6/4, 12/8? I mean,
matthematically it represents the 
same quantity, and musicaly it represents the same quantity of notes. I know
that 3/2 are three half-notes,

Very nicely said.  I personally don't like Mac's but that is a very good
observation.
You know it and I know it, the only reason IBM compatibles are so popular is
because they're mainstream and because Microsoft runs primarily on them.  If
Microsoft were to start fully supporting Macs, I'm willing to bet my buns
that the Mac market would improve a great bit.  But as long as MS uses IBM
Compat's the market and world will follow.  If Microsoft would design
software for your Texas Instrument's Speak and Spell, I think people would
buy Speak and Spell's.  Just my personal opinion.  So flame me while I have

Who ever came up with the notion that Rush fans are intrinsically
conservative?  I'll buy the part about higher than average education, (or if
not then at least the capacity to use what's between the ears a tad more
effectively than the rest of the population), but I'd like to see someone
come up with proof about conservatism.

I am quite liberal and I have always enjoyed Rush and the way that their
music stands for personal responsibility, independence, and rights.  Has not
their message been about emotional, environmental, and societal pressures
and responsibilities?  I know of many Republicans who would literally froth
at the mouth after listening to such as Nobody's Hero, Freewill, Prime
Mover, not to mention 2112!

Perhaps I just don't get it.

To all NMS readers who think BMG is inferior, I have eye opening news.
The CD's they send out are EXACTLY the same except that one little
"produced by BMG" logo. Here is why, and how I know this.
1) BMG is a major Distributer.  Many of the CD's you buy in the store use
BMG to get there discs around the world.

2)Next, BMG must purchase rights to produce the CD's from the record
company.  If they don't the production is ILLEGAL.
2b) In addition, the packaging is the same due to the prior reasons.

3) If you don't believe me try for yourself.  I recently joined BMG after
researching the two main players in CD Clubs (BMG and Columbia).  You can
ALWAYS get the free CD's and Not pay the shipping or fufill the obligation
if your unsatisfied...heres my situation...judge for yourself

	I planned on ordering my first 7 free CD's and then dropping my
membership. However, I was actually impress with the service of BMG. (side
note, 2 of my first CD's were Rush...Farewell to Kings (remastered) and
Retro 2 the packaging was the same). When the CD's arrived, I discovered 2
with flaws...BMG sent me replacements immediatly with no extra shipping
charge. Since then I've ordered a few things.  A Billy Joel 4CD box set for
$17.99, and then 3 Phish CD's (Buy 1 + get 2 free and 10% off), buying that
one also completed my "obligation."

One final note...As for the ever so hated "Featured Selections" which the
company automatically sends to you, you can decline them online or (since
no contract is ever signed, you have no obligation to pay for them if they
send them to you.
	That's my story, and NO, I don't work for BMG...I just saw people raging
on them, so I thought I'd tell a positive story.  That's it for now.
Goodbye.

really make out what Big Al calls himself because the sound kinda

Rush sighting on New Year's Eve:
I work at a hotel in Twin Falls, ID and I was working the 3-11 shift 
that night.  I was working very hard (watching TV because no one
was coming in) and I got a phone call from someone wanting to 
make a reservation for that night for a friend of her's coming from 
out of town.  I started up the reservation and I asked for the person's 
last name.  She said "Syme", then I asked for the person's first name, 
and she said "Hugh".  Not surprisingly, it wasn't him, but that did 
kinda make up for the fact that I had to work on New Year's Eve!

Hey guys...

Did you ever notice how a lot of bands release a compilation entitled "Love 
Songs?"  Well, it got me to thinking...if Rush ever released a compilation of 
love songs, what would it look like?  Well, I made a tape for my friend for 
his birthday and called it RUSH- Love Songs.  I will now share the results of 
that recording...

Side One--
Closer to the Heart
Anthem
Lakeside Park
Madrigal
Entre Nous
Different Strings
Losing It
Red Barchetta

Side Two--
Emotion Detector (one of the most underrated Rush songs ever...)
Time Stand Still
Second Nature
Presto
Bravado
Ghost of a Chance
Alien Shore
Resist
Cold Fire
Mission

*LOL*.  That's why we love them, I guess...most bands would just write love 
songs about a relationship, but Rush can write them about a car, yourself, 
humanity, the present, or a bunch of Renaissance people...

P.S. Did anyone but me notice that Neil's drumming on the 1978 set from 
Different Stages, particularly the "Working Man/Fly By Night/In the Mood 
medley is ESPECIALLY smoking??  He was in the 'zone' that night...

P.P.S. To guitarists: I can play most any Rush song pretty accurately, even 
"Strangiato", but "Show Don't Tell" perplexes the hell out of me.  What the 
heck kinds of chords is Big Al playing?  Inversions?

Hi!

I hope everyone had a safe and happy holiday season.

Just a quickie note to say that I heard Bravado (RTB version) on KDDX
(methinks they were the call letters) in South Dakota on 12/26.  I was
traveling between families, and let me tell you, it was a bright spot on
a very stressful day.

DS is a great listen when one is travelling down a dark highway going
78mph.

I haven't been listening to DS much lately (what?  am I crazy?) because
Styx I and Chef Aid have been in the CD player.  Cartman's version of
Come Sail Away is so fucking hilarious.  I'm a total Stygian and I had
tears from laughing so hard.

Also, I haven't been listening to anything because of the time-sucking
game of BALDUR'S GATE.  If you have it, you know what I'm talking about.

Best Rush Wishes!

Hola Rush Fanatics,

Eventually, keeping my peepers open and my mouth shut led to some build 
up over time.  Just a couple of comments... 

Mind blowing observation by Dan McConnell.  I'm a Mac user/Rush fan. It 
has opened up so many windows as to why I feel so subconsciously 
oppressed.  (snicker)  Psychology humor is intentional.  Kudos! 

Based purely on fan loyalty, I recently purchased the "Working Man" Rush 
tribute album (Which was produced in correlation with Mike Portnoy, of 
course).  Oops!  Silly me!  That's probably what the guys up in marketing 
were hoping for because deep down they knew that Rush in any other form 
just couldn't be the same.  

Buyer beware!  If you can fathom the illegitimate child of Judas Priest 
and Rush, then I recommend this album.  Sadly, I wasn't able to stomach 
listening to the CD in its entirity.  I appreciate the efforts of Mike 
and Co., but sheesh!  Any other opinions, please feel free!

See you in Xanadu,

Ok, we've been having a thread on 'speed demons'. Many fantastic players
came to light - all of them very fast. Someone said there may be too many
fast players out there. Not a problem in itself, but I think in this age of
homegeneity, the real craft lies in what you can do with the speed you've
earned. Al DiMeola uses his speed to tremendous melodic effect, changing
direction, phrasing, even using an 'ebb and flow' of speed (this particular
trick is 2 die for). John Mclaughlin couples it with an absolutely
diabolical guitar tone and often creates a complete blur of dissonant notes
  you don't know what's happening. Jason Becker, another insanely talented
player who eventually got ALS (the disease), gave the world something truly
amazing with his early 'Perpetual Burn' album - this guy can play
arpeggios, let's leave it at that. RUSH CONTENT!! Alex Lifeson likes to use
sudden, nervous bursts of blinding speed. Steve Morse is a chicken-picker
from hell (among other things). The list goes on. These people didn't get
stuck in the mud with their speed. They looked upon it as a means, not an
end. Skill is definitely a large part of the craft, and speed is a large
part of the skill, but it definitely isn't *all* the craft.

Somebody said here a while back, that players who use white noise are
'amateurs'. I still haven't been able to figure out what this means. To my
mind, this is a very deleterous generalisation, it denies contributions
from many important players. Don't ask for a list - suffice it to know that
a very big one exists and yes, I can differentiate white noise from noise.
When I was 12, I might have felt like that. All I can say is, keep an open
mind, and maybe if it isn't too much to ask, listen to Sonic Youth's 'Goo'
  by general consensus considered to be a landmark album in the history of
the guitar fullstop. (it's among Guitar Magazine's 25 greatest guitar
albums, Moving Pictures is there too) See what they did with white noise.

RUSH SIGHTING: I live in Bangladesh. The primary music channels we get are
Channel [v] and MTV Asia. Needless to say, neither of these have played a
single Rush video in five years. But Channel [v] has a program called Turn
on TV which comes on every day - back to back vids. Well, during the splash
screen between videos, they play bits and pieces of music - and almost all
of these are snippets from Rush songs. The intros to Limelight, Tom Sawyer,
Red Barchetta, Passage to Bangkok, and many more. 
Yeah. Never play a Rush video, but use their music everyday. So it goes.

after the effects of DS - plus NO good at maths.  Sat my O-Level four times
you know = sad!

Ok, at the risk of more [serious?] derision, I will take this further......

Aaaah.  Now I [we ??] am getting somewhere.  Ok, the 2/3 was a gaff.  But I
did think that 3/2 was a serious time signature with a particular "feel",
qualitatively different to 6/4.....?  You know, like how 3/4 feels different
to 6/8 etc.  I most certainly could be [a] wrong and/or [b] banging my head
against a ping ride here, but what sparks my interest is this:  The King
Crimson album called Three of a Perfect Pair.  I always took the name, Three
of a Perfect Pair, to be a literal translation of the time signature of the
title track? Wrong again ??

Even though I gave up playing, it seems I am still most certainly a [drum]
bore.  Looking forward to yet more insight.

Happy new year to all of you.

Keith

Dinky drums on P/G?  I think I know what the original poster meant when
describing the drums on P/G as dinky.

Its not a matter of performance by any means, but whenever I hear "Red Lenses"
or "Red Sector A", I shudder when I hear those fuzzy synth drum pads
(especially on Red Lenses).  Were those the hexagonal black/white pads?  Of
course at that time they were cutting edge, and Rush is a bad to experiment
with new technologies.  I hear the same drums in other 80's rock band as well,
"Best of Both Worlds" by Van Halen was on the box yesterday and I noticed it
there as well.

Neils performance on P/G is exceptional, but thank God that the sound of synth
drums have come so far in 15 years.

My niece was born on 12/22.  So unless Rush come out with a sequel album 2122, 
I'm screwed.  Either that or I'm a fan of 2112 and the band Ten Years After.
