Hey everybody

just had to add my voice to all the Seattlites...KISW pretty much rocks, 
plays tons of Rush...the best is hearing "2112 Overture" and "Temples" 
during, ahem, the evening rush hour. Though yesterday's afternoon DJ 
started *talking* during the end of "Red Bachetta"! 
*gasp* sacrilege! ;)
And when the radio alarm went off at 5:22am today, something loud and 
heavy greeted me, though it took my sleepy brain several seconds to 
recognize it as "Working Man". ahhh... :)

Yep, that's his brother.  I actually saw him on a video countdown about a 
month ago.  At first I thought he WAS Geddy, they look so alike.  The 
host of the show was interviewing him because she was touring his 
company, Revolver Films (at least I think it's his company -- I can't 
remember whether he owns it or if he's just one of the head honchos).  
The company's website is at www.revolverfilms.com.  It reveals that, 
surprise surprise, Allan has worked on some Rush videos :-)

Hi there !

In Holland, every year we have a festival called pink-pop, in
a small town called Landgraaf.
Rush played there during their Hemispheres periode.
Last weekend Primus played in front of 60.000 people at Pink-pop.
What happened ? 60.000 people go nuts, jumping up and down, and 
the Meteoroligic institute registered an earth-quake 1.1 on 
the Richter scale, with it's epic centre at Landgraaf, during
Primus' performance, at Pink-pop ! ! ! !

Let's see Rush doing that !  (I'm NOT a Primus fan, but this is
unique ! ! ! )

Upon reading the book, I found it ironic that a high caliber band such as
Rush would allow such juvenile, idealistic writing to be published as *the*
biography about the band. Heck, maybe they really *would* allow me to
produce their next disc!

What needs to happen is for Neil to sit down and take the time to do it
justice -- we all know he can write. :-)

Concerning the tribute band Power Windows:

I've never seen them live but my younger brother has (twice) and after
seeing them the first time he came over to tell me that it was the best
imitation of Rush you could imagine. The vocalist had Geddy's voice down
pat and the guitars, bass and drums sounded identical to the gear the
boys use.

In fact... he went so far as to say that if you closed your eyes, you
couldn't tell any differences between Power Windows and a live Rush CD.

Hey gang..
Great thread. I don't know if this has been stated but Nietzsche's vision
was of the "Uberman," which translates into Superman. I studies Nietzsche in
high school, and don't exactly remember all that went into the thought, but
I'm pretty darn sure he did coin the word.

Neil has suggested that you play anagrams to figure out what it means.
You can do that if you would want Neil to be proud of your effort, or
you can just read on below for the answer:

Change the letters of Narpets and you get Parents.  Didacts, coming from
"didactic" (the same in French, possibly the same in Spanish?) means
teachers.  So Didacts & Narpets is Teachers and Parents.  I hope this
helps.  I doubt you'll be able to translate an anagram into spanish and
still make it relevant, but good luck.

I think you got it ... the band themselves.  Didn't I hear/read of a CD-ROM
in the works by the guys -- with history etc?  If I recall it was in response to
a question about enchanced CD's and Neil said he preferred something more
than just tacking a video onto the CD ... something more substantial.

I used to own a 4003. Black w/white trim... it WAS wired for "Rick-O-Sound"
Stereo. As I recall, when I asked the guy in the store what was the
difference (because I wanted what Geddy was using) between the two, he said
that the 4001's frets/neck were made to accommodate flat-wound strings, not
round-wound. He said the round-wounds caused a lot of wear and tear on the
frets and fret board and the 4003 was made with round-wounds in mind.

The only people who could really tell you the real truth are Rickenbacker,
which does have a website.

> The difference?  Back then the 4001 was wired for "Rick-O-Sound"

The difference, actually, is in the neck construction.  The 4001 was
built for flat-wound strings ... less tension than round-wounds.  The
4003 was a response to the market -- roundwound or die!

Both are wired for stereo (Rick-O-Sound) with an additional mono
output.

They are, otherwise, exactly the same.  (Although I did notice, way back
when that the pickguard was not one-piece on the 4003, but split at the
'bulb' leading to the control knobs).

Hello Rushians !
Greetings from Brazil, a country where Rush never played. 
Did you know that the biggest brazilian newspaper ("Folha de São Paulo")
intervewied about two thousand people who went in several concerts, and
asked them what band they would like to see playing in Brasil ?
Rush was the second answer, right after U2. U2, that hateful, horrible,
popful, ridicule band, came in March for shows in São Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro, but Rush...
I have a question. Does anybody happen to know the meaning of the folowing
verse of Between Sun & Moon of CP : 
"ahh yes to yes to ahh to yes
why the sun why the sun"
I can't find the connection with the rest of the lyrics, and can't figure
out what Neil means with that. Help would be appreciated. Thank you.

My one year-old prefers Mozart, 50's music and big band to Rush hands
down.  This is despite (or possibly because of?) my wife and I having
been to five TFE shows while she was pregnant.  He does dance like made

I wish to make a public apology to Suzanne, aka Xanstar@aol.com, aka
oceanrush.com. I help her with the hordes of mail she gets sometimes, and I
mistakenly posted MY opinion of the book "Visions" under her screen name. As a
result, SHE received a very, VERY nasty email from someone purporting to be
Bill Banasciewicz. 

I just want everyone to know that the opinion as follows from NMS #2044 --
<<He and Rush parted ways almost immediately after the book was

released because he allowed demos from HYF to be played on the radio without
the band's permission. In any case, I don't think ol' B-man *should* do
another book. Visions is too... hmm. Too obviously written by a groveling fan,
IMO. One too many cheesy lyrics references. That's just IMO, of course. But as
I said, it won't be Bill who writes the next authorized biography (assuming
there will be one).>>

 - is *MINE*, not hers, and I once again publicly apologize to her for the
mistake. 

BTW, I'm not the only one who mentioned B-man's unauthorized release of
tapes... 

<A NAME="2047317"><<From: greg cormier <cormier_greg@isus.emc.com></A>

  In NMS # 2043 Greg Sanderson posted that it was about time that B-man do 
an updated vewrsion of the biographical book Visions. For those who didn't 
know B-man and the band are no longer considered friends. When the band was 
getting ready to release Hold Your Fire they had a.llowed B-man to preview 
it  and he took it upon himself to leak it out to his radio audience 
without the bands permission. In short B-man blew it and will not be 
authorised to do an updated book by the band.>>

Yet this supposed B-man person INSISTS he never did any such thing. Can
someone confirm/deny the story about the HYF tapes and send me a source? 

Thanks, hope this makes a difference. And if anyone wants to see that nasty
mail, just let me know. I'll be more than happy to send it along. But it's
too... hell, it's just plain EVIL if you ask me, and cruel too, to post here. 

Again, thanks for listening.

Not to mention drumming lessons.. and I guess Neil would probably

I have written about my 9 year old Rush fan, Cory, before on here. He is a
great kid and believes he is the next Neil Peart (he actually is a great
little drummer). Tonight he called me into the TV room yelling, "Mommy...come
here quick...they're playing RUSH!". As it turns out, he was watching the
hockey game on ESPN (Buffalo v. Washington) and they were playing Freewill.
Cory and I sang along till they cut it off to get back to the game. Soon after
(within a minute), Buffalo scored (Cory's choice in the game). Do I have a
cool kid or what?

Anyone else watching this game? Cool, eh?

Exactly!  If not for TNMS, I don't know when I would've heard about the
tour.  I know several people who went only because they heard via the net.
The local paper didn't mention it until the week of, and coming up with $40
and a ride in just a couple of days is, for many people, a bit much...

Maybe the NEXT tour (hint to Rush's management) will be well-advertised.  I
have missed Rush in the past because I just didn't hear about it...

              I insist, I heard a little voice in my cd when played the 
Beneath, between & behind with karaoke. That was the same first line, 
but sang in a different way. I don't want to be disappointed, I think 
that Ged is the best bass player in the world. But... can he sing and 
play perfectly alive? In the ASOH video, in the intro of 2112 Alex play 
a Black guitar, and also appears images with the white one... and it 
happen in several songs. Fakes?

It has the most dynamic Rush songs,

and jazzy dances etc...well ..we youngsters had a

Hello fellow NMS'ers!

It's been a long time since I've written into the NMS.  I think it's been
since after Rush had played The Rose Garden in Portland, OR on May 14th, 1997.
The sixth and final show I saw on the 96-97 Test For Echo tour!

Anyways, I stumbled upon this thread.  I'd love to add my two cents worth.  I
purchased a "red barchetta" recently!  It's a 1998 Volkswagen Jetta Wolfsburg
Limited Edition.  I bought it at my local Volkswagen dealer in the greater Los
Angeles, CA area in April.  Love the car and in my 6 disc CD changer is Rush
of course!

<A NAME="2047026">Subject: Re: Rush = Iron Maiden</A>

Hey there,

I have every Rush and Iron Maiden album.  I've listened to both bands since
the early 80s.  A few similarities:

Both:
have songs called 'Twilight Zone'  
have songs based on Colerige poems : 'Xanadu' - 'Ancient Mariner'
mention the Enola Gay in songs : 'Manhattan Project' - 'Holy Smoke'
songs influenced by sci-fi : '2112' - 'To Tame A Land', etc...
songs influenced by historical events : 'Red Sector A' - 'The Trooper', etc...
have great bass players : Lee - Harris

The major differences:

different countries of origin : Canada - England
different type of lineup : trio - 5 piece dual guitars
different styles : Hard/Progressive Rock - Heavy Metal/Headbanging 

Rush has the same lineup since '74, Maiden has always had a revolving door
lineup (only Steve Harris and Dave Murray remain constants)

Maiden is basically washed up, Rush is still going strong.

I think the major difference between lyric styles is that Peart has a more
mature writing style than Harris or the other guys.  Growing up listening to
both bands, I definitely relate more to Rush songs now that I'm older.
Maiden songs were geared more towards that teen-age metal crowd.  I'm not
saying they were anything like those cheezy 80s metal bands (i.e. Quiet
Riot, Ratt).  Their songs have some good content, but they're written in a
simpler manner.

I still listen to the older Maiden albums every once in a while, but the
band has degraded since Adrian Smith left.  If anyone wants to check em out,
I recommend : Iron Maiden, Killers, Number Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind,
Powerslave , Somewhere In Time, Seventh Son ..., & Live After Death.  The
rest of stuff isn't worth listening to.

Anyway, that's just my opinion.

Hi.
I am kind of enjoying reading what Rush is played on everybody's stations.
So I wanted to relate this:
I have been a Rush fan since I was about 6 years old (and heard Tom Sawyer).
Having the severely limited finances of your typical grade school student,  I
had two Rush tapes.  One was Permanent Waves, the other was a tape of every
time I heard Rush on the radio.  As far as I remember, it had 
Tom Sawyer
The Spirit of Radio
Limelight
LakeSide Park
Freewill

So that is a list of Rush heard on the radio (by me) from 1980ish to 1985ish.
I wish I still had that tape.  But some bastard stole my tape collection about
5 years ago.   Hey, buddy, if you are on this list - you stink.

What are you smoking???  Steve Harris is one of the best bass players in
existence!  One of the things I like about Maiden is that you can actually
hear the bass distinctly, as opposed to some other metal bands.  They really
do bring the bass out in the mix.  Some songs to listen to to see what I
mean:  Phantom of the Opera, Killers, Innocent Exile, Hallowed Be Thy Name,
Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (the whole album!) just to name a few.  BTW
John Myung of Dream Theater lists Steve Harris and Geddy Lee as his primary
musical influences.  One can see why.

Hey, I *like* Metallica!  At least the early stuff when they were still a
thrash band.  Say up through ...And Justice For All.  The Black Album has
its moments too.

Not anonymous, Stephen Wright, I believe.

On the subject of Marillion:  Steve Hogarth does *not* suck, he's a great
singer, just different from Fish.  'Brave' is currently unavailable, but the
remastered version will be released in August, buy it or die trying.  If I
were to direct you to two quintessential Marillion CDs, they would be Brave
and Fugazi.  And, oh, BTW, the epic 'Grendel' can be had on the 'Script'
remaster bonus disc, along with 2 versions of MSH and other stuff.

Well, none of them play violin.  There is no credit to any other
musicians, which the boys do do when they use them.  And if you use a
pick(I don't) you can easily get that scraping sound along a string.  It
sounds like classic tube amp fuzz to me.  From, say, a Marshall stack
cranked up with a fuzz pedal?  Didn't Alex have that setup at one
point?  Any one else play a lot of guitar and recognize that sound? 
Clapton has done it, too, and probably a host of others.
And I'm not aware of any guitar synth that would ADD the sound of a bow
scraping to just one note, even now. 

question:  What is my spare copy of Visions worth?  Thinking of selling
it, depending.

In reference to Aaron Calder's post on the mighty color red and it's many
appearences in Rush albums and songs, I would like to point out that red is
one of the three primary colors.. take another look at ASOH for more
references. Also in response to the red not concerning communism... I am
sorry, it's does. Consider that Grace Under Pressure was written during the
Cold War and at the height of Communism. The references to the Cold War in
songs like "Distant Early Warning" and "Red Sector A" point to a world on
the brink of nuclear holocaust and totalitarianinsm.. The entire album point
to an uneasieness in the world. This is probably my favorite album because
Rush was not afraid to tackle these topics back in Orwell's 1984

Most underrated? COS.This album doesn't even get much respect from fans,
let alone the general public. Yet this is tha album that made Rush
decide to do it their own way, even though commercially, it failed. I
also thinks it's one of Alex's best efforts. Listen to the remastered
version. It is well deserving of wider recognition.

in answer to the Rush on the Radio thread, two stations out here in
SoCal USED to support the boys. 91X, back in the early 80's, used to
play FBN or Tom Sawyer along with Stairway to Heaven every hour on the
hour. KLOS 95.5 in L.A. used to have RushHour on Wednesday nights. They
played all requests and usually had some cool background info on the
songs. I don't know why, but we don't get Rush too regularly on the
radio anymore. And when we do, it's always Tom Sawyer, SOR, or
occasionally, FBN.

Ford introduced a prototype car that  never made it to production years
ago called the Ford Ghia Barchetta!  Wish I could get my hands on that
car (it was a red convertible two seater!).

I'm not sure that the statement is true but I do like both Rush and Iron 
Maiden.  There are a few Iron Maiden 'progressive' tracks that anyone new 
to Maiden should check out:

Alexander the Great from Somewhere in Time
The Clansman from Virtual XI - Steve Harris plays an accoustic bass to 
great effect on this.

I caught Iron Maiden in London on 16th May 1998 on their Virtual XI tour and 
would like to urge all US fans to check them out - great stuff and they 
were obviously having a ball.

I also caught Test For Echo in Toronto last summer and I think the two 
bands are chalk and cheese but both have the same commitment to and 
enjoyment in their respective types of music.  Perhaps that is why I like 
em both.

Any fan who wants more details about the Maiden gig, email me privately.
