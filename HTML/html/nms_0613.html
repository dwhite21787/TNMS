Hey everyone...

Ghost: I was a little offended at your criticism of what Trevor Rabin brought
to Yes as far as style.  He is an excellent guitarist, and a decent songwriter.
True, the style compared to stuff from earlier years changed to a more top-40
sound, but even Anderson himself said that they were ready to explore a
different type of music for a while(Union video).  Besides, Alan White's lack
of ability to play syncopated rythms like Bill Bruford hurt the band more, in
my opinion.  Have you ever heard him play Heart of the Sunrise or Roundabout?
CHEESE!  Finally, in relation to Rush, consider this:  How can anyone say that
Yes's music of the 80's compared to their earlier material changed from good
to bad, when I can't think of a better example of anyone doing this more than
Rush themselves?  Earlier works compared to Roll the Bones?  RTB is ok, but
it gets old quickly, i.e., Cheese.

<A NAME="613002">Subject: Closer to the Heart and my first time...</A>

  I'm catching up on past issues of the NMS (I'm on 517) and have something
to add about leaving out Closer to the Heart in future set lists. I first
saw the boyz at the Worcester Centrum (PoW tour) in Mass. That was around
85/86. Anyway, I am 90% sure that Closer to the Heart was NOT played
during that concert. (Btw, Marillion opened and they were great!) I
remember (I think?) that I left the concert completely blown away, but
remember my friend saying, "They didn't play CttH. There were no lighters."
Does anyone else remember this omission from the tour? I was not
the least bit disappointed by the fact that the song was left out.
  As for my first time...
  I'm not exactly sure when was the first time I heard Rush.
I think I was around 12 (~78) and I used to hang with a guy who played the
guitar. We would go down in his basement and he'd play to various
albums. One of the albums (I found out later) was AtWaS. I remember
clearly the transition from FBN to In the Mood. He played it over
and over again. Years later I wondered why the radio never played
the transition part, not knowing that one song ended and another began.
I also remember being blown away by 2112 on AtWaS. The song had a lot
of power for this 12 year-old (even if I couldn't understand the words!).
  But the great part of my story is that 10 years later, I was
introduced to Ayn Rand by a friend who claimed that objectivism was the
exact philosophy that I'd been trying to explain without much luck.
So, I read some Rand and had somewhat of a religious experience.
Then my friend said I should listen to 2112 by Rush! I had been listening
to the song for 10 years and I had never understood most of the words
because of the Gedster's melodious voice!! Needless to say I was blown away
by the connection. That part of my life formed a neat circle and I've been
a devoted Rush/Rand fan ever since!

I'm sure that many drummers out there have or have heard of a _Drum Techniques
of Rush_ (in case you haven't, it's a transcription of parts to 10-15 of their
songs).  Anyway, my question is:  does anyone have a copy of _More Drum
Techniques of Rush_?  I'm pretty sure it exists, because I saw a review of it
in Modern Drummer a while back, but haven't been able to find it anywhere.  If
anyone has any info, please contact me.  Also, if you have any transcriptions
you have done yourself, I would be interested in exchanging transcriptions with
you (I haven't transcribed very much, but I have done all of Entre Nous, along
with bits and pieces of other songs).

<A NAME="613004">Subject: **** RUSH CONVENTION UPDATE ****</A>

Yeah folks, I've made some calls, got some info, and got what appears to
be some nice tentative plans (even narrowed things down two ot three
hotels).

What:  The First NMS/Rush Convention

    Featuring: Rushour, performing a 3 hour set of Rush covers
               A picnic in Lakeside Park, with transportation to and from
                    Lakeside Park provided in the the cost of the convention.
               Possibly a guest speaker from Anthem (when I get firm Hotel
                    Commitment, I'll call them)
               Plus plenty of free time to meet some other Rush fans and
                    friends from the NMS, alt.music.rush, or #p/g! as well as
                    check out the sites in Toronto

When: Jun 25th-27th
Where: Toronto Canada, Hotel TBA
Who: Anyone who wants to come!

How Much:
I'm going over some figures, but it looks like things will operate this
way.  Anyone interesting in coming to the convention will pay
approximately 50 dollars as a non refundable deposit.  This deposit will
give me a firm head count.  I will then send a list of names who've paid
to the hotel, and individual hotel arrangements can be made according to
a group reduced rate. The hotels are looking to be approximately 60 US
dollars a night for a double. This may become even smaller.  Depending
on costs we may get specific event T-shirts and stuff made.

A couple of notes:

I should have a deposit deadline set for about mid April, more info to
follow.  Also, some hotels which can provide excellent accomodations
have a maximum number of people they can legally hold.  This is about
200 persons.

I know where Lakeside park is, BUT I've also been told that its very
small.  I've even been told that a picnic may not be possible.  ANYONE
who knows for sure PLEASE get a hold of me.

I'd like to thank the following people for helping me with suggestions,
support, and comments:
Jimmy Lang, Meg Jahnke, Thomas Beaudoin (hope I spelled that right),
Harold Lessure, Nick Mascari, Mike Sandoval, Mike Weintraub, Susie
Kretschmer, Glen Reed, Dave Warner, Jamie Buckley, Matt Phillips, Eric
Carlson, Pat Choy, Tony Reynolds, Lewis Beard and anyone else who showed
support

An *official announcement* will be made in a week or two, regarding
official deposits and stuff.

Any questions, comments, suggestions can be directed to me

|    It's true, some people really dislike Rush

And some people come around!

|First of all, one reason was already mentioned by someone- Geddy's
|voice.

In terms of pure singing ability, he ain't got much. But still,
there's just something that works.

|    Another reason seems to be the complex lyrics in most of the band's songs.

I don't see that point... I guess it you were used to "shooma shoom
shoom and a boom boom" it would be quite a challenge, but for music,
it's a desireable thing. After the first 200,000,000 love songs
written, people pretty much exhausted the alternatives. Insightful
social commentary and slightly deep lyrics are good. (Heavily deep
lyrics are good too, but we'll leave those to Jon Anderson. Neil is
actually quite down-to-earth!)

|bands with even slightly innovative
|lyrics are few and far between.  Listen to any Top 40 radio station
|and see.

Amen! (Not that there *are* top-40 -- that format is about gone. It's
more top rap and top oldies.)

|    The last reason I can think of, and one that I CAN relate to, is that
|maybe we've all driven some of our friends and acquaintances completely nuts
|from all the Rush that we play!

Nope, at least not me. I'd never heard them until I got the albums and
started hearing the songs. Now I recognize the rare Rush song on the
radio. (Time Stand Still, though I've heard a few others)

I got myself into Rush...

Hi kids,

   For those of you who have contacted me about "The Pass" and
_Profiled!_, the ENTIRE disc's transcription will be on the anon-ftp soon.
 Meg already has Part I and Part II will be in her mailbox by the time you
read this.  The section containing info about "The Pass" will be in Part
III, Neil Peart Q&A.  For those who aren't satisfied even by this, I will
make a copy of the disc for anyone who wants it.  Interested persons
contact me by personally by E-mail and we'll talk.  For the mean time,
here's the run down of the transcription:

		Part I:  Montage (Interviews and music)
		Part II:  Station Liners and Geddy Lee Q&A
		Part III:  Neil Peart Q&A
		Part IV:  Alex Lifeson Q&A

   Secondly, thanks to those of you who agreed with me about the solo in
"Between the Wheels."  I was beginning to feel alone!  'Cause I know my
roommate fully agrees with me.  There are too many good solos to go
through and pick a top 5 or 10.  I'd probably like it if Alex played a
harp!

   Welcome back to Peter Collins, by the way!

Hi all

   It's been said that Rush doesn't appear to much on TV. That's true
also here in Mexico. I have only seen 1 video (Roll the Bones), but
I have heard them a lot of times, specially in football games
(before-and-after the breaks) and that sort of things. And they use the
songs very frequently, and the latest album. As RTB arrived here they
began to use it. I heard in an one-hour program all of the songs from
RTB.

Having nothing more to say... Goodbye

Luis.

Aha!

	YOU CAN'T DANCE TO RUSH MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(Well, most of it,
anyway)  When I read that in the last issue it hit me like a rock.  I'm sure
that thought has crossed my mind before.  Danceability is the main reason(IMO)
that most of the pap that we hear becomes so popular.  The average person is
into pop music for dancing or foot-tapping purposes and really doesn't
appreciate musical intricacy or creativity, only easy-to-remember licks and
beats.  Note I said average, you non-musician Rush fans have obviously risen
above the pack.
	Someone mentioned the bassist from Dream Theater. . .about time!  I
have now seen them twice from the foot of the stage and of all of them(all
Berklee school of music types), the bassist John Myung impressed me the most.
Dream Theater is one of those bands that was created so that Rush fans
wouldn't have to annoy their roommates by playing Rush music all the time.
By the way, to anybody in SOUTH FLORIDA(or those interested in a road trip),
DT is playing the Edge in Ft. Lauderdale on Feb. 23.  Email me if you want to
go.  Trust me, it's worth it!

First, I'd like to list my personal favorite performances by Neil Peart
with Rush.  They are 1) Hemishperes [entire album], 2) Natural Science,
3) Freewill, 4)Red Barchetta, 5)Subdivisions, 6) Marathon, 7)Lock And Key,
8) Show Don't Tell, 9)Where's My Thing.  Secondly, as for the notes
regarding Journey's "Nickle and Dime", the author has no idea what time
signatures "Tom Sawyer" is performed in.  It is in 7/8 and 4/4, which is a
far cry from playing in 5 and 10!  I'm tired of people claiming Rush has
ripped off countless other artists.  Most of the other bands shouldn't
even be discussed in the same sentence as Rush.

Just my quick .02 cents.........

	I agree with (oh geez, I forgot who it was) who in TNMS 612
stated his anger about all this fuss with the compilation CD.  I agree
with him.  Lets just do it.  Ok?  Don't worry about all the legal
stuff.....I mean, If it is produced underground, sold at cost (which should
be fairly cheap) then everyone benefits, right?  I mean seriously, I would
be willing to go to jail for it, wouldn't you?  <waiting for nodding heads>

Ok, well anyway, that's what I have to say about the whole thing.

LETS GET STARTED ON IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank's for your support.  Look for me in an early issue next week.  I have
some things to say that will knock you over with excitment!

but for now, gotta study.  so bye...........

Dear fellow RUSH fans:

I'm new here so allow me to introduce myself. My name is Scott, and
I have been a RUSH fan for over 12 years.  (Sounds like I'm at a 12-step
meeting, reply: "Hi Scott")  My first album was FBN and I've been hooked
ever since.  I have seen them in concert 5 times, twice on the RTB
tour.  I was even fortunate enough to see Marillion open for them on
the HYF(?) tour, and Eric Johnson on the RTB tour.  I love all of the
their albums but have a real affection for FBN, COS, AFTK, MP and RTB.

I was really excited to find NMS and looked forward to reading it.
I must say I was rather disappointed to see all of the messages
about the boot CD.  This argument has been beat to death here so I
won't belabor it.  For the record, I disagree with the practice of
bootlegging whether it is done for profit or not.

 < In a related matter, Earl writes: >

I respond: Let's not be so hasty to count out Mickey Mouse, after all,
according to my brother, Geddy sounds like a singing mouse,  so
therefore Mickey might be a fan!

To Dan about the backstage passes:  To get one you would probably have
to win it from something like a promoting radio station, know someone
REAL WELL who is involved in the promotion (like a DJ) or someone who
is involved in the production of the show.  They don't hand many of
these out so if you get one, you are truly privileged.  You could
apply for a job as a roadie for their next tour, but I would imagine
even that would be hard to obtain.  Besides, you have to be willing to
work your butt off every day for the length of the tour and get paid
squat.

My cousin married a girl who knew someone who had contact with Rush.
He said he could get us backstage passes the next time Rush toured.
However, my cousin divorced her before I ever got a chance to use the
offer, so now my chances are blown.  You know, so many people get hurt
in a divorce.

Jay mentioned the "Tom Sawyer from the Rush MTV concert".  I believe
this is taken from the "Exit Stage Left" video (which I was watching
again tonight), if it's the same clip I've seen on MTV before. I am not
sure whether the video was made and then had rights sold to MTV, or if
it was a MTV production to begin with.  Now you may have seen a clip
from the "Grace Under Pressure" video which was a MTV concert, but Alex
had that weird haircut at the time and I don't remember ever seeing
"Tom Sawyer" as just a clip.  (I recorded that concert off MTV) If Alex
was wearing a red jacket and the background screen had a green spiral
thing happening on it, it was from "Exit Stage Left", otherwise it was
likely from "Grace Under Pressure".

Last note: Has anyone noticed at the end of "Cynus X-1", at the very end
as the music fads out, you can hear a thumping in the left channel,
like a heartbeat?  When I listen to this loud through headphones I
swear my heart beats to the rhythm of the thumping.  There is so much
energy built up at the end, that it feels like a shot of adrenaline.

You are correct sir!  Sort of :)  A quick listen to Hemispheres seems to
verify what you say, but let me requote part of the original question

->I am not a musician, and know little of time signitures, but does anyone
->know what time the different parts of cygnus X1 are in?  There's one part
                                               ^^
I was referring to Cygnus X-1 from AFTK.  Sorry that I didn't make that
clear.  I usually call that song "Cygnus" and the other one "Hemispheres:
Cygnus".

Now I'm confused about what the question really was :)  Well, *one* of us
answered the question!  Which one Roy?

Truth At Last! Mmmm. Let's just say someone called Graham (a friend and
fellow non-worker) here always follows up anybody saying "Why are we here?"
or "Why did X happen?" before I can. He does it for the irony. Maybe I play
Rush a *little* bit too much or something! Another thing. Even my parents
have finally realised that when I talk about 'rush' I'm not talking about
what a hurry I'm in.

Oh BTW for whoever keeps asking - we're here... for the beer. Ged backs me
up on this one.

Another UK voice added to the "hey, there ain't any Rush on TV/radio" shout.
I found out about Rush through the most bizarre set of circumstances. Enough
said.

Solos: Lerxt: Emotion Detector (esp. when he hits That Note)
              YYZ
	      Witch Hunt (ASOH) (excellent solo, love it)
       Dirk:  Show Don't Tell
              YYZ
       t'Prof:Rhythm Method (ok I'm being a bit obvious here!)
              Er, well other tracks with excellent drumming in
	       like Where's My Thing?, er, well all of them actually!!

As a few people have said, that last point shows ya what's so *difficult*
about this kind of thing!! So many (good) tracks to choose from...

Is there a Ludwig UK address? Do the US guys post a poster (good thing to do
with it really) over to the UK for Three Dollars!!!?

"enthusiastic ravings of the hardcore fans" eh Paul? No-one in particular
like! :-) Hey, politics? I think Alex must be a member of the Monster Raving
Loony Party (yes, there is one over here) and, of course,  a royalist.

Oo, Peter Collins produces the next album. Goody! I esp. like the production
on PoW and HYF, I think having Mr. Big back is a Good Thing. Yay!

>It's not just the bass either. All three of these musicians play
>their respective instruments as leads most of the time. ...

And this is called 'knowing your stuff'. This is totally right, and I wish
I'd said it. The thing is, it's not just that most other music isn't too
good, it is _actually_ the case that Rush are by far the _best_! (ahem,
IMHO, etc.)

And about Rush fan's age groups: I'm 19 and have been a fan since, er, 14 I
think. That's, erm, (grabs calculator) 5 years I fink, innit. I don't think
that RTB is actually more 'normalised' than anything since Signals, to be
honest. Then again, who knows? It's like me trying to guess the size of the
planet with my face against the floor (I'm talking about the difficulty of
being objective here).

I am glad that Alex's guitar work is being discussed lately.  I've
always considered him the most underrated part of RUSH.  Anyway, I
was wondering if anyone knows of a time when Alex cut loose on the
guitar.  I know he has done added parts within the context of songs
and Broon's Bane is phenominal,but does anyone know if he ever got
up and did a solo ala the rhythm method....

Hey, all you fellow Rush geeks:

	I hope that comment doesn't offend anyone... anyway, I can't
understand the reasons many of my friends don't like Rush. Some of them feel
that the "Roll the Bones" album is excellent, so I try to introduce them to
more classical Rush that diehard fans like us drool over. Most don't even
recognize that I'm playing Rush... they say: "Who is that idiot screeching
into the mike?" Oh, well...

	Rush music has a special quality about it which every Rush fan knows
is unique. Someone posted that it isn't danceable, which I think is one of
the music's better qualities. Instead of trying to dance to the same boring
beat every time, you "drift" into each song's special characteristic nature.
You feel the sentiments of the person who has lost their friend in
"Afterimage"... you feel the struggle in "Red Sector A"... (sorry that these
are all p/g songs, but that is the album I am listening to as I'm writing
this..). I'm glad that I've felt this through their music; it is too bad
others don't seem to capture this impression. Of course, that is what
creates this Rush "cult."

	And in response to Bob, who says that we play so much Rush that
people get sick of listening to it all day... I am probably the only person
on my hall who listens to them, so everyone gets a taste of it. Luckily my
taste in music is diverse, but a good portion of my radio's usage is Rush.
Actually, it isn't is bad as the guy across the hall, who plays U2 all
f**king day long at 10 on the dial. He also thinks that he is Eddie Van
Halen reincarnated, so he trys to imitate him on the guitar and gets
everyone pissed off. Or worse is my roommate, who only plays Top 40 (puke!).
I hate it so much that I just can't be in the same building when he turns it
on... well, enough of my platform speech...

As consciousness seeps out of the lizard-like portions of my brain, a faint
and distant memory stirs.  Back in 1983, when I was a wee one living in a
(believe it or not!!) rural part of New Jersey I had no access to cable TV.
(The roads in my town hadn't seen pavement in about 200 years either. Sadly,
all that rustic beauty has now been eaten by Subdivisions!)  A freind, who
moved to N. Carolina in 1984, hence the date of this experience, lived about
15 miles away, and had, fanfare and much pompt, MTV!!  Well, back at that time,
MTV had what were called Saturday (Friday?) Nite Concerts at 11:30pm.  The
point of all this is, on one weekend in December (?) of 1983, a bunch of us
adolescent cheese balls gathered around the warm glow of the TV screen and
worshipped at the bright images flashing by of our Canadian faves!!!  If only
we didn't have beta back then, if only I had taped the broadcast!!  Yes, there
was an hour long broadcast of a rush show (I believe) taped at MSG.

Since my brain has accumalated many battlescars between then and now, can any
one else remember (or relate to) this experience???

Finally, since everyone is talking about fave riffs-

No one has mentioned Vital Signs off of MP.  I think the  underlying rythym of
the song is absolutely flip drumming by Mr. Peart, and the punch followed by
the growling darting of the guitar of Mr. Lifeson is absolutely smash.

Well, that's all folks

Our main man the rush-mgr just posted news that the producer of the new
album will be Peter Collins.  Thank goodness for that!  I really liked the
"sound" on the PoW/HYF albums of which he was the producer.  Maybe he will
be able to steer The Boyz back into this sort of groove and out of the popie
sound of Presto/RTB.

Supposedly they are still in the writing process and have not started to
do any recording.  I, personally, was figuring on a spring/early-summer
release of the new material, however, after hearing this news it sounds like
it will be later than that.  So, is there any word out there on the street on
when this new album will be released?  Just courious.

Interesting point.  There is a fair amount of talk in the orchestral
world about who tunes to A 440 and who tunes to 442 or 444 Hz.  These
small changes of pitch are hardly noticable (especially if you're used
to Jr High School level bands which tune to A 435-457 + tax), but generally
speaking, sharp sounds better than flat.  Orchestras tend to tune a little
sharp for this reason, following the lead big-name symphonies like Chicago.

Historically, pitch has been gradually creeping up for centuries.  For
example, tuning forks from Mozart's time (mid-late 1700s) are found to be
almost a whole step flat to their current-day pitch.  Without assistance
of precise measuring instruments, pitch apparently drifted quite a bit.
Note that A# is all the way to 466.16Hz, so the difference from 440 to
444 is relatively small.  Note also that tubular bells produce enough off-
color harmonic frequencies to make this differnece quite hidden.

However, I'd be more inclined to believe the argument that he's using
the same tubular bells live that he uses in the recording, so I wouldn't
think this would account for the difference between studio and live.
Maybe after it was all recorded, they just thought it sounded better
a little faster.

Someone mentioned seing the Tom Sawyer video on MTV recently, with the credit
line indicating it was from an MTV concert. This is true, but only sort of,
because MTV showed the Exit Stage Left video as one of their Saturday night
concerts several years ago. That's where the Tom Sawyer video (live version)
came from. In their early years, MTV showed many commercially unreleased
concerts on Saturday night. Rush, unfortunately, was not one of them.
