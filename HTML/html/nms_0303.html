There was no NMS for Thursday, 8/1/91.

I have finally updated the tab directory as I said I would a couple of
days ago, and there is an updated CONTENTS file.  I am still waiting on
one of the files, but I'll leave the notation in the CONTENTS file and
just add that file to the directory when I get it.  (I guess some node
between here and Frank ate it instead of passing it along...)

Just a quik note to say that you can find the Buddy Rich Video at Music
stores with A good DRUM department within. So go and pick yourself up a
few copies(at a low, low 75 bucks!) So remember: Anyplace with a decent

Ahoy!  Been a while since I've spoken up and I caught myself in that kind of
mood again.  I'm a little behind in my reading so please excuse any 
redundancy-

1>  Just to offer a counter opinion:  I enjoy the bizzare conclusions drawn
    about Rushs lyrics.  (ie.  the 2112 thing).  It offers a good opertunity
    to broadin ones mind.  Besides-- people do it with Shakespeare all the
    time and get praised for it.  All Shakespeare knew was rhymed couplets,
    lets se him write in 5/8 | 6/8 | 5/8 | 6/8!!!

2>  Rap!?!  On the title track?!?  Is it possible to rap in 7/8?  That would
    be cool!  Lets see my friend fit _that_ one into his mix!

3>  Big Money vid on CD:  Yeah, I've heard of it.  My ex-girlfriend (<- women
    and Rush...) had it.  Never did see the video.  For $13 I'd say  "Hell,
    it looks cool".

4>  Is the 1001001 a dollar sign, the letter "eye" or the vertical bar used
    for pipelining?  (That may be obvious to some of you, but the terminal I
    am on (a Mac telneted to athena) makes the letters cap 'eye'  lower 'el'
    and the vert bar all look the same.)  If it is the 'eye' I would guess it
    is very intentional.  Think about it.  An android finding it's own
    individuality?

5>  I'm psyched for this album!  Song's sound great, instrumental, short
    production-- Wow!  Can't wait!

6>  10 non-Rush albums that I most often listen to (in no order):
   -King Crimson: 3 of a perfect pair
   -Concrete Blonde: Bloodletting
   -Nirvana: Bleach
   -Andy Summers: XYZ
   -Simon and Garfunkel: Hall of Fame Commemerative (esp disc 2)
   -The Police: Regatta de Blanc
   -The Police: Ghost in the Machine
   -Sting: Soul Cages
   -Yes: Yessongs
   -Weather Report: Heavy Weather (God, Jaco's death is a loss)
   -Primus:  Sailing the Seas of Cheese

Ok, you can count.  That's 11, but Primus is new so it's an up and coming.

That's enough for now-
Later,

  Greg

<A NAME="303004">Subject:      Master Neil</A>

Good day, let me tell you what I love about Neil's lyrics.  (Or you can page
down to the next article.)  They are different, cover more subjects than sex
and love like Firehouse, Slaughter, etc., and they have multiple meanings and
produce many different themes and subthemes.  Neil can say more than he is
literally saying; it depends on the listener.  Everytime I hear or see the
word "red" now, I think of at least a billion things at once.  One example
of taking lyrics to mean different things is the recent "Mission" discussion.
Here's what I think of these lines.

  "If their lives were exotic and strange,
   They would likely have gladly exchanged them
   For something a little more plain,
   Maybe something a little more sane."

I think this refers to those who have succeeded in terms of their goals, but
they're not the ones in the limelight.  If they were as overexposed to the
public as Madonna, they'd probably want to have a simpler life and compromise
that price of paradise.  My reasoning is that Neil wrote "If" as the first
word, inferring that their lives *aren't* exotic and strange.  Of course, Amy
and Gregg and many others have their own opinions and points.  Mine is just
another way of looking at it.  Neil's lyrics are something to discuss and
ponder, not to debate--that's why I like them so much.  There is usually no
one answer to the question "What does this mean?"  Sometimes (as someone else
recently mentioned) the analysis gets a little silly or trite, but some things
are (i.e., part IV of a trilogy).  That example is humorous and light, whereas
"Mission" is emotional and deep.  What a variety RUSH has!
Time to say goodbye.  "Hello Cleveland!"   Craig Rindy  mv012791@vm1.NoDak.edu

Bottom line (literally):  Neil Peart is the master.

Hi Folks,

        Just wanted to say a little something about the roaring fire that
seemed to be lit in the last two issues (although I actually may be
adding to it, which I regret).  I'm a fairly recent Rush fan (3yrs) and
even more recent subscriber (4mos), and there are (or at least were) a
lot of things about Rush that I didn't really know about.  I thinks it's
interesting for folks like me to have good outpouring of information
(whether based on fact, rumour, or personal opinion) on the NMS.  For
those who decide that some of the info is "far-fetched" or whatever,
I think its a lot better for all of us to ignore what we don't like or
aren't amused by and glean [$10 word] whatever info appeals to us. And
I think many people will agree with me when I say that info like
release dates, tours, and Rush parties is good stuff to absorb while
sifting through the matters of personal opinion.  For example, I
admire Rush more for other things than their philosophies, so I
usu. scroll through the Rand/Objectivist stuff.  If more people did this,
than the NMS would probably be less "flammable."  Of course, this also is
my opinion and can be laughed at as well.  But I hope that all the people
who disagree with each other should do so without "flamethrowers."

        Anyway, to be more festive.... I'd jump at the opportunity to
have a Rush party here in Baltimore.  I know tons of people here who
love Rush.  I, for one can't play anything, but my housemate plays
bass (& loves Rush) and another friend plays guitar (& loves Rush).

        If we could get a party going here after school starts, I'd
definitely attend as would many others I know (some on the list, some
not).

        Another thing.  I know this sounds wierd, but my housemate
asked me to pose this question (he's not on the  list).  He heard f
rom somewhere that Rush started releasing, some time back, copies of
the first album with Neil filling in some of Rutsey's parts on some
songs.  I've never heard this before and very much doubt that it's
true, but he insisted I post this question.  If someone can prove me
right and dampen this rumor before it gets too big, please do so.

        Also, (sorry if this is too long) when Rush _does_ come
around to the Balt/DC area soon, and if they'd like to go in a group-
type atmosphere, (and if they're fairly local) let me know.  Me and
a bunch of my afore-mentioned friends will undoubtedly get permission
for free use of a Univ. van to take to the shows.  Of course this is
a long time from now, but since I'm posting, what the hell.

[ We did something like this for the Presto show at the Capital Centre; 
  a group of us met out front about an hour before the show and just 
  chewed the fat for a while.  Good luck with the next show & coordination!
                                                                 :rush-mgr ]

        Sorry, but I have to say something about these hell-born
Ecopaks.  I happen to be an avid recycler, but there are alternatives to
both the Ecopaks and longboxes.  Like someone mentioned earlier,
shrink-wrapped jewel boxes have little waste, are sturdy, are
replaceable (while still maintaing cover art).  In Balto., there's a
store called An Die Musik which sells them that way, and they say it saves
them much more space and is environmentally sound also.  In short,
longboxes suck, and Ecopaks suck too.

        Fortunately, I've run out of things to say. So be excellent to
each other. (Take Bill & Ted to heart...they know what life's about.)

P.S.  Most listened-to Rush albums:
        1. Permanent Waves
        2. A Farewell to Kings
        3. Hemispheres
        4. Moving Pictures
        5. Chronicles

      Most listened-to non-Rush albums:
        1. Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here
        2. Van Halen - 1984
        3. Yes - 90125
        4. Queen - Greatest Hits
        5. Black Sabbath - Heaven & Hell
        6. Steve Miller - Greatest Hits

        Sorry, but I realized I had just one more thing to say.  IMO,
we should all the give the rush-mgr his due.  As far as I've been on the
list, he's been fairly objective and non-biased about everything.  But,
when he has an opinion about anything, he has as much right to post it as
any of us do. And, BTW, that last one, was in my opinion was fairly
justified.

        So keep up the good work, rush-mgr; hope to see you at the
forthcoming Balt/DC party (if such a party occurs).

After a quick glance at the crossword, I notice that the numbers across the top
of the crossword have been jumbled.  The numbers should read 1 thru 31, to help
with the placcement of the clues.  The answers will be available sometime after
the 15th, which is when the tourbook comes out of storage back at school, unless
someone else has the answers and wants to type them in.  Good Luck!

[ This is from a later post which got saved separately ]

First, ignore my earlier post about the numbers, that was just my telecomm
program messing with me.  Second, Cam Abrams (did I spell that right?) 
pointed out an error.  The "#" at (26, 8) (down, across) should not be there.
This allows clue 61 down to fit (I think, my printer is disconnected for two
weeks, so I can't check for sure)  If any other errors come up, please let
me know my e-mail, otherwise, have fun!

Erik

[ And another post from Erik .... ]

   In clue 115 Across, the answer is 4 letters long, not 8.

   In clue 104 Down, remove the word "what", from the clue.

   Hopefully, there are not any more errors, but this is unlikely!

Hi everybody,

Just a question that has been gnawing away at my gut, for sometime now.
Does anybody see a "contradiction" here?

       "All puffed up with vanity
        We see what we want to see

        Would  someone tell me what happened did Neil read the NMS??
  Did he like it ?  Did he Flame it?  What did he think? How did he get a
hold of it?   PLEASE TELL ME!!!

[ The original post was in NMS #5, available at both the ftp site and the
  e-mail server (I assume).  In a nutshell, Neil was getting a tour of a
  computer facility by a list member, and they were explaining about 
  computer networks, news, mailing lists, and the like.  Neil had commented
  that it was a potential time-waster.  Then Neil was shown the NMS, but the
  issue he saw was one where we were discussing hidden symbols in album
  covers.  In particular, the picture of Neil on Presto shows his watch set
  to 9:12, which if it were PM would be 21:12 in military/computer time.
  When he saw that level of analyzing, he remarked "Get a life!"
                                                                 :rush-mgr ]

    Anyway......   I was really bothered that a fellow Rush fan was
intimidated enough to unsubscribe.  Anyone can write what they damn well
please and if you have a problem with it then SHRUGG IT OFF!!!  We don,t
need this here!   It is a place to talk about Rush   not make someone
less informed feel like an idiot!!!

[ For the record, the intimidated didn't unsubscribe, the intimidatOR did.

It's interesting you ask this question.  I went to the Phoenix, AZ GuP
concert in June '84, and surprisingly enough, there was a different twist
to the drum solo.  They started with Red Lenses, and part of the way
through began the solo.  Afterward, they finished off the last half of YYZ.
It was quite a change of pace.  Like you, I do hope they launch the solo
from another song to give it more variety.

>>I disagree.

David disagrees with me much less (in general) than he thinks.
Our disagreement lies mainly in the reference of the word _they_
in the last verse. In fact, I agree with his immortal art
angle(see below), this is part of what I was trying to get at
when I mentioned 'natures' of people who are great artists.
I was speaking in terms of success(see below) mainly because
that was the context in which Amy was interpreting things.
I however tend to believe that Neil knows the conventions or
English and would not violate them when he could easily have
avoided it (see my original posting for the English bit).

David argues

>Okay, now let's see if I can explain why.  (Batten down the
>hatches, there's a storm coming up...)
>
>First off, I think the type of 'mission' talked about in the song
>is more than mere success.  Rush is certainly successful, but
>Neil's lyrics talk about viewing these great works of art almost
>as a pupil or disciple, rather than as an equal... consider the
>lyric "I wish I had that instinct... I wish I had that drive."

Yes, the narrator views things from the point of
view of someone who is not a master _at creating those
things which he is appreciating_. No one is a master in
everything, however.

>If Neil doesn't feel he has 'that kind' of drive, then he's
>talking about only the very greatest artists history has to
>offer... people like Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky.  (Excuse the
>preponderance of musical names - I'm not up to speed on great
>architects. B-)  Often these kinds of artists were so consumed by
>their missions as to let everything else in their lives slide...
>they're the kind of people who died young and destitute because

I think that David fails here  to distinguish between narrator
and author in his interpretation. Note that it was the same move
made by Rolling Stone's Mr. Mack in his 'review' of 'Presto' (which
discussed the lyrics to 'Mission' for some strange reason)
trying to argue that Rush were incompetent artists. Just because
there is an 'I' in the song from the narrator's point of view
doesn't mean it's _Neil_ narrating! For example, look at Red
Barchetta. Since this is not a record of an historical event
(as ''Countdown'' is) I see know reason why the narrator can't be
distinct from Neil (maybe he's 'one without it!').

He goes on to a part which supports the 'immortal art'
angle:

>all they could ever think about was their obsession... but that
>selfsame obsession is what made their art immortal.  (Consider
>the lyrics "I gaze at their FEVERISH pictures... the secrets
>that set them apart" and "In the GRIP of a nameless possession,
>SLAVE to the drive of OBSESSION".)

Gee, sounds alot like Neil dropping out of school at 16 (I believe
it was 16) and going off to London to become a great drummer and
to make immortal art!! Looking at ''Grand Designs'' I don't
get the impression that the band has a low opinion of its
work. Maybe David is mixing up what I wrote with what Amy wrote
(though I think he also misses the relevance of her point of
view),

>Now, the whole song up to the last verse (and even there, in my
>opinion) is obviously referring to these people with a mission.
>"I hear THEIR passionate music"... "I feel the powerful visions
>THEIR fires made alive"... "I walk through THEIR beautiful
>buildings", and so forth.  All through the rest of the song the
>word "they" is referring to these mysterious people who were
>endowed with an obsessive mission.>

The word 'they' is used because more than one craftsman (artist)
is being talked about in the song, what's the big deal?
Again, Dave doesn't see my point about the conventions of English.
Just because one talks about a particular person for the first
twenty-five minutes of a half-hour conversation using the pronoun
'she' doesn't mean that 'she' occurring in the last five minutes
can't refer to a _different_ person if after the first 25 mins
the speaker then mentions another name and uses 'she' afterward.
Get the idea?

>Now reread the last verse, continuing to interpret "they" in the
>same way (i.e., as applying to those with a mission):>

     it's cold comfort
     for the ones without it
     to know how they struggled
     how they suffered about it
     if their lives were exotic and strange
     they would likely have gladly exchanged them
     for something a little more plain
     maybe something a little more sane

>In this light, here's the meaning I get from it:

>     people who badly want a mission but don't have one
>     are unlikely to find much comfort in the thought that
>     those endowed with that flame of obsession often had
>     very difficult lives nonetheless (and in fact many
>     might have preferred not to have had the obsession at
>     all, even at the cost of their fame... i.e., they were
>     dragged along, slaves to their mission, rather than
>     choosing the path willingly).

This I find really stretches it. Why then even bring up the
ones without it? Reading this according to the
conventions of English usage (i.e. in such a way that the 'they'
refers to 'the ones without it') it makes perfect sense, meaning:
it's small comfort to those who can't achieve their dreams
that they struggled and suffered trying to do so and just failed.

>     And I think that the "immortal art" angle
>enriches the song that much more: whenever I listen to "Mission"
>(which is often), in my mind are conjured images of Mozart lying
>feverish and dying on his bed, desperately attempting to finish
>the Requiem Mass before it's too late... I see images of young
>Piotr Tchaikovsky running to his mother in the middle of the
>night, crying that he "couldn't make the music in his head stop".
>Those are images that move me both to envy and to pity... which
>is exactly what I believe the third verse of "Mission" is about.

I don't see any pity in the song at all. As a final arbiter I
suggest listening to the tone of Geddy's voice when he sings
this. In it one finds a sympathy most appropriate for ones who
have failed. I think that focussing too much on musicians
warps the interpretation of the song (leading one to think
that it is irrelevant to the band since if the narrator is
Neil then he must be talking only about super-geniuses like
Mozart, etc.). I think there is a place in the song for
minor geniuses like Neil too!!

As a nice cross-reference check out ''Middletown Dreams''...

A few things have gone through my mind in the last few days, so I
figured that I would ask-

(Remember, the ONLY stupid question is the one that isn't asked, right
Rush-mgr?)

1)  In "The Big Money" video, the "car" that floats around throughout
the video has the license plate "Mr. Big"    Is it possible that this
has any correlation whatsoever to the fact that the Boyz toured with Mr.
Big for Presto?  Just wondering...

2)  In Tom Sawyer, WHY does Geddy say "The River"  ??  It really doesn't
seem to have much connection with the song, does it?

3)  I agree with whoever it was (sorry can't remember the name)  saying
that they listen to Rush for the Music, and aren't overly-involved with
reading Ayn Rand, interpreting, etc.

[ That was me...  :-)                                           :rush-mgr ]

4)  What's with the new "trend"  of adding a list to the end of your
post stating what your favorite albums are?  Who started this trend?
And why?  (I happen to like reading who likes what - it's interesting.)

Oh, well.  That's all for now...

<A NAME="303015">Subject: rap ...one last time ....i promise</A>

Most everyone is probably tired of the rap discussion,
but let me get this out cause I may be the one who started
it all.

One thing: I stand corrected. Someone pointed out that it was
RUSH after all doing this, so it was bound to be good. I agree.
Given the humongous precedent of 2112, Farewell, et al, they
probably cannot make a bad song.

Next thing: I did not mean to offend any of the rap fans out
there. If I remember correctly I think I said "opera and rap
don't interest me". I don't THINK that implies that it is
worthless, just uninteresting.

What?another thing: I forgot about Faith's _Epic_. Damn good
song. I guess that proves that rap and rock can mix. I don't
know...I just have this mind set of Vanilla Ice saying something
as intelligent as "ya know whut I'm sayin", whenever I think of
rap music.

Rush thing: (Where's my thing?) I can't believe I have to wait
another MONTH before new Rush. Oh well, you just can't have every
DAMN thing! I'm psyched today though. My wife has "girls night out"
plans so I gets to play Rush REALLY LOUD. She is not a Rush fan. Don't
ask me why I married her, it was a moment of weakness.

Hi Fellow Fans,

I'm writing in defense of Neil's reaction to the NMS. We all know
that he saw a rather bad version. But his reaction still seems a
bit strong to some. I think that this is just his disposition in
terms of immediate reactions. I'm sure that if he read several
issues and thought it over, he wouldn't be so averse to the idea.
I know some of his reactions to people's question in the Backstage
Club and in some interviews have a similar tone to that reported in
NMS#05, and they are usually a result of running into something
that he's just sick of dealing with, like the face of his watch
in photos, what his personal preferences are, etc. These sorts
of interests in fans really tend to bug him (it seems to me)
and he's run into them for along time now (especially in Britain
as I gather), so he's just reacting like anyone would, it seems
to me.

Gregg

You know you're a Rush fan when: Every time you find yourself in
a public elevator alone you break into an air-drum version of the

<A NAME="303017">Subject: Rappers and Rush</A>
Date: Thu, 1 Aug 91 9:37:02 EDT

  In the time I've subscribed to the Rush digest, the Rap debate surfaces every
few weeks.  The first time I was involved, it all started when someone bitched
about a rap cover of Tom Sawyer (oh heavens!).  Now as rumor has it, Rush has
actually integrated a little rap into a new song.

  I've pretty much given up singing the praises of rap on the Rush list, since
everyone is entitled to their opinion and misconceptions are notoriously
difficult to eliminate.  Since this debate has come up again, I figured I'd
just toss in a bone to gnaw:  lots of rappers REALLY get into Rush.

  I'm sure everyone likes Rush for their own reasons, but I suspect Neil's
sense of rhythm hits home with people who are already very clever when it comes
to rhythm.  A friend of mine in LA has a couple of brothers who are dyed-in-
the-wool rappers, out on the streets trying to get a recording contract.  These
dudes are amazing, they'll just integrate rap into their everyday speech or
take something you've written and 'rappetize' it.  Great fun, let me tell you.
Anyway, we were sitting around one night just BSing and partying (and listening
to everyone's new tunes), when these guys start clamoring for Rush.  "Tom
Sawyer, man I need to hear Tom Sawyer."  When I talked to them about it, they
said Rush is a big influence for them as well as other rappers they deal with.

  So those of you who spend lots of time explaining why rap sucks, it can't be
music, blah blah blah, think about the effect one of YOUR favorite bands has
had on the rap culture.  Rappers are open to Rush, looks like Rush is open to
rap, now it's time for Rush fans to open up as well.  At least check out the
Public Enemy/Anthrax duo remake of "Bring The Noise."

This may be a premature thing to bring up, but didn't King Crimson
do a song called "Neurotica" on their album _Beat_ in i think '84-ish?

I am not a huge king crimson fan although i have never really devoted
serious listening time to them (an unfortunate curse of being a total
rush-head) and i know Bill Bruford is their drummer, so maybe i'll give
them a try sometime...anyway, i know there ARE some major KC fans out
there...any of you familiar with their "Neurotica"?  ( i *read* about this;
i didn't hear about it directly from KC fan myself, so i literally
no nothing else about this song--it just kind of sparked my interest...)

(For those of you who may not know what i'm talking about, "Neurotica" is
listed as the last(?) track on _Roll the Bones_...)

at any rate, hopefully some input from you KC fans will spark, or maybe not
spark, a comparison discussion, and maybe sell some more KC records....

Ok, again I'm responding to several topics:

The prices I talked about a few issues ago--ASOH for $1.99, older rush
for about $6.99--are for CASSETTEs.  Apparently there was some confusion
about that.

Rap?  Come on, don't you people trust Rush's taste in music?  Think of the
standard rap beat, then imagine what Neil could do with it.  It's just a new
area that they want to experiment with--don't complain until you've heard
it (a bit over a month from now)

Someone asked where to find "Gonna Roll the Bones".  From TNMS I had a
list of 3 books that had it.  Let's see...  Ahh, hear 'tis:

 -- Dangerous Visions.  Harlan Ellison, ed.
 -- Hugo Winners vol. 2.  Isaac Asimov, ed.
 -- The Best of the Nebulas.  Ben Bova, ed.

(wow, perfect justification.  what luck...)

Anyways, I found Best of the Nebulas first, and read it in there.  It has
some other great stuff in it.  BTW, you know you're a Rush fan when you
read Dragonrider (it's in there) and when it mentions a "red star", you can
only picture it as the Red Star of the Solar Federation.

Hi people,

It's been quite awhile since I posted, so I thought I'd put in my two cents.
Anyway,  I have seen in the FAQL that Neil's reaction to the NMS was in
issue #5.  I don't have it.  I also don't have access to ftp sites.  Would
someone please be kind enough to let me know what it was?  Thanks much.

Second:  As far as rap, I think it would be funny if Rush sampled a bunch
of rap songs and made them into a real song ;-)  Rather ironic, wouldn't
you think?

Third:  Yes, I'm still working on the Rush tabs.  I just bought a house
and I now have a terminal at home, so things will go a lot quicker.
Please forgive my delay, Frank.

See everyone later...

Dear Rush fans,

   I only started reading TNMS a few weeks ago, and I must say I was
rejoicing for days when I found out Rush is putting out another album!
I've learned a lot these first few weeks - thanks, everyone!

   I'm not sure if this is of any importance, but it looks like "Roll
the Bones" contains the first two song titles by Rush using the
first and second person: "Where's My thing?" and "You Bet Your Life".
They haven't done that since "Entre Nous" (PW), What You're Doing
(Rush) and Finding My Way (Rush) - at least on the albums I know -
after being very thoughtful but impersonal through the '80's, I thought
this was an interesting change of direction.

   On the subject of the Geddy rap, well... I *LOVE* Geddy's voice
more than anyone else I know - cheers to all you who said the same -
but I'm not so sure he's fit for rap.  For all the reasons I can't
wait for the new album, I'm dying to find out what "Roll the Bones"
is like - I, er, just don't hope HE's rapping.  Don't flame me,
its an opinion.  :-)
