I have updated the list of dates for the Roll The Bones tour in the file
at the anonymous ftp site at Syrinx.  The filename is:

    rush/special/rtb.tour.dates

This is by no means complete, but it's something.  Here is the last part
of it, containing all shows mentioned in today's NMS:

------------------------------ cut here ------------------------------

May 21 Memphis, TN, Mid-South Coliseum
May 23 Kansas City, MO Kemper Arena
May 24 Wichita, KS Kansas Coliseum
May 25 Oklahoma City, OK Myriad Arena
May 27 Denver, CO Fiddler's Green Amph.

June 19 Meadowlands Arena, E. Rutherford, NJ
June 23 Dayton, OH
June 24 Deer Creek, Noblesville, IN

------------------------------ cut here ------------------------------

Sorry for the lack of NMS this week, it's been brutal.  There will be two
issues today to catch up.

I've had enough of posts about Neil's bandanna & cancer rumours.  No more,
please!!!

Please remember to keep your .signature files short!  I'd prefer them to
be around five lines at most...  Long sigs may be blasted at my discretion.

I spotted at least two MST3000 quotes in todays submissions (across the two
issues today)!

theposter from the 'Presto' tour. I must say this is an excellent poster of

Also, I remember years back a video for the song 'Take Off'. Does anyone out

Hello Out There,
        I agree, Alex Lifeson is really underrated as a guitarist and a
musician.  He's not a "flashy" player, but his sound is the color of all
of Rush's songs.  I really like the jangly, "Lerxst" sound he's
developed in the last two albums.  Enough said.

1) In the last issue, somebody asked if "Avaliable Light" had ever
been performed live. The answer, no, it hasn't. Ever. Too bad, as
this is my favorite song off _Presto_

2) Here's my review of the new live Rush CD, "The Fly"

         cover art: Weird as hell! A big, fuzzy housefly on a purple
background. A couple nice color pix inside the liner. On the back,
where the setlist is shown, "Ghost of a Chance" is called "Ghost
of Dance." Pretty funny, huh? The disc itself is beautiful, almost
a picture disc, it is covered with purple and blue roses!

         oh, yeah, the music. Obviously audience-recored, it is still
pretty good, though it is in stereo in name only. The bass gets over-recorded
in some areas, but on the treble side, there is no hiss (CDs are
good for something, right?) Some fade out occurs during "Force Ten"
and again during the beginning of "Bravado" but otherwise the recording
is pretty solid. Overall, it sounds sort of tinny, hollow, and audience-
recorded,
but overall, it is worth picking up, especially if you have not heard
Rush on this tour. (or even if you have and want to hear them again!)
I paid $35 for my copy.

Hello Out There,
        I remeber reading about the CARESS OF STEEL cover in VISIONS,
the biography by that Banaciewicz fellow.  Apparently the artwork was
originally much brighter, but for some reason turned out dark when it was
reproduced on the album cover.  The central figure is a man (somewhat
reminiscent of the "Father Time" figure that Led Zeppelin used) whom I
think is a representation of The Necromancer.  I have always suspected
that The Necromancer was a Tolkein reference, but who can be sure when
it comes to Neil Peart's lyrics?  Anyway, I'm not sure if I have the
right answer, so you might want to check out VISIONS.

Hey there NMSer's!
  Although I decided to dodge the heated and thoroughly significant debates
over the great dog/submarine controversy of 1991, the great bandana schism of
March and now the impending bone/brain/whatever cancer summit of April, I
couldn't resist helping Neil fans in ned of a poster! (sarcasm coming though
alright
? :)) Anyhow the address is :

I got mine a couple days ago..it's only about 16'' by 20 '' but its a great
photo. As previously posted it comes with a cool ludwig sticker, and order
forms for ludwig clothes and some other posters (including Neil's presto one).
It's only 3 bucks so I'd say its worth the cash.
Also does anyone have the date and ticket sale date for either Rush's show
at Merriweather post this summer or a
Spinal Tap show near D.C. ? Any info
would be appreciated!

First of all I'd like to say thank you to who ever came up with this
listing, I most probably couldn't have seen rush this time around with
out TNMS.  Now to my point, I have seen it discussed in various forms
reasons why Rush won't play there older material in concert.  Well I seem
to recall, and maybe some guitar players out there can give some input
an articule in guitar magazine around the time of P/G that interviewed
Neil (??? Don't ask me why???), anyway during that article I believe
Neil said that he did n't like to play much of there material from before
1980 because he said it was "childish"!!!!  While I love alot of there
older stuff, on thinking about it I had to agree.  There message and music
have all changed since those early days and some may say for the worst,
but I guess that's the reason that they are so unwilling to play much of
there older material, They just Don't like as much as there new stuff,
Can someone find that article, It may not have been in there, But I Don't
know,

Fellow Rushians,

About two or three years ago, I turned on my radio (gasp!) and heard a really,
really cool Rush song, filled with Geddy's high-pitched voice... But when
_Presto_ (the new album at the time) came out, this way-cool song wasn't on it.
The reason, of course, was that it WASN'T A RUSH SONG!!!!!  It was a song by a
band (I *think* from Chicago) called Siren, and the song was called "All is
Forgiven"...  The funny part is that the vocalist is a female (hehehe), with
the vocal range of Geddy...

Well, the band (Siren) released this one album, and changed their name (to
something like Red Siren), and then disappeared... I owned their album for the
briefest of times, and it was truly Rush-inspired (a la Queensryche and Fates
Warning) on PolyGram (coincidence???) records....

Does anyone know what happened to them?  Not only can I find their debut CD
anymore, I can't find anything by them...  Anyone know anything???

Mucho gracias, mein froinds...

Well I have stumbled across some more tour dates for the summer tour so here
goes:

May 23 Kansas City, MO Kemper Arena
May 24 Wichita, KS Kansas Coliseum
May 25 Oklahoma City, OK Myriad Arena
As posted 4/7 May 27 Denver, CO Fiddler's Green Amph.

Like usual I will reiterate my usual disclaimer, this info is accurate to the
best of my knowledge and as far as I know, none of the these dates have gone
on sale yet.  Check your radio stations, but don't be disappointed if they do
NOT know yet....

And now a bit of troubling tour news, in speaking to a friend of mine who
supplies me with information regarding the boyz, there now will NOT be a
date at Jones Beach.  Apparently, they have decided not to play any outdoor
venues which do not have a covering over at least part of the amphitheatre.
Jones Beach is completely open and they feel that if it rains they would
have to cancel and they do not want to do that.  So as of now, no Jones
Beach.  I will keep you all posted.

However, Meadowlands is definitely happpening although, I'm not sure when tix
go on sale.  Who knows, maybe they'll play Garden State Arts Center instead
of Jones Beach.

Any questions about the above can be emailed directly to me.

Later.

Hello Everyone (sounding like Karl Haas)

I picked up the previously mentioned recent Terry Brown/Hugh Syme
project (oh yeah, there were also musicians!) with the band Fates
Warning. The album is called `Parallels' and is not half bad I must
say. Not a bad 1st (?) album. I recommend it to anyone who is comfortable
with `heavy metal`-style vocals (they're growing on me). The final
track is the closest thing to CoS I've heard, and the opening track
sounds like the boys playing drunk (wouldn't be too bad, would it?),
quite catchy. This band seems to have accumulated quite a range of
influences, which I take as a good sign for their future. I hear
some Rush, Saga, and Kansas influence. Hugh Syme has done a nice
cover in the same style as that for PoW. So if you see it cheap
or are looking for something to buy, give it a try...

	Howdy all, This posting is just in addition to the posting about the
anti-rock music series shown on cable.  I have seen several of these, the
first was about two years ago, that my mother, and younger brother (who I got
into Rush at age 9) and I watched mainly for fun.  Lately, I have noticed that
it comes on about once a week, sometimes I catch it, and I watch it primarily
as entertainment, I enjoy the ignorant, non thinking fools who believe this
stuff.

	However, I have seen the attack (let's face that's what it is) on
Rush and Zeppelin.  Their arguement is that when Rush recorded `Anthem', they
backmasked the lyrics so that there would be a satanic message if you played
the record backwards (which everyone does with their new albums ;). )

	Though it's not a Rush topic, they also attacked Van Halen and Heuy
Lewis and the news.  Heuy Lewis, have you nothing better to do with your time?
They said that the song `Jacob's Ladder' (hmmm.) is anti-god because it says
that people make their own choices and are by no means perfect (there tied it
in with Neil's objectivist ideology). These people must be braindead, Heuy is
Mr. Cleancut American, not some rebel rocker.

	Anyway, the long, sad story behind all this is the shows serve no
purpose aside from entertainment value only.  Don't take them seriously,
because the same people that buy them are the same people that give to
televangelists.  Can you see it now, convert Geddy or god will kill him!
Ooohhh, my head.   Enough of this sillyness, GET OUT THERE AND ROCK!  AND ROLL
THE BONES!!

	Frank.

This makes so sense. If we are Rush fans, what are we missing?
Personally, I _LIKE_ the fact that Rush is not some glamour cheese
band like Guns 'n' Roses or Firehouse. For one, I like to think of
being a Rush fan like being a member of a secret club. WE know what
Rush is all about and that they are the best thing to happen to Rock
and Roll ever and on and on and on. So what if the high schools fluff
chicks havent even heard of them?? I say,"GOOD!!".

MAKE others listen to the band??? Be blesses by their visions? What

My passion is deeply satisfied at a live Rush show with 10000 screaming

I have one small problem.... I have no idea where Deer Creek is other
than that it is "near" Indianapolis.  I go to school at Purdue and
know how to get to Indy via Rt65.  Anyone who can help me please e-mail
me VERY soon. (My account will disappear when school ends!!!)

                                                Thanks
"I believe there's a ghost of a chance" (that I will find out how to
   get to this concert that I have tickets for!!)

such as spanish, french, japenese etc//////

also where could i order a " presto cover album poster " for my wall in my
bedroom?

about the bandanna controverse going on, my speculation is that neil wears
the headband to connect with the primal forces of nature, between and beyond
to reach nirvana when he's banging away at his drum kit..................

Hey out there,
   Does anyone know any summer dates for Philadelphia yet!
If anyone finds out please post or e-mail me immediately. I saw
the boyz in Cleveland last December and I sure can't wait another
two or three years to see them again. Thanks.

I will finally be graduating and moving to Phoenix, and it would be
great to see Rush at Desert Sky. However, I have heard that tickets go
on sale April 18th, and unfortunately, I will still be in Boston. Is
there any kind soul in the area who could obtain a ticket for me? It
would certainly be a nice welcome to the area, that's for sure. I
missed the Roll The Bones concert in Worcester (I haven't missed them
since Moving Pictures), and would love to see them on this tour! I'll
be in Phoenix at the end of April and could easily re-imburse someone
at that time. Thanks.

Ok.
   I have been dying for someone to ask what it was but no one else seems to
be curious (unless for some reason I missed it):  What was Neil wearing on top
of his head when he stood on his stool?  He had some sort of a hat on,
something like a marching band "shake-o".  He wore it for a few songs and we
didn't have good enough seats to actually make out what it was.  Did he do this
just for this concert it New Haven?   BTW, this is a minor question, but not
to be looked at like the bandana.  I am just curious as to what it was not why
he was wearing it.

Another thing:  When someone decides to stop their subscription of NMS, that
is almost comprehendable.  I, too, don't always have time for the NMS but the
people that keep sending it to the wrong address is really getting annoying.
I think that every time someone decides to POST that they don't want to get
the NMS anymore, just send thousands of annoying FLAMES to them.  That will
make everyone remember....

    Well, this is my first post to the National Midnight Star, and I'm
so skeptical about my ability to actually get this there that I'm not
going to take it too seriously, but I thought that a little
illumination might be appreciated on the CD Boot subject, so people can
stop asking.  Anyway, there might be some innaccuracies, and if so,
please let me know, but I'm fairly sure about all of them...
    Here's a list...

          Fly In the Night      Toronto  11/29/77  55 min
          Rushian Roulette      Pink Pop  6/4/79   50 min
          Red Barchetta         From Exit...Video  ?? min
          Red Stars of the S.F. From Exit...Video  55 min
          Enemys Within and...  From GUP Video     ?? min
          Temples of Syrinx     From GUP Video     45 min
          Currently En Vogue    From GUP Video     ?? min
          Life Under Pressure   From GUP Video     ?? min
          The Fly               Madison S.G 12/7/91 69 min
      2CD Rush Live 1+2         Rosemont 11/1/91   100 min

   And I'm absolutely sure that I've missed some of the Grace Under
Pressure boots...I don't have my lists here right now, or I'd be able
to tell, but the bottom line is, the first two and the last two are the
*ONLY* CD boots that have not been officially released in some form.
You can take your copy of the videos and dub them off onto tape and get
the others.  CD's can be convienient and I'm not saying don't buy any,
but be careful what you buy because the five above are all the same
show...imagine how awful it would be to buy all the Grace CD's to find
out they were all the same material.  Also choose carefully because
some (especially in the GUP material) discs contain more than others,
for instance, Temples of Syrinx doesn't have -The Weapon- while
Currently En Vogue does.  By the way, The Fly is a very good audience
tape as is Rush Live 1+2.  Pink Pop is the best sounding, while Fly in
the Night takes last, although it does contain -Cinderella Man-.  Any
further discussion (Sorry Dave) can be taken care of through email.  I
hope this helps.

        The complete tab to these and all other songs from Presto and RTB
are in the guitar books that accompany the albums.  Just go to your local
music store that has alot of guitsr sheet music and they should have them
or should be able to order them. There is also a P/g guitar book.  All
three are great and include tab and solos.

        My question is if anyone knows if the RUSH Complete songbooks are
printed in tab.  I want some of the earlier material in tab and I can't
seem to find it!!!   If anyone can help...   PLEASE EMAIL ME!!!!!!!

<A NAME="462026">Subject: Rushwords, y muchas gracias</A>

A flick of the Bic and a tip of the hat to David C. Copley, for
doing (and then reporting to TNMS!) the fascinating analysis of
how many times certain words appear in Rush lyrics. Others may
flame, but I thought it was one of the best examples I've seen
yet of virtually-useless-but-fun information. (Now, if Mr. Copley
would crank up his remarkable initiative an order of magnitude
further and do a full-blown concordance, I'll bet he could even
make some money from some of us freaks.) I haven't been so
impressed with anything connected with Utah since I last hiked to
Delicate Arch.

And I thought *I* was weird for calculating the average length of
a Rush song. (No, I won't post it. Too much depends on what one
defines as a "song" -- and I'm two albums behind, anyway.) :-)

Hello out there!

I just had a couple things on my mind that I thought get out into the open.
First of all, I was wondering, does anybody know if Rush will be in either
the San Diego or San Francisco areas in the relatively near future?  I saw
the boyz when they were down here in San Diego in January (Awesome concert!),
and I sure would hate to miss 'em if they come around again.  Secondly,
there was a list of radio stations that air Rockline that someone (I
can't remember who) compiled.  Well, here's one more station to add
to that list:  102.1 (KIOZ) in the San Diego area.  Not too shabby,
since I've heard Rush on there every-so-often.  One last thing:
I've heard on two separate occasions, a version of Roll the Bones,
where the "chat" portion was edited out.  Has anyone else out there
heard it?  Just thought I'd ask...
