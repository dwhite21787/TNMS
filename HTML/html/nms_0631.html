Well, I just finished watching the annual music popularity awards... I mean
the Grammys... and I noticed that Ben Mink was listed as co-writer for
kd lang's song "constant cravings."  As you probably all already know, Ben
Mink played the violin on "Losing It" (SIGNALS), and was in the band FM.

[apologies if this is old news to you all...]

Does anyone know if he was the violin player on that song?

Thanks....

BTW, is there ONE MORE AWARD we can pile on Eric Clapton for his song
"Tears in Heaven?"  I really respect the guy for his guitar playing and all,
but he's written much better stuff (not that it's a dog...)

<A NAME="631005">Subject: New World Man/Waynes World</A>

On the way to work the other morning I was listening to the radio and
over my speakers, through the ramblings of the DJ, came the intro to
New World Man.  I'm thinking this is truly a rare treat, it's rare
enough to hear Rush on this station, but I have never heard Rush in
the morning on this particular station!  Then the lyrics start, and
it's not Geddy singing (I don't know who it was) and the words went
something like: "He's a local cable hero.... From Aurora Illinois..."
and it turns out to be a bunch of Wayne's World related lyrics with
sound bites from the movie and skits.  I must admit that the lyrics
made me laugh (but I couldn't help thinking that they could at least
play Rush once in a while if they are going to use them for a "spoof").
I listened for quite a while after the song finished but the DJ never
said who put this song together.  Does anyone know anything more about this?
Was it "Weird Al"?  Would he have to get Rush's permission to do this?
If anyone has any info on this, please post.  This may be a candidate
for the FAQ (excuse my stupidity if it's already in the FAQ).

Someone previously posted the story about his two little girls and how
they asked for Rush in the car.  I'd also like to share my "young Rush fan"
story.  I have a 2 yr. old and every time I go to turn on my stereo system
at home he says: "I wanna listen to the Skeleton CD"!  How can a father
turn down a request like that!

<A NAME="631006">Subject: Read this with a grain of salt . . .</A>

Someone a couple issues back asked what the 'Sign of Eth' signifies.
Here's the meaning:

Today, dear brothers and sisters, we are going to learn the ways of the
Wicked One and how He is corrupting the youth of this generation.  We are
going to view the vices of Satan in ROCK music.  Chief among those
possessed by Him is one Neil Peart, of the ROCK group known as RUSH.
>From the very beginning of his involvement with this band he has openly
written about his dark beliefs, though denying them in public.  His
first example is in the phrase "The sign of Eth is rising in the air"
from the album _Fly By Night_ (itself a reference to demon possessed
nightmares).  So, let us now expose this phrase for its true meaning.
Eth is actually an acronym.  The 'E' is actually a secret code meaning
"Geddy, Neil, and Alex" (the names of the members of the band) since it
is the only letter common to all their names.  The 'T' stands for
transcend, and the 'H' stands for Heaven, obviously.
  Therefore the entire phrase "The Sign of Eth is rising in the
air" must mean that Geddy, Neil, and Alex have rejected traditional Judaeo-
Christian beliefs, committed their talents to the Dark One, and that they
are openly proclaiming their beliefs in their music.  It also has two
other Satanic messages, of which I can only bring myself to reveal one:
the sound 'eth' is typical of someone with a speech impediment, a demon
of the tongue, trying to say 'S', which can only stand for 'Satan'.

>. . . Sorry, folks, that's all I can stand to write.  P.S.  The
preceding was a farce.

Regards,

David K. Drum

i was wandering around a music store in Boulder wednesday when I saw
an interesting version of MP. It was mastered from the original recordings
(doesn't everything seem to say this when the price goes up??),
given a new logo around the MP album cover, and recorded onto a CD plated
with 24 carat gold(i assume to give better sound reproduction).
my question is:
has anyone got one of these? does ti really sound better?
is it worth $26(damn thats alot for one cd) for something i already have??

	I was catching up on the paper and saw that someone had mentioned an mtv
rocumentary on rush.  Don't make me sick!  Sure, I would love to see an hour 
long special on tv, but eMpTV?  Don't forget, this is the same channel that
headed lavish praise on Milli Vanilli after they won a Grammy for best new
artist.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure some people like Bon Jovi and
Guns n Posers, but mtv gives them deity-status.
	Yeah, I have seen the occassional rush video on mtv and loved it.  I'm 
even surprised to hear parts of RTB at the end of the half-hour comedy hour. 
But seeing a "rocumentary" on rush on mtv would be like kissing your sister....
No, it would be worse....more like having oral sex with your grandma.  Sure, it
feels good, but it is just plain wrong!

Anyone notice on the new Van Halen live album that Alex Van Halen's drum solo
sounds quite a bit like Peart's?  It also comes during the song "Pleasure
Dome", about which has been some speculation that it had some similar rhythms
to "Xanadu".  Discussion, anyone?

<A NAME="631011">Subject: Eth and so forth</A>

I'll throw what little I know about the Eth discussion out for ya'll to knaw
on. I dated an Icelandic-American(in the sense of immigrant) woman in
high-school. She and her family taught me a tiny bit of Icelandic(which as it
turns out is very little different from Old English in written form). The
letter being called eth sounds like the letter she pronounced "dth"(I don't
know the name in Icelandic), where the "th" portion is voiced. The voiceless
"th" sound was written differently, like a lower-case p with a glandular
problem(actually, overlay a lower-case p and a lower-case b, and that's the
letter, lower-case anyway. I never have seen the upper-case).

The reason I mention this is that someone described eth as the voiceless "th",
which I would find surprising, unless there was considerable divergence,
including the swapping of the two sounds, between the two languages. I'll admit
that weirder things have happened, though...

<A NAME="631012">Subject: Rush and Religion</A>

Hello to my fellow Rush fans!
    First of all I must admit that I haven't been an avid Rush fan for
more than a few years, and I'm not as familiar with all of the lyrics as
I'd like to be.  Please feel free to correct me if I'm off base on anything.
    Several issues ago a fan stated that she found "emotional and spiritual"
support in listening to the Band.  Well, I am a Christian, and quite
firmly committed to my faith.  Because of this I also find a level of
enjoyment in the philosophical depth of Rush's lyrics.  Do any of you have
serious religious or philosophical beliefs that draw you to Rush?
    I (and I don't think I'm alone) usually have trouble deciphering the
symbolic lyrics.  I was wondering if any of you had any insight into the
religious tendancies (or lack thereof) of the band.  Do you see them as
necessarily strongly opposed to a "traditional" Christian belief system?  I
know they often use Biblical phrases (or things that sound like them): "And
the Meek shall inherit the earth...",  "Blame is better to give than
recieve".  Could "Witch Hunt" be a lashing out against the judgemental
members of religious groups?  How about "Freewill"?
    I'd be happy to hear from ya' personally, or just post something here
on the board.

I guess the only way to find out where Rush played during the COS is
for someone very knowledgeable about this tour (Like what
part of the States they played in, or around what dates)...

   [ I read that most of the shows for the COS tour were played in the
     Midwest.							: rush-mgr ]

If we can find out those details then we can send agents to look at old
newspaper microfilms!  Most newspaper make microfilms, they can
often be found in local universities.   So people please start posting
as to what part of the country and approximate dates!  Local libraries
are also a good source of info!  So people plase start posting and maybe
we can even impress the Band with this knowledge!

Well kids.....
The Song Poll is going great.  I'll be posting the results sometime at the
end of next week.  I really appreciate everyone voting.

Next,  I've gotten a few Email notes from people (more than a few actually)
that really have made me quite angry.  I know that certain things aren't
allowed to be posted here, but come on.  Give people a break.  You know,
It's one thing to post to the NMS saying "Enough Dream Theater" or
"Give it up about the fourth member"  this way everyone gets to see.  But
have any of you out there who have posted about any of these "Tired issues"
been attacked via your Email?

I didn't appreciate the person telling me that my poll is tired, and that
the few times I've posted "DON'T FORGET TO VOTE" that they felt like I was
treating them like a baby.

I guess I thought wrong when I thought that the NMS was a forum for any
Rush fan to write his/her thoughts about Rush, or conduct a poll, or ask
questions, or whatever.  I wouldn't have felt so hurt personally, if the
person would have posted to the NMS, that this poll I'm conducting is tired.
I'm sorry if I offend anyone by taking up space (NMS mgr, please forgive
me) on the bulletin...... If you are really tired of my polls, then
I'll stop them.  But I really think that the results are interesting to all
of us, and they are fun for me to do.  And really, if you don't want to vote,
then by all means, don't vote.

Sorry about all my bitching.  I just felt too much that TNMS is being
"Guarded" by the wrong people.

Thanks for listening.

On the subject of entertainers vs artists --

entertainers are those who "perform" for others.
artists are those who "perform" for themselves.

Rush are first and foremost the latter, but often
delve into the former.

"lot of people" you THINK would agree.  Funny that my CD player should go
belly up last night, and as I fished around for a cassette to play I happened
upon a tape I recorded about 10 yrs. ago with Signals on one side and P/G on
the other.  Wouldn't you know I popped it in the deck and cranked it up and...

>... next thing I know I was back in 1983 at RPI tearing the plastic wrap off
of my barand new Signals LP...gently placing upon my severely underrated
Realistic All-in-one stereo's turntable and listening to, of all songs...

NEW WORLD MAN

and thinking.... and thinking...and smiling and saying, "Damn, this is GOOD!"
>..."No, no wait"...   "THIS IS GREAT"... "HELL, THIS IS FANTASTIC"...

I happen to feel very strongly about that song.

- John Turi

ps. - my girlfriend who was in the kitchen at the time (and who rarely can
tell the difference between RUSH, GENESIS, MOODY BLUES, etc, because she
just generally isn't into that scene)   looked around the corner and with
a slight smile said, "That's RUSH."
Trust me when I say that if she recognizes something like that, it is
because she likes it.
OK, so it doesn't explain WHY N.W.M. went (yech)TOP 40(yech), but maybe it
just helps prove that it is a more widely enjoyable (by a wider audience
that is) song than they generally produce.

My humble $2/100 worth...

Hello, just wanted to say 'Kudos' to the person who donated money to the
'make a wish foundation' and requested that the radio station (95.5 in
Syracuse) play the whole album 2112!!! I was about to fall asleep and then
I heard the intro guitar riffs from 2112. I almost pissed my pants!!!!
There's always a first! Anyway, good choice and a great cause! Think I heard
somebody else in the NMS saying that this was done elsewhere, the donating
thing for requests.  Now if the radio stations would play CoS and
Hemispheres!!! :-)

Jay

<A NAME="631021">Subject: Some Juno awards won by Rush</A>

Well, I do know that Rush won a Juno in 1992(?) for best Hard Rock
Album (RTB), and another Juno in the previous year (1991?) for
best Heavy Metal Album (Presto). :) :) to that last one... Although
at one time Rush might have been classified as heavy metal, I think
a lot of Canadian heavy metal bands were upset that Presto won the best
album in their category... Modern Rush fits better in Hard Rock, and
they finally recognised that fact for RTB.

Anybody know if they won any Junos or Grammies in earlier years?

  [ They never won any Grammies, but they were nominated for "YYZ" and
    "Where's My Thing?" as best rock instrumentals.	    : rush-mgr ]
