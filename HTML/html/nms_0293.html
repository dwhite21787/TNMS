In response to Marshall_Robin's post to NMS #291; EcoPaks:

My feeling is that EcoPaks are here to stay, and anything that can be
done to replace those wretched hard plastic longboxes (which BTW most
older Rush CD releases are packaged in) has my approval. I don't enjoy
the jewel box either: it is breakable, unsightly (ever notice those
scratches), and a terrible waste of plastic.

Don't misunderstand me, I am not a flaming environmentalist. I do believe
that the EcoPak is much more attractive and functional. I own Sting's
Soul_Cages CD, and I enjoy the design of the packaging very much.
The argument that the EcoPak is not durable and will rot is unfounded.
Since the EcoPak is a new innovation, how does one know it will rot???
The EcoPak is very much like the paperboard record sleeve. How many folks
have record sleeves that have rotted?? None have I. I have a large album
collection dating back to 1969, I even have some collectable stuff from
the '50's.... all in fine shape.

If you want to avoid rotting the EcoPak, don't get it wet and don't store
in a humid environment. All it takes is a little care!!!

My 2 cents for the day.

Cheers,
Dave

HEY everyone, guess its been awhile since my last post. If you don't want
to get the CD in the flimsy cardboard type of container, you can always
go ANYWHERE in Canada (preferably TO of course) and get the ANTHEM version

	I believe the video for Van Halen's "Pretty Woman" had a
Napoleon-like theme to it, if not a Bastille Day resemblence.  Also
last week, I think it was Friday or Saturday night, the Global Jam
program played "Spirit of Radio" and "Tom Sawyer" from ASOH
concert film.  It was three a.m., but dammit they played it!

   While reading the aftk tourbook, Neil statess "I joined the band on Geddy's
twenty-first birthday, June 29, 1974,...".  Also, from Thrice Told Tales in
the Rush Complete music book:  "I joined the band on Geddy's twenty-first
birthday, June 29, 1974, ...".  The FAQL says July 29, but I recall reading  a
book of birthdays in a bookstore years back that also put Geddy's B-Day in June,
and I think Alex's B-Day in July, but I am very unsure on Alex's B-Day.  Neil
seems to think Geddy was born in June, what do you all think?  Maybe I was
right after all three weeks ago.

Some thoughts...

Rush and REM:  I used to sort of like REM, but I really dont anymore,
               because I think that they have failed to grow and change
               in any interesting way.  They have their "sound", but the
               stuff coming out now doesn't sound all that different from
               the early eighties.  IMHO, of course; after all, some people
               think Rush music "all sounds the same"!

Rush Fan Factions: I am a late-twenties fan who was fairly obsessed with
               _Hemispheres_ for many years, and had a hard time dealing
               with the "newer" stuff (anything after _Hemispheres_).  I
               have a number of friends who never made the jump at all,
               but even more who could deal with _Permanent Waves_ and
               _Moving Pictures_, but completely gave up at _Signals_.  I
               think Rush lost a lot of "old" fans with _Signals_, fans
               that have never come back.  I didn't like _Power Windows_
               for at least a year, but now it is one of my favorites (and
               definately my most-listened-to)!  I *still* think _Presto_
               is their weakest album since _A Farewell to Kings_.
               Ultimately, the reason I have been able to be a dedicated
               fan for so long is because Rush have grown and changed,
               and challenged me to do likewise!

Albums Most Often Played:
       Power Windows, Permanent Waves (who else?)
       Imperial Bedroom, Spike, Mighty Like a Rose (Elvis Costello)
       Compact King Crimson (King Crimson)
       Remain in Light, Speaking in Tongues, Stop Making Sense (Talking Heads)
       Houses of the Holy (Led Zeppelin)
       Pirates, Magazine (Rickie Lee Jones)

Elvis is my second fave to Rush.  He has also gone through a lot of changes
(from straight-ahead rock to more textured stuff), put out a lot of albums,
and been a consistent live performer.

<A NAME="293007">Subject:      Gangster of Boats</A>

  Well, I'm just wondering whether I'm the only one who's found this and
think that it's important, or if I'm just uninformed, or just stupid?

But, the other day I was reading through the sleeve of my HYF cassette,
you know reading the lyrics (for the thousandth time) and all the
thank you's, when I got about three-fourths of the way through, and lo
and behold, they thanked "the Gangster of Boats"  So, is just something
else they just made up (i.e. in AFTK, they give a very special thank you
to Dirk, Lerxst, and Pratt) or is the Gangster a real person, and if so,
who?  As for the part IV of the trilogy, I think everyone who said it was
like the "Hitchhiker's" trilogy is right, just something to be funny.

[ Ummm, Dirk, Lerxt, and Pratt are aliases for Geddy, Alex, and Neil.  I'm
  not sure who is who w/out checking, except for Alex/Lerxt.     :rush-mgr ]

Instrumentals:  "Overture" is not a true instrumental because the last
  line is "and the meek shall inherit the earth".  However, if memory
  serves me right, "Of the Battle" in "By-Tor..." is an instrumental.
  Can't wait for the new one!

Most listened to albums:  ASoH, HYF, ESL, Hemispheres, and Presto.  Also
  anything by Billy Joel or the Eagles. (Please no flames!)

You know you're a Rush fan when...
  You're staring at a can of Mountain Dew and read "Mountain Distant Early
  Warning"

Concept Albums:  I don't think they should do one based on something someone
  else has written.  (Although Xanadu is great).  Besides, I think that they
  have outgrown concept albums, as they have stated themselves.  So, I
  wouldn't expect one any time soon, although we can hope.  Off the subject,
  isn't David Edding's "The Belgariad" and "Malloreon" the best fantasy
  books to come down the pike in a hellavu long time?

  All for now,

Nonsense.  You're concern is well noted, but not necessary at this time.  My
friend Kevin, who has been in contact with Neil recently, informs me that
Neil is in great health.  He lost the ponytail not because of chemotherapy,
but because he just wanted to.  This type of rumour is the same thing as the
"Paul McCartney is dead" scare back when he was in the Beatles.  It just
starts with one person trying to be cute by starting a rumour, and before you
know it the rumour gets blown up completely out of proportion.  Neil is alive
and healthy, and he plans to stay that way for many years to come.

bombard my mailbox asking for it.  If any of you are currently working on
these, email me fast!

The YYZ tab is not my own, I got it with the Guitar interview quite a number
of years ago.

Hi,

   It seems that while I've been away on holiday over the past 2 weeks
   various people have found the relevant quotes from the Fountainhead
   about the 3 balls and posted them in. Well, it saves me the job at
   least :-). Not only that, but a philosophical debate has arisen
   about Objectivism. I wouldn't call myself an Objectivist, although
   I agree with a large amount of Ayn Rand's ideas.

   Has anyone noticed how closely Rush as a group, and NP
   in particular conform to the ideals described by Rand in her books?
   All the characteristics which make a person 'great' in AR's philo-
   sophy are personified in Rush.The career of Rush has very close
   parallels to many of the leading characters in AR's books.

   Take Howard Roark from The Fountainhead as an example.
   He was an architect who would only design
   buildings in a style which he believed to be right. He did not care
   what any other architect designed, or what the popular opinion of
   the general public was, or what his friends said, he just did it
   HIS way. Very few people liked what he did - it was too radical, too
   original, but still he continued. When offered contracts to build
   in a style he thought to be lacking in integrity, Roark refused,
   even when that cost him money, status, friends, etc. He was brought
   to the point of despair, and at one point in the book had to give up
   being an architect and work in a quarry, rather than design buildings
   that he considered would have no value. But Roark was also a perfect-
   ionist, working night and day, driven by an overwhelming love for
   his vision of designing buildings. Eventually the one or two people
   who had the courage to recognise Roark's abilities gave him contracts,
   and he started designing again. His fame spread by word of mouth. In
   all the popular press articles he was slammed for not giving the
   public what they wanted, being too arrogant, being too conceited, too
   individualistic and for having an inflated ego.

Compare that to a potted history of Rush.

   1) Rush are perfectionists. They are widely regarded as being
      the best musicians around today.

   2) They never compromise. They do not produce 'disco' music that you
      can dance to, just to sell records. They could sell many more
      records than they do, simply by putting in a catchy chorus and a
      4/4 beat. But they don't, because they have a sense of musical
      integrity.

   3) Rush do not seem to care what the latest fashion is. They continue
      producing their music in their way, while all the latest trends
      go the way of all latest trends.

   4) Every song they do has a 'reason'. Sometimes that reason is just to
      conjure an image or emotion (Red Barchatta, Tai Shan), sometimes
      to make a philosophical/sociological point (Freewill, Red Tide),
      or sometimes for the pure joy of self expression, in other words
      sowing-off (YYZ, La Villa Strangiato).

   5) Their songs are always positive in approach, with a joi de vivre
      evident. I can't think of a single Rush song which I find depressing
      (compared to many from other groups, eg Pink Floyd, Queensryche).

   6) Their songs are never trite. They treat their listeners with respect
      and expect them to have intelligence.

   7) Rush work incredibly hard, both while writing the songs in the studios
      and on tour. Even when relaxing, they relax 'hard'. Play tennis, ride
      bikes up mountains etc.

   8) Although there are three members of the group, each member makes his
      own individual contribution to the Rush sound. No one individual
      compromises his integrity, even though each contribution is blended
      together to form the final song.

   9) When they originally formed, they had to learn their trade the hard
      way, in the club circuit. They tried endless times to get a record
      contract, but at that time in Canada they were considered too
      novel, too individualistic to take a chance on. So Rush formed their
      own record label, with their own money, and made the record themselves!

  10) Rush are still not liked by the majority of the masses, since they
      don't play conventional music (ie. disco-orientated rubbish). Even
      rock music critics don't like them, because quite often Rush are too
      complex for them to understand (eg. the Creem review). They get
      very little radio play (none at all in England).They are regarded
      as arrogant know-alls, with no snese of humour (WE know this isn't
      true, but the music critics keep on saying it).

  11) Despite all this, Rush's fame has spread by word of mouth, a
      friends-telling-friends situation. Those of us that hear a few Rush
      albums, realise that THIS is how rock music SHOULD be performed. All
      other groups seem trite and insignificant in comparison.

  12) Neil Peart wanted to be a drummer when he was younger, and came to
      the then music capital of the world (London) to try and join a
      group. But none of the groups he found there were making anything
      like the sort of music he wanted to participate in. Rather than be
      a drummer in a 3rd rate pop-group, Peart took a job as a street
      vendor (in Carnaby Street, I think), and waited for when he could
      resume his drumming career. This is very reminiscent of Roark's
      time in the quarry. I believe 'Circumstances' is about this period
      in NP's life?Eventually he had to return to Canada, and found the
      'right sort of people' in Lee & Lifeson.

  13) Despite all their critics, their unflinching individuality, their
      lack of radio play, etc, Rush have triumphed, and are now
      regarded by many as the standard by which to compare all other
      rock groups.

   There are many more examples I could give, but this posting is too
   long as it is. But for those of you who have read The Fountainhead
   and thought "It's only a story. In real life Roark couldn't have
   survived", think again. He did survive in spirit...he's called Rush.
