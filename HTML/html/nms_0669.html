Hey Guys -
         How is everyone?
Got a question for all of you. See, I'm in this fantasy baseball league again
this year (third year for me), and the name of my team is "GEDDY's GOLDEN
GLOVERS".  I'm looking for an insignia to place in the weekly stat sheet.
Does anyone have ideas? Does anyone have a small gif file they could part with
that I could edit with paint or something that would "fit the baseball type
idea"?
Looking for suggestions -
Joe

	Anyway, Re: the Rosinante. I don't have the book handy, and it was
a LOOOOONG time ago, but it's my recollection that Rosinante was the name
of Don Quixote's horse. Now, for the life of me, I have never been able
to figure out how this fits into the song, if indeed it's the right
connection.

	And I, too, have never heard that Rocinante was Zeus' horse. In fact,
it doesn't even sound like a Greek name, though Nikos can probably tell
better than I.

Our Greek friend pointed out that he had his doubts that Rocinante was
Zeus' horse. I concur. Wasn't he Don Quixote's steed?

Also, it might SEEM like an honor when the Harvard Lampoon inducts a

The original National Midnight Star was a recurring "SCTV" sketch which
lampooned the tabloid-TV genre (but as always, "SCTV" was ahead of its time,
they never anticipated shows like "Inside Edition" or "Hard Copy").

After a NMS commentator finished reading a newsstory, someone off-camera would
bellow "It's true!"  Hence the line in "Red Lenses":  "We've got Mars on the
horizon, says the National Midnight Star.  (It's true!)  What you believe..."

Rush is Canadian.  "SCTV" is Canadian.  As a matter of fact, Rush was scheduled
to appear on "SCTV" as a 'musical guest,' but the show was cancelled by NBC
before that episode could be conceived.

Well, let's see-

to Firebird: I agree.. I love peart to death, and think he is one
of the better rock drummers around, but I had the unfortunate/fortunate
chance to see Weckl here in Baltimore and a Yamaha drum clinic.
He was incredible.. Double Stroke, Triple Stroke Rolls and paradiddles
that were amazing. He is really good. Of course, I was disappointed to
find my notion of Neil Peart being the 'best drummer period' to be
altered, but then again, I don't think Dave's stuff would work to well
in the Rush framework, and vice versa.. So, i stopped comparing and
just enjoy them both!

and, in response to greg's post about Show Don't Tell live: I
personally enjoyed the slow-down.. I love the opening riff to
Show Don't Tell - I think it's one of my all time favorite Rush
riffs.. slowing it down seemed to give it some power, IMHO..
I just enjoyed it.

Later-
Chris

<A NAME="669010">Subject: Promark 747 Sticks</A>

For whoever asked, the Neil Peart, ProMark 747 signature sticks are widely
available.  However, there is such a high demand on them that it is very
difficult to keep them in stock.  As for Mr. Peart not using the signature
sticks live, not too many drummers play sticks with their signatures.  After
all, what's the use in making the company fo through the trouble of
providing you with signature sticks when it's YOUR signature?  Mr. Peart
also use the butt ends of his sticks almost exclusively, because they do
provide much more power when used in that fashion.  I find using the butt ends
of sticks creates far too much noise and there is little stick definition.
That's just my opinion.

Well, a couple of points about Alex's guitar work. Much of the early work
solo work used string bending on Gibson guitars, and in later work, he uses
a tremolo bar on his Paul Reed Smith to achieve similar effects.
( corrections welcome, but I think this is right ) These effects are often
well nigh impossible to achieve on an accoustic, as it is much harder to
bend the strings to the same extent ( this is in my own experience, mind you -
maybe the man himself can do it, although it would still be hard ). So
the solos would have to be radically changed ( not that this is beyond the
boys though ). Tremolo bar stuff is more or less impossible too.

Secondly, Alex uses stuff like distortion and so on a lot, and playing
something like Limelight on an acoustic doesn't sound just quite as hot.

Overall, the band use a lot of synthesiser and so on to 'fill space'
because there are only three of them. This would make an Unplugged session
seem quite 'empty', I would imagine.

However, I don't think its impossible, just quite a lot of changes would
have to be made to make the songs sound good in acoustic form. I can see
Alex with an acoustic, Geddy with an acoustic bass and Neil with one of
those titchy jazz-type drum kits... :-)

Rocinante is Don Quijote's horse (y'know, _EL INGENIOSO HIDALGO DON
QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA_ - the Miguel De Cervantes toptoptop book).

Is it just me, or is Geddy having an extremely poor singing night on
Over the Europe.  I mean, he is off key in many areas, takes all of
the high parts down, etc. etc......   The music is great, the quality
is great, but the singing sucks.  My copy of the opener in Hamilton
is much, much better as far as Geddy's voice is concerned.....

I guess that's what you get when the show was recorded near the end
of a tour.  Well, I certainly hope that everyone who can gets that
deposit in, because I am looking forward to going to this convention.

I almost sure that Rosinante was the horse of the legendary DON QUIJOTE the 
character of the most famous Spanish novel. First published around the 16th - 
17th century. I know this because back home, studied it (I hated it)...

howdy!

This is my first post to the list. I just got back from the record store
and I was looking for rush stuff (of course) and I came across several
rush albums on vinyl (remember that stuff?). I saw 2112, ESL, ATWAS, and
MP on vinyl. The prices were really cheap and the records and jackets
were in good shape. The question is, are these hard to find? Are they
worth more than the $5 or $6 they want for them? I don't have a turntable
and probably wouldnt play them, although ESL has some neat pictures of
the band in the jacket (ones not in the CD version of the same). Any
input is welcome.

        Hello All!

        I just read the "Satanic Edition"...great job guys, I hope that person
with the cat problem finds some advice, that sounds like a bummer!
        Anyway I have been getting anxious for this new album that I have been
playing my Rush CDs to no end and have been getting pretty bored with them.
So I have made a couple recordings of my own.  A couple months ago I took my
stero and hooked it up to a VCR and made a recording of the Grace Under
Pressure video.  Well that kept me satisifed for a couple weeks.  So I decided
to take ALL my Rush CDs and make a mix.
        So while I was watching the Sabres SWEEP the Chowder Heads, I threw
5 discs on the player and hit random.  I kept the CDs out of chronological
order to get a somewhat beter mix.  After about 25 min, I put 5 new ones in,
and so on.  I kept going till I filled a 110 min tape.  Here's what I got:
        SIDE A
        ~~~~~~
        Jacob's Ladder (Live)
        Hemispheres (ALL PARTS!)
        Where's My Thing?
        Red Barchetta
        Big Money
        Cinderella Man
        A Farewell to Kings

        SIDE B
        ~~~~~~
        The Rhythm Method (COOL!)
        Afterimage
        Anagram
        Kid Gloves
        Big Money (Live)
        The Spirit Of Radio
        Mission
        Turn The Page
        Force Ten
        Losing It
        A Passage to Bangkok
        Lock and Key (only 1/2 of it)

        As you can see a pretty decent mix, and I now know that my CD
player loves HYF!!  So this will keep me happy probably till the weekend.

        GO SABRES!!   Hope there are enough golf courses in the Boston area!

Hello everyone!

First of all, a quick response to something in issue 668. SOmeone
wrote that he thought it was insulting to parody Rush.  Well, my
$0.02: THey say that immitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I
know that I sure wouldn't sit down and spend a few hours coming up
with a parody of a song by a band I don't like. Parodies, when done
respectfully show a person's fondness, for lack of a better word, for
that which they are parodying.

Sorry. FLAME OFF...

Anyways, the crux of my post:
OK, maybe I'm stupid, maybe I have missed one to many NMS's, or maybe
I am just out of it, but IS "CRITICAL MASS" THE REAL TITLE, OR WAS IT
JUST SEIZED UPON AND HAS BECOME A NAME TO REPRESENT THE NEW
ALBUM???!?!? I coulda' sworn that that post was an April fool's joke,
but now everyone is using that name....

Hello again fellow Rushians! I just got a today from Goldmine. They told me
that they have received a number of complaints regarding Dead Parrot Disc's
honest dealing and have subsequently banned them from advertising on their
pages. I probably will never receive my order or receive my $68 back. But
at least I can take comfort in knowing that fewer people will be robbed.

Beware of Dead Parrot. Money goes in and nothing comes out!

Take care all,

Rolaant

Hello All

I was sitting around pondering things and a thought came up.
Has Rush always been distrabuted world wide?  I mean I figure that when the
original album came out it was just Canada and the U.S. Right????  Can someone
on the other side ofthe big lake help me out on this and then maybe also tell 
me how they first heard of the Big Three.  Just thinking of things until the 
next album comes out.
P.S.  My best concert memory was standing in line at APVMT waiting to get in.
And during the sound check they started to play Analog Kid.  I almost pissed in
my pants.  It was the beginning of a great night.

Hello from Greece (again).

As I noticed , you guys seem to know almost everything about Rush.
Anyway in this posting, I will try to give you some information
from Greek mythology referring to Cygnus X-I - Book II (and just hope that
some of you will find something here that you don't already know...)

So, Cygnus ( which is the Greek word for swan ) was a king in a place called
Ligouria. He had the skill of singing and actually he teached
this skill to the God of music and arts : Apollo ( one of the 12 Greek
Gods on mountain Olympos ). But ( I don't know for what reason ) Apollo
transformed him first to a swan ( hence the swan is called Cygnus in
Greek ) and then to a constellation ( hence the constellation name ).
Anyway I don't think that Neil knew this Myth when he was writing the
lyrics - IMHO).

Now a few words about Apollo and Dionysus who are the conflicting heroes in
this song:

-Apollo was the God of music, poetry and other arts. He was able to
foretell the future and his symbols was the sun and the lyre.

-Dionysus was the God of fun and inspiration (for arts) and his symbols
were grapes and wine. Althought he made many mischiefs he wasn't
related to things like sexual orgies or overwhelming eating or drinking
until the Roman times.

Now - although there is another God for wisdom (actually Godess - Athina ,
the daughter of Zeus ) - these two Gods have been used by many to symbolize
the rational and irrational part of the human nature respectively.
Although many battles between the Gods can be found in Greek mythology,
I am almost certain that there was no battle between these two Gods ( they
were actually two peaceful Gods ). Also there is no God of Balance in
Greek mythology ( and Cygnus is not even a God ).

The conclusion is that the whole story has influences from Greek mythology
but it is basically Neil's imagination. This is more evident from the
reference of Armageddon as the place of the battle since this has nothing
to do with Greek Mythology (it's the place where the final battle of the
Revelation will be given).

That's all and I hope I haven't tired you.

Nick
