Quite true...he has lost a (figurative) ton.

Whoever does his bumper music must be a fan, because I am pretty sure I've 
heard some Rush on Rush before.  Nearly fell off my chair at the irony.

ARGH!  At least pick someone with TALENT and some sense of moral 
character.  Not necessarily MY morals, but some morals nonetheless.

How about Anne Murray?  They can sing Danny's Song or Daydream Believer?

Celine Dion? She and Geddy could share clothes and nose tips?

Haven't heard the remaster, but those guitar parts are
ADSR'd--(attack/decay/sustain/release)--similar to what Al does with a
volume pedal, but more so.  You can control how fast the sound comes in,
how fast it chops off, and a minimum level at which it will be allowed
through the system.  It's possible that someone diddled with them on the
board during remastering, not knowing what effect Al was trying for. 
They might have "fixed" something that wasn't broken.

This has been done, has it not?  If my memory serves, wasn't a book compiled
and sent to the band for their anniversary a few years back?

Since I have now broken my three year lurking stint with TNMS,  I'll take a
second to say thanks.  Although I don't get the time to read this newsletter
much anymore, it sure is nice to know it's here.  I've been an obsessed RUSH
fan for the greater part of my life (discovered them when I was 15, am now...
ahem....32).  And found that I wasn't alone with this obsession when Idiscovered
TMNS a few years ago... Whew!  What a relief! I officially quit trying to 
"enlighten" my friends and family by bombarding them with the songs which I 
thought one only needed to hear to be awe struck by. Of course, most weren't 
(which I still don't understand, but now accept).  

My 10 year old son has apparantly caught the RUSH bug. I always knew he was a
spectacular child!  Of course I am thrilled (we conspire against the rest of the
family by slipping RUSH cd's into the player).  Unfortunately though, this means
I have to occassionally retrieve a stack of cd's from his room. 

Anyone else have kids who like THE BAND?  I'm curious to know which cd's/songs
kids like.  My son's favorite cd and song is PRESTO/Presto.  He also likes
Half the World and Time Stands Still. Like I said, he is a spectacular child.

So there is hope for the next generation!
Rush on!

No, he used overdubs.  Chorusing is an electronic effect that was
invented in the mid-seventies.  Alex reports in various interviews that
he started using chorus in '77.  I'll look for the article.  There's
also his comment on Counterparts about "Ending my horrible 15 year
dependency on Chorus."

If you use reverse reverb and digital delay does the sound come out
before you play it?

Hey gang....
Regarding the comment about some songs, like Tom Sawyer, Closer to the
Heart, and Spirit of Radio becoming redundant live, I kind of disagree.. I
mean, I love hearing the new music and the classics like 2112, Hemispheres,
Subdivisions, etc, but I would also feel a little empty if the three songs
above weren't played. As far as Tom Sawyer, that's a signature classic. It's
also cool to see several thousand air drummers in the front rows playing
along. Closer to the Heart brings out that "chilling effect" when everyone
sings the first verse along with Geddy and when everyone sparks up their
lighters. I don't smoke, but I bring a lighter just for that song.. And
Spirit of Radio, above all others is the true signature song. For me, SoR
embodies why I love Rush. That and the role the crowd plays  after Geddy
sings "Concert halls." There are just some songs that will always be played
by cetain groups. For Marillion, it's Kayleigh, for Yes, it's Roundabout,
and for Rush, those three songs will be a mainstay. I'm all for the
tinkering they do, like on CttH. It made the song more enjoyable in my
opinion. Maybe some day they'll record the different version in the studio.
I can dream can't I?
Cheers from New Mexico..

Hey, anyone who has been to the NMS website knows that there is a great
selection of multimedia files to choose from. And, i am prolly sure that
the Rush-mgr has the Limelight pop-up video on videotape. So how about
putting 2 and 2 together? I say you make a RealVideo version and put it
up on the website! And for the future, maybey getting realserver! :)

Toastado
=================
If we burn our toast
Frying too hot for the bun
If the moment of golden(brown)
Has past us before its noticed 
If the slice is done --
Though everything is charred
We will scrape the blackstuff
But we will not spread the lard

When the carbon's been cleared
And victory denied
Tortilla too soft-y
Bagel's a little too wide
If the jam does glide --
Though loaves so nice are lost
We will heat the rice,
But we will not serve the toast

And if the toaster stops
There's only the pound-cake to blame
All the hope and glory
All the kneading done in vain
[and] if the loaf has grains
Though every slice is tossed
We will slay them twice
But the baker we'll not accost

My apologies to rush fans everywhere for this travesty of humor.

<A NAME="2040010">Subject: Beyond Borders and Censorship</A>

Good day.  I have two items.  First, here is an e-mail that I got from Rik
Emmett.  It sums up the liklihood of ever seeing "Beyond Borders" on a
forthcoming CD.  At the time that I asked him that question, he indicated
that he did not have the master tape.  I told him that it was available at
the TNMS site (I incorrectly used the term "bootleg." My apologies to
Rush-mgr), and this is the response:

Dear Eric:

Thanks  for  the  info.   I noticed in the Discussion Forum on the web site
that I got slagged for appearing to be a tightwad millionaire searching for
a  few  nickels  in  the  dirt  over  this issue...hardly the truth.  I was
actually  taking  a bit of a stab at the no-respect-for-copyright nature of
the  Internet,  and  the  abuse  of  private creative properties that is so
apparent in this domain.  There's also another issue at work, too.
Actually,  Alex, Liona, Ed and I did the project purely for its educational
(and,  undoubtedly,  its  promotional)  value,  and  I  am  sort of glad to
discover  that even though "Borders" is being "bootlegged", as you describe
it,  it  is  being  offered  free of charge.  I suppose that's cool, and in
keeping with the spirit of the project in the first place.
As far as a future release goes, that's probably a giant can of worms.  How
could I get the other artists to sign off on allowing me to profit from the
thing?   Why  would I want to?  The magazine only had the right to print it
on  vinyl inserts in their magazine that one time - technically, they don't
own the master, or the publishing copyright - I guess I do.  But that's not
the major stumbling block, anyhow.
Here  is  just another major irritating hunk of ex-Triumph bull-oney.  Upon
deciding  to  leave  the  partnership, I was not prescient enough to take a
quiet  little  visit to the tape storage of The Metalworks and grab all the
tapes,  masters,  safety  masters,  etc.  of unreleased things I had done -
little side projects that I had recorded, outtakes and unreleased materials
from  over  the  years  that had not made their way to the public. (I'm not
just  talking about TRIUMPH projects here, either - I'm talking about stuff
from  totally  outside  of  the  partnership umbrella - solo things, guitar
pieces,  acoustic  stuff,  demos,  projects with other musicians, and stuff
exactly  like  that  GP  Beyond  Borders project.)  Later, after things had
definitely  turned adversarial and my faith in my fellow man (well, some of
my  fellow  men,  anyways) was being severely tested (for several years), I
sent out word through the lawyers to try to get access to, and recover that
stuff.   Well  -  guess what the official word that came back down the line
was?   It was that the tape library had been reorganized, and that all that
stuff  had  been thrown out and/or destroyed.  Uh huh.  And sometimes, pigs
fly.
So  that's why I'm kind of leery about anybody anywhere profiting from that
stuff.   As  long  as  all that stuff is actually dead and gone and buried,
well,  that's  life  (so  to  speak).  But if anything ever resurfaces that
shouldn't,  well, that would be unfortunate and puzzling and unsettling and
unkosher,  wouldn't  it?   And  in all good conscience (I'd like to believe
that  I  still  have mine, even if critics and Discussion Forum writers and
other  former  acquaintances  may have lost theirs), I'd have to try and do
something about it.  Thanks again for writing.

Sincerely,

Rik Emmett

There  we  are.   No  Beyond  Borders on CD.  And, no Triumph reunion tour,
either.   My  second item involves any situation in which someone has their
post  expurgated  by  the  Rush-mgr.   Too  many people start whining about
censorship  and refer to the First Amendment.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but
the  First  Amendment DOES NOT state that your beleifs and opinions MUST BE
posted  in  TNMS.   State  them  if you wish, but to claim that Rush-mgr is
violating your civil rights if she chooses not to include them is silly!

That is all.

<A NAME="2040011">Subject: Geddy interview part 3</A>

I'll be in Canada on a fishing trip till next week so I'll include a couple
of questions today. (From the Dec '96 Guitar School)  

The Third question is were Geddy solves the many mysteries of His Basses!!!!

GS---  How about amplification?

Geddy Lee---  I didn't use any live amps this time.  I used a combination of
DI's and speaker simulators: a demeter tube direct, a palmer speaker
simulator, and a SansAmp.   During the early stages of the bed tracks, we
fiddles around with various pieces of equipment, but this setup worked best.
I've done it this way before, but I think the combination of those three
things created enough of an amp sound that I found very satisfying.  I've
never had that experience in the past.  Usually I've felt like there was
something missing.

GS---  So what gear will you take on the road?

Geddy Lee---

I'll still use my Trace Elliot Quatra 4vr amps and the Trace Elliot GP12SMX
preamp, and I'd like to take the SansAmp/Palmer conbination, too, Because I
think It will work better with some venues' PA systems.  I'm going to
experiment with it in rehearsals.

GS---  Tell us about your first ever bass.-a Corona, wasn't it?

Geddy Lee---  Right.  I bought it from the local music shop for like 35
bucks, when I was around 14 or 15.  My mother loaned me the money.  I wanted
a bass, and that one looked good [laughs].  And then I had a Hagstrom, which
I used right up through the early incarnations of Rush, when I got a '69
Fender Precision.  Once we'd gotten our first record deal, I had enough
money to buy a Rickenbacher 4001, which I'd always wanted because of
watching Chris Squire and Paul McCartney.  I liked the fact that the "Ricky"
had a separate control for the treble pickup and and for the bass pickup.  I
used those for years until I started playing a Steinberger, which was for a
strange reason:  It was physically easier for me to get in and around around
my keyboards using the smaller bass.  It was lighter, it didn't whack into
my other mics, and it was ergonomically easier to get around my gear during
that heavy keyboard period.  But the sound just wasn't good enough; it was
too limiting.  It's a good practice bass, though, whenever I travel I
usually take it with me.  And then I went to Wals for a few years; our
producer Peter Collins, had introduced me to them, and I'd used one of his
on [1985's] POWERWINDOWS.  I'd heard them before; Percy Jones from Brand X
used one, and I loved that sound.  That's when I also started using lighter
gauge strings, which gave a little more snap to my top end. So I used those
until COUNTERPARTS; then I went back to the Fender Jazz, which I'd also used
on at least half of MOVING PICTURES.  Like on "Tom Sawyer" --a lot of people
think thats the "Ricky", but it's the Jazz.

Well, there is onlt one question left and I'll post that when I get back
from my trip.  See y'all later,

	In the words of the current WWF world heavyweight champion Stone
Cold Steve Austin (whom I have met), "Oh, Hell Yeah!!!" 

	Brother, I have felt that way for the last several tours. It is
such a routine, they might as well phone in the end of the show...it is
always:   Spirit>Sawyer>YYZ. 
	All of which are awesome songs, but lets mix it up a little
guys! The Dead would do a different show every night. One could go see 6
Grateful Dead shows in a row without hearing the same song twice, and by
the 7th night, you might hear 1 or 2 tunes from night #1. 

	Metallica always does 4 or 5 different tunes from night to
night, so it is possible to go & see 2 or 3 shows in a row and not hear
the same exact thing each evening. Page/Plant do the same thing. Now I
understand the constrictions of an enormous light & laser exhibition and
showing films is not conducive to "mixing the set up" from night to
night. Perhaps Rush is like a lot of bands that wish to perfect a
setlist from night to night, and stick to what they feel works. And that
is fine, I have no problem with that. But from tour to tour, C'mon!

	Rush has 16 incredible records to choose from, not a lot of
bands can say that. A little variety would be embraced by everyone. Oh
to hear "Anthem", "New World Man", "Bastille Day", or even "Time Stand
Still" once again. I won't push my luck by requesting "Kid Gloves". And
do not be so foolish as to read into this as Broon & I hate Rush or
should stay home, as many of you inevitably will. We have been
supporting Rush for many years, a little variety from tour to tour would
be nice, (but not required.) Cool?

	Wouldn't it be nice if Rush put out a live CD set at the end of
every tour as a souvenir for all of us, the diehards. Make it a complete
show, beginning to end, warts & all, they can pick one stop that they
felt was the best. Sell it only over the net, or limited edition-like.
It would not sell a million copies, so do not press a million. It would
most certainly sell 100,000 copies at least (wouldn't YOU buy one?), and
it would thwart the evil bootleggers at the same time. 

	Just a thought. Geddy & Alex....make it happen. We know ya read this.

	METALLICALLY yours in allegiance,

	Bryan C
	(giant Sandman mark/Washington Capitols friend.... and fan)

	ps.... Did anyone see Van Halen on Howard Stern's "E" show
Monday & Tuesday night? Was that not scary? Eddie is braindamaged....no
question.

Doesn't he also own and use one of those Godin guitars, which I think is 
called an Acousticastor, because it has a piezo pickup in addition to the 
"regular" electric pickups.  This gives (obviously) electric and acoustic 
flavors to the sound (and can be mixed or separated).  I believe I remember 
seeing it live on the T4E tour.  In the tour program there are photos from 
the "Half the World" video which show Alex playing both a PRS and the 
Godin.  Also, the guitar for "Closer to the Heart" isn't a nylon string 
guitar live, is it?  Isn't it a steel string Ovation?

Just a possibility...in The Camera Eye, is it possible that Geddy said
"morning Doug" as in Bob & Doug McKenzie?  The reason I ask is that both
Great White North & Moving Pictures came out the exact same year, 1981. 
They could have recorded both at the same recording studio & the guy who
plays "Doug" (don't know if it was Moranis or the other guy) came in & said
"Hello" & as a joke Geddy responded "Morning Doug".  I'm not saying it
doesn't sound like Gov or Guv but who (or what) is a Gov/Guv?  Not flaming
anyone who hears Gov/Guv, cuz I'm not even sure when I hear it...Geddy is
somewhat away from the mike and what is said is difficult to
discern...hence my curiosity within the context of the timeframe of the two
albums.
Any thoughts or clues................

Even though nobody asked for it, here's my $.02 on opening songs...

I agree with choices like SOR, Big Money, and Animate, but how about 
Dreamline?  It started off the last tour with a bang, and pretty much 
set the pace for the whole show.  I think Test for Echo or Driven would 
be cool choices, too.
And of course, I can't forget 2112.  It opened up the PW tour, I think 
(at least it does on a few of my PW boots), and what better song to open 
up a show with?

On an entirely unrelated note, here's a Rush sighting which I don't 
think anyone's mentioned yet.  During games at Yankee Stadium, each guy 
on the Yankees comes to bat to their own choice of music.  Chuck 
Knoblauch comes up to Big Money.  Anybody else hear this?  Does anyone 
else know of other pro athletes who are Rush fans?

I saw them at the El Paso '96 show.  During Neil's drum solo, I had
binoculars watching him (gives me chills each time I see the Rhythm
Method).  He dropped his right stick at a crucial point in the solo and
his eyes got huge with a look of worry and I thought to myself, "He's
gonna mess up".  But in less than a second, his face went back to the
serious look he always has, he grabbed another stick, and continuted the
solo without any hesitation or noticeable break in the performance.  His
left arm never stopped playing.  It happened so quick, I wasn't sure it
really happened so I looked around the stage and sure enough, there was
the lost drum stick at the base of his kit and it remained there for the
rest of the show.  He covered the mistake so well, that no one noticed.
I've asked dozens of people that attended that show if they saw him drop
the stick and not one of them noticed.  Did anyone else see this?

Funny, I was thinking on a practically similar line this after
noon and was going to post the idea on this list.  I think this would be a
good idea to have a list of members saying in one line, what they like
about rush, whether it be songs, lyrics, albums, tours, personal traits
physically, personally, or musically.  What I was thinking is that it
could be a list of 2,112 non repetitious responses.  They could all be
sent in to some one willing to sort through them and send them back.  To
save space it would probably be good to simply have the list and not the
full from:, Date:, subject: introductions that normally precede posts. 
Also maybe there could be issue 2112 pt.1, 2... if the list is too long
for one mailing.  Just my idea.

<A NAME="2040028">Subject: Tai Shan - A Wonderful Song!</A>

I've been reading TNMS for sometime now and never really
thought about writing until I started noticing many people saying
that they weren't crazy about "Tai Shan". I think this is a wonderful
song and I can't understand how anyone wouldn't like this song!?!
When I first heard this song, I felt that it was the best song for making
you feel like you were experiencing everything that Neil was! Since I'm 
sure that Neil wrote this song about his experiences in the Orient, I felt
like I was there with him. And in true Alex and Geddy form, the music
complements the words. I always feel that Neil is trying to get a certain
point(s) across in each song. I feel that if a musician/lyricist can get his
point across and make you feel the way he wanted you to, then he had
accomplished his goal. Does anyone else agree with me? I feel the words 
and music in this song work so beautifully together. I think if you don't like
this song, you're missing the emotions, and visions Neil is trying to get across
to you. Perhaps another listening is in order. Or maybe a visit to China would
help! Close your eyes when you listen this time, and imagine for a moment you
are seeing what the words are telling you Neil saw. Imagine how he felt! It was
obviously an experience profound enough for him to write a song about it!

I love all Rush songs and thoroughly enjoy reading TNMS postings. Its 
interesting to me to see all the different opinions and interpretations of 
the band and their music. HYF is full of songs with meaning. Even if my 
interpretations are different from everyone elses, TNMS is a great forum for 
getting a different perspective on a song. If you are not a Tai Shan fan, try 
listening with a different perspective.

Anyway... I would think after playing Closer to the Heart for over 20
years in every concert rhey've ever played does get a little old but you
almost expect that song when you go see RUSH, and so do a lot of fans
who go to the concerts and don't know all the osngs like we do...:)  I
think the Boys would like to keep as many of their fans happy with a
diverse selection of song (Hey, take a look at this time around, they'
added 2112 (INCLUDING DISCOVERY, and the ORACLE!!!), as well as Natural
Science, although NS was missing a few parts... but that's okay...:)  It
was still a rocker...

Okay, so I'm not going crazy... I brought this up with a friend of mine,
I poped the FBN CD the player and skipped to In The End, and sat there,
and when it came through I'm all OK, listen carefully, what is that
doubling the guitar?  He listened for a moment then he exclaimed loudly,
It's a KAZOO!!! And he went all off about how much Rush kicks ass for
making a little insturment like a Kazoo actually usefull, That'd be a
trip wouldn't it, The Boys playing In The End, and Ged comes out with a
little kazoo during the solo... Definatley a picture perfect moment... 
Anyway, I went on to tell him about the 1/4" plywood that Neil used in
YYZ, and he is beginning to wonder what else the Boy's have used...
sounds like we're going tape by tape (I do that anyway cause I have all
the albums in my car and I listen to them all about every 5 or 6 days or
so) I just started over so I'll keep ya posted if I don't get into a
wreck!

The part of Geddy Lee will be played by Cher.   (You are either laughing

This may seem to be back-tracking, but...
1-I notice in 'Freewill' that Geddy says "if you choose
not to decide you still have made a choice" but the
lyric sheet inside the album clearly say "you cannot
have made a choice".  Did the band do some inter-
views or something that influenced them to change
the song at some point?
2-I received a 15-question quiz from a guy nicknamed
'flame' where he asked me to name the first Rush al-
bum where Geddy sang his own backup vocals.  I
responded >>Rush<< since I thought I heard Geddy
doing this on a couple of songs on their debut effort,
but 'flame' said it was on 'Presto'.  I wondered if any-
one knew for sure?  Thanks, though, 'flame'--your
quiz was informative.
3-I was wondering if anyone had experimented with
stereo systems and come up with the optimum set-
up for playing Rush albums, CDs, or cassettes?

<A NAME="2040034">Subject: The Billings Metrapark</A>

Hello! Every now and then, I feel the need to whine and bitch and
complain about our beloved Billings Metrapark. As I've mentioned time
and time again, the Billings Metrapark sucks royal ass when it comes to
concerts. I say this because 98% of the concerts are Country. Metrapark
holds around 11,000 people and is located out here in Billings, Montana.
Garth Brooks will be coming here sometime in the summer. I HATE country
music, but I will on rare occasions tolerate some of Garth's older
stuff. But, you won't catch me dead listening to his newer albums! A few
days ago, the very front page of the Billings Gazzette(our main
newspaper) read something like: "GARTH BROOKS SELLS OUT 4 CONCERTS AT
METRA!" For much of the population, this is about the most exciting
event to occur in the Montana/Wyoming region in years. Because of the
extremely high demand, and to keep things fair, Garth Brooks himself
organized some stupid ass raffle system for purchasing concert tickets.
I got the joy of seeing nearly everyone in the population prancing
around with a bright pink band around their wrist to signify that they
had received a "raffle number." So, four shows have been booked, four
shows have been sold out.  What exactly is the deal with this guy? I
mean, for the most part, the man doesn't even write his own songs. The
Billings media has made damn sure to point out over and over again that
Garth has been declared by some organization, "music entertainer of the
year." How does someone earn this title exactly? Much of it comes down
to publicity. Commericalized!

This whole situation brought to light one of the many reasons why I love
Rush so much. I could go into some philosophical speech, but I think all
of you know what I am trying to get at. The following question
summarizes it: How many Garth Brooks "TV specials" have been on the past
few years? I think it's in the quadrillions now.

Go Garth!!! Screw that. GO GEDDY!!!

I recall looking at a listing of the rock charts sometime in early '83 and
seeing New World Man at the top.  Numero Uno.  Of course this was the rock,
and not the general chart.

As for Limelight, Tom Sawyer or Subdivisions not charting higher than Take Off
  Aren't the charts based on singles sold.  I understand the songs respective
chart positions if that's the case.  I don't think the Great White North sold
nearly as many albums as Moving Pictures or Signals.

Another way to look at the whole deal is that I still hear Tom Sawyer &
Limelight on the radio (to my chagrin- I'd rather hear Driven or Carve Away
The Stone now) and not Take Off.

Does Billboard have a website w/ archives?
