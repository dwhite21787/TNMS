Ok, well, there's been enough discussion here on the list about a name
for our beloved Digest, so it's time to put your votes where your fingers
are!  I've compiled a list of the most likely candidates below.

I'd like whoever is interested to cast a single vote for their choice.
The entry with the most votes will become the new name of the list.
One of our list members, David Conley, has graciously agreed (offered,
even) to tally the votes for this.

TO VOTE:  Send mail containing the name of the Digest you like best (only
one!) to:

    dmc@milton.u.washington.edu

PLEASE do not send any vote mail to the administrative address, or to the
list address.  Any vote mail here or to the list will be ignored!

Voting will be short and sweet; Thursday and Friday.  Any votes sent in
after Friday cannot be guaranteed to be counted, so vote early!  (David's
on the west coast, so it gives you the maximum time to respond, at least
in the continental US.)  The votes will be tallied at the beginning of
next week, and I'll post them either Tuesday or Wednesday.

Here's the list of potential names; I've purposely shied away from the
direct usage of any song title - I figured we had more imagination than
that.  One title made it in on sheer number of times mentioned.  Some
I really like, others don't do much for me.  But, it's a list of, by, and
for the people, so it's up to you to decide.

  1) The Daily Shreve
  2) Signals
  3) Temple Paper
  4) The Overture
  5) The Cyberspace Rush Review
  6) The National Midnight Star
  7) The Shmeng Borough Times
  8) The Real Relation
  9) The Underlying Theme
 10) The Rush Method

Manager,

Good day and welcome to day 18!

I haven't posted in quite awhile so I thought I'd better get to it.
Recent discussion in the forum has been about the influence of Rush
in our lives. For some people it seems they over do it a bit thinking
that Rush are the best and everything else is worthless. The main argument
that these people use is that Neil's lyrics are intelligent, meaningful,
and go beyond the minds of most people who listen to music only to
"dance and mate." :) In the other corner are people who say that Rush are
good but are not the only band that can make quality music. These people
tend to stress the 'feel' of the song is very important. IMHO I think
that the music cannot be one or the other. To steal a metaphor from
Hemispheres; music should be the Sphere. This is where both emotion and
reason are held in balance. As the perfect song should be, lyrics convey
the reason and music the emotion with sometimes a little crossover. Therefore
I should state that I "like" Rush because the intelligent lyrics pleases my
mind and the emotional music pleases my heart. Anyway I just had to say
something about this before it was not a controversial topic. (I've been
a little late on my readings.)
On to other things- When I saw Rush at Cal Expo in Sacramento last summer,
I heard an interview on the radio with Howard Ungerleider (sp?) , the
lighting and show director. Most of the interview was how the show was
going to be set up to be done outside, but a question came up on a new
Rush album. He said that after the tour ended, 6/31/90, they would take 5-6
months off and start work on a new album during the beginning of 1991 which
will probably be out during the late summer.
As for alternate titles how about:

"The Diary of Alerxst"
"Never turn your back on a Monster!"
"Freewill"
"Exit... Stage Write"

(I know some of these are corny, but it's all I could think of!)

Until later...

Last time I saw Alex play it, it looked like he was playing
"Spirit of Radio" like he always does, except he didn't use a
wah-wah on the solo. The intro still looked and sounded the same to me :
pick the high E, hammer-on/pull-off the 2nd fret, then hammer-on
the 3rd fret B string; repeat except now instead of
hammer-on/pulling-off the 2nd fret, you use your pinky to hit the 5th
fret, high E; repeat the first phrase, then the last phrase is to hit
the high E, and hammering-on/pulling off two notes : the 4th fret E to
2nd fret E, to open E, and then hammering-on to the 3rd fret B.
Alex says in an interview a while back that in the intro, there's not
a lot of pick movement, since you really only pick the high E and the
rest are hammer-ons and pull-offs.

Oops, sorry, that's lick.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone out there
knows how the very first riff after the intro to YYZ is played.  I have the
second and third, but not the first.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks
much.  Also, someone had asked what Rush's musical education was.  I had
heard that Neil has a PhD in drums.  I don't know about the other two.

>X-Mailer: Mail User's Shell (7.0.4 1/31/90)

	Yesterday Jason Bold asked how Alex Lifeson used to
play the opening riff for "Spirit of Radio" compared to how he
now plays it.  Jason thinks that an open E string used to be
struck, and now Lifeson is playing the E note on the B string.
	I don't know how Lifeson plays it, but it is easier using
the open E.  It sounds smoother and more even using no open strings,
though.  Perhaps his playing has progressed to the point where he
can do it the more difficult way, and if he feels it sounds better
he'll play it that way.  I can play it (OK, a little sloppy) with
the open E, using no pull-offs, but it's kind of choppy, and the open
E doesn't sound the same as the other notes.  You'll notice that
many experienced guitarists and bassists avoid open strings sometimes.
	By the way, I don't think your explanation of "what notes are
played" was very clear.  Did you mean the sequence is
	F#, E, D, E, A,  E,  D, E,
	F#, E, D, E, G#, F#, E, D	?

	This is how I think it is played.  Any dissent?  Agreement?

I just finished having lunch with a co-worker of mine who is friends with
Neil Peart.  He showed me a letter that Neil just sent him.  Neil is
currently on another one of his bicycle journeys through Turkey, Cameroon,
and countless other places(In fact, Neil sent a snapshot of himself with
his bicycle in Istanbul.  It was quite amusing.).  The line that caught
my eye was that when Neil is done with his biking tour, sometime in November,
he said "we will be going back into the studio to work on our new album".
This is not a rumour!  This was a letter directly from Neil, and he said it
himself!  So, are there any ideas as to when the album will be released?
Anyone?  Anyone?

Hi,
  A few things...

* Someone asked about the boyz educational background and whether they were EEs
  Someone else asked whether Neil had been an English teacher.  From what I've
  read, Neil and Ged dropped out in early high school to pursue a career in
  music, (thank God!  Imagine Ged as an EE?).  Neither learned to read or write
  music until just a couple years ago.  Neil finished high school and attended
  a Junior College for a brief time until he left to pursue music, (in England).
  He never taught English, although he has read and critically evaluated
  hundreds of books and written a few small works himself.  Maybe this person
  was thinking of Sting, who actually was an English teacher for awhile.  After
  a year of small-time studio work and a few small bands in England, Neil
  returned to Canada.

* Someone noticed that at the beginning of Broon's Bane on ESL, Ged says,
  "Mr. Alex Lifeson".  It sounded interesting so I checked it out on my CD.
  After EQing the heck out of the left channel, I heard, "..Lifeson on Classical
  Guitar" during the first couple of seconds of the tune.

* About back issues.  I think it's a great idea!  Thanks to whoever was
  involved.  I have been saving every Rush posting for the past 2 years,
  including the postings prior to the formal establishment of the mailing list.
  (to the back issues mgr: if you need anything specific, let me know).

* About the mailing list name...I have read all the proposals and most sound
  far too fanatical and downright obscure.  How about, "The Rush Mailing List"?
  It's simple, descriptive and easy to remember.  "The National Midnight Star"
  is just a random line from a song and has nothing to do with the band or

[ While it is a line from Red Lenses, it's also a reference from SCTV; their
  sensational rag, a spoof of The National Enquirer and The Star. :rush-mgr ]

  their true spirit, (my opinion).  The only name I really liked is,"The
  Daily Rush".  (Hey, we all know the band chose a drug-related name, right?
  Why not keep with the theme?)

* Thanks to the guys who mentioned the "Rock Fantasy Comic" and 3 Jap imports.
  If anybody hears more, be sure to post it.

*  Has anybody heard about the ESPN coverage of the Maluby Celebrity Tennis
   Jam from September?  If anyone has any info, please post it quick!

*  About the new album...A friend of a friend who attended the Tennis Jam BBQ
   asked Ged if they were working on the next album.  Ged replied, "Yup." and
   walked away.  I guess that means good news for us!

* By the way, the following is yet another ad for "The Spirit of Rush" fanzine:
  It's a super high quality Rush fan magazine published in England a few times
  a year.  Trust me, SUBSCRIBE!  I can assure you that you will get much more
  than your money's worth.  Each issue usually exceeds 50 pages and contains
  rare pictures, reviews, previews, news, letters and ads.  Subscriptions for
  the next 4 issues cost $16 in US/Canada.  US/Canada subsciptions are
  available from:

    Ray Wawryzniak

 <Personal checks payable to Ray Wawryzniak>

  Back issues are available at $4.00 per issue, (11 issues).  Subsciption is
  past 2000 now, and still climbing.  Tell him, I sent you!

                                                      Take care,
                                                  - Chris Michael
