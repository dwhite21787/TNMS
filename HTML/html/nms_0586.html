Well, happy holidays everyone.  Just a short reminder that yes, the
T-shirts are in and if you have mailed in for one, please be patient, you
should have one by the end of next week.  (Some may have already
received them - let's hear what you think!)  

Also, there's some Rush news at the end of this digest concerning the
next album and the producer.  (Thanks Ken, you did it again bud!)

    I recently reintroduced the likes of Neil to my eldest brother.
His initial reaction was one of frustration, but he soon put Neil's
style into a unique perspective. He said that you have to listen to him with the
idea in mind that he doesn't drum along and just keep the beat, but rather
that he takes command and, unlike many drummers, makes the next thing happen
rather than waiting on it.

I just thought that THAT was the best way to describe the style that I had
heard yet.  You really can't sit back and play Neil's stuff. It requires
anticipation and precision. I realize that there are hundreds (at least) of
drummers that can execute what Neil plays, but there are few drummers who can
take charge of the sound that way.

   I have to compare some of the greats that were/are capable of that. First,
the granddaddy of them all, Gene Krupa. Gene took over a song like few
drummers before him. He took what could be considered a primitive view of
music, that the drums should be what moves you, be it in dance, mood or
whatever.
   I am sure that there were many drummers between Gene and Buddy Rich, but
Buddy is the next guy to portray that attitiude. The next individual I can
think of in the train moving towards 1992 is a man named John Bonham.
John took the idea of Rock-n-roll drumming to new heights, making us realize
as Gene and Buddy did, that druming could well stand on its own without other
insruments. I have always felt that drumming was the difference. While any
instrument could play the blues, any instrument could lay down a jazz or blues
chord progression, it took rythm (a rythm section) to make it rock-n-roll.
Please don't flame me on this, so many people have shown me songs that
differ from this idea I'm almos blue, but I still think that if you want
rock-n-roll you better have somebody tapping, banging, shaking, or plucking
a rythm.
    I am sure that I have left out many influences in lives (mine, Neil's, etc.)
but I think the picture and the styles stand for themselves. Steve Gadd is
more than worthy of the praise I give these others as are Smitty Smith,
Will Calhoun, and I could go on....OH and Louis Belson and .....others.

    The point is, the greats share an attitude, sort of a cockiness that
you don't find in the average pianist. Oh well I guess that's my $.02 worth.
That could even cost me $.05 I think. If you have constructive remarks to
the contrary or in agreement, let's discuss.

In the catagory of "things that make you go hmmmmmmmmmm..."

Isn't it strange to think that the words "In the dying days of the war"
could turn out to be the days when everyone here is claiming victory.
The dying days of the war.....are afterwards.

                                      Just a thought.

Hi ho.

Well, after a rather unsuccessful day of Christmas shopping, I came
across this CD, which I bought (naughty me)...  What does anyone think
of it?

Rush, 'Mardi Gras'
Live Recording, 23 Feb 1992,  New Orleans, LA

Goregon Music
(Australia)

It is a 2 CD set, with 18 tracks between them.  I paid USD $59.00.

Was I ripped off??

Thanks,

The Neil drum parts thread is very interesting. When I started to
listen to Rush, Neil was impressive, but not *quite* as impressive as
he'd been made out to be.

The basic parts are very straightforward in most cases -- Tom Sawyer
sounds pretty simple to pound out. He gets fancy in the drum solos. I
think one thing he does is use a very wide selection of drums and
percussion, so there are some non-standard sounds, even for him.
Unlike say Alan White who has a trademark snare. The rich variety of
sounds, even synthesized ones, is great.

Bass lines -- Geddy is a very understated player, he doesn't do
grooves very much. I like Force 10. Free Will is another powerful one.

The keyboard lines seem to sound very easy to play! :)

I saw a tape of Caress of Steel -- should I have gotten it? Is this
album any good?

Well, there have been some talk about relative talent lately and hard
solos on bass... I think Neil is a very talented drummer and has
excellent chops, but I was disappointed when I was younger to hear
Dave Weckl for the first time, because he played with more dexterity
than my Idol did, but I came to realize that Dave playing Neil stuff
would not be Dave, and Neil playing Dave stuff would not be Neil, so
I stopped comparing and just ENJOYED BOTH.. so anyway, the moral of the
story is: when you're walking on eggs, don't hop.. no wait a minute,
I guess the moral of the story is enjoy the music, enjoy the talent,
enjoy the SHOW.

As far as people judging guitar players by their speed (I think Gerry
brought this up), I really disagree here.. yeah, Malmsteen is very
very fast, but I listened to his newest album, and all the solos were
actually horrible to me. There was absolutely no feel whatsoever..
Each note sounded like it didn't fit with a grand design (except of
course speed). This is where Alex shines, as far as I'm concerned.
I've enjoyed Alex's work from day 1 of my Rush enjoyment, and I can
tell you he is a very smart guitarist. He knows his limits, but
he can really play mean solo.. As far as solos with feel that fit
into the framework of the song, I believe that Alex is a diamond
in the rough. Listen to Ghost of A Chance, Marathon, The Pass,
La villa, lots of his work on Caress, etc.. The list goes on and on.

Geddy lee: the tower of power, too sweet to be sour, the man of the
hour!! He is sweet... as far as bass work I find tough, lets
see.. most of it!! :)

Actually, his later stuff technically speaking is relatively easy,
but to duplicate the nuances, slides, and stuff that makes Geddy
Geddy is just way beyond me..

(1 being hardest)
1. Analog Kid
2. Circumstances
3. Middle Town Dreams
4. Big Money (just when you think you've got it, try singing it!!!)
5. Digital Man (another fret burner from signals)
6. Camera Eye (I've never really tried to learn this cuz I am afraid)
7. Anthem
8. Hemispheres (Theres some neato stuff in here)
9. YYZ (probably should be higher, but the numbers have lost meaning
me!)
10. Just about everything else

Well, the sand man is about to pay me a visit, so take it easy, and
sorry for the long post..
Chris

To get a letter to Neil, write to:

      Ask A Pro
      c/o Modern Drummer Magazine
      870 Pompton Ave.
      Cedar Grove, NJ 07009

      ATTN: Neil Peart

   Don't just write bunches of letters asking him about mohawks and boat
gangsters. They should relate to drumming. Otherwise, I feel Modern
Drummer would dump them. To my knowledge, the preceding is not MD's policy,
but I'd hate to lose Ask A Pro due to an overwhelming number of "Neil,
what's your favourite kind of Cap'n Crunch?" letters.

My number 1 is "Turn The Page".  It's difficult enough to play WITHOUT
having to sing it at the same time!

I just heard that Rush have decdided that Rupert Hine will NOT produce
the next album.  Unfortunatley my source would not tell me who would produce
the next record saying only that it is confidential.  (I should be able to
get it out of him within a couple of weeks).. However, he did confirm
that the boyz will start working on new material January 15 and the
target date for release is September 15.  I'll post more information
when I get it.
