Hey guys n' gals, I'm not on this serv any more, but I thought you'd all like
to know that Rush will be coming to Boston (or  more precisely, Cambridge)
this Sunday (May 9) for an induction ceremony into the Harvard Lampoon's
newly created "Musicians of the Millenia".  Rush will be the first inductees.
The man on the radio (BCN for you Bostonians) said that Lampoon will induct
them based on their "musicianship, sense of humor, and personal style."
The ceremony is at 7pm on Bow St at the Lampoon's building there, and is
open to the public.

If I bring my guitar, d'ja think they'd be able to autograph it?

This Sunday, May 9th, Rush will be in Cambridge, MA at the Harvard
Lampoon.  I heard this on the radio.  Evidently the Lampoon is giving
Rush the "Band of the Millenium Award".  I have no idea what this is,
or the particulars, but that's what they said on the radio.
Unfortunately I have to go home for Mom's day, but I thought I'd let
everyone else who is in the area who subs to TNMS know, who wants to
go check it out.  If anyone doesn't know where the Lampoon is, I can
give you directions (email me).  I go to MIT, which is right down the
street.

<A NAME="675003">Subject: A Memo to a higher office</A>

Hy From HaploPeart,

  Time for a little ramble as I have a few things to say today:

Best lyrical Albums:
   IMHO--Hold your Fire, Moving Picture and Presto
         Closely followed by 2112, RTB, and COS
    I just think that the music and the lyrics sort speak in a certain way
    on these albums.

Biggest Extreme in Songs:
   This is sort of a large and subjective catagory but I'll bite
2112 and Ghost of a chance, or Witchhunt and Rivendell
agree disagree

Break in period:
  I found that I did not really need that much of a breakin period at all
Each time I bought a new piece bt RUSH I just immediately loved it.
Then again I am probably one of the worlds biggest fanatics for rush
the Boyz get 99.9999999999% of by streros playing time most days and I have
used them as subjects of papers in classes many times, just to have
an excuse to listen to them while doing homework< I have great anylisis
of 2112 if anyones interested.

Rush and Box sets;

  I don't see our Boyz doin' a box set for quite a while in fact probably
never,  Box sets(ok except AeroSmith) ususally come at the end of a bands
life nad are an indicator of that eneding.  I hate hearing a band is
workin' on a box set is really scares the hell out of me.  So I think a box
set for the boyz is at least 20?(I hope!!, Yeah right, Then Geddt won't
think he's gonin' Bald he will be) years away(Imagine what volume of
Nms we would be up to).  Anyway no box set for quite a while I hope.

My rush dreams:

  I have two:
    1:  I go on exchange for a semester to a collage in Toronto and
        meet a girl and fall in love.  Easy so far.  now the dream
        This girl turns out to be the daughter of one of the Boyz.
        We get married and I join the Rush Family.
    2:  (I actually feel asleep and had this one once)
        I am a song and poetry writer, inspired by the same sorts
        of things as Peart, so you can see where this is goin'.
        I write this ultra_cool and Rush like song and record it.
        Rush(ie and esspecially Niel) hears the demo and takes an
        interest in my carrer.  I play openning for the next tour
        and proceed into an awesome carrer of my own and have a
        electoric mail news letter started in my honor, ect ect ect..

This is gettin long as latta for now,
latta,

I was listening to TZ last night on my nice Sony v-6 headphones when
I detected a screw up. The guitar line appears to come in a bit early,
but only for a split second.  I think it is right before "enter this world
of imagination."  It is very slight...but there.

I had a dream a few weeks ago about the new cover album of "Critical
Mass" that Hugh will design.. So here goes.....

Basically, it was a picture of the contenents, oceans, clouds,
looking downward from the circumferance of the ozone.. It was weird,
and the whole thing about it is that I had this album in my hands...
didn't get the chance to hear any tunes or catch the l

Also, I don't know if anyone is aware but I heard on the radio that rush
will be presented a award for the best, technical, long term and cool
band in boston, mass.. I'm not sure if it's this weekend, but it'
s open to the public and from what I've heard that this award is only
been presented to band a century ago.. details are sketchy.....

but if someone knows more, please email me..

thanx

Hello fellow Rushians,

	I was just wondering if there is anyone out there that has written
a letter to Neil Peart and gotten a response from him.  I am not just talking
about the basic "Gee I think your great and I worship you" fan mail. I am
talking about an actual letter with some point to it.  As in his suggestions
for a drummer wanna-be and/or a letter that comments on subject material he
has covered in some of his songs.  If anyone out there has gotten a response
from Neil himself PLEASE either coment on the NMS or feel free to respond to
my private email address below.

Thanks all!

   [ Neil's actually pretty good about answering fan mail.  A lot of
     people who've mailed him through Modern Drummer have gotten responses
     back from him, mostly postcards.  	                   :rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="675007">Subject: one last note on black holes (I promise)</A>

Greetings RUSH-land,

	Sorry for the non-rush content, but I have to come to the
defense of the guy who started all this black hole stuff.  I didn't
see his post, but apparently some guy wrote in something about the
physics of black holes and mentioned that their huge gravitational
field even interacts with photons by virtue of their small, but finite
mass.  I _did_ read the last issue of NMS where everybody and his brother
attacked this guy for saying that photons have mass.  Well I'm surprized at
you guys -- of course photons have mass -- OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT INTERACT
WITH A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AT ALL!!!  Think about it.  m=E/c^2=h*nu/c^2.
Case closed.  It is true that photons have zero REST MASS, so if you were
travelling in the frame of the photon, you guys would be right, but I haven't
yet met anyone who has travelled the speed of light on the back of a photon
(except maybe those guys in the Diet Dew commercials).  So lighten up,
if something has energy, it has mass (wasn't it Einstein who said "Let there
be mass"?  ..no sorry, I think that was my mom's pastor). I have no other
complaints on the accuracy of the posts, but geez, get off this guy's
back and go read up on your special relativity.

Sorry I sent this out on the NMS, but I felt it would be a good gesture to
defend this guy, because apparently he was absolutely right (although, as I
said, I didn't read his original note).

The Harvard Lampoon is a satirical publication that has little if any
connection to Harvard's official student newspaper. It gave birth to
National Lampoon. At first, I wondered whether the Lampoon was actually
perhaps making fun of Rush with this award, but they sound sincere in
their admiration...

<A NAME="675009">Subject: Rush on MTV, Orioles and Rush, Light & Physics, Breakin period</A>

Hey all-

First of all, the only other time I've seen Rush on MTV week in Rock was
when they announced the top 10 grossing acts of 92, and Rush was 6th,
and that's not too bad considering the lack of 'major' advertising..
I do know that in every guitar/bass/drum mag out there, atlantic had
a 1 page ad for Rush, as well as Billboard..

Orioles.. hey Mark.. I heard limelight all the time last year, but didn't
hear it this year yet.. Supposedly, according to my friend Stacey whom
I usually go to the games, they only played 'Limelight' when Storm Davis
came out, usually as the pitcher between the starter and the closer,
which was around the 6th-8th innings.. Still, it was awesome to hear
limelight over the speaker system there.. brought tingles to my spine

Light and Physics.. well, I'm just a struggling EE major, and I know
that light supposedly has no mass, otherwise many equations would
fail.. However, just out of curiousity,  doesn't light impart momentum
(like the solar sails I've heard about - and no, not from sci fi movies).
Also, when light hit an object, doesn't it impart heat, thereby meaning
that the photons bombarding the object 'do' something to the object,
thereby implying mass.. I could be totally wrong. It has been 3 years
since I took Physics 3, and I am currently taking Quantum physics
(wish I had my book here), but my brain is on sensory overload..

And, the break-in period.. I usually am 'high' on one album for
a period, and when a new album comes out, the comparisons are there,
but it only takes a listen or two before I am totally hooked. Oddly
enough, PoW took the longest 'adjustment' for me, but yet now
I find it one of my favorites.. I must have been hooked on 2112
when I bought it.. *grin*

take it easy - Good luck on FINALS for all of us students..
I'll be around over the summer.. hopefully we'll keep up
the good posts and catch some new info on Critical Mass

-till later

Yo,
	First and foremost...good luck to everyone taking exams..Rush
will help you through..they did when I was a student...p/g and PoW were
ideal for blasting out during a break between the books.

With regards break-in periods..I wonder how many people don't really bother
with the lyrics for the first few listens..only concentrate on the music,
and then pay attention to the words once the music has `sunk in'. I realise
that this is a dangerous habit. I didn't particularly like Anagram (for Mongo)
musically, and hence missed out on Neil's witticisms.

>..as for Unplugged, of course it will never happen ("anything can happen?"
but we can dream, hey that's why we're here..but if Springsteen can go
gospel and country (check out Many Rivers to Cross and Achy Breaky Heart
on the latest leg of the Euro tour!) then why can't the boys ship in the
full orchestral accompaniment  from PoW and the Brass band from HYF..they
are unplugged..and it would be awesome..whaddya think? How about Rush
at the Royal Albert Hall? (only kidding!)..

p.s Saw a Roll-the Bones T-shirt while walking around Cambridge yesterday
lunchtime..seems like Summer is almost here.!

Berlin grueszt Ihr!
(Greetings from Berlin)

A few comments after waiting a month trying to get connected...

1.) You can all quit complaining about "there are no good radio stations in
my area."  Berlin is a classic rock wasteland.  Armed Forces Radio comes up
with something good every now and again (always a "hit," e.g. Hotel
California), but their format is News, Classic, silly announcements, Rap,
Dance, Country, more silly announcements, Punk, Heavy Metal, etc, and that
gets old fast.  Hell, it was a major victory to hear _Time is Tight_ and
_Classical Gas_ last night (on another station).

2.) I understand the arguments of the detractors of _Red Lenses_.  But I'm
quite fond of the song - excellent wordplays, Geddy's noodling at the end,
the way the group went from the drum solo to Red Lenses on the p/g tour.
Or maybe it's just because I study the former Soviet bloc and like the
allusion to governments having the people look through those rose (red)
colored glasses.

3.) Having been away for the last month, I'm also out of the loop as far as
the rarities collection goes.  Anyone?
Thanks in advance...

This is my response to the many people who have discussed their
first impresssions on RUSH albums.  When HYF and P first came
out, I did not like them enough to buy the disc.  This is from
someone who had never hated any earlier RUSH song (though I might
add I do not own the first three albums).  Of course I was only
hearing what the radio was playing.  Well, anyway, I happen to
come across P in a used CD shop and decided to purchase it.
Needless to say, I love it and feel like a complete idiot!  How
could any RUSH song be bad?  I am now searching for HYF (which
most stores don't even carry new anymore) and the first three to
complete my collection.

Side note:  I believe I may have the record for the longest time
between two RUSH concerts:  My first show was on the Signals tour
(Carrier Dome, Syracuse, NY) and my second show wasn't until the
RTB tour in Cincinnati and then Dayton, approximately 11 years!

Well good luck to all you .edu's (I myself am an .edu but I work
here, arghhhhh!!!!) during finals!

Go Habs!!!!!!!

Date: Wed, 5 May 93 10:12:10 CDT

Keep in mind the definition of the word "lampoon". The Harvard Lampoon is
widely known and respected for its humor, but for Rush to receive this award
from them is really a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is a compliment in that
it recognizes that they are well known and that there is frequently an
element of humor in their performances, i.e. roadies shooting nerf arrows at
Alex, etc. On the other hand, I think it could be interpreted as a slam at
them, because humor is not their main emphasis. It almost lowers them to the
level of Spinal Tap. I don't know for sure, but I think it is much more of a
compliment when they give an award to someone like Bill Cosby, for whom humor
is a major part of his persona. With them actually showing up to receive the
award, it will be very interesting to see how it is handled. It could go
either way, and I hope we will see some reports next week from readers who
are able to attend. By the way, I would really like to get a copy of the
Harvard Lampoon issue which features them. Send me e-mail if you are in a
position to do this. Thanks!

Well, I posted this little diddy in alt.music.rush, and saw someone
had posted a few here, so I figured I'd throw in a parody myself.

Pass the Brew

Well you can drink some juice
they say good health' s the key to good fortune
Joggers like to run
Drinkers seldom leave their home
But we don't like that juice
and sometimes we need something more
We reach into the fridge
Grab another cold draft brew

We go out to the store and take our chances
Beer is just the fear of many parents
That's why we drink beer called Narragansett
Pass the Brew

Why are we here?
Because there's beer.
Pass the brew.
Why does it foam?
We don't really know.
Pass the brew.

Beer should be cold as ice-
Why do long necks taste better than cans?
What more could be finer
than one cold as ice.
Well who would pay the price
for  beers that are much too expensive.
If there's some way we can drink
and just control our vice.

We come in from the cold and take our chances.
Beer is just the fear of many parents.
That is why we drink beer called Narragansett!
Pass the Brew....

Jack, pound two.
Get busy with some brew.
No drinking hats or wooden bats
No cogniac in big oak vats
Just the brew
Gonna drink till I'm on my back.
I'm seein' three of you- you dig?
I move around.
I can't talk straight. I take a swig.
Its hopps, barly
lots of carbo Charlie.
So who's afraid of getting real tardy.
Can't get a buzz from just a few.
Better drink homeboy
a brew's a brew from your freezer to your glude.

What's the deal? No more beer.
If the beer is hot- make it not
Drink some more, show us what you got.
What your holding
If the beers are cold
Don't get molding
It makes your hand smell golden;
It takes some time, to make it cold.
Stop drinking Boones.
The stores have a thousands different brands.
So get out there and drink
and pass the brew.
Get Dizzy!

Hope you all enjoyed it..
have a good summer for those leaving..
Chris

<A NAME="675017">Subject: prophet of profit</A>

Howdy ya'll,

  I've deleted the issue, but some one recently pointed out that many people
put *prophets* instead of profits in thier quotes from Spirit.. off of PW.
(Sorry for losing your name, oh source...)
  Well,  this is something I've often thought about.  I used to think that the
correct word was prophets...both as a reference to Simon and Garfunkels'
Sound of Silence..., and as a clever dig at radio station program directors who
dictate what is to be played, and thus, what will become hot.  The trendy
mouthpeices of the record industry are *prophets* of what we will end up buying
since we all march as mindless zombies to the dictates of fashion.
  However, the use of profits in the line *the words of the profits are written
on the studio walls...concert halls!!* also makes a great deal of sense.  Does
Neil envision an artist with song lyrics tacked in front of him, written by some
one else?  An artist who serves only as a piece of musical cheese/beef-cake?
(Insert your favorite no-talent here for an example)  Or perhaps since all
commercial radio stations are, by definition, run for profit, perhaps the
program director's written play list is the words (song titles to be played)
that mean profits for the station?
  What do others out there in the great big NMS extended family think?  (That
  I need to get a life is a valid response for e-mail only...)

Thanks,

Brent

<A NAME="675018">Subject: more physics near black holes</A>

	I am an astronomy/physics grad student, and I agree with most of
what Brent said. I just thought I'd point out two things:

	1) It's not really a star's initial mass (ie 1.44 - 6 solar masses as
	   Brent said)  that determines its fate- it's the core mass remaining
           either after the supernova explosion or the red giant stage.
           If the core of the star (remaining after either a supernova
           or red giant stage) is less than 1.44 solar masses, you get
           a white dwarf. If the core mass is between 1.44 and about 2.5
           solar masses you will have a neutron star. Above 2.5 or so, you
           get a black hole. The star itself could have an initial mass of
	   up to 100 solar masses (Eddington limit), but if it blows away
           enough of its mass in a supernova explosion, you may just find a
           puny white dwarf at the center.

	 2) We actually don't need Jean Luc Picard to measure the size of
            a black hole's event horizon. The event horizon depends on the
            mass of the black hole (which is NOT infinite, by the way). If
            the black hole is in a binary system, the companion star will
            will feel the graviational effects of the black hole, which can
            be measured observationally. Once we know the black hole's mass,
            getting the size of the event horizon is easy.

	 3) Frank Shu's book is very nice if you want to learn more about
            astronomy and black holes.

Just to keep this Rush related, most astronomers believe that Cygnus X-1 is
a black hole....

<A NAME="675019">Subject: hey all, school's over!</A>

Hello everyone,
	Well, took my diff eq's exam just now, and I'M DONE!!  BUT
when I heard Rush was accepting their award up across the river on
Sunday, I decided to stay the weekend.  I intend to take some great
pictures...ZOOM LENS!  (ha ha)
	Actually, this letter does have two points.  First, when I read
that Power Windows was going to be at Ronny V's in Miller Place, I was
so excited!  Ronny V's is right by my house--they are a bar & grill-type
place, with bands all the time, and very classic-rock oriented.  They get
a lot of promos from the rock stations on Long Island (that's where it
is, by the way, on Route 25A in Miller Place).  All in all, its a cool
place.  18 to get in, and rightnear the pool hall I play at.  Not that
you care!  :)
	Second, to respond to, er, Evil Super-Genius, Presto is also
my favorite Rush song.  I thought I was the only one--everyone I know makes
fun of me for it--but I love it.  It just has so MANY meanings in it.
"I look down into a million houses and wonder what you're doing tonight"
always makes me feel better, in a strange way, whenever I get lonely--
my boyfriend lives 600 miles from me, but the wong itself has so many
different things in it.  I completely agree; it's a very inspiring song.
Similar to the lines in Ghost of A Chance, "I don't believe in the stars
or the planets or angels watching from above, BUT..."  and then "I'm
not one to believe in magic..."  I guess, in a sappy, stretching it way,
you could take Presto as another one of Neils' almost love-songs.
But its a lot more than that. I guess I'm babbling now, so I'll stop,
becaus eI can't really find a way to say what I mean.  But yyes, someone
else finds Presto to be amazing.

	Thank you!  G'Night!

This was noticed and discussed on the NMS several times over the
last few years with no conclusion as to the connection.  One other
connection that Dan does not mention is the OTHER space station
called Babylon, where the Rastas hang.

I think that the Zion/Babylon dichotomy (I can't believe I just used that
word) is a classical one that both Peart and Gibson used to represent
different sides.  There are enough similarities to be very suspicious,
but at the times of the last discussions, no-one knew of any
Peart/Gibson connection.  Any new ideas?

Hy Fellow NMSers, and Crazy RushFans(tm),

     Here I am once again and hopefully will finish my mad
     Rush( *Grin* <:-]#, actually all pun intended) to finish up
     catching up on my NMS thoughts, that I am so far behind on.

     On to todays thoughts

Rush Unplugged:
    There  are reasons it should and should not be done that is
    not to be argueed, still my $0.02

    I would like to see i done as it would present a new and interesting
    side of the Boyz that we as fans mightlike to see.  I think that
    in the last twenty years they have doen enough stuff that they could
    pick out enough songs to fill an hour or so with acustic music.

    Possible list:
       1:  The Trees-With and extened Broons Bane
       2:  RivenDell-Its like a lost song that needs credit, heres a chance
       3:  Closer to the Heart-It could be done
       4:  Time Stand Still-Little help from Amiee Mann
       5:  Mystic Ryhums-Would adapt well I think
       6:  Manhattan Project-Also I think a good adaptation could be had
       7:  Freewill
       8:  Lakeside Park
       9:  Discovery+Presentation of 2112-so often dised live
      10:  Differnt Strings
      11:  Jacob's Ladder
      12:  Xanadu
      13:  Mission
      14:  Second nature
      15:  Prime Mover
      16:  Ghost of a Chance-Like there is one they would ever do this
      17:  available light
      18:  middle town dreams
      19:  Nearly every thing on HYF
      20:  Long shot Tom Sawyer
      21:  A new song written for the occasion

    Well I think ya get the point these is lots that could be done.

   Now why shouldn't it be done. because it would only serve to bring
   watchers to that bastard service (M)y(T)elevision(V)iewers suck.  Rush
   could only help them they could not help Rush at all the Boyz don't
   need 'em.  They have gotten plenty far with out 'em  Look at Us
   discusing it.  Rush has nothing to gain from the deal and would therefore
   comeout of the deal with very little, except some cheery Fans.

Related topic MTV:

  They keep saying the Music Revolution of the 90's will be televised. Well
  my question is who detiremines what the revolution is and the direction it
  takes.  MTV seems to think it is them and the record companies, I say
  NOT!!  It is or at least should be us.  MTV has become a slave to Industry
  and Trendyness(look what they did to Adam Curry, and John Noris), and
  it is high time we did something about it.
  Here is the Rush Content it is Up to us NMSers to let MTV know how we feel,
  By letters to the important people, and esspecially when Critical Mass
  arrives to live up to being a Critical Mass and call in massive requests
  for Rush Music Video's when ever possible.  MTV surrives by kissing
  A@@ and I think its time they kissed ours for once.  I remember once
  MTV was pretty decent, they actually helped Disco(uhg, I hate that word)
  end and brought back Real Rock, lets force them to do it again, end this
  Pop' Hip Hop Kris Kross Rap Funk Garbage and Bring the real stuff back.
  What is pop?  It no longer what people by the most it's what's played
  the most on MTV and Radio, to get people to by it, If Rush, Metalica,
  MegaDeath, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and other groups such as these were
  played as Much as the so Called pop garbage they would chart #1's all the
  time also.  HUM, maybe if Anthem Records Kissed more... nah, Rush
  doesn't need that, there enough on there own.  Besides if Rush Charted
  better think of all the fake RushFans(Tm) there would be out there.  People
  who could careless about the things all us NMSers spend our days museing
  upon(not to mention the increased competition for tour tickets, bad enough
  already!)

I seem to have reached Critical Mass Myself, at least in words so...

latta,
