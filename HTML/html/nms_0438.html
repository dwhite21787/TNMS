Rehi all.

	1st of all, I was quite happy that Eric Johnson took the
grammy.  Although Rush winning would've been the best thing EVER,
I think Cliffs of Dover could've tied the Boyz.  I had the pleasure
of seeing Eric open up for Rush on Nov 17, 1991.  It was great
seeing two grammy nominees playing at the same concert!

	Another thing, I read that Rush opened for Sha-Na-Na a
LONG time ago.  Anyone know what year?  My friend has a S-N-N
tourbook(s) from the mid-70s that supposedly mentions Rush in it.

	What's happening with the NMS shirts?  I wanna order 3,
myself.

<A NAME="438002">Subject: Sorry, Eric Johnson SHOULD have won!</A>

In response to the dude whom thought Rush was ripped off by getting beat
out by Eric Johnson, I have to submit the following reply.

Sure, RTB is a great album, I feel it is one of the best in a long time.
However, I must admit (even as a die hard Rush fan whom has not missed a
tour in 6 tours) that Eric Johnson DID deserve the award.

Listen closely to Cliffs and hear the magic that Eric creates with his
fabulous 4-way guitar sound.  Do you hear it?  Now go see him live, you
will hear it again!  He is a great performer.  Sure there was a comment
that Rush was a let down in Indy (no windmill and the absense of Ghost),
but seeing Eric and the Boyz was the best show ever for me!

Neil was great, his 4-way drum solo was cool...although maybe not too hard
to accomplish...but it worked, and worked great.  Of course he did impress
the Hoosier crowd after the 4-way Latin bit was over! GRIN

Back to the award though.  I hear WMT and it is cool and impressive, but
let me leave all of you with this question...DID WHERE'S MY THING HIT YOU
AS WELL AS YYZ DID THE FIRST TIME YOU HEARD IT?  I didn't think so!

I have found- yes- THE PERFECT RADIO STATION!! Possibly even rivaling
the Buffalo poster's station.  It's 98 ROCK in Baltimore.  I knew they
played a lot of Rush- I've heard Limelight, GOaC, Dreamline, Freewill,
Spirit Of Radio, Tom Sawyer, New World Man and Subdivisions many times,
as well as others.  But in all my life, I have NEVER, before last night,
heard THE ANALOG KID played on the radio!!! I was shocked, and very
excited.  This just confirms my suspicions that 98 ROCK IS the best
station in the country.

As for that quiz- I get #7 (sorry no quote) to be Scars, and #21 to be
Fly By Night.  I'm right, don't bother disputing that.  :-)

And to that dude that said Where's My Thing? was a boring bunch of old
riffs- all I have for you is large quantities of unprintable expletives.
Where's My Thing?, although I didn't like it at first, has grown on me-
it is a wonderful composition which BLOWS ERIC JOHNSON OFF THE PLANET.

One more thing- Best I Can is an awesome song, if you didn't know that
already, and I'm sure you did.

Thank you very kindly,
Tom

Hmm....  Yep, I guess you could say I'm interested in bass (plucks the
Steinberger).  However, accomplished as Billy Sheehan may be, I really
can't stomach Mr. Big.  I just didn't find them musical (saw 'em TWICE
on Presto).  I despise the "pound the hell out of the kick drum with 16th
notes" drumming philosophy, and I was moved to head for the restroom
when the guitar player whipped out the drill.  Blech.

I was really sorry to miss Eric Johnson and ESPECIALLY sorry to miss
Primus on this tour.  I got stuck with Vinnie Moore, sadly.  (Before you
reply, yes Primus does the 16th note kick drum thing sometimes...)

In short, technique doesn't make the music.  Mr. Big sucks with
technical perfection.

Everyone,

Rush is in Roland User's Group Mag., Vol. 10, Number 1...the February
issue.  The article reads as follows:
======================================================================
RUSH

	Seventeen years and umpteen albums later, it's still difficult to
categorize the music of Rush.  Geddy Lee, Neil Peart, and Alex Lifeson have
been hard at work for time re-creating the image and sound that unfolded
accross the band's evolution.  Of course, technological and stylistic
developments characteristic of the band's growth to maturity are apparent,
and one can spot political and environmental concerns throughout their
work.  Starting from their first, self-produced album RUSH up to their
latest Atlantic release, ROLL THE BONES, it is more than evident what
connects this long line of successful vinyl achievements...talent.  Lee and
Lifeson met in the eight grade, as Lee remembers, "Alex used to borrow my
amplifier all the time."  Much of their musical influences came from
British blues bands like the Yardbirds and Cream. "Alex would pretend he
was Eric Clapton, I would pretend I was Jack Bruce, and w'ed play
"Spoonful" for twenty minutes," recalls Lee.  It wasn't until 1975 that
this Canadian-based band signed a recording deal with Mercury and produced
Fly By Night with a new drummer, Neil Peart.  From that point until now,
this trio has been responsible for year after year of ground breaking
conceptual music.  And Rush is starting 1992 off with a bang:  Their
national tour for the new album should give audiences across the country a
chance to catch a live Rush on stage along with their racks full of
Roland's new S-770 Digital Samplers.  "It has such great sound quality -
that's the major fact for me.  It's user friendly and very adaptable - the
S-770 is a completely useful tool," comments Lee.  Wiath a new excitement
in the air between these three men, fans can be assured that they'll
maintain their long and creative partnership in the years ahead.  There are
even mentions of another album when the current tour is finished. "We are
really psyched!" confirms Peart.  As post-mod be-bop or one-drop or hip-hop
lite-pop-metallists - whatever you call them, they'll always be Rush.

Well I knew EJ would win the Grammy...  yeah, such a show is so predictable its
sick  :)   Although I love the EJ song, I feel Rush deserved the grammy based
on longevity... EJ is still a fairly new player in the music scene, and if this
were a perfect world we would have seen a more seasoned Veteran win the
award... but lest forget that the music industry is one big commerical mess, so
the grammies reflect that in fine form.  I didnt think "Yes" deserved it
because it wasnt Yes on that song, it was all Steve Howe... great song, but its
more a solo deal and not the band.  Well the big thing is Ged, Alex, and Neil
could probably care less about the award, and us fans could probably care
less... I know I will still buy Rush CD's, and support their tours, grammy or
no grammy...  Interesting thing, on eMpTyVee they interviewed Hammer about the
grammies and he said they are important, they show that the public supports
you, blah blah blah.... and then they asked Dave Mustaine, and he said in more
words, who cares about the grammies, our fans will be there no matter what...
just shows the attitude of a commerical artist versus one who hangs back and
has their loyal fans, and thats Rush in a nutshell... we are gonna support them
no matter what...  sure, an award or top 10 song would be great, but if it
never happens, who cares...

Hola!  Just felt like I should comment on something from the last issue of
TNMS.... Someone said that GOAC was released last week, and hope it got a lot
of airplay.  Well, I've been hearing it on the radio practically NON-STOP
for the last 3-4wks... Which is cool, b/c it's a good tune, and I think they
played RTB quite a bit (though not as often as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was
played (ugh!)) and it's nice to hear another off the album...
	I have actually found a station that plays a decent amount of RUSH too.
In the last several weeks I've heard Subdivisions, Tom Sawyer, Freewill, Lime-
Light, Passage to Bangkok and a couple more...can't remember (school is affect-
ing my brain most non-triumphantly!!!!)  Anyway, the station is Q104 out of
Albany, NY (103.9 FM) and they play a lot of cool stuff... Just thought I'd
tell ya all!  'Til later......enjoy, and Roll 'dem Bones!!!!

ORQ- "I stand atop a spiral stair, an Oracle confronts me there.  He leads me
      on light years away..." (damn, wish they'd play 2112 on the radio!)

  Howdy folks!  I know I haven't written in  a while, but after seeing
 the quiz in the 26-Feb-92 NMS, I just had to write in.  First, I just
 wanna say that I'll be at the Richmond, VA show on March 10.  Hope every
 person going enjoys.  Second, You won't see an "Analog Kid' in ASOF #4
 due to personal reasons.  (oh come on, someone feel sorry...<grin>)

	[ ASOF is a Rush "endorsed" fanzine if anyone is interested.
	  In line with Spirit of Rush - UK for those who care :rush-mgr ]

 And finally, the answers (at least the ones I got) to the quiz.  The ones
 I do have marked, are indeed correct, the ones I'm not sure of or don't
 know, are pretty obviously marked.  ahem... here we go.

   1.) "Entre Nous"
   2.) "Afterimage"
   3.) "Neurotica"
   4.) "Hemispheres, III. Dionysus"
   5.) "Chemistry"
   6.) "Bastille Day"
   7.) "Scars"
   8.) "Camera Eye"
   9.) "Madrigal"
  10.) "Emotion Detector"
  11.)  'and in defeat', this one stumped me....
  12.) "High Water"
  13.)  'take the key', I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's "Twilight Zone"
  14.) "Vital Signs"
  15.) "Circumstances"
  16.) "Face Up"
  17.)  'but change can make', I thought I knew it...I thought wrong..
  18.) "Enemy Within"
  19.) "Different Strings"
  20.) "A Farewell to Kings"
  21.) "Fly by Night"
  22.) "Red Barchetta"

Well, 19/20 out of 22 isn't bad...

        What is the deal with people bashing Primus?  In My opinion they
are way above Eric Johnsons meaningless songs. Rightious from the new
album sounds exactly like Zap from the album prior.  Primus are two
extremely talented musicians ( YES  2    the guitarist is nothing to
write home about)  Cliffs of Dovor is so stagnant.   I can just picture
it as background music for a Sprite commercial or something. WMT is one
of the best Rush songs ever.  Especially live!!!  It blew me away!!!!  I
saw EJ 4th row last year and he was uninspiring to say the least. Seemed
like he would rather be home watching Night COurt.  Primus are definately
a great opening act for Rush.

<A NAME="438010">Subject:      Comprehensive Ayn Rand Info</A>

Rush's music has been very influenced by Ayn Rand.  Many people think
that since Rush has 'mellowed' in recent years, Neil must have abandoned
Rand's philosophy.  But I think that people who say that don't really
understand the comprehensive nature of Rand's thinking.

Many of Neil's more philosophical songs (Show, Don't Tell comes to mind)
are interesting on two levels... first on the superficial level and then
second on a more philosophical level.  Show, Don't Tell is a song about
the centuries old debate between Aristotelians and Platonists about the
nature of knowledge, perceptions, and reality.  Not bad for a rock song!

Anyhow, I run a mailing list called "Moderated Discussion of Objectivist
Epistemology".  As you might guess from the title, it is a pretty
heavy duty technical philosophy list.  The most active participants are
philosophers, mathematicians, etc.  My list is awesome, but isn't really
the best place for general questions... Try Vixie's list for that.

I am including a shortened version of a list of Objectivist resources
available on the network.  The list was originally compiled by
Thomas Gramstad of Norway.

Enjoy!

This list is a moderated discussion of Objectivist Epistemology.
Posts are expected to be serious in nature, although it is not
necessary that everyone be an expert.  The purpose of the list is to
'chew' Objectivist Epistemology to gain knowledge.

We have several exciting projects scheduled for 1992.  Beginning
in January, we will have a 10 week organized discussion of Ayn Rand's
_Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology_.  Following that, we will
return for a time to our 'open discussion' of Objectivist
epistemology.  This summer, we will have a session on Artificial
Intelligence featuring invited essays.  Finally, in the fall, we will
be doing an organized discussion of Leonard Peikoff's new book
_Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand_.

To subscribe to the list, send a mail message to either of

listserv@iubvm.bitnet
listserv@iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu

with the following line in the BODY (not in the subject-field) of
the message:

(If you are on bitnet, you can send an interactive command to the
listserv of the form:

TELL LISTSERV AT IUBVM SUBSCRIBE AYN-RAND Firstname Lastname

Of course, the first part of this command is machine-specific.)

You may leave the list at any time by sending a "SIGNOFF AYN-RAND"

required.

Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can
obtain a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX
AYN-RAND" command to listserv@iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu. These files can
then be retrieved by means of a "GET AYN-RAND filetype" command, or

it was eric CLAPTON who won the grammy for best rock instrumental. i don't know
who this eric johnson is.

cfny from toronto plays 'roll the bones' but wierdly enough edits it JUST a bit.
almost missed it being gone! and BTW, "on yonge" refers to yonge (pronounced
young) street, the happenin heart of toronto.

have any of you heard of the bare naked ladies? they are a very excellent band
out of (you guessed it) toronto. they have a song not yet released (played at
the canadian casby awards) called "grade nine" where the band plays a bit
of "tom saywer" and at the end samples the end of "the spirit of radio" (the
sicko guitar part) at the end of their song. either they are rush fans (just
about everyone in toronto is) or they are making a great statement about the
great taste of youth!!!!

	Concerning a tour of only old songs, here are my impressions.  Bands
like Rush, Jethro Tull, and Yes are evolutionary bands.  i.e.  progressive -
which means making use of or interested in new ideas, findings or
oppurtunities.  Each album is going to have a different texture to it from the
previous albums.  That's why a lot of people say they either like the old stuff
better than the new stuff or vice versa.  I agree with most of you that Presto
was a weak album...well, it's great and everything, just weak for Rush.  But I
feel that they had to go through Presto to get from HYF to RTB.  Just a step in
evolution.
	So it's not that Geddy can't hit the notes, or that not as many people
would go to such a concert, but just the fact that they've evolved past the
older material.

	GOAC, on top 40, God Forbid.  And to win the grammy...grammy schmammy,
this sums it up.  Rush doesn't need this.  If Rush wanted to write a song or an
album that would be played all over top 40 stations, they probably could, but
wouldn't degrade themselves as such.  Let 'em write what they want.

>Where's My Thing is just a boring collection of leftover riffs. I would
>have been very disappointed if they had chosen Rush over so much new and
>inspiring instrumental music.

I don't agree.

>Alex isn't bad but Eric Johnson is more of a guitarist's guitarist

You're comparing guitarist to guitarist here. Not band to band.

I saw Rush in Rochester, N.Y.  The second show of the RTB tour and Eric Johnson
opened.  I'm a big Eric Johnson fan and enjoyed his concert a lot.  I don't
know why he stopped touring with Rush though.  It seemed the whole crowd really
loved him.

BTW, anybody think that Mr. Big is trying to do the same thing Extreme did.
Compare their most recent single with "More Than Words".  And so much play time
on MTV!

I can't wait to see how many TNMS posters get all bent out of shape over
this quote.  Hooray for everybody who realizes that everybody has their
opinion and if it doesn't agree with yours then blow it off and move on.

Personally, I think Where's My Thing sucks too.  I also think that people
who go around saying things suck without justifying themselves really suck.
;-)

I had a short opportunity to talk with Neil this tour, and I mentioned all
the talk on the TNMS concerning the Grammy nomination.  He laughed and
told me his opinion (which most of us knew he had) that he REALLY doesn't
give a shit about tinseltown awards like the Grammies.  He mentioned that
he would hold an award like that from Modern Drummer in much higher regard,
but even then he just keeps all those awards tucked away in his basement
gathering dust.  He's a very self-confident person who doesn't spend a lot
of time caring what others' opinions of him are.

Personally, I didn't think "Where's My Thing" was quite as good as "Cliffs
of Dover", but we could argue about this forever.  The one obvious fact
that most people have missed is that WMT did not get much radio airplay,
while CoD did.  When you're dealing with the Grammy's, that probably is
a factor.

It's too bad this wasn't a category when YYZ or La Villa Strangiato were
released (or maybe it was and the voters were just pinheads).  These
songs certainly should have won the award.

		A Mail from The Heavy Horse
		---------------------------

Hi everyone,
	This post is just to clarify what exactly Metallica said
about Tull on grammy nite as many of you sent me mail saying you
had missed it.
	This is (roughly) what Lars Ulrich said:
	"Well, Obviously, thanks to Jethro Tull for not
	 releasing an album this year. [ So that we got
	 the award]. Thanks to Tull for releasing their
	 album in 1989 (unclear about what he meant here).
	 Thanks to all the radio stations and MTV (pause
	 for all the applause and raises finger)...without
	 whom all of this would have been possible ANYWAY!
	 Just kidding, just kidding....." (and he went on
	 the thank all the radio stations for "coming around"
	 finally and playing their stuff and then Metallica
	 fans who had "been following us for ten years now").

	Just thought I'd post this because it does irritate me
how "modern day metalheads" are always putting down older bands
and classic rock. If you dont like 'em...LEAVE 'EM ALONE!

	In passing I would like to mention that Lars appeared
extremely pissed at an earlier comment by Whoopi Goldberg (the
host) who said something like:
	"What was that guy on drums doing? Did you see him?
	 Like he should have gone to the restroom before he
	 came on. He was like (screws up face like Lars) 'Damn!
	 I should've gone the restroom before I came here'"
Maybe all the venom came out. Too bad, Metallica will sell
only 749,999 cds in the first week from now on!
	Cheers,
	_Aspi_

Last issue, Victor E. (can't remember the whole last name, sorry)
mentioned the ATWAS album cover getting someone into Rush. Well,
interestingly enough, the same album cover got a friend of mine
from high school into Jethro Tull. He bought JT's "Bursting Out"
inadvertently thinking he was buying ATWAS, and became a huge
Tull fan because of it. Subsequently he got me into Tull, and I've
loved them ever since.

On the same train of thought, I think Tull deserves a Grammy for
something, but I doubt that heavy metal was the category to go
with...

It seems just as well to me that Rush did not win the Grammy award, for they
chose the path less traveled and are much better because of that - not falling
for the glittering prizes and endless compromises.  Eric Johnson is a fine
musician, and made a fine winner, but I have one comment to the guy who was
bashing WMT yesterday:  "instrumental" does *not* mean "guitar".  While the
guitar playing in Cliffs of Dover may be more interesting to "real guitarists,"
I doubt that the drumming of C/D is as interesting to drummers or that the bass
playing is as interesting to bass players.  Don't be so damned guitarocentric!

Hello Everyone,

I'm a long time listener, first time poster.  I know most of us
share the same opinion on Rolling Stone magazine, but when the
fans get a chance to vote on Rock 'n' Roll talent, sometimes
RUSH gets its recognition...sort of.  Neil placed second in
this year's "Best Rock Drummer" catagory.  I've forgoten who got
first place...sorry.  Geddy also placed second in "Best Bassist"
catagory.  Flea of Red Hot Chilli Peppers got first place.
Although I don't like everything the RHCP do, I think Flea
is deserving of the award.  I saw them on SNL a couple weeks
ago, and boy was he slapping those strings.

Regardless, as a band, I still think RUSH is the best collection
of musicians overall.

Hey,
	1) who the hell is Ayn Rand? (Excuse my ignorence.)

	2) Ya had to know Rush wouldn't win the grammie.  In this time where
the grammie nominates hacks like boys to men, and color me bad for several big
awards, there is sadly no appreciation for real, honest gut-wrench MUSIC!
This is why I personally shun the grammies, and the american music awards!
They reconize trends and fads instead of real talent.  Not that I think Eric
Johnson is bad or eneything(his album is great!)

<A NAME="438321">From: tiverson@lynx.northeastern.edu!</A>

Well, I was completely unsurprised to see Eric Johnson get the grammy over
all the other canidates, but IMO the _best_ instrumental of the year wasn't
even nominated--SRV's cover of "Little Wing".  I suppose it was released too
late for this year's awards, but if it doesn't win _next_ year, there is no
justice in this world.

Once again, the grammies as a whole proved that they are largely irrelevant
to music.  Best new artist:  Marc Cohn?  Marc's good and all, but there surely
are many artists who deserve that award more than him.  Well, at least C+C
Music Factory didn't win!  And album of the year:  _Unforgettable_ was
certainly the best of the albums nominated, but the nominations were mostly
awful in the first place.  Oh, well...

On a cheerier note, I'm looking forward to seeing Rush for the 2nd time this
tour (and the 12th time overall) on March 15th.  One thing I'd like to see:
since it's the last date of this leg of the US tour (it is, isn't it?) I think
Rush and Primus should get together for a YYZ jam.  Or, better yet, let's hear
Rush playing "Jerry Was A Race Car Driver"!

    I think we all would be extremely happy if RUSH would just have one
concert (ex:  2112) and then release a video of it.  Most hardcore fans
would probably buy the video at $xx.xx making it a worth while
investment for the band.  It would also minimize the agony of playing
the "old" songs.  bART
