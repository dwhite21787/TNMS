     Does anyone know if there is an ELP mailing list somewhere out there?  I
haven't found any.  Sorry about the lack of Rush content, but I'm sure many
fans would be interested.  Besides, this is short and I don't have a long
obnoxious signature full of quotes from Rush songs we all know.

O.K.  Get out your tour books for this one.

See the colorful vest Geddy has on in some of the photos.  It's got neat
little sailors and boats on it.  And where can you get one?  Don't ask me!
I want to know myself.  I know no one out there probibly knows, but that's
O.K., I'll try anyway.  Maybe someone made it for him.  But anyhow, I want
one; It's cool!  And yes, I already wrote him.  If you know where to get
something like it, write me at the address that follows, I
would appreciate it!  I guess I could get my mom to make one, oh well.

OkOk....people.
If Neil saw all the fuss over his bandana, he would
say "GET A LIFE!!!". Just like he did when he saw people trying to
figure out what time his watch said in the Presto photos. That
(as far as we know) was the only time one of the band saw
TNMS, and he was not impressed because of the petty stuff he saw.
If he should happen to "give us a second chance" and sees
people relating his headwear to gypsy theories, he'll be dis-
gusted. Please...gypies....that came out of someone's ass for
sure.

Also, I missed the address and $$$ needed to order Neils Ludwig
poster....could someone repost the info? or email me. either
way is fine.

Thanks!

Greetings NMS'ers...

Look, this discussions/chat/argument/whatever about the bandana has gotten a
little out of hand IHMO.  Neil IS going bald and that may be why he wears it.
Personally, I think he wears it because it  keeps the sweat out of his eyes.
But really, who cares?  It looks cool.  I vote for moving the discussion into
private email if you really still want to talk about it.  Unless of course
Neil really DOES have bone cancer....;)  (keep the flames to private mail, ok)

BTW, what's this about Neil posters?  I've seen the discussion and I'd be
interested if the price was right.....

I went to the concert on January 30 at the Oakland Coliseum and man, it was
a blast!!!It was my first Rush concert and I was really amazed.  I walked out
of there thinking, "Damn, these people aren't musicians, they're geniuses!"
I know many people think that they are just a band but I guess they don't
appreciate the quality of Rush.  What I was wondering was if Rush is by any
chance coming back to the Bay Area within the next couple months or hitting
the NY/NJ area(same time frame). I was reading the "National Midnight Star"
and saw that there was a possible June 19 concert at the Meadowlands Arena.
If anyone knows any information about either of the two(Bay or Tri-State Area)
regional concerts, PPPLLEEAASSEE email me!!!!! Thanx.

First of all, thums up to the poster who judged Xanadu on AFTK being better
than the ESL version - Alex has some guitar biton AFTK that I miss dearly on
the outstanding ESL.

And a possible box set.  Unless it contained lots of unreleased and live
material, and an attractive format, I don't think its a good idea.  Quite
simply, all but a dozen of the 100+ masterpieces deserve to be on a
hits compilation.  Why not just buy the 14 studio disks?

But the item concerning me the most.  After missing getting U2 tickets to
the Oakland, CA concert this April (Ticketmaster screwed us over,
confirming ticket sales 15 mins. before-the-fact, I had gone back to sleep),
I am getting REALLY nervous about missing the Rush show.  If anyone knows
or finds out about a show in the San Francisco, CA (no flames for vagueness
here) area, PLEASE post it, or preferibly, let me know directly!!!  I do not
want to miss this show.

<A NAME="461311">From: "David C. Copley" <COPLEYD@ACOUST.BYU.EDU></A>
<A NAME="461011">Subject: Word Count</A>

A while back someone made a comment about Neil recycling words.  That
got me thinking... have you ever wondered how many times the word
_____ (fill in a word) has been used in Rush lyrics?  I have.

To satisfy my curiosity, I fed every line of lyric (downloaded
from syrinx) through a word frequency counter and came up with some
interesting results.

I present you with a summary of some of the more interesting (IMO)
results:

Total number of words                    18937
Medium length of all the words           4.19
Number of different words                3449
Medium length of different words         6.37

Naturally, the most used words were common words such as 'the' (used
1305 times), 'to' (509), 'a' (481), 'of' (415), and 'and' (408).  The
word 'I' appears 388 times, 'you' 268 times.

Other common words such as 'in', 'you', 'we', 'is', 'it', 'on' 'my',
'that', 'for', 'me', 'all', 'with' and 'can' all showed up over a 100
times.

I had expected that the word 'like' would have shown up more than 84
times, with all the simile Neil does.  (eg: 'like a pillar of
cloud..', 'like shadows in the dark...', 'like lovers and heroes...').

Some words that showed up more than I expected were: 'they' (83),
'world' (80), 'don't' (71), 'time' (54) 'life' (49).

More words that caught my interest were 'feel(s)/feeling(s)' (73),
'eye(s)' (52), 'light(s)' (52), 'big' (40) (guess which song made that
number BIG? ;-), 'night' (47), 'need' (38), 'heart' (36), 'think' (30),
and 'dream(s)' (48).

Neil hasn't been too PC (politically correct) over the years, though
the past few albums have shown considerable improvement.  Glancing
over the gender-specific terms in the word list, I found that
male-specific words (he/him/man/boy...) out-number female-specific
words (she/her/woman/girl(s)...) 2 to 1. (I'm sure I missed a few--for
instance 'ballerina' (which is definitely a female reference), 'king',
etc.)  Many words may have gender connotations (ie: 'warrior',
'priest', etc. but I didn't care to get into all that...)

For what it's worth, Rush have used 'yeah' 46 times and 'baby' 18
times.  We can all probably guess which album contributed most of
these.  ;-)

If anyone would like the full word-frequency listing, drop me an
e-mail.  It's approx 250K.  Research note:  lyric data were processed
by WLIST--a word frequency counter written by Ari Hovila.

        Well, I sent out my 3 bucks on the 20th of February, and I still
haven't received my poster of Neil from Ludwig yet.  Geez!
        On a totally unrelated note, I recently got to take a peek at
a boot CD called "The Fly" which someone was just asking about on TNMS.
Oddly enough, there's a huge housefly on the blue cover.  It had some
stuff from RTB on it and carried a price tag of $45.  Not worth it in my
opinion although I didn't get to listen to it.  It was at a record show
that was touring through the area, so I can't get it now even if I wanted
to...  They even had an amateur VHS video of the RTB Rochester, NY show
from October of last year (horrible bouncing quality sad to say).
        Lastly, can anyone elaborate on the interview that's on the flip
side of the Ghost of a Chance cassette single?  It's says something about
a Q107 interview...

Good Day To All You Rushains.......

  I know this has been asked and answered before but.... I've heard of mailing
list but can't find the address.  Could someone be kind enough to send
me some information on it???

  About Rush and thier older songs.  Another explination I've heard about them
not liking to play some of thier older stuff is something to the effect that
Geddy feels he can't do the songs justice anymore(with his voice).

  AFWTK Xanadu vs ESL Xanadu.  Personally, I think the live version of Xanadu
has much more energy and life than the studio recording.  The lead in with
"Broons Bane" and "The Trees" is nothing less than perfect.  In addition, Neil
also adds a little more to the song with some extra percussion feats.

  That's all for now....  Ciao all!!!

I saved the original posting from RES4475@ritvax.isc.rit.edu who
mentioned that there was a video tape of the Buddy Rich Memorial Concert
which featured Neil, Steve Smith, Omar Hakim, and others.

I was wondering if anyone has purchased this tape from DCI?  I know
that the $88 price tag is kinda steep but there are a few die-hards
out there who might have spent this kinda money for it.  If anyone
has, please email me direct as I would like to have a copy of it but
can't afford that heavy price tag :-).

Hey hey to all you Sonoran desert RUSH fans!!!

As Ken F. pointed out last issue - it's June 7th at Desert Sky! The tickets
go on sale April 18th at the TicketMasters in Phoenix & at Desert Sky itself.

Since there aren't any outlets in Tucson, I was wondering if any of you
Phoenix folk could help us "southerners" out a bit & get tics for us????
I'm planning on calling in that morning to try to order tics by phone but
I haven't heard for sure if it'll be allowed... If I had a car, I'd go there
in person!!!

Thanks a bunch!

And that's all........

     (or whatever they call it!) a few weekends ago.....      :-)

Hi.

  Let's stop the talks about the bandana, please.  It's really getting old.
If you'd like to talk about Rush's wordrobe, I'd like to talk about their
style of clothing during the 1970's.  I think that they looked great in those
long white ropes with very long hair and bell bottoms.  And don't forget the
high heeled shoes.  If I ever played in a band, I would want my band to dress
something close to that, maybe without the bell bottoms and the high heeled
shoes.  I'd also loose the long hair.

  About Firehouse and Hold Your Fire.  Did anyone know that Olivia Newtonjohn
(or something like that spelling) has an album by the name Xanadu.  Also a
song by that name which is the title track.  Personally, I don't think that
taking the name of an album is against the law.  However, if they took the
logo of the album as well, which is the three red balls on a red backgroud,
then they'd be in big trouble.  But as someone already metioned, it'd
probably be a gorgouse blond with a bikini holding a torch or something
stupid like that.

  Could someone tell me how I can obtain the words to the first four albums
Rush.  I would like to read the words, since I can't make them out very well.
And also where I can get the other version of Fly by Night, the one with
extened words.

  I don't remember what else I was gonna say.  Well, meybe I'll send two of
these over.  Bye for now.

Hey all!  My compliments as well to everyone who submitted to the April
Fool's issue -- it was hilarious!

Heard a few things on KRQR (San Francisco) a couple weeks ago about
Rush that I thought I'd share:

1.  Neil has done a tamborine solo (!) for some group out of Canada who's
name I didn't catch.  (Sorry!  Anyone know it?)  Apparently, he liked their
first album a lot and contacted them.  They in turn asked him to contribute
the solo for their new album.  Sounds interesting...

Bay with Mr. Claypool of Primus.  Geddy was invited to go fishing with
Claypool in the Bay.  While out in the boat, the fan belt seems to have
broken, leaving them stranded for six hours!  Despite this (or because of

Hi, in addition to what Gabriel Salcido says, of course there are a lot of
RUSH'ers	in all Mexico, even there are not many radio stations playing
RUSH music. Most of us	 heard from RUSH when we were younger (from friends),
and since then....you keep
listening evertything about them. I haven't seen'em in concert, just in the
three	video concerts I got, that's why sometimes is hard to read that some 
of you follow
RUSH during the tour and have the chance to go several times to their concerts
:(	But, maybe sometime we got the chance to see them :)  !!At least one 
time I have to	go to a RUSH concert before I die !!
Recently there has been some good concerts in Mexico (but only in D.F., demn 
chilangos :{  )	like ZZ-top, Guns'n Roses, Queensryche (yes, :((( ) and next is
Van Halen :(((  (If I'm putting this :( is because they are not coming to 
Monterrey, my city).
That's all, just wanted to add something now that I saw someone from Mexico.

	In response to the theory of buying a boxed set rather

I personally don't think it's possible to put together a definitive
Rush collection of
Rush collection of 'hits' or 'classic tunes.'  There's just too
much to choose from.  I was dissapointed at the thought of Chronicles,
except for the live stuff, and see it as a way for Mercury/Polygram

Date: Sat, 4 Apr 92 21:19:44 EET DST

Being naive enough to believe that someone might be
interested, I thought I'd give my opinions about the possible
Rush boxed set.

I sincerely hope that there will never be a Rush boxed set
that is similar to Yesyears, for example. If my memory
serves me correctly, the Yes "boxed set" contains four CD's.
There are 10-15 (I don't remember, I don't recall, I got
no memories of anything at all - Peter Gabriel) new tunes
but the rest is old stuff. Now this is, IMO, a very immoral
thing to do; putting fans to buy 4 CD's (costing a HUGE
sum of money) in order to get a few new songs.
I know that the holy trinity that we all idolise and adore
blah blah blah would never do a rip-off like this, but
I don't know about the record company (who, therefore,
must be in league with Satan). After all, it was the
record company (Mercury? RIP, Freddie..) who, regardless
of what Rush thought about the matter, went forth and
released Chronicles.

So, I don't think there will ever be - because of
Chronicles - another "greatest hits" album, and as
far as a collection similar to Yesyears is concerned,
well, you know what I think about it.

I finally saw a video tape of that idiot on the family channel.  They goy
, sorry guy, who talk about rock music and it's sexual and satanic
message and influence.  It just made me sick to hear all these
generalizations made, and hasty ones at that.  See, they first cover all
the blatantly satanic albums, ones where the artists admit to it.  Fine
and dandy, they can all bur in hell as far as i am concerned.  But then
they attempt to tie it into Huey Lewis and Van Halen. Some of the
connections are astounding.  Like, "Bast of both worlds." VH-  the
(sorry, Best of both worlds.) the narrator explains why Sammy H. is
giving himself to the devil, and gives up a chance to go to heaven only
to live in sin in this world.  Excuse me?!?!  I think the song is a
little more positive.  It simply says you don't have to go to heaven, you
can live in heaven on earth.  I dunno.  Religious fanaticism is beginning
to piss me off.  Sorry for the ramble.  I think someone should complain
to Anthem about the use of 2112 in this tape, maybe they will pull a suit

Just wanted to clarify something which I have received some mail about.  The
tour information which I have previously posted is to the best of my
knowledge 100% accurate.  Although, some of the dates I have told you all
about have been confirmed, this does not mean that they have been announced
publically.  In fact, most of the info I have reported has NOT been
announced and the respective cities where the shows will be taking plac(oops).

Again I suggest listening to the radio to hear announcements as most of the
dates will go on sale over the next month.

As far as the Juno Awards, according to Billboard Magazine, Rush won in
two categories:  Best Hard Rock Album and Best Album Design (Hugh Syme).  I
was under the impression that they had won even more but apparently not.
Did anybody tape the ceremony?  I would like to get a copy of it.  I presume
that the boyz did not attend.???

I would appreciate it if someone would e-mail me regarding the following

(please send the mail directly to me [matthew@wavefront.wti.com])

I was in a CD store the other day and I noticed a "bootleg" CD of Rush with the
title
		Temples of Syrinx
It had a picture on the front which appeared to be from the Hemispheres era.  
But,
on the back of the CD the songs were live from the 1989 tour.  They were all 
songs
that are available on real CDs (ESL, SoH, etc.).

So my big question is... does anyone already own this CD and if so is there 
anything
different about these live versions than the ones available on regular CDs (for
example, "Thank you Pittsburgh, Goodnight!!!" or "I'd like to dedicate this 
song
to L. Ron Hoover fo the First Church of Appliantology", etc.)

My wife is an aerobics teacher, and is always after me for suggestions
of music to use in her classes.  I've mentioned Rush several times,
but she's always said it "wasn't appropriate" or "not the right beat."
(Stuff with a dance beat (ugh) works best, and, surprisingly, most
rock music is too slow for aerobics.)  This weekend she was digging
through the albums and CDs, looking for new tunes.  I grabbed all the
Rush CDs and scanned through them, looking for something with a fairly
fast beat.  "What about YYZ?" I said.  She put it on, and after about
3 seconds said, "No way."  "OK, try Vital Signs."  She put it on, lie
down and started doing leg lifts.  "The beat is perfect," she said
with apprehension.  "Excellent!  Put it on your tape," was my reply.

Congrats to the Boyz for getting a Juno in Hard Rock.  In
their NOTW (Neck of the Woods) they almost expect it (don't
quote me on that :), but here in Grammy-land, they at least
deserve some recognition.

(My feeling for the Junos vs. the Grammies is that the
Canadian performers perform at a different level (where
doesn't matter) than the American performers.  From what I
surmise on Make Tabby Vittles is that the album must contain
**Canadian content** in order to be certified (and to get $$
for their albums.  Bryan Adams was razzed for not having
enough CDN content on it...and to quote the current issue of

tho; Xanadu was VERY slow, and Geddy or Alex was out of tune.  Other
than that, it's worth the $20 I paid.  Anyone got info on the new

more recognition for this under-rated band that we all appreciate very much

but the contents of their albums shows how wrong they can be about that.

  Yes, Rush is not getting enough attention from the American music
listeners.  So let's put out minds together and come up with a solution to
make others listen to the band and be blessed by their visions.  To bring
Rush into the media and re-introduce them to the non-Rush-fanatic public.
This should make a better enviornment for us to satisfy our passion to listen
to Rush and learn their ways.

  Once we have others to recognize the band, they will no longer be
under-rated.  I think they deserve this service from their fans, which are
us.  Please let me know what you think about re-introduction of Rush to the

Hi,

   In the last NMS, Michael Silverman asked:

>Does anybody know if the word "lamneth" has any meaning whatsoever?
>I have looked it up in about half a dozen dictionaries, and looked
>it up in a list of geographical names, but to no avail. Did Neil
>(shock!) make this word up?!?!

   I asked this same question a few months ago, but no-one seemed to
know the answer. I guess Neil just made it up. The best guess I have
as to how he came up with the idea is very tentative. Neil lived for
a few years in London in the early 70's. There is a suburb of Central
London called Lambeth, but whether Neil lived there I don't know.
As far as I know, Lambeth doesn't have a famous fountain, but it is
relatively well-known for a 1940's dance/song called 'The Lambeth Walk'.
Maybe Neil took the name 'Lambeth' and changed it slightly to 'Lamneth'.
Veeerrrry tenuous I know, but it's the best I can think of. Can anyone
else shed more light on this???
