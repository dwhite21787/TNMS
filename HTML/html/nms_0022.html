Hey folks, are there any D.C. area guitarists who would like to jam on
some Rush with a good Rush-head rhythm section?  We're located in
Bethesda and Gaithersburg and we're mostly into middle era stuff like:
some 2112, La Villa, lots off PeW and MP, Subdivisions, Enemy Within,
a couple of later songs like Big Money, Force Ten, Show Don't Tell (I
know I'm leaving out lots).  We'd love to play some really early
stuff, especially tunes from COS, but they sound kinda lame without a
guitarist. Also, it really helps to have that extra instrument as a
guide, so I know we could do lots more.  We had a friend that played
with us a while back, but he's since left the area.

There's a bit of urgency to this request, y'know.  We have an
opportunity to jam at a party this Saturday 8/4 to thousands of
adoring Rush-ophiles (:-).  We're used to playing with just bass &
drums, so we'll go jam anyway, but it would be great to have a
guitarist come along (or a vocalist, or keyboardist, or even a
flautist playing Geddy's vocal parts ;-).  If you're interested in
either jamming at the party, or maybe getting together some time in
the future, please contact me at the address or phone # below.

<A NAME="22003">Subject: Re: RUSH Fans Digest of 08/01/90 (#21)</A>

Great mailing today! (now yesterday.)   On to some of the topics at hand...

I agree completely with Evan Hunt on Ayn Rand.  For a period of time some of
her philosophy was an influence on Neil's lyrics, but it is hardly likely that
they still hold the same place.  One can infer this from his changing, more
"sensitive" lyrics in later works, but you don't have to; it would simply
be impossible for someone of Neil's intelligence not to have changed and
matured his weltanshauung over the past decade (and besides I think a world
view based on Randian philosophy is very limited to begin with).

The only Rush songs I CAN'T "get into" are:  "Countdown" off Subdivisions,
and "Jacob's Ladder" off Exit...Stage Left (not the Permanent Waves version
-- for some reason, I like it, but not on ESL).

"The Pass" is a classic case of the way I react to newer Rush -- when I first
listened to it, I thought it slower and more repetitive than the usual fare,
but now, after months of listening, I can't help but drop what I'm doing and
sing along with it, emotionally.  The chorus is -- addicting!  That's the only
way I can put it.   :-)

I think of the last five studio albums, Grace Under Pressure would have to
be my favourite (for its incredible B-side), and Power Windows, my least
favourite -- although I still like it!  Aside from "Marathon" and "Territories"
most of the songs on PoW seem to be overfilled and overly-upbeat -- there is
little respite from the high-pitched and constant music.  It's hard to describe
the feeling, but the album... tires me out.

Thank you Adam Dickson for your line-by-line analysis of The Pass!  Someone
want to do one for "Scars?"  :-)

                                later, eh,

Hey everyone!!

While  I read the list as soon as it come out, I also scan the Net looking
for things associated with Rush and I found this out of the alt.rock-n-roll.
It is long, however, so "Oh Great Rush List Manager", chop it up as
you wish. (You could make it a two-parter.)

Here is.

[ I had originally asked Nate to re-submit this himself, as it was posted
  here a while ago (if I'm not mistaken).  Looks like you beat him to it.
  I'll leave it in, since you properly attributed it.  I hope you don't
  mind, Nate...  In addition, I thought in light of the recent wave of 
  new additions to the list (about 50 in the past 3 weeks), that I'd re-
  post some of the stuff sent in a while ago by Chris Michael; the longer
  items from older days.  **Chris, let me know if you have a problem with

After seeing someone accuse Rush's Anthem of having backwards masking,
I feel obliged to post this editorial Neil Peart wrote a few years
ago.

                  ROCK GROUPS HARDLY SATANISTIC

Editor's note: The following column was submitted by a member of the
rock group Rush in response to Jim Hankins' July 19 coverage in The
Daily Texan of a seminar entitled "No One Here Gets Out Alive."  The
seminar was sponsered by the Longhorn Christian Fellowship and
centered on the theme that many popular rock music songs are trying to
turn American youth against Christianity toward satanism or other
religions.  The group contended that either blatantly or through
subliminal means, musicians convey satanic messages in their songs.

    I am writing in response to an article which was written by your
reporter Jim Hankins in your issue of July 19, "Group seeks to show
rock 'n roll Satanic."  It was awhile ago, but the article was sent to
me through several intermediary steps.  Besides, it's never too late
to discuss a matter like this, and as I happen to be a member of one
of the groups mentioned, perhaps I can interject a little rationality
and truth into such a hysterical exercise in propaganda.
    Satanism.  Now here is a word that should be kept away from some
people the way you should keep matches from children and guns from
jealous husbands!
    There is a certain trait evident in human nature which some people
seem to possess in greater degrees.  It derives from a state of
insecurity and low self-esteem and shows itself in the actions of
those who wish to make themselves look good by making others look bad.
You see it everywhere once you start to look for it.  People who can't
gain respect for their own merits feel obliged to try and tear down
those who do.  We see it in the failures who try to prove their
aloofness by criticizing the actions of those who actually *do*
something, or in cases like this one where the weak and pusillanimous
prove their righteousness by trying to punish the "less-righteous."
    A big advantage to such an attitude is that it keeps them so
involved in other peoples' lives that they need not examine their own.
    So these are the grim-faced hypocrites who are stirring around in
the dark places of life hoping to find something - anything - dirtier
than their own reflection.  And if they can't find anything - no
problem - they'll just make something up!
    And here they are accusing rock musicians of being sincere and
dedicated satanists attempting to poison the souls of America's youth
with subliminal messages of devil-worship.  You know that's almost a
very good joke!  Almost.
    As one who knows many of these "demonic figures" personally,
especially some of those mentioned in the article, the idea of some of
these sold-out, burnt-out, cynical, strutting peacocks being so deeply
and religiously committed to *anything* (save their "image" and chart
numbers) is also a bit of a joke.  And a pretty lame one at that!
     These nameless mercenaries don't even demonstrate that kind of
commitment in their *music*: why on earth would they be bothered to go
to all that trouble to put anything else into it?  All they need (and
care) to do is find a kind of lowest common denominator of commercial
"acceptability."  Yes, you Christian crypto-fascists, it *is* a joke!
The only problem is - *you're* not laughing.
    I'm not laughing anymore, either.  I've started to receive too
many questions and letters from confused and impressionable young
people wanting to know if it's true that we worship the devil.  Who is
it that is corrupting the minds of young Americans?
    Let us not for one minute forget that this is the same
self-righteous mentality that has put itself to work persecuting
witches, Christians, Jews, Quakers, Indians, Catholics, Negroes,
Communists, hippies and capitalists down through the ages.  There's
always somebody to kick you when you're down.  It seems like every
group has taken its turn at one end of the stick or the other.  From
the bitter oppressed to the righteous oppressor is a very short step.
    Speaking for myself, as lyricist and drummer for "Rush", and one
of those accused of this heinous crime, I must object, Your Honors.
Far from being a closet Satanist, I confess crudely, I don't even
*believe* in the old bastard!  I wonder if that's better or worse in
your eyes, Grand Inquisitor?
    I can certainly assure you that my lyrics contain no "demonic"
secret messages or cleverly concealed mystical commercials.  Nothing
like that, I'm afraid.  It is not only absurd and pathetic, but it is
also totally incompatible with my philosophy, my work and my beliefs.
    I get all kinds of letters from people like this whose perceptions
are narrowed and distorted by pre-set values and ideas, telling me the
most fantastic things that they have somehow "discovered" in *my*
words!  As is ever true - they find what they *want* to find.  Fair
enough.  I know what I put in there.  It isn't that, and it isn't this
either.  Period.
    I don't wish to offend anyone's genuine beliefs, as it is a
fundamental tenet in my philosophy that people should believe what
they *choose* to believe.  It must be stated, though, that when you've
"got" religion, like Siddhartha, you find it everywhere you look.  And
when you've got evil, you'll find *it* everywhere you look, too.
    Ah!  It's the old "recorded backwards" trick again, is it Watson?
Ha!  I'm sure you could play "The Star Spangled Banner" backwards and
find a secret message there too.  Wouldn't Francis Scott Key be
surprised at your cleverness!  How do you suppose *he* knew what it
said in 1812?
    Don't you think something as vague as this is rather like a
Rorschach ink-blot, or cloud shapes?  Interpretation is based on the
perceiver's state of mind - *not* on any objective reality.  An
ink-blot is a cloud is a song - frontwards or backwards.  One finds
what one *wishes* to find.
    Yes, there's something subliminal at work here all right.  The
subliminal and poisonous sickness that dwells in the minds of these
fearful and pompous so-called Christians.  And they even call
themselves a "Fellowship."  Think about that for a minute.  Then think
about what this paper and others have accomplished by giving innocent
ink and paper over to this kind of drivel.  You readers don't know
that I would never even use the kind of *grammar* that these people
have attributed to me, let alone the insipid and valueless supposed
message.  Listen to this: "Oh Satan, you, you are the one who is
shining.  Walls of Satan, walls of sacrifice; I know it's you are the
one I love."  That's disgusting.  I mean *really*.  You just *know*
these people have to be sick.  If you don't believe me, ask my Mom!

This may not pertain to RUSH in general but I'm sure many of you out there are
into YES too.

I have heard only 90125 by YES and liked it one helluva lot. So given the info
that I like all RUSH albums and 90125 , what other YES albums should I 
venture into ? I don't want to start off by listening to a "lousy" 
(apologies to YES fans, but I hope you understand) album and have a wrong 
impression of the group.  So I need some help in deciding my next album and 
I hope you guys can mail me something at

	I had a few questions to ask: 1) What are the three parts of Fear that
(or three songs) Peart wrote?  2)  Has Getty or Alex ever pitched in for lyrics
even though Neil takes care of that?   3) Does anybody know how Getty and Alex
met Neil after dropping their first drummer for Rush after "RUSH"? and
4) What ever happened to that drummer?  Is he still playing, but for a different
band or what?
I'd appreciate the feedback.

<A NAME="22008">Subject: my 2 cents</A>

Hi everyone

	I'm new to the list. I came on just about the time everyone started
talking about their likes and dislikes of the p/g record. I have not read
anything yet from someone who as been a Rush fan since Rush Rush came out.
Sooooo I figured it was time to put my 2 cents in too. You'll probably wish
that I had kept it to 1 cent by the end.

	I got the first album back when it first came out. I was not overly
impressed at the time. But, I had just listened once. By the time I had heard
Working Man a few more times I thought "Shit these guys are good!". I wasn't
very verbose then. Contrary to now of course. When Fly... came out with Peart
on drums, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I don't know what happened
to the old drummer, but he did the best thing for us. Needless to say, when
Caress.. came out, it didn't even get the record bin warm before I snatched it
out. Bastille Day is still one of my 10 best Rushs. Just when I thought "These
guys can't keep this up." WRONG! 2112 is released and I was overjoyed. I think
2112 is the best one. Some of you were talking about Rush music fitting
different moods. I think this one album alone fits a lot of different moods. It
has a song to satisfy just about any mood you can conjure up. "OK" I said "this
is the last good Rush album." Farewell came out! I don't say anything anymore
about a bad Rush album. I don't think they are gonna make one. I wasn't
impressed with Signals at first. Rush albums up to that point did not need time
to grow on me. Signals was the first to need the time. Anyway...now we have
Hemispheres (a very good followup to Farewell), Moving Pictures (very good, it
reminded me of 2112 a lot), Signals which I just told you about, THEN p/g. The
apparent sore spot with just about everyone. This one brought me out of the
funk I was in after Signals (Signals is not a bad album, it just takes time. So
much time that p/g came out before I liked it). P/G convinced me that Rush
still had it. I have to admit though, Power Windows, HYF, and Presto have it
beat. Presto is my current favorite. It seems to mix some of the pre-ESL Rush
with some of the post-ESL Rush. Alex is back doing some leads. Geddy spends
more time on the bass. Neil dazzles your brain with anything you can hit with a
stick and some of the best lyrics in a while. Now I'm just waiting on the next
one.

	Next subject. I am going to Toronto to spend a few days. What better
place to look for Rush stuff. I haven't been there before so I am looking for
any information about what I might find there. Here's looking to lots of
responses.

	Thanks for the time everybody!!

Hmmmm... seeing as Signals is one of my favorite albums and that I
like every song, rating "Countdown" as worst does not slam that
song in the least.

I dunno.  Every time I watch a shuttle launch, I get a lump

Anyway, I once recorded a shuttle launch off of CSPAN (or was it CNN?)
and synced the video up with the audio from "Countdown".  Watching

BTW, I would be interested in the poll that someone did a while back

restriction is that a group may only appear ONCE in the list (in other
words, you can NOT have Rush - Moving Pictures and Rush - Permanent Waves
as numbers 1 and 2).
After a week or so, I'll post some of the most frequent favs, most obscure,
etc. (if our beloved Rush-Mgr doesn't mind :-))  I know this was done once
before but I didn't see any results from it and I'm courious.

<A NAME="22011">Subject: General questions</A>

   Someone wondered what the sources were when I said that Geddy Lee was a 
big  Metallica fan. Well, I heard him on Rockline a couple of years ago, and 
he said that was one of the bands he liked. Then on Metalshop [this was also 
a while ago] they had "Stars Choice" where rock stars pick a Metal song to be 
played. Geddy picked Metallica [can't remember which song, but it was 
*heavy*!] and then complimented the band, saying he thought they'd be around 
for quite a while and even compared them to RUSH. Then, in Guitar magazine 
[or Guitar Player] a while back Geddy said he was a Metallica fan. I've heard 
that the liner of the Master of Puppets CD contains a "Thank You" to Geddy, 
but I'm not sure about that.

   I've got some questions about Caress of Steel. Is there supposed to be a 
concept album hidden in there? I bought it on tape [has no note liner or 
anything] and remembered that when I saw the CD, the songs were arranged in a different order. Any help?  
   Also, what's the purpose of Didacts and Narpets drum solo, then some 
guitar, then Geddy and some other guy say something like, "LITERN!" Could 
anyone enlighten me? Also, how did they come upon the album title? thanx...

   Earlier I stated that I think RUSH should do an all out power song, and 
someone mentioned that they can still rock etc. I was just saying that they 
should do a METAL song.

There has been alot of interesting discussions lately on the old

Jeff Jonsson writes:

Yep, it's coming out on Polygram I believe, at least Geddy alluded to
this in on the recent Rockline interview. Someone phoned in and asked
him about Chronicles and his reply was that he knew nothing about it
because it was being put out by "another" record company. Could it be
that Rush doesn't talk to their old buddies at Polygram anymore!

David Arnold writes:

Yes, most definately pronounced Peeert. I heard Neil say it himself on
the Rush Profiled CD.

Neil says himself on Profiled that he was sick of reading about these
young people taking their lives with the mistaken belief that there was
nothing left for them in life anymore and the only noble and valiant thing
to do was end it. He did not mention any religious theme.

No, it is on CoS. I have an Anthem import and the cities are listed there
too. Maybe these cities were on the Fly by Night Tour?
