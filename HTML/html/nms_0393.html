Last week, I mentioned a new band that was being produced by Terry Brown.
I found the article, and here's the info: The band is named "Fates Warning",
the album title is "Parallels", and it's on the Metal Blade label. The Chicago
Tribune rated it 3 stars out of 4. "The formula is obvious, and the same as
always for this Connecticut-born band: Queensryche's Geoff Tate fronting Rush.
And, for the most part, it's seamless. Vocalist Ray Alder is a powerful Tate
clone, and guitarist-writer Jim Matheos is ultra-progressive. Rush producer
Terry Brown only adds to the tribute. But while all involved are talented, the
lyrics lack the urgency or the interest of the band's models." I guess I said
they were from Canada...my mistake.

Who the hell is Motley Crue to deride Neil Peart, anyway?
Call me petulant, but that kind of crap really agitates me.
Crue, although more popular by top 40 standards, has never
and will never produce the quality of music that Rush has.
Hell, I would rather listening to my ten least favorite Rush
songs than Crue's greatest hits (Decade of Irrelevance).

Quite a contrast in styles.  Motley Crue, on one hand, writes
about those "girls, girls, girls" and "Dr. feelgood".  The type
of music that Crue makes is very shallow, totally devoid of any
real substance.  Crue is the anti-Rush.

Rush once produced the type of music that, sadly, has made Crue
a radio favorite.  Rush's first album, although in my opinion
musically superior, is isomorphic to the music that Crue
repeatedly rehashes on album after album.  Rush, in essence,
grew out of that particular stage.  Crue, conversely, has
remained in a rut (musically speaking) over the duration of its
career.  I regard their remarks about Neil as simply jealousy.

Well, don't fret Dan McDonald. I also broke down and ordered the RTB
video on the Jukebox Network, I ordered it Wednesday night. I wasn't
as lucky as you were, though. I ordered at 12:15 AM. They didn't
play until f**cking quarter til 3 !!!!!  I was pissed. But I got
it taped nevertheless. I still would've rather got it on
mtv though because on the Jukebox network they constantly flash
other available video selections at the bottom of the screen. Which
by the way are composed of 80% rap. No kidding! It sucks.

Someone asked where the morse code is on the RTB cd. It's not on
the cd, its in the RTB tourbook.

Also, I discovered something weird. For a while my sig included the
quote " If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice."
from Freewill.
 Then, someone emails me saying that my quote is incorrect. So I
looked in my fraternity brothers PeW cd sleeve for the lyrics and
sure enough, I had it wrong.
In the cd sleeve it says,"If you still choose not to decide, you
haven't made a choice."
Well, I thought, so I was wrong. And I changed my sig(see below).
But then, on my way home for Thanksgiving, I had my ESL tape playing
and in Freewill on that album, Geddy distinctly says,"If you
choose not to decide, you still have made a choice." !!!!

So I was right!!  I dont have PeW yet, and I dont listen to my
Chronicles cd too much. I usually listen to ESL quite often, so that
is why I picked the alternate lyric.

Just a little tidbit. I wonder why he switched it like that??

Oh well, gotta study and listen to Neil on Rockline tonight.

Seeya!!!

Just a quick note:
As I was scanning the TV late Saturday night (again, hoping for that
elusive 'Roll The Bones' video), I came across some show called Night
Flight, broadcast on our local NBC station, KYW channel 3.  Anyway, it
was from this dubious program that I learned the name of the director of
one of my favorite Rush videos, 'The Big Money': Robert F. Quartermain.
Does anyone out there on the 'net know of any other works by Mr.
Quartermain (perhaps more Rush videos, he says hopefully...)?

Well, at least it's something for Rush trivia-heads to chomp on...

<A NAME="393007">Subject: Lakeside Park & the Jukebox Network</A>

TO whoever posted about Lakeside Park being in Sudbury: I think you're source
is dead wrong on that one.  I believe this is in the FAQ, but Neil grew up
in St. Catharines, Ontario -- just around Lake Ontario from Toronto, southwest
across the lake.  A quick jaunt along the ever-enjoyable Queen E expressway
through scenic Hamilton and Burlington, and there you are in St. Kitt's.  (Yes,
the above sentence was somewhat tongue in cheek.  The Queen E is also known
as the Quick 'n Easy, which is hardly so.  And Hamilton is a true eyesore,
I gotta wonder why they started the RTB tour there.)  (No offence to any
Hamiltonians, please!  You can go ahead and insult any city I've lived in for
free, some of _them_ are real eyesores too.)

Oh, as for the Video Jukebox Network -- each station is entirely local, I
believe.  The way the "network" works is each week the network HQ in Miami
mails  a new laserdisc or two to each affiliate, and they put the LD in a BIG
box that is essentially a closet-sized television station.  (It's basically a
40 disc LD changer with transmitter and monitoring stuff.)  The 900-number
stuff is all nicely automated -- you just punch in the number, and the PC
that runs each station puts your request in the queue and shuffles the LD's
around appropriately.  So, alas, any $2.50 calls you make apply to the station
in your area only.

Would have been a good idea, though.  :-(

Yo People,
The Philly show was one of the best I've ever seen (can't wait for
The 3rd!)-
The Boyz were in top form, running around and playin' games.  The
Professor was especially comical.  Geddy's vocals were ON the whole
night!  He did drop an octave for "FMW" and "Anthem", but he was
well in control throught the whole set.  Where's My Thing and
Superconductor were performed exceptionally well.
The lasers were right on cue, as were the videos.  No screw ups
(Alex did, however, break a string during the encore).
As for changing songs, etc., we must remember that the Boyz play
"staple" hit songs every tour.  I think that the changes in songs
like "Subdivisions" help to keep the material fresh for the Boyz to
enjoy performing them night in & night out.
Well, show #2 is tomorrow.  Hope it's as wonderful a show as last night's
(like I'm doubting - NOT!).
Later......................

	Excuse me if you heard it already, but I was away for Thanksgiving,
and haven't looked through my mail yet.

	But, some of us musiholics who must have music, tune in to MTV, just to
catch what's on (and in my case to see if RTB is on, not yet though.)  Anyway,
my point is that I saw that Most Wanted (a.k.a Dial Mtv) has gone back to an
800 number, now some suggested a media (Rush) blitz.  As an 800 number is
free, I think as many people who have access to a phone around 3 to 5 pm,
should call every day, as often as possible, and request RTB.

	This, theoretically now, should put RTB in the top nine, at least
once, which would allow some people to tape it.  Now, knowing MTV is a pop
monster like RS, there is a damn good chance, that the persons in charge, have
a list of songs to play, and it won't get on.  But the idea is to try anyway,
and if you thought I forgot it:

	MTV most wanted -----   1 (800) DIAL MTV  country code USA
				1 (800) 3425 688

	There you have it, and let's hope your vote counts for something.

	Frank.

Well, right now I'm listening to Neil on Rockline, in what I think is a great
interview. In case you haven't heard already, here are a few things that you
may find interesting...

Geddy's the rapper! Neil explained that they found that when the Gedster's
voice was lowered, it produced a laid-back effect that captured the mood of the
song.
Neil's last name is pronounced 'Pear'-t, as in the fruit, not Pirt (with a
short e).
Oh, lots of other stuff that I can't remember now, but the best revelation of
all...Neil tells us that we can expect to hear much more from Rush in the
future. As he put it, when they did RTB the Boyz realized that the opportunity
still existed to have a great time while making an album, and also that they
had plenty of ideas to keep things going for quite some time.
BTW, I remember some talk about what Neil listens to in his headset...he told
us that it is a click track, used during Time Stand Still and one other (I
forget) in order to keep up with the video behind them.

Also, I always find it interesting to hear what other musicians have to say
about Rush. Here's a quote from Ty Tabor, King's X guitarist, from this month's
Guitar for the Practicing Musician (the one with the La Villa tab)--
"...I was really into Rush...I was heavily into them all the way up to MP,
>...I was really into the fact that their music was so original and thought-
out, and the musicianship so good."

Well, folks, although I thought I'd hyperventilate before I could ask my
question I made it on Rockline!

For those who care:

I set up my modem to call constantly from 7:30 CDT on.  I set the delay
between tones to the lowest number recognizable by the phone system,
turned the modem sound on, and waited.   400 phone calls later, the
phone rang at 9:30 CDT.  I had to listen to it ring for almost an
hour, 10:20 CDT, right before the show.  They answered and said, what's
your question?  I asked one and they said it had been taken, so I asked
my original one--one discussed on TNMS, whether Neil's listening to
a click-track.  I maintained so, and Mr. Peart confirmed this.  I also
said that is why he takes it off near the end, so they can just jam.

It was exciting to say the least but really you must use electronics
to have a ghost of a chance ;-) to get in!  They (the Rockliners, who
had British accents) said my question was good, but no guarantees.  Until
my question came up, I could hear over the phone the interview--5 seconds
ahead of the radio.   Weird.  Also during local commercials they were
running promos for the radio stations to tape for next week's show, goofing
around, etc.  They prompted me that I would be third after a song; then
next, and then boom!  I was on!

Finally the mystery rapper revealed for North America.  I figured Neil
would do it.  I knew a couple of weeks ago from an inside source but
was asked not to tell ANYONE which I didn't, not even my brother, although
I did promise him that if Neil didn't answer it, I'd tell him.  Whew.

Moral o' the story:  use a computer to call; and have more than one
question to ask.  The Rockline screeners might not think your all time
burning question is good enough; personally I wanted to know if the
damn noises were DOGS or WOODBLOCKS!  But knew better than to ask...

Well I'm psyched for the show!

The Mysterious Rapper is Revealed

at the risk of being the 100th person to post this (though it is a
greater risk to have noone post it) Neil confirmed that the mystery
rapper is in fact Geddy.  (is this proof enough rush mgr?)

for everyone who didnt catch rockline, Neil was a great guest.  He is
as free with words on the radio as he is in his lyrics.  Geddy tends to
ohh & ahh in interviews searching for the right words but not Neil.

Our FAQL constructor will be glad to know that the interviewer corrected
his pronouciation of Peart too!

Is someone going to post a transcription of that interview? My tape came out
horrible.
