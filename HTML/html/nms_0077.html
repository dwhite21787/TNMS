    It seems to me that there has been alot of conversation about how to
play this or that RUSH tune.  So I was just curious if there are any of
you musicians out there who are in a band that does any RUSH cover tunes.
If so, what tunes do you play?  My band (called "dangerous papers") does
In The Mood, Red Barchetta, Digital Man, and Presto to name a few.  Of
course we do a lot more RUSH tunes at practices, but these are the ones
we do at gigs.  If there are any gigging bands out there that does RUSH
covers please respond.  It would cool if you could post dates and locations
of gigs too, so other RUSH fans on the list could come enjoy your music.

Two things:

Could Chris Michael post the address for "The Spirit of Rush" in the UK?
Thanks.

Also:  The last time I saw Rush was at the ARCO arena in Sacramento.  I heard
from a friend who lives there that the last time they were there, someone
threw a *rock* and hit Geddy in the head.  Supposedly the band has sworn they
will never play Sac'to again.  Is this true?  When did it happen?

Oh yeah:  what's the latest info on the track listings of the Japanese Rush
CD's?

Thanks. I was just about to ask this as I just got mint copies of Fly By
Night, Caress of Steel, 2112, ATWAS, and AFTK that fit the above description.
Does anyone have a clue on how much they would be worth?

[ Note:  The original FBN and COS sleeves had pictures, drawings, and/or
  pictures on them.  If you got the 'Mercury catalog' sleeve, it's a later
  pressing.                                                      :rush-mgr ]

I think they mention this in _Visions_. Its a mini-compilation from their
first few albums targeted for airplay. {Target mass appeal :-)}

Yaaargh! I wish I had blown off school and heard the rehearsals instead of
just going down for the show! I was wondering why they didn't play Presto
(I had a mental picture of seeing Alex in a soft spotlight playing acoustic
amidst a sea of lighters!). Going to AFTK from that, I would have died. Also,
I had a hunch they would play Nat Sci but alas it didn't happen. Good to see
that they considered it.....I will be looking forward to seeing if they do
bring back By-Tor. That would be a wish come true.

>*  I heard from a normally very reliable source that the next studio album will

Good to hear it! Just in time for my birthday! But that seems a bit soon
considering Neil just got back from a huge bike trip (see last digest, I think)
But I hope its true....

Hey Rush fans:

Is anyone out there interested in compiling a list of songs that people in
the Rush mailing list can play?  Maybe we could start an archive of the songs
or even an archive of how to play them.  I would be willing to put some
of the songs I know into ASCII tab for guitar.  For starters:

	Spirit of Radio
	YYZ
	Trees
	La Villa Strantiato (does this mean "the village of Strantiato" ?)

[ This should be La Villa Strangiato.  Possibly means "the house of
  Strangiato"?                                                 :rush-mgr ]

	Fly by Night (everyone knows this, I know)
	Natural Science
	Xanadu
	Cygnus X-1
	Closer to the Heart
	Something for Nothing
	2112 (another popular one)
	Show Don't Tell
	Red Barchetta
	Tom Sawyer
	Kid Gloves

As should be obvious from the above list, I am quite severely lacking in
any of the newer material.  I would be grateful it anyone had the parts
for some of the newer songs.

    I don't recall having seen this on the mailing list yet, so...
Rush, along with Bryan Adams and k.d.lang, have been named
Canadian rock artists of the decade.  They will be honoured at
a gala affair on November 20 at the Sheraton Centre in Toronto.
Unfortunately, I didn't win tickets to attend this black-tie
major music business event.

[ Refresher:  Helen is the archivist for our mailing list.  She's also the
  archivist for the Jethro Tull mailing list, hence the request for 
  clarification.  Shameless plug:  to join the J. Tull list, send mail to
  "jtull-request@uiuc.edu".                                     :rush-mgr ]

Okay.  This is the way it goes.

Your request must have the following information:

   1:  Whether or not you want Rush backissues or Tull backissues.
       (this is IMPORTANT - a request for issue 23 gives me no clue as to
        what you really want)

   2:  Which issue numbers you want.  Or, in the case of the tull history,
       which parts.

   3:  An internet address (hopefully yours  :)  if at all humanly possible.
       Failing that, a bitnet address would be nice.  Please, only use uucp
       as a last resort.
       HOWEVER!!  Please include an address at the end of your post - some
       mail headers are no fun to try and decipher.

Okay.

Turnaround time:  I have stored the digests (both rush and tull) to tape.  All
		  of them.  The only ones I have on my account are from the
		  past week.  Once a week, I store the new ones to tape and
		  answer the requests.  In theory, at least.  I am still in
		  the process of working some bugs out, and, adding an excess
		  of programs due to that, things have not been going well.
		  I'll get to your request.  Honest.  Don't send it again, as
		  it just makes things more confusing.

# of issues wanted:  Due to an excessive number of people wanting issues 1-7x
		     and other such quantities, this is how it's going to work
		     (for now, at least).  All large requests will be sent in
		     groups of ten issues.  I can't just mail user < *  because
		     it does horrible things to the mail queue, and I don't
		     currently have the time to type the command for each issue
		     issue.  One of these days i'll write scripts to do it, but
		     until then, you'll have to bear with me.

Turnaround of more than a week : I'm probably having problems mailing to your
				 site.  Don't worry, I'll get them to you.

	Thanks for putting up with the sermon.

Yet another non-rush posting, BUT I do believe it will be of interest
to a good deal of you posters out there (if not all of you, eh?)
After reading the list of musical mailing lists recently posted here,
I noticed a certain band I like very much was not represented (although
many of them were, certainly!) so gather up the DIY spirit, I decided
to do one myself. So, I am announcing the existance of a Marillion
list which can be posted to by 'mail csc8mnp@oliver.vcu.edu'. I
realize I don't have a neat alias at the present, and am using my
drab account address, but I am working on creating one with my friendly
local guru - I am tentatively thinking of using 'fishnet' as the addr.
So, hopefully I get a great response from all you secret Marillion
fans (really, they must be one of the biggest 'unknown' bands in
America, judging by the sold out shows I saw of their last tour),
and be able to post the list on a daily basis, as the Rush list is
posted. Oh - and if you do post to the list, I (like some other lists)
am looking for an appropriate name for my list, although I've got
some good ideas, so I'd appreciate any suggestions you'd have.
I am waiting to hear from you....

The Grinch

PS. the above addr is the same for both postings, admin matters, and
    whatnots. Also, comments ect about other 'New Wave of Prog Rock'
    bands like Pallas, IQ, Dream Theater, Pendragon (maybe even stuff
    like WatchTower...) are welcome. I realize every band can't have
    it's own list...
