I like 2112 as well, but I'd say that my favorite is Grace Under Pressure.  I
love the art work.  Depends on my mood I guess.  I love the inside of the Exit
Stage Left ( live) album.

Everytime I hear The Learning Channel advertise their theme of the week:
"Armegeddon" all I can hear in my mind is: " The Universe divided as the
heart and mind collided..."

And I think that they should ask Rush to write a new theme tune for
their Addrenalin "Rush" Hour:)

Can anyone tell me what the Ferrari model number is of the original Barchetta?
Is the Ferrari pictured on the Red Barchetta single an actual Barchetta?  Is
there anything more interesting to talk about these days than die-cast
toys?>>>

Aha:
You have reached the list's resident racing fan/Ferrari specialist. 
To answer your question, the Ferrari in question is the 1949-1952 Ferrari
166MM, and the photo in the video is of one of those.
To get a model of that particular Barchetta, contact two great sources of
model cars: EWA Cars at www.ewa.com or Photorific in Portland, OR (their
homepage is on Compuserve, if I remember correctly---do a search on the 'Net
and you should find it with no problem). Both should have several models of
the 166MM in stock (they were primarily racers, but a few were made for road
use(!)....).
WIth 2-liter V12's no less, in a car a little bit bigger than a Miata.   :)

hey everybody

due to circumstances here at home, it seems that i will be lacking in
internet access due to the fact that i will shortly be moving out.

To bear, and everyone on the echoes mailing list:

thank you for the 6 month's of interesting and challenging conversations,
opinions, jokes and various other occurences.  the loss of echoes will be
the biggest loss i feel.

To REACTOR, and the rest of the rust mailing list:

i'm sorry that i wasn't around very long, and, again, thank you for the
time on your list.  my love of NY will hopefully carry me through many
tough days.

and that is echoed to the National Midnight Star, and For Badgeholders only
list.

To you, loaf, thanks for the many (occasionally mind boggling)
conversations we enjoyed together, and hopefully i will again have internet
access soon, so i can carry on our friendship.

and finally, to aaron.  The offer from you to host my new olga was
gracious, and i thank you for it.  i have begun to work on the setup
already, and will e-mail you the various files that i have.  hopefully this
dream will be kept alive for the many guitarists out there.

again, it was nice knowing all of you, and i shall deeply miss you

later, eh?

Last night's episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 contained a
reference to Neil Peart.  The movie the guys watched was a real winner
entitled "Hobgoblins".  About two or three minutes into the show, Crow
made the comment "The life of Neil Peart!" as a teenaged kid played "air
drums" to his walkman.  I had read a post a few weeks ago that talked
about MST3K references and thought I would mention this one.
Also, in response to the favorite TV shows.....
MST3K (duh!)

<A NAME="2064006">Subject: Alex vs. Neil</A>

Hello to all,
First time posting here, as I am new to the NMS.
I have been reading all the posts concerning the debate of Alex Van Halen
vs. Neil Peart, and I do not wish to say anything to stir up any further
craziness here (Probably due to the fact that Rush is, and has been my all
time favorite band now for some 20+ years, so you can figure on who my fav
of the two would be.), but to get to what I wanted to say. I haven't seen
in all the posts I've read so far, someone who has noticed that it has only
been recently that Alex has had similar drum solos, and even tried to look
like Neil (Yes, I mean visually also). I have seen Rush on every tour since
MP at least once (Although listening to Rush intently since 2112), and Van
Halen on every tour since WACF. I missed the last tour (Balance), but did
happen to catch the live package shot from the tour in (connections start
here) Toronto. Immediately upon seeing backstage footage of the band I
noticed Alex looking alot like Neil (Haircut, goatee / mustache). Then the
show starts and I can't get over how the light show is very similar to the
Rush light show. The video screen behind the drums...hummm...something funny
here, and then came the drum solo, and I almost fell off the couch. Like
most of you who say they saw the show, I couldn't get over how much the solo
sounded like Neil's. The credits came up at the end and there was my answer..
Ray Daniells, SRO Management!! Effective the Balance album and Tour SRO
Management took over as Van HAlen's management company. Also I had heard
(I don't remember where, or how accurate this is) that Alex Van Halen's wife
is a sister in law? to Ray Daniells. Now, wouldn't Van Halen have access to
a few common resources with Rush? Coincidence? I don't think so, and as much
as I've always thought that Alex had improved greatly as a drummer over the
years, I was terribly dissapointed in him when all of this seemed to fall in
place.

Thanks for listening, and long live the original, Neil Peart!

If you happen to catch the Small Soldiers( I think that is what it is called)
preview on TV you can hear Rush on the first part of it. It was pretty cool to 
actually hear rush on TV. Just thought I would share that.

Hey. I know a couple of episodes on which they mention Rush are on the
Rush/NMS page, but I have seen a couple more. One I don't know the name
of, when Mike refers to some friend/relative of his travelling back in
time to the year 2112.
The Sci-Fi Channel just showed "Hobgoblins" over this past weekend. At the
beginning of the movie is a kid air-drumming to his Walkman. One of the
guys (Crow?) says something like, "Look, it's a young Neil Peart." He
pronounced his last name wrong, of course :-). Anyway...so has anyone got
in touch w/the guys at MST3K to see who's the big fan?
On another note...I DO NOT appreciate them using clips of Tom Sawyer
(out-of-context senseless clips, too) to advertise Small Soliders.
Thanks fer letting me ramble.

Dear Fellow Rushians, 
	I recently spent a week at the college I plan to attend in the fall (for
those of you who want to know, The University of Maine at Farmington).  When I
was there, petty differences didn't matter, and that is what I have been
trying to get through peoples heads for years.  It was like the population of
college freshmen realized that they were their own idividual, and they were
not going to change to fit in with the (non-existant) "Cool people."  I really
liked it, for once it was a harmonious gathering of students.  There were no
conflicts, or no hatred or biased oppinion upon someone for their certain love
of music.  I only wish everyone in society could be represented by the petty
number of 67 students.  If any TNMSer out there has had this inspiring
experience, please don't hesitate to E-mail me or post with there feelings and
comments.
						Thanks TMNS,

Rush´n Roll To You All !!

Dreaming of Rush... before  MP was released
i had a dream of Pictures in a gallery with 
Alex Geddy Neil hanging on the wall... i said to my fellow rushians that
the next cover would have to to with pictures....before TFE was released i
dreamed of  some snowy blue thing and something black at the front to the
left (wrong side) but cloose!

The other night i was dreaming of some goldpaintings so..the live or next
studio release would have some goldish maybe..anyone out there with stupid
rushdreams?

I also dreamed that Rush was on Hawaii...but Neil was not there..Ged stood
in the front with palms around him  just singing( no bass) with his hair
shorted and Alex long way in the back doing the playback to some soulish
stuff..it looked like the MTV Grind..urgh!!!.....well enough is enough!!!
Best solo......Big Money....Working Man etc..etc...zzzzz

Glad to see someone finally pointed out this single. It's got to the 
point where even I've delurked to give it a mention! Imagine Xanadu 
compressed into a 4 minute indie guitar tune and then imagine that 
against all the odds it is the coolest thing you have heard for months.
Even then you won't come close to the smile that crossed my face 
when I heard it. Everyone should buy it! And check out those 
harmonies on the big Xanadu chant............  fantastic!

Hey folks, this is my first post, and I had such a cool Rush experience 
over the past weekend I thought I'd share it with you.  

I went to a pagan festival in MD and out of a total of 40 people there I 
found that *eight* were hardcore Rush fans.  So we could speak to each 
other in Rush lyrics and we'd understand the references perfectly!  At the 
Bardic Circle, where we share songs, stories, and jokes, I got up and sang 
The Enemy Within a capella, which was well-received.  Then sitting around the 
fire in the wee hours, all us Rush fans were doing songs as prose pieces, 
which I found rather difficult to do without singing them.  We did all 
kinds of stuff like Cygnus/Hemispheres, 2112, The Trees, Afterimage, AFTK, 
CTTH of course!, and BBB.  During the rendition of 2112, there were breaks 
to explain the story to those who didn't know it.  (Now that I think about 
it, too bad we didn't do Totem.)

I was surprised that such a high percentage of these people were hardcore 
Rush fans.  I found that their attraction to the band seems to be based 
on the depth of the lyrics and the intricacy of the music.  

Peace from Cincinnati USA,
Elise

While waiting for releases from Rush (Live CD) and Kings-X (New CD) I took 
in a Pearl Jam concert at Alpine Valley in Wisconsin. Awesome show and 
awesome venue. I have seen Rush there many times. This place is beautiful.    

Eddie Vedder and Co. prove to be a great live band with high intensity. All 
and all a great night, great crowd and cold beer.

As for Rush content, I saw a band at the Milwaukee Summer Fest. The bass 
palyer was playing a Wal bass. Weak Geddy sighting!

Looking forward to the new live Rush, especially good sound quality from a 
20 year old show!

Take in a summer concert!

Just back from a pair of 'Tallica shows this weekend.... Atlanta &
Charlotte. Both were incredibly good, more on that later, I just had to
get this in. This Rush sighting may be a tad bit removed, but my buddy,
Peter Coblentz, fellow NMS subscriber will verify this for us. 

Friday night here in Atlanta, I sat right next to a guy wearing a Rush
"Starman" T-shirt. The next night in Charlotte, the guy right directly
behind me was wearing a bootleg "Roll the Bones" T-shirt. Who knew?

Greetings fellow fans

Things are heating up, now that the 'live' album is coming together.  I
am ready.

Areas of interest:

I know that rush-mgr. has requested we stop, but my opinion is coming
out.  Alex is a very good drummer..seen him and thought so.  But...he
does not contribute on the same plane as Neil.  Neil's drum pieces sound
as though they control the tempo of the song.  Alex just drums through,
as though he'd better not upstage Mr. VanHalen (Eddie).

The B-man is an angry loser.  Boo yada yada hoo.  I cry for him daily.
How low and stupid are we?  I'm sure not stupid enough to play a demo on
the radio, knowing the band didn't approve.  Gee, Mrs. Kennedy....one
more question....Other than the glitch in the parade, how was your visit
to Dallas??  DUMBASS!!!!!!!

The Masked Rider...Makes me homesick, in a way.  Having lived in
Mozambique for a year, I often long to return, and hope that soon I will
be able to move my family back for an extended period of time.  All of
the things that make life difficult, as we normally view it, are what
drives my desire to return.  All I have to say is..Mystic Rhythms.

Enjoy independence, and freedom.  Not everybody gets the chance to.

Yup,  I thought Dog Years could have been better lyrically too.  I know,
I know, give Neil a break.  He’s 15 albums old, for chrissakes but I
could have written those lyrics and I wouldn’t say that about any of his
other songs.

Hey gang...
I know this kind of sounds "how pedestrian", but when we used to have our
little "Rush parties" back in Albuquerque, we'd always go out and get
Moosehead. It seemed appropriate, and we could get it for about 7 bucks a 12
pack at the Price Club. It always went down well.. Makin' me thirsty.....

HEllo all
   In regard to the new live album..
Few are aware that on the Counterparts tour RUSH did indeed play a longer
version of Hemispheres at a few shows..One was Dallas I'm fairly sure, and
one I'm posotive of was the second of two shows at Madison Square garden in
NYC..I WAS THERE.........now..I've been flamed saying this before as few
actually belive that this event occurred..But I'm betting dollars to donuts
that a long version of Hemispheres appears on the new album..and NOT from
the London Hammersmith Odeon show either..If it's the 78 Oden show then
Hemispheres wasn't even on the setlist as this was still the AFTK tour!

Only time will tell

Thanks for listening

You guys coming up with set lists are making one Major Mistake!!  There
is no way that Bravado can come after any other song but Dreamline.  I
mean, they fit perfectly.  Who doesn't think of the beginning of Bravado
after Dreamline is done.  

I know that Bravado was barely on the CP tour, but I read somewhere, that
they added it because of them taping the shows.  It seems to me they want
it on the album.  Did they do the same jam at the end like during RTB
tour?

I'm currently working on set list right now.  Does anyone else ever get
bored and design their own personal set list?  I know it sounds corny,
but the only times I've seen them live was T4E shows, and their videos.

    I have been searching some clues to find the "Lost Link" between the 
old 70's Rush and the Thrash of bands like Watchtower, Cynic, Atheist or 
Dream Theater. In the Working Man tribute l.p plays Sean Reinert and 
James Murphy, ex members of Death. In what ways the Rush music is 
conected to the Thrash and Death-metal? In the last Arch-enemy elpee, 
several songs reminds me the ultra-recognized Lifeson style... Who can 
tell more about that? My list of favorite bands can be so weird to 
someones:

 Rush (of course)
 Primus (Les = Geddy in penguin disguise...)
 Pestilence (with Tony Choy)
 Dream Theater
 Atheist
 Cynic
 Yes (#$%&\ª+*@?????)
 Slayer
 Watchtower (Like Rush but at double speed)
 Death
 Morbid Angel
 Entombed

 Sadus

<A NAME="2064029">Subject: Favorite Alex solos...</A>

Well...with there being so MANY Alex solos, as usual it's very hard for anyone
to pick a single favorite...even harder for so many fans to agree...so here
are some of mine...
1)La Villa Strangiato...essentially this whole song is a show-off tune for
Alex, out to prove he's just as talented as his two other
counterparts...what's great about this song is the range of emotions that go
on througout the song...and when it's done Live!--forget it!
2)Free Will...this was the first song that made me realize just how good a
guitar player Alex is...and this is one of his solo that don't have too many
arpeggiated runs on it, too.
3)Analog Kid...this one on the other hand DOES have a lot of arpeggio runs!
I'd never really thought much of this song until many years later, when I
actually stopped to listen through the solo, and my jaw dropped.   This is
probably Alex's fastest solo to date (even faster than "Cut to the Chase").

But there are also more obscure ones, that maybe don't posses the technical
flair of the above, or maybe because we don't automatically think of them,
because they're not Rush songs...(they still are, however, classic pieces of
guitar).
For example:  Many have mentioned "Mission" and I must heartily agree.  As
well as the solo at the end of "Presto".  There is also the "Guitar wanker,
and proud of it..." work in "Shut Up Shuttin' Up" off the Victor album.  And,
lastly, one of my personal favorites would be the solo on the fade-out ending
to "You Bet Your Life" at the end of RTB (it's definitely a signature fade-out
piece, that leaves you thinking of the album as a whole while the CD comes to
a halt).

BTW--anyone with a bootleg of the RTB tour would also have to throw in the
additional guitar solo at the end of "Bravado" as a very moving piece, as
well.

My favourite thing to drink while listening to Rush sometimes is a nice
singlemalt Scotch, neat (no ice, no water).  With a nice rich beer to
inter-sip.

say, The Royal Lochnagar, with a McEwans (Sp?)
     Laphroiag, with an India pale ale
     Macallans 25 year old, with a good porter

Once the buzz kicks in, I get all philosophical and the lyrics just seem
so deep, and the music carries them so well....Just lie back and fly
through the music.....Ah heaven!

Regarding the post about Rush not pressing any vinyl LP's
of their albums is refuted by what I have in my collection.

A local record store in Houston has ordered import copies
of everything through Test for Echo.  Some have liner notes,
some don't.  I just have a nostalgia for holding the old
full size album covers while listening to the music for the
first time on a new release.  I do have a number of them
on CD format, as well as cassette, but I just like to have
the LP's around -- the full size cover,  the readable (without
straining) lyrics.

One question -- I don't have Roll the Bones on anything
but vinyl, the inside photography on which the lyrics are
printed is a large close-up of an elephant's rear-end -- is
this picture also in the CD liner notes?

Early 80's - Where did I spend more hours ... playing defender, or listening

My fondest memories of that time involve the same group of friends.  We went

preceded it or ended it by cranking Rush.

Fellow Rush-heads-

Alex Van Halen isn't in Neil's league, and Lerxst kicks Eddie Van Halen's 
drunken ass. Michael Anthony can sort of hang with Geddy when Geddy's asleep. 
Sammy Hagar, by his own admission, is not much of a singer, and he's a kiss 
ass. David Lee Roth thought he was going to be the Phil Collins of heavy 
metal, and he achieved that dream, somewhat.
	Van Halen's like a tootsie pop with jello in the center-it's fun for 
a while, but don't waste your time trying to sink your teeth in. When they 
try to be serious, they're even funnier.

[Sigh] no.  I don't.  And the TfE Tour was here, in San Diego, a mere stone's
throw away, but nooo, my mom wouldn't let me go.  Guh.  But I tell you, it must
be great.  I got chills the first time I listened to E...SL and heard CttH.
First I thought that Geddy was using some neat filter on his voice, but then it
dawned on me that the crowd was singing, in more perfect unison then could have
ever been planned.  I can't wait for another studio album, if only to be able to
go to the concert.

>        3) Rush sightings - very amusing at times.

Not terribly amusing, but worth noting: on Mystery Science Theater 3000 this
last week, on the episode "Hobgoblins," one of the first jokes out of their
mouths was at a scene where a scruffy looking 80s guy was air drumming and Crow
says "The *true* story of Neil Peart."  But they kid Neil.  At least they'd
better be.  Related question: Neil's name?  "Purt," "Peer," or "Peert"? (Crow
said "Purt.")

Rush fun fact: Outlook Express tries to spell check "Geddy" to "geode."  Well,
they both do *rock*!

Groups like Pink Floyd may have more lasers, but one thing Rush knows how to
do with lights and lasers is to perfectly choreograph them with the show.
They really flow with the music.  Calm for a song like Resist, crazy for a
