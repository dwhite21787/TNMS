    First of all, for those sticklers for accuracy, Syrinx was upgraded
from Ultrix 4.0 (beta) to Ultrix 4.1 (not real 4.0 as I stated previously).

\begin{tirade-mode}

    Secondly, something has happened which has upset me.  One of the list
members has apparently posted an issue of this digest to a Usenet newsgroup.
For some strange reason, the group was "alt.sex".  I've spent a good portion
of the morning figuring out who did it, following up the original post with
an official apology and disclaimer, and replying to all the mail from people
asking why it was posted there.  Now, the heat concerning Rush postings is
bad enough in rec.music.misc, where such stuff belongs; I don't need extra
flak from totally unrelated newsgroups to worry about.

    The person who did this has been removed from the list pending a good
explanation.  If I'm not satisfied, or they don't reply, I won't reinstate
them.  I perceive this as a violation of Usenet protocol; the re-posting
of a moderated digest without the moderator's knowledge or permission.
What if this were a personal mailing list?  Things could have been a lot
worse.

    I have no problems with people setting up local redistribution sites
for the digest, or for forwarding digests to other people interested in 
Rush and their music.  I'd prefer they get directly on the list (in the
latter case), but I won't object if notified.  I realize that once the
NMS leaves Syrinx, it's at the mercy of the net, but I take a dim view of
obvious abuses.

\end{tirade-mode}

    Also, for some reason the 'rush/incoming' directory of the anonymous
ftp setup had been changed to read-only; possibly a left-over from the 
upgrade.  I've changed it back to world-writable, so there should be no
further problems.

    Please, when posting, make your text mixed case, not ALL CAPS.  It's
harder to read ALL CAPS.  Thanks.

    Lastly, PLEASE send mail to the correct address when you're mailing
to Syrinx.  The correct addresses are at the end of each and every issue.
I still get regular administrative questions here at the digest address.
It takes me extra time and effort to weed them out and deal with them if
they're not sent to the correct address.  Help me out here, folks!

Enough bitching,

This is the story of "Fly By Night" as told by Bill Banasiewicz in the
biography _Visions_ (Which is getting a lot of use on the NET isn't it?)::

	"The band had just played in St. Louis.  Howard <their road manager>
pointed the car, which was engulfed in pot smoke, in what he thought was the
direction of Cleveland.  Three hours into the trip as they neard Memphis, TN,
Howard realized he was going in the opposite direction and it was no time to
stop by and meet Elvis.  Alex, Geddy's and Neil's singing turned into
screaming.  In response, Howard turned the car around and tore off to
Evansville, IN where the band could catch a plane.  They pulled into the
airport parking lot just in time to see the Delta jet 'fly by night' departing.

	This doesn't say if it was written there or that had anything to do
with the tune - it could be what the B-man (author) thought sparked the song.
I don't know...  make your own opinions - I do.

Mike,

Sorry to disagree, but I voted for p/g, and I seem to remember it was
on the list with a few (1 or 2) other votes, as well.  It was way down
on the list, though, so that may be why you missed it.  I didn't keep
a copy or I'd be able to tell you more exactly.

It was interesting seeing what was on the list...I think only two or
three of my choices (including p/g) made it on the "two or more votes"
list, but then I'm not particularly interested in guitar hero music.

   John McMillan writes about Red Cross ragging on Rush.  Sorry if
this turns into one of those "other band" tangents, but I just wanted
to say that
   a) I too am kind of pissed off at them(ps if anyone has
seen them, they are definitely trying to make an impression and
not just "play cool music")
   b) I will still listen to them.  They have some talent and a
good sound.  Especially for an "alternative band", they rock.  They
aren't Rush, and I admit I just lost some respect for them,
but take the music for whats its worth.  Just 2 bits from me...

I would love to see Rush extend their show.  The amount of music they have
makes it (realistically) impossible to have a complete performance inside a
1.5 hour show.  I was commenting to a friend the other evening that I would
really like to hear them do more at a concert.

>X-Mailer: Mail User's Shell (7.2.1 10/31/90)

	In response to several segments of yesterday's NMS, I
offer my opinions, advice, and questions for the perusal and ridicule
of all.

	1) "Natural Science" : The line "Science, like Nature, must
also be tamed..." always bothered me.  WHY must Nature be tamed for
it's preservation?  What does "taming Science" entail?  I just don't
know....

	2) Moving Pictures is DDD?:  I am of the opinion that my
CD is labelled DDD.  I don't have it with me, so I'll check when
I get home.  If I recall correctly though, the liner notes mention
digital recording, don't they?  In the credits section?  Also, when
Signals (the following album) was recorded, the song "Digital Man"
included the line "He won't need a bed, he's a Digital Man", which
supposedly referred to the fact that when they were assigning sleeping
quarters for everyone involved in the recording, they didn't need
a bed for the digital man because he wasn't there!  A trivial argument
concerning a trivial matter!  I do have tha Canadian release, but
I doubt that that matters.

	3) I cannot accept the argument that Rush plays "progressive jazz".
This is an answer I cannot accept.

	4) Who said that on the last tour some "Bunnies" came out to
give the boys a drink and some bowels?  This is truly weird.....

	5) Instead of McNealy Schneker Group or the McCauly Schenker
group, was it the Michael Schenker Group?

[ It was originally the Michael Schenker group, but the lineup changed,
  and so did their name.                                       :rush-mgr ]

	6) Carl Stalling didn't actually write a lot of what went into
the Warner Brothers Cartoons, although he did *arrange* it.  A lot of
the tunes came from popular songs of the day, as well as classical
pieces.  This includes the Monsters theme from La Villa Strangiato.

	7) Niagara Falls is not a great place to shop for records.  And
yes, we do have pressing plants in Canada, so recordings by foreign (e.g.,
US) artists are often pressed in Canada for domestic release, just like
other "foreign" products are made in Canada for domestic sale (e.g., Coke,
Wheaties, football...).

	8) Who asked about Kim Mitchell recordings?  He has appeared on...
		1) Max Webster
		2) High Class in Borrowed Shoes
		3) Mutiny Up My Sleeve
		4) A Million Vacations
		5) Live Magnetic Air
		6) Universal Juveniles
		7) Gowan (his first album)
		8) Mitchell's contractual obligation EP with Anthem Records
		9) Akimbo Alogo
		10) Shakin' Like a Human Being
		11) Rockland
		12) I Am A Wild Party
		13) Diamonds, Diamonds (best of Max)
		14) Best of Max Webster CD.

	Good luck finding any of this in the US.  #8) is fantastic,
although short, and was never released on CD.  It can no longer be
found here.  #4) and #6) are my "essential" Max Webster releases,
and #8) and #9) are the "essential" Kim Mitchell releases.  Any other
Canadians care to voice opinions?  Robyn?  Ron?  Dave Wolf?  Mark
Dykeman?  Martin?  Back me up here....

[ Please, let's not escallate this into a flame war.  If you feel the 
  need to continue this discussion, please take it to e-mail.  :rush-mgr ]

  I ignore it most of the time, but sometimes the mindless idolatry
of rock music fandom irks me.  Particularly when it applies to Rush.
I understand that Rush appeals to people who are looking for something
to believe in, since their music and lyrical meaning are inspiring.
Considering the emphasis of individual thought over collective impulse
we find in Peart's lyrics, mindless idolatry is also pretty hypocritical.

> Dear Rush Faithful,

  I don't know about you, but I doubt Geddy, Alex, and especially Neil
would take kindly to equating Rush with religion.

>  [... bassist for Redd Kross (yes, that's how it's spelled) makes
     snide comment about Rush ...]

  Opinions of Sinead O'Connor aside, this stuff really cracks me up!
When you load your postings with subjective BS like "Skinhead", 'sense-
less', 'willing to say anything offensive or shocking', 'fledgling, petty',
do you honestly expect people to take you seriously?  I, for one, don't
agree with your opinions, and furthermore I find mindless idolatry at
least as annoying as "senseless iconoclast trashing."

  Have you actually heard any Redd Kross?  Considering your posting, I
doubt it.  Having had lots of exposure to the underground Los Angeles
music scene, I can assure you that they produce some excellent tunes.
Obviously I don't agree with bassist MacDonald's opinion of Rush, but
that's his prerogative.  Doesn't affect their music, though.

  If you don't like Redd Kross' music, that's one thing, but to condemn
them because they offended your idols and make collective appeals to the
NMS to condemn them as well is ridiculous.

> Keeping the faith,

  See above comment on equating Rush with religion.

  Listen man, I don't mean this as a personal attack (which is why I
deleted your name from my post), but I really REALLY wish people would
THINK before they assume their personal opinions are natural law.  You
owe it to yourself to keep an open mind, and take to heart what Rush
represents, which certainly isn't New Kids On The Block style fan-worship.
And I promise not to bring up RAP again!

     Quick to judge, quick to anger
     Slow to understand

Thanks for all the replies to the RUSH guest jam post.  I believe it was
Max Webster with Battlescar that was the particular release on which
Rush played.  From what I know it was one tune?  Is it worth getting
the album?

As for shopping up north for albums and stuff.  Good CD prices are
hard to find.  Up in Toronto where there are a good handful of competing
record stores in Yonge street area you can eventually turn up a bargain
price at least on a cassette version.  Haven't really seen CD prices much
lower than 19 bucks.  Now there's this GST tax, which I still can't figure
out.

To the one individual who went up to the Falls to get the Gowan CD, that's
too bad.  I picked up Gowan on an american label down at Record Theater for
the regular 14.98.  Gowan has been on domestic presses since his Strange
Animal cut.

Patrick Widener writes about Aimee Mann in Open Secrets, sure sounds
like it to me.  Singing along in the 'chorus'.

A comment for Paul Crossman, who asked about Kim Mitchell CD's, I've
been on the alert for Max Webster (and Kim Mitchell) CD's for years.
They are only available as imports (obviously :) ), and I've never seen
them at the regular record shops.  One extremely eclectic (that's
putting it nicely) local shop often has a small selection of imports by
these guys, but they are PRICEY.  I think you'd have to find an unusual
or very large (like Tower) store or order them, but be prepared to
pay.

Sounds like there might be limited interest in mail-ordering Canadian
CD's among this audience.  Any of you Canadians know about
mail-ordering from up there?  This will probably be just as difficult
as ordering through a good store though, but it might be worth a go.

Hello,

    To all Kim Mitchell Fans, (especially in the Toronto Area)

   Just before Christmas I was visiting a friend of mine in Toronto and

Centre on New Year's Eve.  Unfortuately, I couldn'

Just finished readin about 3 weeks worth...  Now onto some comments:

Re: The M-80 incident
	That a$$ should have been thrown out of the place!  There is really no
	call for something as STUPID as that and I feel sorry for the
	concert-goers that happened to be around an idiot like that.  I	really
	fell sorry for the person (people) that got hurt because of it.

Re: Aimee Mann
	Someone asked about her relationship with Rush.  In "Visions", I
	believe, it says that after they had done "Time Stand Still", they
	felt that Geddy's voice alone just didn't sound right and that they
	needed to do something about it.  They tried different studio 'tricks'
	(oversampling ,etc) but it still just didn't sound right.  They
	decided it needed a different voice along with Geddy's so they started
	listening to different artists randomly.  When they listened to Aimee
	Mann (what group is she with again?  I forget) they felt her voice
	would do the trick so they got a hold of her and her producer.  They
	did not know her or anything, they just blindly hoped that she would
	agree (which obviously she did).  Relationship?  What relationship :-).

Re: Steve Smith
	I can't remember if I mentioned this or not but I saw Steve Smith at
	a percussion clinic at Zampino's Drum Shop in Canton, OH in 1986.  He
	was *EXCELLENT* and is a very talented drummer.  His style is close
	to Peart's in some aspects.  Just thought I'd mention this since we
	were on the subject of Peart and Smith.  What is he doing these days
	anyway?  Haven't heard anything from him since his Journey days (hate
	to see good talent not doing anything).

Re: Rush Opening Acts
	I was going to mention this but since Jimmy agreed to conduct the
	collection, I'll send my info there.

Hey, Lewis, the best team in the NFL *DID* win the super-bowl!  At least the
best team in 1990.  I hope Hostetler goes to Disney World :-).
Go Steelers... one for the thumb in '91!  (What?!?   Where did that come
from?!?  :-).

Someone mentioned yesterday about the cartoon music from La Villa
Strangiato. Well I know of another reference where that music was
used. This is the theme music from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids!"
Being that Rick Moranis and Geddy Lee grew up together and
are pretty good friends, maybe this was inspiration to use this
theme. Of course it's not La Villa Strangiato that is played during
the film, but imagine if you will the "Monsters!" section played
with a saxophone!

Also, another good idea. If anyone out there has not yet read
Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" do so immediately. Though it's long
after I finished I realized where a lot of Neil's ideas came from
particulary in the early albums. I never thought that I could listen
to "Anthem" with such conviction! If anyone has already read the book,
let's here what you think!
