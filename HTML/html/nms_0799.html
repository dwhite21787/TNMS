Hmm...

I was thinking in a relation to a post on the last issue about the
Gangster of Boat thing. Well, my philosophy is this: Maybe it is an
installment of Gangster of Boats Trilogy in the idea of:

Where's My Thing? (from the last album)

to

Leave That Thing Alone!

If one thinks about it, you could come up with a good tie-in between them.
So maybe this is an ongoing title relationship to a certain "thing"?

Just my 2 cents I guess...
(If someone has already mentioned this idea disregard this post, I havent
been keeping up with the digests lately)

-Jamie

P.S. Just what IS that "Thing"?
It could stand for the boat in "Gangster of Boats"
ex. Where's My Boat?
    Leave That Boat Alone!

I don't know if anyone has brought this up yet, but has anyone got ANY
idea what's being said in the middle of "Alien Shore"?  If you listen
carefully, in the middle of the song during an instrumental section you
can hear a voice saying something.  But it's so darn quiet, I can't make
out a single word.  Sounds like Geddy, though.  I coulda sworn I heard
the word "envelopes" in there, but I think I can chalk that one up to
an overactive imagination.

As for "screwed, blued, and tattooed"...that's an old cliche.  I've got
an album released about 3 or 4 years ago that's named "Screwed, Blued,
& Tattooed."  Sounds to me like it's something that came out of the blues,
I just see it as commentary on depressed rock stars. :)

Anyone else think that "Stick It Out", the 'fabulous first Rush single', is
actually the weakest track on Counterparts?  (All this Cp and CP nonsense!
It doesn't take that much to just type it out! ;)

Okay, okay. You guys have me, maybe I was a little harsh in my earlier
critique of the album.

For one major point, I've definitely changed my mind on Nobody's Hero. Took a
few listens, but I can honestly say that this is definitely a classic Rush
song, ala 'The Pass' or 'Losing it'. But I still think that the first verse
makes me giggle a little at the rhyme scheme. But good song.

Has anyone else noticed that for the most part, the final song on any Rush
album is  one of their better songs on the album. Well, maybe not better but
definitely different from the others. Of course there are exceptions (Like
RTB, GUP). But look at the others, this is from my small collection of RUSH
albums.

MP - Vital Signs (very different from the rest of the album (one of the many
word play songs (Like Anagram, Bet your Life, Chemistry, Red, etc.)
Signals - Countdown (the only song that breaks from the concept in the
Signals album (tracing a man's journey from High School -> College -> The
REAL world -> the end of life)
GuP - Like I said, this song fits with the rest
PW - Mystic Rhythms (Awesome, but different from the rest)
HYF - High Water (One of my fav mellow Rush songs, a lot like Mystic Rhythms)
Presto - Available Light (Again, another powerful song. I see a pattern
forming. The previous three could be a trilogy in and of themselves)
RTB - Bet Your Life (Not really different from the others)
CP - Everyday Glory (Slow start, then BAMM!! the lyrics really hit home.)

Does anyone else see this and want to add something??

Also, on the Rand discussion.
Let's just say that Rush takes and existentialist point of view and leave it
at that.

Finally, this is one album where I haven't had any misunderstood lyrics (ala
Freewill, or any other song)
Oh wait, there was that song about the 'Glorified Vision of a Pelican'
Oops, forgot, that was the new Pearl Jam album  :D

Hmm,

Well I guess I'll send this in and hope it gets used. Since someone asked
about the Gamera comment and since it was in CP, maybe it will add some more
obscure Rush Trivia to what we already carry around. Besides, it's definitely
better than reading about that darn binary code or the Rand discussion.

Perhaps the worst 4 or 5 movies every aired on MST3K was the Gamera series.
They starred this giant mutant turtle that could fly...
"You will believe that a giant mutant turtle can fly" - Crow T Robot.

Anyway this turtle was the friend of all children and had lots of fun
adventures, etc. etc. Anyway, the series had this theme song, which was in
Japanese. So Joel and the Bots wrote their own versions of the song. It went
something like this.

Gamera is really neat
Gamera is full of meat (or "He is full of turtle meat")

Howdy all....

I thought I was the first Aussie on this digest to get CP, but obviously
not...congrats to Stum for getting b4 me :)

ok...onto my thoughts on the newie (like you all wanted to know what I
was thinking)

Animate, Stick It Out, and Cut to the Chase just plain ROCK!!!!

I actually reckon that the drum intro in An. sounds like Even Flow by PJ
not Once...anyhow, that is irrelevant :)

I must say that the comments about Neil's simplistic drumming strike me
as a bit strange...some of the fills he does are quite complex, and the
grooves are just brilliant!!! It is great that someone finally gave Alex
back his distortion pedal. I think the boys should buy him a Marshall
with Quad box for christmas, then the guitar would be truly earth
shaking :)

Another thing that pleases me about CP is the appearance of Hammond
Organ! I never thought I'd hear the real thing on a RUSH album, but
there it is in CTTC, LTTA and Cold Fire (I think)...there is also some
buried in Animate. LTTA is a beautiful instrumental, esp were the keys
(a layer of Piano, Bells and Hammond) come in. Sounds like late model
King Crimson being played by U2....

The only song I don't like is Cold Fire. They could have made that so
sooooo heavy, but wimped out (IMHO) and made it a ballad. It just sounds
a bit too smooth for my liking, but that is my opinion -- not fact...:)

The lyrics left me cold on the first couple of listens, but they are
growing on me. I have never liked instensely personal lyrics, especially
those where the writer inflicts their hardships/loves/problems on me.
I'm not saying Neil has done this, but people having a cathartic
experience on stage or in song just make me cringe. Nobody's Hero really
moved me though (the orchestration by Michael Kamen is superb, as it is
with songs like Silent Lucididty -- Queensryche, Who Wants to Live Forever --
Queen). Especially the last outro bit, where the strings come in...very
emotional and powerful.

Anyway, needless to say that when I got the CD home and played it -- my
breath was taken away by the power of the album overall...the most
powerful since MP, but completely different (if you get my meaning)...

Ok, I will shut up now and go and listen to it again (for the millionth
time)

Seeya later

Hi again,

About Nobody's Hero -- could the turn-off for the song be the first stanza of
the song.  "I knew that he was different in his sexuality"  COULD it be that
MOST of the people that don't like this song, don't like it because they are
homophobic and hear this first line and think Neils' singing about a friggin'
faggot!  Or that the thought that the song starts off with a person who is a
homosexual make SOME people uneasy to listen to the song?  If so then CENSORED
FOR COURTSY by the writer.  Come on people if you are uneasy by these lyrics
then what is your problem, broaden up you horizons a bit huh.
This song is not directly about the gay community
or tring to convert you to be a gay.  It is about someone that is a friend (
for Neil he happens to be gay) who has changed your life and you look up to this
person from what this person has done for/to you.  Then they are gone and to you
you miss this peron, and hold this person as a hero to you, though they may
not be to anyone else.

If you are someone who doesn't like this song because the music is slow or not
rocking then I hope you like the song for its lyrics, because you have very
little reason to listen to a band that puts a huge (I mean b.i.g. HUGE) amount
of the song creating process to the lyrics, if you listen to them for just the
instruments and the sounds that the band makes with them.

I am sorry to those who really don't like the song, this was not aimed at your
direction in anyway.   It has been my experience
with those many people that I have talked to about this albumi, that the
majority that didn't like Nobody's Hero was because of the first line of lyrics
from the song.  This burns me up BAD!  Or maybe my problem is that I have an
open mind, and don't look down on the human behavior, that I don't find harmful
to others, that is different from my own.

Ok, now to climb down my high horse, wait one last thing.  About LTTA, to those
who though it was another part in the Ganster or Boats trilogy, possible
part V.  Know this--Where's my thing was an inside joke for the band, and a
trilogy has three parts, and the fact that WMT was part four only added to the
joke!

Hey ya'all,

I don't know if anyone else has a radio program called Metal Shop, it sounds
as if it is a national thing.  But Alex Lifeson was the featured guest this
week.  He had talked about the harder in yer face style of the new album, and
what he thought (sorta), Neil's lyrics ment.  I did tape the show and when I
have time will type in the interview for TMNS.  Hopefully by the end of this
week.

   [ If you, or anyone else for that matter, have radio interviews taped and
     don't have the time to type them in, drop meg@syrinx.umd.edu a line, she 
     said she'll be more than happy to type them up.	      : rush-mgr ]

Anyways about Cp, I have to.  I truelly believe this is the album that many of
the older Rush fans have been waiting for!  This had a harder sound that I know
I have been craving from them since MP.  Too bad they don't do anything like
COS or the stories from the 70's, but the harder sound made me real happy.  If
you haven't listen to the album with headphones on DO SO!  You'll hear some
sounds like lightly spoken text (No the part from Double Agent, you nutwads!),
and other instruments.  In CTTC there is a piano in the background but it is
really faint, you can really hear it towards the end; and in Alien Shore there
is a few faint words during the solo, just to name a few things.  There are
other sounds that a friend and I found when we disected the song(I don't mean
by thinking either 'cause if you have the ability to - do so!), that I'll
leave up to you to find.  Kinda like watching MST3K (Gamera you're turtle meat),
and tring to find the Millenium Falcon, trumpets, and such on the walls of the
Satellite of Love.

Also one last note -- There is a differnce between the tape and the CD
packaging of Counterparts.  The CD has a picture of Neil with his Mowhawk, the
tape doesn't BUT has a group picture of the band backstage somewhere.

One last thing,

For those homophobic people out there you are probably also offended at the
song Animate for its thoughts on the female's influnce on the male and the
female within the male kinda thing; and probably also think that Neil is now
becoming gay!  Also, what is so daring about the writing of and singing Nobody's
Hero.

One last thing, no I'm not a bitchmeister, just bothered by what I've heard from
other people.

Well, the way I see it, its so they read as DDD left to right, which is
the conventional way of presenting these sorts of things. Of course, since
when has Rush been conventional? :) (Oh shit, does that through my
theory out the window? Jeez, now I'm gonna have to give up my Dick Tracy

I'm pretty much the opposite. I guess that's why "my solution" is pretty
simple.

Ahh, but life isn't always exciting. But them I'm a grad-student so maybe

I tend to agree with you, that's why I like the 'DDD' explanation. The actual
sequence of 1's and 0's is completely meaningless. It's just the fact that they
are 1's and 0's that provides the explanation.

Well, it is '3' rows of counterparts (1's and 0's) that may be the only
reason, but I do kinda like the 'DDD' explanation. (I said that before, didn't
I?)

Well, that's enough for now. The suggestion of the binary digits
referring to the recording technique was just a random thought in a rather
chaotic thought process. The more I think about it, the more I like it,
just becuase of its simplicity. Anyways, if anyone can come up with a
believable uncoded message, I'll jump in line behind it.

<A NAME="799012">Subject: Final tunes</A>

First I would like to respond to Owen Gottlieb, who posted in #796 about
under-rated tunes.  What a coincidence.

	In the End
	Kid Gloves
	Everyday Glory

all songs that he considered under-rated, are three of the songs that I've
recently been skipping around their respective CDs to hear.  Owen, I like
your taste. Sad to say, Hemespheres and the Prime Mover album (I assume
HYF) are not yet in my collection, and I am thus unfamiliar with the those
two songs.

Second,  I would like to point out the magic in the last track on most
RUSH albums.  I don't know what it is but there is some strange aura that
eminates from the final cut on most rush CDs.  They always seem to have a
more sort of highly emotional, almost sensual, move-the-world kind of feel
to them.

	Namely:

		In the End
		Vital Signs
		Countdown
		Between the Wheels
		Available Light
		Everyday Glory

I just think that's kind of cool.  Not earth shattering (like the songs),
but just kinda neat.

Agreed. I can't get over the verse of "...sense of honor, just a shield
of rusty wire..." especially since in English class we just read _Sir Gawain
and the Green Knight_, and in Spanish class we're reading _Don Quijote_.

And now that we're reading _Heart of Darkness_ and the teacher keeps talking

If I remember right the word fugazi came into use in Vietnam.  It means
"all f**ked up" or "totally f**ked up" or something like that.  Fish
used it for a song title ("This world is totally fugazi") and album
title and I suspect the American band came up with it completely
separately.
The whole "Double Agent contains Fugazi" thing I suspect came from the
fact that Fish's first solo album was called "Vigil In A Wilderness
Of Mirrors."  Coincidence or not?

Rushppl --

Okay, thanks to mweintr@american.edu and jghien00@ukcc.uky.edu for setting
me straight on the picture of Geddy on the drums.  For the rest of you
"unenlightened" people (incase neither of them post this) -- Geddy, as a
bass player, represents the rythmic counterpart to Neil, on the drums.  Guess
it ain't as obscure as I thought!

Here's an interesting, if not highly unlikely, thread:  My roommate seems to
think that Rutsey still stays in contact with the band in this way -- he
is under the impression that Rutsey is married to Geddy's sister.  Again,
this is HIS information, not mine.  Does Geddy even HAVE a sister??  I'd
just like to set him straight if someone can disprove this for sure.

And hey, rush-mgr, what's this you said the other day about signatures being
limited to FIVE lines???  I thought it was like nine!

I am not sure if Geddy is using his Jazz Bass on Cp. Did he say in the
radio interview that he was? I have really only listened to Cp as a non-
musician. I am also a Bass player, but I have been very busy with school
to sit down and really figure out what Geddy is playing and what instruments
he is using. Although, I have figured out Animate. I agree with most of

I am not sure about Geddy using a pick.
If you heard the radio interview, Geddy said he used an old amp
for this song. Maybe the amp gives his bass that type of sound?
I sort of agree with you, but I really need to listen to it more.

BTW, are you originally from New York? If so, Email me.

Date: Tue, 26 Oct 1993 09:09:08 +22306512 (CDT)

    For those of you wanting to know where Rush is on the charts, here goes.

    On the Billboard AOR single chart (which is always out before the rating of
the album is out...) Stick It Out debuted at Number 1...much like Dreamline did
approximately 2 years ago.

    THIS IS NOT THE TOP 200 CHART I'M TALKING ABOUT!!!!  So save the post.

    Also, Stick it Out is at the top of two major trade magazines, The Gavin
Report and Radio and Records...yes they beat Pearl Jam for adds to radio
station playlists.  Who would've thunk it?!  In fact, in one of the magazines,
97% of all the stations reporting for the AOR format were playing Stick It
Out...and this (make no mistake about it!) is impressive.

    So, I have no idea where the album is going to chart...It wasn't out yet
when I was research, although I suspect that it's out now.  So check your
local library for Billboard and you can find out.  And unfortunately, yes,
Pearl Jam will probably beat Rush on that one.  And with referral to the Top
200 single list, Rush will probably not show very respectably on that one
simply because it combines all forms of music and compares them together, so
(IMHO) the Billboard AOR singles chart is a far more accurate judge of success
than the top 200 chart could ever be.

    Also, I like Between Sun and Moon.  But hey, to each their own, don't you
think?!  Talk to you all later.

I was really looking forward to hearing all of CP live (maybe they'll do

   To add another to the list of FMLs, when I first heard Alien Shore,

Remember the "ching-ring" (the tamborine-like thing that John Bonham
used on top of his hi-hat)?  It works great for the tunes on C (yes,
that's C and not Cp or CP) that have the tamborine parts in them.

On "Double Agent", I recently noticed that Neil does a nice little
switch with this cymbal work that casually listening probably won't
catch.  Beginning around 3:30 and counting it in 6/8,

  1)  XxXxXx    X's indicate strokes on the bell of the ride cymbal
      123456    x's indicate strokes on the body of the ride cymbal

  2)  TxTxTx    T's indicate strokes on the "trash" cymbal
      123456    x's indicate strokes on the body of the ride cymbal

  3)  same as 1)

  4)  xTxTxT    T's indicate strokes on the "trash" cymbal
      123456    x's indicate strokes on the body of the ride cymbal

  As well, method 2) is used around 0:39 & 2:06 and method 4) is used
  around 4:20.

On "Leave That Thing Alone", Neil's nifty fill towards the end isn't
as hard as it may sound.  I think I've pretty much figured it out (if
I just had those special effects!).  I'll try to chart it if/when I
have time.

Anyone wanting to discuss more about Neil's contributions on C, send

Who's got the power to convince Rush to come down here? It would be a
great thing for a change... I mean, having read their interviews, it
looks clearly that they'd be better guests than some other things that
have come here (I'm thinking of Michael Jackson, Guns'n'roses, etc.).

Yes, there are Rush fans in Chile (I'm one...) -  however, we aren't
many - and only a few ones have net-access - two of us were the first
ones in the whole country to actually hear the CP a(u)lbum. Who made

G'day!

Counterparts kicked off on the Island's Rock 20 last week at #4!!
This week it's at #2!  The only album that stands in the way of CP being #1
is _Human Wheels_ from John Mellencamp.  Now THAT hurts.  I can't stand that
album in the first place; it's so boring to listen to that it drives me up
the wall each time it comes on the radio (which occurs about 12 times per day).
(So WHAT if you came knocking!!?!?)  Unfair!   Compensate Me!  I hope you
Mellencamp fans can let this one go by...

Other ideas for pictures of counterparts on the album insert:
-R2-D2 and C-3PO...("I am C-3PO and this is my counterpart, R2-D2."--Episode IV)
-The album covers from Roll The Bones and Counterparts (to reflect the different
 *sound* on each album)
-The smartly-dressed man from the Hemispheres cover and....John Kruk.

	All youse can forget the DDD theory about the binary code on the back
of the CD booklet.  They are phasing out the AAD, ADD, DAD and DDD codes
because they mean absolutely nada.  They don't necessarily correspond to the
actual recording process and since they really don't accurately tell you
anything at all about the quality of the recording, they're useless.

After reading all the other reviews i thought i'd have a go, for me
this is the best album since Power Windows(i'm not much of a Presto
fan- their worst i think).While RTB was OK i felt that the
production just did'nt suit Rush, and i think Counterparts
highlights this.As for songs, well all side 1 is very good (although
CTTC and Nobodys hero took a few listens before i liked them).Side 2
is a bit different,as everyday glory and alien shore are kinda crap,
but Speed of Love and LTTA more than make up for this,all in all a
really good album.Now for something a bit different, on various Rush
albums through the 70's and early 80's album sleeves stated that
alex played 6 and 12 string guitars,what songs did he play 12
strings on, just curious.Also if anyone knows the chords for Sgt
Baker and Those damned Blue Collar Tweekers by primus could they
email me, thanks.

Geez!  Where do you people come from?  The critical imaginings are
amusing, but tiring.  Do you ever take time from critiquing to just
listen and enjoy?  NP spells it out.  Sex (gender) and race - represent
distinct, separate bodies.  Male and Female, Black and White.  They are

Oh gee, come to think of it, maybe he was talking about space

<A NAME="799036">Subject: is "Cold Fire" the second single, or what?!?</A>

It seems that every time our local rock station (WDVE) played some new Rush
last week, at least when I was listening, they played "Cold Fire" instead of
"Stick It Out".  Is this happening elsewhere in the country?  I'm wondering
whether it's the second officially-released single from Cp.  Ugh, I hope
not...  Not that it's a *bad* song, but there are many better on the album.

Maybe WDVE is just trying to compete with Pittsburgh's ridiculous surplus of
country stations.  (1/2 :-)

P.S:  I'm with Greg et al. on the binary.  It's just DDD, folks.  By the way,
do the rest of you have a little yellow "footprint" overlapping part of the
binary digits?  It looks like a faint fingerprint roughly in the shape of a
foot.  Sorry if this has come up before, but if so I didn't notice.

<A NAME="799037">Subject: Misc. Opines on Various Questions</A>

I've enjoyed reading the dissection of the new Rush album.
I'd like to throw out a few comments.

I think Geddy used the "exploding amp" on more than one track
(besides Animate).  It sounds like it's in the mix on EG as
well, and maybe others.  The overall engineering reminds me
of some of the power bands in the '70's, the ones that you
could crank their stuff up to the top on ANY stereo and it
would still sounds as good (bad?), whether it's a small jam
box, car stereo, or a giant home system.  Black Sabbath comes
to mind (I know this comparison has been made before; this
may be why).

It *does* sound like Ged is using a pick on some of the tracks.
I get the feeling more from the attack sound than the speed of
the licks.  Of course, some creative pickup placement and eq or
massive callouses could also explain the sound.  A creative mix
may include both plucked and picked tracks.  Look real close in
concert <drool>.

I also think Geddy is using a fretless bass on some of the songs
(damn- I can't remember which one gave me that impression and I
left the CD at home).  You know which ones I mean.  Again, this
could just be one track out of many in the mix.

The soliloquies in DA sound alot like their fellow Canadian
Robbie Robertson did on his self-titled solo album.

Frank Zappa also has a song called Stick It Out on _Joe's Garage_.
Frank's version is about sticking IT out, however.

Collins finished the work on Ged's vocals that he started on
_Power Windows_ (I think Territories is the first cut that Ged
harmonized with himself on).  Geddy sure hasn't lost anything,
but he has gained a lot.

I'm suprised at Alex's comments about being back into the studio
proper while recording and getting "that wonderful feedback".  You
can get some types of feedback through your monitors, but that
physical stuff that comes from the speakers resonating the body of the
guitar itself seems to get lost with each layer you put between
yourself and the amp; I figured he would know that (maybe he just
forgot).  Some of the feedback that is on Cp sure sounds like a
vanilla Stratocaster to me.  Very good stuff.

How far does Neil having to "work alone" go?  Did Ged and Alex mean
that he has to be alone to write the lyrics, or do they mean when
they're recording, as well?  Anyone know any details about their
work habits (or is this in one of the bios)?  Do they get along?

<A NAME="799038">Subject: A couple of things about CP</A>
Date: Tue, 26 Oct 93 14:33:41 CDT

 1)  I haven't heard any one talk about this yet so... I don't like the
     section in CTTC where they cut from speaker to speaker saying "cut".
     When I first heard this I thought I had a bad CD.  I think they could
     have done this a lot better and it would have sounded cool.  However,
     the way it ended up sounding it's just a 3 second distraction in an
     otherwise great song.

 2)  About "Nobody's Hero", someone (Tracey?) mentioned that they wish Neil
     would have waited until he was more ready to discuss homosexuality
     before taking on that subject in a song.  First, the song is NOT
     about homosexuality.  It's about who Neil thinks are the true heros
     in our society.  Second,  I didn't get the feeling when I first heard
     the song that Neil was trying to "reassert his heterosexuality".  I
     thought he was trying to give the message that "Just because you're
     NOT gay doesn't mean you can't have a friendship with a gay person(s)."

 3)  Last Earl (eebie@aol.com) says:
    > Could we have a discussion of the lyrics for Between Sun and Moon?  I'm
    > afraid that I really can't get a handle on what's being said.  My best
    > guess "The happiest of places is that between extremes".  What are some
    > other interpretations (or expansions on my own) for this song?  I'd love
    > some outside insights here...

     I thought he was trying to say that people are always trying to get to
     some preconceived goals or perceptions in their life where they will be
     happy.  Always looking for the right "things" to enrich their life with
     instant happiness that they miss the happiness that is happening right
     now.  Also,  how some people live in the past and miss the happiness that
     is going on with them right now.

 4)  To whomever said that they felt that Neil is changing back to a more
     of a story telling style of lyrics, I agree 100%.  That was the part
     of the music that I missed the most in the albums since MP.

  Well,  that's all for now.  All in all I think the new album is great...
  Oh I forgot...all in all the new album ROCKS!!

<A NAME="799039">Subject: First Tour Date</A>

Hey Dudes:

	I`ve known about the Pensacola show for a while but did not say 
anything about it because it was only a rumor. Where *do* you guys get your 
information anyway. The Bayfront venue, however, it much smaller than the 
Civic Center where they usually play. Although Jethro Tull is playing at the 
Bayfront location later this month, and I thought that they were a pretty big 
concert act. BTW Pensacola is where I live (sort of). I have not heard 
anything about tickets yet.
	Word has it that Rush will also be rehearsing here for the tour. I 
wouldn`t mind sitting in on one of those rehearsals. Don't have those kind 
connections though. Oh, well. Life goes on.

	FUN FACT: The group Yes used the Pensacola Civic Center to
rehearse in for their Union tour. The first date of the concert was also
played in Pensacola.

	FUN FACT: Michael and Janet Jackson have both used the Pensacola
Civic Center to rehearse in, but did not play any shows here. I was *Not*
disappointed.

	FUN OBSERVATION: Concerts are generally better near the end of a
tour rather than the beginning. I would rather be one of the last people
to see them and get a great show than be one of the first to see them
and get a "not so good" show. (Like Rush does bad shows.) Read that
previous paranthetical expression with heavy sarcasm.

I have to agree with that guy who said *SOME* of you out there need to
take you Ritalin more often. It's just an album. Four months from
now who's going to care about who heard it first before it was released!
We're all listening to it now anyway. I suppose I should admit that I was once 
like that myself around the time ASOH came out. So please don't take any 
offense to the above comments. Well, that's all I have time for here tonight.

		See Ya'll at the show(s)

   To add to the growing list of generally favorable Cp reviews, here's one
from the latest Guitar World magazine:

Guitar World Dec. 1993

>> RUSH
Counterparts
***1/2 (out of *****)

Just when most folks had pretty much given up hope on Alex Lifeson, he makes
like Lazarus here and plays with a rocking vigor he hasn't displayed since
1981's _Moving Pictures_.  And with Lifeson playing more guitar and Geddy
Lee (bass amp now fully cranked to 12) playing less synthesizer, the new
Rush album, _Counterparts_, becomes the record die-hard Rush-heads have long
been hoping and praying for.  From the delicious dissonance of "Animate" to
the fat, raw, chords of "Cut to the Chase" to the monstrously dark and
ominous riffs of "Double Agent", it's obvious that Lifeson is the beast that
ultimately puts the bite in Rush's bark.  Now if we could just get Geddy to
belt those vocals a bit more....          --MICHAEL MOSES <<

   Well, it's nice to see Alex getting his due in the guitar mags, isn't it?
Until Larry Lalonde fires Les from Primus...
