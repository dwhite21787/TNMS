There is now a new MacSounds file out in the anonymous ftp area on syrinx.
The files should be ok now, but I take no credit/blame for them.  Check out
the README file in that directory for more specifics.  See also post #2 below
from Milton Moskowitz for details.

  ** SERVICE INTERRUPTION -- IMPORTANT -- READ **

There will be an interruption in service with the NMS.  I'd mentioned this
before in passing, but it's staring us all in the face now.  There may or
may not be a NMS tomorrow, Friday 9/20.  I will not be at work that day,
but my log on from home.  Next week, Mon 9/23 through Fri 9/27 I will be
away on vacation.  There will be NO mailings for this week.  I'd appreciate
it if people didn't swamp the addresses on syrinx with mail, but I won't
hold my breath.  :-)

The machine should be up the whole time; my office is accessible by others
if there is a problem.  One Syrinx user in particular (hi, Ed!) will be sure
to alert people if it goes down, so there shouldn't be any major interruptions
in availability.

For those of you in the eastern US, if you happen to see a Honda Accord with
"Syrinx" license plates in VA or NC (Outer Banks), stop and say "hi" to your
list-manager.  :-)

Now that the traffic has died down, I'll send in my batch 'o stuff

Yes, I am partial to COS as well. There's alot of great guitar on that
album.

The "ghost" of a chance has got to be an intentional irony: I don't
believe in destiny, or XYZ, or ABC, or angels, but I believe there's
a ghost... I'm sure I don't need to tell this crowd, Neil's full of
words twists and double-meanings. Like the phrase "you bet your life"
When you get on that train, or load your gun, you're playing the odds
that it won't derail, or it won't go off accidentally - the odds are
certainly in your favor, but still, you're *betting* your life, for real.
Or "fence the enemy within" with foils and rapiers? or with chain-link?
Ahhh...  To non-Rush fans it's just silly, but I really dig the way
Neil does that. I'm going to stop this line now, since you all no I can
just go on and on...

I don't know what objectivism is, but I do think Neil is highly skeptical
of divine powers at work in this universe. It's causes and effects, albeit
extremely ( uncomputably, in fact ) complex causes and effects. I live my
life under the same assumption - to each his or her own faith. Although I
don't think  I'd get along with Neil personally very well, his lyrics were
my main attraction to Rush - I really dug "Freewill".

Is Show Don't Tell the opener now? (missed Presto tour) I wasn't expecting
a change until the next album (3rd album, 1st song from each set of four:
Bastille Day, Spirit 'o, The Big Money)

I think they will play Face Up. I like Face Up. Use headphones, and
anticipate that guitar fill after "... and it's goooood to be alone."
I wish they extended the fill to a solo, it fits beautifully (IMHO).
Sometimes Alex's solos are just there in the bars where the solo goes -
they don't always "fit" with the precision that Page's do.

I've found that anticipation helps to get into Rush songs - you have to
listen and learn. "The obvious thing" doesn't always come next.

The rapper is Leonard Nimoy :-)

Finally, human compassion is a *good thing*. Let's refrain from the "Get a
life" comments just because someone's deeply into Rush (especially when
the same posting contains arguing about fonts on the artwork - get a life).
So there are die-hard Rush fanatics who go on and on all over USENET
about how Rush is the greatest band ever and they can do no wrong....
Live with it - thought police are *bad things*. If someone comes up to
you and says "you're a Rush fan - you mindless zealot!". Just explain to
that individual that s/he is committing an unjustified generaliztion from
*some* Rush fans to *all* Rush fans.

Oh Yeah, where's that U.C. Davis drummer I met here a while ago?

        Is that what they mean my Where's my Thing?  They probably didn't
have room for the elephant on the casette case -- elephants ARE big
creatures, you know?

        And now to the other topic: the MacSounds.  Stupid me FTP'd them in
Binary, and they didn't wanna go as binary for some strange reason.  I
don't know why!  So I've Binhexed them, and I've put them back into the
incoming directory.  Last time: Rush-mgr moved them to /Rush/MacSounds, so
I hope he'll do the same again.  This time I actually tried to download
one, and it works fine.  What you need is a program to UnBinhex the files.
Any of the Stuffit's will do it for you.  Then I saved all the files as
Self-Unstuffing Stuffit Deluxe Archives, so they'll extract themselves.
Enjoy!  If anyone has questions/problems with them: send mail to me -- I'm
quite sure that Rush-mgr has better things to do with his time then answer
questions for the samples that I threw in the FTP site.  I'm more than
happy to give better details on how to use these files.  Enjoy!

Hello Folks.
First of all, the moment anyone hears any tour dates ... PLEASE post them!
Second, has anyone heard anything official about the Gangster Of Boats Trilogy?
I'm hoping that they are going to do three more instrumentals to complete this
work.  Are Rush going to do Rockline again any time in the near future?
Thirdly, to Frank the Tab guy... Please send me your address.  If you still
don't have a Freewill tab file, I can do one for you when I have time.  I might
be able to do a halfway decent Working Man and/or Finding My Way also.

Now ... some opinions.  First of all, there is no way in hell RTB is going to
be #1 on BillBoard anytime in the near future.  Did we forget about the new
Guns and Roses albums?  I'd say those will be #1 at least for the next year
or so.  Rush will be lucky to hang on to #3.  But we can always dream....

Later.

<A NAME="343005">Subject: Geddy, Alex, and Drum Machines.</A>

	Yesterday someone said they didn't know drum machines could
play the difficult patterns Peart plays.  According to excerpts from
"The Drummer's Diary", an article culled from Neil Peart's writings,
"The Weapon"'s drum parts were written by Lee and Lifeson and Mr. O. Scar's
drum machine.  Peart complains about having to bend his arms in
unnatural ways in order to play the part, and mentioned he felt it
was no compromise to go with a straight four on the kick drum, given
the complexity of the drum pattern.
	This article was in a newspaper called "The Sunshine News"
(yes, really!) that was distributed free in my high school when
Signals came out.  What?!?  You don't have a copy of "The Drummer's
Diary"?!?  And you call yourself fans?!?! :-) :-)  Or is this available
via ftp?

<A NAME="343006">Subject: I Hate My Life -- another RTB spoof...</A>

	In the spirit of our recent attempts at parodying RTB, here's
my contribution to the blasphemy.  This spoof of "You Bet Your Life"
is aimed at a lot of the male/female stereotypes we commonly associate
with marriage in America as sarcastically depicted on TV shows like
"Married With Children" and "All In The Family."  My rendition
basically consists of a husband and wife trading insults.  Although
none of the following lyrics are meant to offend anyone, if you find
the need to vent anger at something I've said, PLEASE flame me via
e-mail and NOT through the NMS.  Enough qualification...laugh
heartily!

          I HATE MY LIFE or YOU BET YOUR WIFE (whichever you prefer)
		       Music by Lee and Lifeson
			 Lyrics by Ken Maupin

HUSBAND'S VERSE:
Just another in-law, long outlasting their stay
Just another Bon bill she expects me to pay
Just another dinner means more heartburn and pain
Just another day -- at the end of her ball and chain

HUSBAND'S CHORUS:
THE BROAD AIN'T LEAVIN' -- She always complains
THE BROAD AIN'T LEAVIN' -- She drives me insane
I HATE MY LIFE

WIFE'S VERSE:
Just another whiner, pours his beer down his throat
Just another fat ass in a fishing boat
Just another boozer, always jobless and broke
Just another day -- in a castle with a Coor's Light moat

WIFE'S CHORUS:
THE CLOD'S A HEATHEN -- Just look at this stain
THE CLOD'S A HEATHEN -- All men are the same
I HATE MY LIFE

HUSBAND'S SPOKEN VERSE:
greedy jealous money-hungry shopping mall tourist
talk show and soap opera watching self-taught psychotherapist
irrational demanding whining freedom-choking feminist
wrinkled grey-haired sagging vericosed arthritic gruesomeness

WIFE'S SPOKEN VERSE:
armchair natural gas-producing jaundiced beer-evangelist
chauvinistic smelly hairy foul-mouthed macho egotist
impotent pot-bellied balding middle-aged misogynist
in-debt-up-to-his-eyeballs undereducated credit-risk

FAMILY VERSE:
Just another family, the Cleavers they aren't
Just another household completely lacking heart
Just another marriage on the rocks from the start
Just another couple -- wed until "death do us part"

FAMILY CHORUS:
ONLY GOD KNOWS THE REASON -- The story's the same
ONLY GOD KNOWS THE REASON -- Why love is so lame
I HATE MY LIFE

answered, but...

I've been searching for either TABS or chords to Broone's Bane AND/or The
Trees.  Does anyone here (1) have them, (2) know where to get them, (3) not
care to much, (4) know where they are but don't feel like telling, or
(5) not know what or where they are, but feel like telling?

Thanks for anything...Salutations!

My tape copy of ESL also has Xanadu spelled as Zanadu.  I have been curious
about this myself!  Anyone out there have the answer?

About RTB, I really like the album.  I don't see what people are complaining
about, I think its much better then Presto!  At first I was a little
dissapointed, but after listening to it about twenty times, I really like it!
Does anyone have a tour list dates yet?  Will they swing by Greenville, SC
again?  Maybe I can see if Clemson U will get them to play here... yeah right!

Hm, I always thought it meant something like "he thinks there's a much
greater chance of your lying than him dying".  I.e., he's afraid of both,
but the former is less likely to happen, so he's less afraid of it.
Dunno if "he" is a specific real person; I thought it just referred to
leaders in general.

That's one of my favorite songs, by the way; it's the last Rush song I can
remember that had a long instrumental part in the middle.  I wish they would
do this every once in a while; an instrumental song is great, but I like
songs like "The Weapon" and "Jacob's Ladder" that have the instrumental
weaved in with the rest of the song.

One last remark about the new album: after finally getting a chance to
listen to it closely a couple of times, I noticed how strikingly upbeat the
album sounds as a whole.  It seems like all their albums since _Moving
Pictures_ had predominantly depressing songs, or at least melancholy (for
example, "Losing It" or "Afterimage"); but this one really doesn't have
any.  I mean "Heresy" is a depressing way to look at a good event, but the
music is still mostly upbeat.  I definitely like this "upbeatness", as long
as they don't start doing "Shiny Happy People" or anything as disgusting as
that.

Interesting article, but one statement in here kind of iritated me:

That was not so for the Presto tour.  In the Wisconsin/Illinois/Indiana area,
the only concerts that I knew of were at outdoor ampitheatres - I had cheap
tickets to see them at Alpine Valley but there were T-Storms that day and I
didn't have the motivation to hear an outdoor concert while getting covered
with mud at the same time.

I hope Rush hits this area in the winter so I can see them indoors.  I think
playing at these outdoor shit theaters is selling out, and I hope they don't
do that again this time around.

Not to be a party pooper..but...
 While Rush may be #3 on the charts now... Remember...
The new Gun's and Roses album just came out and that is probably
gonna shoot up rather high. And Ozzy's new album just came out too...

   Good luck to the trio..

Hello, all you Rush fans.  I know everyone is excited that Roll the Bones
has debuted at #3 on the latest Billboard charts, but I predict that it
will never see #1.  You see, there's this band called Guns 'n' Roses which
released 2 albums a few days ago, both of which sold over 500,000 copies in
2 hours.....2 hours!!!!  The album went gold in 2....well, you get the point.
It would be interesting to see if there were any singles off the new album
that cracked the Top 40; not that I care if any do, but perhaps Rush is
starting to be accepted and respected without really changing their
progressive style of music.  Of course, if Rush did hit total mainstream, it
would be a hell of a lot harder than it already is to get tickets, and that
would just suck......

To the person who hears a dog barking in _Dreamline_...I hear em too!  I count
three barks total, one after the other.  So you are not alone.....

Well, that's all folks!

Another reader writes:

Who Jack Secret is, I don't know...
 But I did notice this today...

   On the Blue Oyster Cult album "Imaginos" (1989) there is a
   Jack Secret listed under the additional musicians as a vocalist.

This doesn't surprise me a bit, because Jack/Tony worked for Blue
Oyster Cult before joining the Rush road crew.  I don't have anyone
to compare him to except that he has very long dark hair, a semi-
dark complexion, wears sunglasses a lot, had on black leather the
day I met him and had a penchant for women.  In fact Slider noticed
that my dress was wrinkled and said he had some wrinkle-free stuff
back at the hotel...yeah get serious.  I guess because of my sex
I could've met the boys, but that's what makes Rush different,
is they don't have "groupies."  They are all married.  So what's
the point?

To the guy who asked about Rush's Pgh tour date (and for others of you
interested...):

WDVE has yet to announce a firm date, but they keep saying Rush will be
here during the month of Rocktober.  So, given that Rush starts their
tour on October 25, my guess is they'll be here on or shortly before
Halloween.

Sounds to me like a good excuse for Pittsburgh Rush Party #2, eh?

Chuck, Doug, Ian, Ken, whaddya think?

First off, thanks to those who have replied to my Aimee Mann/Geddy Lee moan
question....  I will post the results when I'm sure people have had a chance to
reply.

I just heard on a St. Catherines Ontario radio station that ANDY CURRAN will
open the Hamilton show.  I sure this will mean he will open most of the Candian
shows, since he is a Canadian act, although who knows about the American shows.

By the way, Mr. Big opened Presto in the States, and Voivod opened when I  saw
them in Toronto, but who opened the rest of the Canadian shows??

If you've never heard of Andy Curran, he has been enjoying moderate to good
success in and around Ontario for the past couple years.  His two biggest solo
tunes so far seem to be 'License to Love' and 'Let Go'.  He has been touring
incessantly for at least the last 1.5 years.  His sound is basic hard rock,
no keyboards.  He was formerly the lead singer with Coney Hatch, who were
fairly big around these parts quite a few years ago.  Their biggest hit was
'Monkey Bars'.

<A NAME="343021">Subject: Great interview Erik!</A>

Greetings,

Thanks for the transcription of the great interview, Erik!
There are some interesting topics for discussion it seems to raise.
The interview had great information.

But the writer seemed a bit unexceptional -- as in:
>   There is the token ecological in _Red Tide_ but for the most part, the
>subject matter deals with humanistic matters like  cynicism (_Show Don't
>Tell_) and sensory perception (_Available Light_), an ode to Peart's
>travelling adventures.

I hate it whenever the band does a song and the writer calls it a
`token' song. Like, oh yeah, Rush always has at least _one_ ecological
song on each album, they have to have one _no matter what_, so they
wrote ``Red Tide.'' Give me a break.

I, for one, never saw ``Show Don't Tell'' as a song about cynicism.
I've always seen it as a song about the most dependable way of getting
to the truth -- i.e. demanding evidence. It seems to me a cynic wouldn't
ask for evidence, he or she would _assume_ that they were being lied to.

And there is a puzzler:
>"So with _Presto_, the only way we could keep the running order the way
>we wanted was to put more material on side one than on side two.
>This means the sound level on the first side is lower that on the second."

Could one of our resident engineers please explain this one?

I have trouble seeing how the amount of material on the sides
of a recording could affect their relative sound level. It
almost sounds like, gee, each side can only have so much _sound_
and we've got to distribute amongst _all these songs_! WHA?!

And some great news:
>   "We could tolerate it when we were younger and we had to play 300 gigs a
>year to survive," recounts Lifeson.  "But now that we've all got families,
>it becomes so much harder.  It's not so bad for Neil; he's started to work
>on his travelogues and he goes for a 60-mile cycle to relieve the boredom."
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sounds great for fans of Neil's writing! Perhaps these are the
mysterious book(s) Neil has distributed (so far) only amongst those
close to the band?

>Peart enthuses.  "We stayed in the huts with the village chiefs
>and got to know the people in a way you never could if you were just touring
>with a band.  They thought it was quite a novelty to see a white man playing
>the drums!"

Cool!

>"Corporate sponsorship is a vulgar, abhorrent concept," [Neil] says, "which
>drives up a show's production costs by hundreds of thousands without
>reflecting the band's true demand."

People say the band is selling out -- ha!

And some bad news:
>   "For us to play places like Eastern Europe, Japan and Australia would be
>totally self-gratifying," notes Peart.  "We know the fans aren't there, so
>why bother?  And besides, I'd rather see those places on my bike.  It's a
>lot more intimate and a lot more fun."

What about our Aussie and Japanese list members!!

I guess you'll just invite Neil over to your house, eh?

Wow. If anyone else has an interview like this that isn't at syrinx
could they please transcribe it?

Gregg

p.s. I promise to submit another transcription of my own soon...

	To whoever said they heard dogs barking during Dreamline, I hear
them as well. It comes at about 1:11 in the song (on my CD player at least).
For you people with the cassette, it's just after the line "Promise of a good
job/Far away from her hometown" or something like that.
