----------------------------------------------------------------------
In many cases where dates were questionable, I have included (?) to
state so.  Some dates gotten from various sources claim more than
one location played on such a date, I have included (?) to mark
these as well.  Cases where the band played more than one night at
a location but where I only had 1 date, I have marked the other 2
dates with (?) to indicate this.

There are many missing gaps still (especially from the early tours
and from overseas dates) and through time, I will add them to this
list and re-send revisions as I see fit.  Please, if you find any
drastic error(s) in the listing or have evidence to a date contrary
to one listed, please send email to:

jlang@syrinx.umd.edu or rush@ucsd.edu

Updates will be mailed as I make revisions.  Thank you.
This list is obtainable via anon-ftp to syrinx.umd.edu
