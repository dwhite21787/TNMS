First off, if you missed the announcement in the last issue, the confirmed 
date of the start of the tour will be January 22, 1994 in Pensacola, Florida.
Mark your calendars, Rush fans!

Also, there seems to be a couple of letters to the list about certain
administrative things.  I'm not sure how many of you are even interested in 
the drudgery and menial tasks of what goes on behind running a mailing list.
I don't mind answering any/all of them but if you would prefer them all out 
of the digest, then please mail those types of posts to the rush-mgr account.  
Thanks.. I don't want to bore other readers that's all.

I keep seeing people mention good deals on CP, and I'm slightly annoyed,
since I paid $16 for it, but I got it at Ga Tech's bookstore, which
probably accounts for the difference.

I am of the sort who gets off trying to decypher coded messages like the
"remember death", and tryed immediately every trick I could think of to
figure out the binary on Cp.  I also have been reading all of your ideas
(DDD sounds ok, but bland :) and this thought struck me into hysterics:

I wonder how hard Hugh Syme and RUSH worked to make sure this binary
combination was UNTRANSLATABLE into anything that might possably be
construed as a message.  I mean, some of us are pretty dam resorcefull,
and just darn crazy (using translating masks, or treating it as a
possable archive format) and none of us seems to have even come up with a
lame phrase.  That in itself is impressive!!!

I'll make this brief..

1) Did anyone notice the absence of a very important (or at least
common) counterpart, that of black and white?  It is definitely
missing in the list of Cps and they seem to have made a point about
leaving it out of some of the other Cps such as the puzzle and the ?/!
Cp, favoring red and black instead.  Perhaps an attempt at the racial
integration theme from Alien Shore, or am I just getting carried away
by the "Rush is SO deep" mania?  Any thoughts?

2) Seeing as how I just got the album today (well, technically
yesterday, but...) I didn't get a chance to notice this sooner, but I
haven't noticed anyone else who mentioned it (sorry if I missed it).
Anyway, did anyone else notice the juxtaposition of gay and straight
in the list of Cps "...happy & gay straight & narrow...".  I thought
it was kinda cool.

ps.  I've seen too many opinions about the album to post my own.
Suffice it to say, it's been posted by someone else already.

"A lot." -H

                Cp is a great album.  Now on to the real reason I am
posting.   I must say I am a little ticked at the good old Rush-mgr. I
mean how many posts of "Haven't you ever heard of 'tooth & nail' or 'the
new Pearl Jam is cool"  do I HAVE TO SIT THROUGH!!!  YES!!!    I AM
SCREAMING!!!!!    I personally don't see why some of the Nat. Stars can't
be trimmed down a little.    Once again,  why the Pearl Jam
content?!?!?!?    Just because the album is released on the same day as
CP, I have to hear what everyone thinks about Eddie Vedders new mummbled,
shitty vocals.  This a Rush discussion group folks.

All comments welcome.

   [ These are good comments.  So folks, how about it, maybe a bit less about 
     PJ, and some more Rush.                                    :rush-mgr]

Andy is right.  Anyone else notice this?  The background of the picture
of the traffic light in the Counterparts booklet is identical to the
background on the "other CP" - Coverdale/Page.  I'm comparing the two right
now.  They are the same, except the Counterparts one looks a little
squished in the vertical.  I seem to remember reviewers not liking
the design of the Coverdale/Pagey album, but I don't recall why.

I hope they do DA in concert.  I wanna see Geddy play bass and do that
chanting at the same time.  It seems pretty tough to me....

Jello --

My house is now blessed.  Even though i got the lp yesterday, I wanted
to wait for the right moment to *blast* it.  I got home, no one else
was home, got out the Bailey's Irish Cream (*LOVE* that stuff!), put
on my RTB sweatshirt and made three toasts.  One for Pat, one for Lee,
and then one for Alex, Neil, and Geddy.  Then I proceeded to knock
the walls off all the houses in the neighborhood!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
I sat on the couch, sloppily air-drumming to the songs, rolling on
the floor in my maniacal impersonation of Alex doing a solo, and just
plain laughing like hell at the sheer joy of it all!!  sigh.  So, the
house is blessed, in the name of Rush (hey, I'm a certified Reverend,
I can do that!) and all is well.

A couple of things, though.  The *sound* of the album is a bit harsh.
I think they should've recorded at least the drums in analog.  I don't
particulary like drums, especially the *cymbals* (ugh), recorded in
digital -- my ears can't take it.  If they'd wanted to really get that
raw sound, I think they would've achieved it better with a little more
analog in the mix.

Also, does anyone else think that LTTA would sound better at a slower
speed?  It's such an emotional melody; I'd just like to savor it a
bit more.  I agree with the person who mentioned that it's an Emotion
Amplifier -- it really does enhance the mood you're in.  wow.

Ho-hoo!

On his Rockline interview in November of 1991 (I think), the announcer
asks him during the interview the correct way to pronounce his name,
and he said "Peert", just like the commentator for the premiere.

I know the traffic's high due to the release of CP, but if there is room for
an under-rated tunes discussion, I'd be interested in reading it.  I thought
of this because last digest, someone mentioned Available Light, which is one
of my _very favorite_ Rush Tunes.  Some other under-rated tunes:

It was mentioned a couple of digests ago that in Alien Shore,  "we are
seperated by one chromosone was meant to be a difference between blak
and white...well actually it could very well be the difference between
male and female...as we all start out as females and then a change in
chromosones changes us to male....look at the lyrics.

Now my comments on the album:

1) This I think is Geddy's best bassist work...by far, listen to those
grooves...perhaps he feels a challenge from Les Claypool??

2) True Neil's drums are a bit more simplistic and lyrics not as demanding
but it is not allways nesc. to crank out the hardest lines, in order to

<A NAME="796014">Subject: Counterpoints...</A>

First as to the comment about Alien Shore and one chromosone being about
black and white.  Think of it as male/female.  It makes more sense to
the rest of the lyrics and we all start out with the same chrome. and then
we evolve with a different one!

My album comments:

1) Geddy plays better bass then ever...I think.  Maybe a challenge from
Les Claypool??

2) Ok, so the lyrics aren't exactly what we are used to from Neil.  So what?
They are still deepere in meaning then most other rock groups.  For the bit
of a harder edge, perhaps he couldn't find the right words to matc
3) Alex sound very very much like he did on Signals, Power Windows, and HYF
Perhaps this is due to the return of Peter Collins? But I think he finally
has regained decent solos with decent riffs...whereas before he had one or
the other.

4) LTTA sounds a lot like some early Yes stuff to me...esp. the middle when
the bass is cranked up.

Over all the album took three listen to warm up to, but I think it is some
great work and bar the Speed of Light...great songs all the way around.

Rushppl --

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm getting tired of all the "Tooth is
next to nail -- it's tooth & nail, get it?" posts.  Rather than just complain
about it, I came up with a solution: list 'em all.  So, wish me luck (and, if
you don't agree with me on any of them, you're wrong (: )

UPPER-LEFT PANEL:
King & Queen
Left & Right Breast (hey, they're counterparts of each other, no?)
Lock, Stock & Barrel

TOP-CENTER PANEL:
Hot & Cold
Puzzle Pieces (again, that's it -- puzzle pieces are counterparts)
The Birds & The Bees
(I just DON'T get the Geddy on drums picture)
Near & Far
Tooth & Nail
The Gears in the Watch
Relationships & Happiness
Left & Right Halves of Scale
P's & Q's (as in "Mind your...")
Canada & Quebec
Yin & Yang
Interrogation & Exclamation
Note & Rest

UPPER-RIGHT PANEL:
Tortise & Hare
X's & Y's (Simply Variables, or Chromosomes, if you must)
Salt & Pepper
You & I
Stop & Go
North & South (& East & West, etc.)
Comedy & Tragedy
Love & Money (nice catch on the 2112, btw, whoever made it)
Bow & Arrow (Neil & Beret? naah... (: )

LOWER-LEFT:
Diagonally, top-left to bottom-right: Scissors, Paper, Rock
Middle-left and middle-right: Walk & Don't Walk (Go & Stop again)
Lower-left and top-right: Sun & Moon
Top-center and bottom-center: Heads & Tails

BOTTOM-CENTER PANEL:
Larry, Moe & Curly
Counter Parts (get it? Parts of a counter, eh, it's a joke)
Home & Visitor (They should've shown a complete score -- would've added
  winner & loser into the picture...)
Mortar & Pestle
Adam & Eve
X & O (Hey! There's my "Winner & Loser" too!)
See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil

There, now that that's out of the way, we can all go back to enjoying the
album!  Unless the binary code posts persist....  I mean, LOOK at the thing
folks -- just shift the middle line over a character and they're all the
SAME!  It's DECORATION!  Stop wasting time and just LISTEN to the fool thing!
Oh... sorry... getting a bit out of control there :)  Hope I managed to clear
some stuff up, not just make more trouble, eh :)

<A NAME="796016">Subject: More on Counterparts</A>

Counterparts is a great album, definitely worth the wait. I can't wait
to hear it live!! Here are my thoughts on the album.

1. The best song on the album is Nobody's Hero. Like many of the other
people who heard this song for the first time, I too was moved. But I
think the reason the song is so powerful is because it addresses everyday
heroes other than Neil's friend. "...Saves a drowning child, Cures a
wasting disease."

2. I'm surprised that so many people don't include Double Agent as one of
the better songs on this album. The lyrical dualism that is present in the
song is a great example of the band's maturity. How many other band could
successfully rap and progressive rock tracks together to form a coherent
piece. But I do admit it is a song that has to grow on you.

3. Leave That Thing Alone sound like the perfect compliment to Where's My
Thing. Try playing the songs back to back and you should have little doubt
that they are related.(possibly Gangster of Boats pt. 3?????)

  [ Well according to Alex and Geddy, the two things are different.  Yes, 
    different things, not the same thing.                       :rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="796017">Subject: Credits referring to tour-people</A>

Some people have been wondering about some of the credits in the
_Counterparts_liner, particularly the ones referring to the tour.
Something I have noted very recently is that it is very likely that all of
these tour credits refer to those people who helped them out on their
_previous_ previous tour.  That is, the tour credits in _Counterparts_
refer to the tour for _Roll the Bones_, the tour credits in _RTB_ refer to
the tour for _Presto_, etc.

The biggest clue for me is that I remember reading in _Lighting
Dimensions_, a lighting trade magazine, in early 1992 that Howard
Ungerleider was not able to direct lighting for the RTB tour because he
was busy working on some tour for another band (Queensryche, maybe), and
that the lighting director for RTB was Shawn Richardson.  Then, when I saw
the credit in CP for Shawn Richardson as lighting director, it hit me.  I
looked in the credits for RTB, and Shawn Richardson was never mentioned.

Another reason this makes sense is that all of the credits for the tour
are mentioned, including all booking agencies and merchandising people,
while the tour has not even happened yet.  I find it hard to believe that
they would know of all of the people that help them out for the tour this
far before the tour happens, let alone in time to get these things printed
in the liner.

It makes more sense to me that the tour credits refer to the previous
tour, not the upcoming one.

Happy listening!!

C'mon guys (and gals):
        I sent a message a few days ago about a survey of the new album. I
asked you guys for your favorite song on the album and have received a
paltry showing of reader participation. Something tells me, just call it a
hunch, that there are more people out there who read the NMS and own the
new album, so write me and tell me what you think. What's your favorite
song on Counterparts?

remember Vital Signs, there's a bit of a reference to that as well(check my

This is my first post, if you don't agree with what it says, well, deal
with it.
	Anyway, I've noticed that a lot of you hace problems with the
drumming on CP, saying that it's too simple and too vulgar.  That's the
point,
(oops, typo)
the entire album is simple and vulgar.  I'm a rock fan (also like a lot of
Rush) and the straitforwardness of this album is great.  This is the first
Rush album I've heard that really rocks.  It's powerful in its simplicity,
and that really turns me on.  The drum lines fit this powerful groove
perfectly, and my hat goes off to Neil for being such a versatile
player that he can leave that complex grooves in behind when they're not
needed.  Complex drumming is fine in its place, but there is no place for
it on _Counterparts_.  It would only deprive the album of the sheer
power it contains.
	Any flame, go ahead, I'll answer anything.
	The album is great, if you don't have a copy, get one.

Started my subscription on release day when I found a
reference to TNMS while looking for reviews in FTP-land.  I
thought CP was great but was curious what the unbiased ones
thought.  Imagine my surprise upon finding an entire
microcosm of people just as biased about Rush as I am.  You
are all wonderful-especially rush-mgr.

I'm walking that fine line between listening enough and
listening too much.  Don't want to burn out too soon.  Anyone
else grappling with this dilemma?  Is it possible to burn out
on this album?

Tried to figure out the first 2 secs of AS.  Not satisfied
with any theories so far but have none of my own.  Noticed
that there is more talking between 3:40 and 4:00 on the same
song.  If you play it backwards and slow it down 2x I think
it says "I buried Rutsey."

Confession:  I like the chorus to BSaM.

Jon Carrol, a columnist for the SF Chronicle, collects them

What's your guess?

I originally thought that Geddy was singing "The whirlwind's

Ok, this won't go on for pages, I promise. Eric, you and Gregg were saying:

This argument was in response to you saying you'd only heard two songs off
_CP_, right? Well... I have to agree with Gregg that two songs doesn't add
up to the whole cow -- er, glass of milk -- whatever. Neil's philosophical
beliefs can hardly be pinpointed from such a narrow range; his lyrics tend
to change views between songs radically sometimes. On this album, you have
the complexities of man in "Animate" and the complexities of woman in "Cold
Fire" (Damn! Broke my inadvertant right justification! :) :) ... in "Between
Sun and Moon" and "Double Agent" you have very emotional, mystical lyrics,
sorta, and then in "Cold Fire" (there's that song again!) you have very
logical views on emotional subjects.

Anyway, what I'm saying is, to have an idea of what philosophical views any
one album represents, you really do have to hear the whole thing. Of course,
you probably have by now, and have probably heard the interview too, so this
has become an outdated point. Ah well.

Now, THIS point I would have to agree with you on.

Date: Sat, 23 Oct 93 17:22:33 -0600

Well, let's see what these songs sound like... We've already had a vote
for "Sonic the Hedgehog" (ROFL to that one! I immediately took a listen
and you're right!!) and one for Pearl Jam ...

I think the end of "Animate", if you added the "WHOOOOOSH" sound of a plane
taking off, would be magically transformed into Queensryche's "Jet City
Woman". 'S true!

And did someone already compare the beginning of "Animate" to Faith No More's
"Falling to Pieces" or maybe "Epic"? (I can't remember which one sounds like
that; it's been too long.)

Somebody transcribe the upcoming "Talk me to your leader" thing! PLEEEEASE!?
Thanks. You are a saint.

I wondered awhile about the nude breasts, too. I guess one breast is the
counterpart of the other.

Now.. I'm wondering, which songs do you think sound like after Neil wrote
'em, Geddy didn't really buy 'em, so they come off a little less than
authentic? I think "Alien Shore" and maybe "Speed of Love" fall a little
flat in that respect. Geddy just doesn't sound like he believes in the lyrics
to me. Couldn't tell ya why exactly. But that's a risk you take when one
person pens and another sings.

On the other hand, I think someone made that very comment about "Nobody's
Hero" and I couldn't disagree more. He sings it with such emotion, sounds
so "forlorn" (thanks -- that was the perfect word) and sad, that I think
he believes in those lyrics more than most. I would compare it to "The Pass"
and "Losing It". And maybe "Heresy". (I love that song; I know a bunch of you
said you didn't. Oh well.)

Speaking of "NH", I finally think I understand the line "If anybody's buying
nobody's hero"... It's a weird line break, is all. If written as prose, I
think you'd get something more like: "...the glamor girl who'd love to sell
her soul, if anybody's buying. --Nobody's hero..." making the title line more
of a refrain than part of a sentence. Does that make sense? Well, it works
for me.

I want to make posters out of some of the illustrated lyric snippits from the
liner notes. Especially "My angels and my demons at war".

Someone a bit of a while back asked about these lyrics.. if they're

<gasp!> an insight.

Someone else already speculated that in the song, there are two people
present at this lake, this place, and that it was a variant on the
Chain Lightning theme. So I figure, "yes to yes" is one sharing experience
with the other, some mutual agreement to perhaps enjoy this fine place.

Second, someone please keep us informed as to the Billboard info as it is

Third.  In my last post i wrote 3 lines in reference to frats, and that
one is keeping me awake at night.  The rush-mgr took offence to this
saying it has nothing to do with rush.  He actually took up more lines
than I did saying so.  

   [ This is true.  And if you would like to spend a lot of time discussing 
     my reasoning behind what I said, I'll be more than happy to answer you 
     in email.  You know the address (rush-mgr@syrinx.umd.edu) I'm sorry that 
     one of the frats is keeping you awake at night, etc..etc.. and that they 
     are idiots, etc..etc. but seriously, this has nothing to do with Rush 
     music persay.  Send me email I'll be happy reply.           :rush-mgr ]

All I have to say is one: what I said can fall
into the same cateogory as people complaining about studying (which they
do often and no one complains) two: there had actually been discussion
about the subject in reference to individualism and what rush symbolizes.

   [ But what you put in your PS was just not relevant, if you want to discuss
     it, send me mail.  You were talking about them partying all night, etc.. 
     and how they're all idiots, I mean come on.  This forum just isn't the 
     place.  I'm sorry if that's harsh but I don't want no flame war coming 
     out of your PS.                                          :rush-mgr ]

And finally, I can't write the few lines I did as  PS but someone can
fill five to six lines with a signature that has no value to it
what so ever. If you want to cut back on waste, do it across the board.

   [ You can write a PS if you want - just make sure it's relevant.  As far as
     signatures go.  I've already stated, please keep it to 5 lines.  As far 
     as doing things across the board, believe me that is my intention, I will 
     admit though that sometimes I just don't have the *time* or resources to 
     scan EVERY article!  I apologize for this.  Typically I scan the articles 
     and sometimes don't get to scrutinize every word, content, etc..  Because 
     of this, I realize things aren't always "fair" but that's how the list 
     operates.  Feel free to email me if you're not happy, I'm open to 
     opinions.                                                    :rush-mgr ]

A question is asked about a tooth and nail and it gets 10 responces,
including one from the manager.  I must admit you do a great job, but i
think everyone would prefer fairness in cutting back the bulk around
here.

   [ I'll be open to suggestions.  And remember this type of stuff is 
     "administrative" stuff so email to the rush-mgr account.   I'll try and
     keep this out of the normal digest.                           :rush-mgr ]

Hi all --

Earlier during the week, there was a brief exchange on whether it took
"balls" for Peart to deal with homosexuality in "Nobody's Hero."

As a lesbian, I have thought a good deal about that first verse (although
not nearly as much time as many TNMS'rs have spent thinking about those
1s and 0s on the cover). I have finally concluded that, while it was
a well-intentioned stab at calling attention to the fact that it takes
extraordinary courage for some people just to get through a normal
day, Peart diluted his message.

In that first verse, two of the four lines consist of Peart reasserting
his own heterosexuality. His friend's story could have been told much
more powerfully if there was a little more about *him* and a little
less about how "straight" Peart is. But hey, some of his best friends
are gay, right?

I hope this doesn't sound like a bitter diatribe, because it's not.
I do wish Peart had waited until he was a little better prepared
intellectually and emotionally to deal with this issue before he took
it on. Obviously the issue *did* threaten him a little, at least in
terms of how he thought his audience might react.

I thought you might like to either post this or archive it -- the 
_Boston Globe's_ review of CP.

Rush: Challenging the mind as rock's senior statesmen
By: Steve morse
globe staff

	Canadiam power-trio Rush scraped for years to get to the top of
the hard-rock field.  Now that the group is there, Rush deserves credit
for not slipping into the arena-rock smugness of many of their peers.
If anything, the band appears increasingly comfortable with the role of
senior statesmen:  Witness the new album, "Counterparts," due in stores
today.
	Unlike many hard-rockers who are still trying to satisfy their
egos and libidos, rush writes new songs that attack racism and sexism
("Alien Shore"), sympathize with a friend who died of AIDS ("Nobody's
Hero"), defend a woman concerned with male physical abuse ("Cold Fire")
and warn about putting up with corporate and societal lies ("Stick It
Out").
	Singer Geddy Lee, once a shrieky yowler who's now among the most
improved vocalists in rock, offers this statesmanlike observation in the
guitar-driven "Cut to the Chase":

	_I'm old enough not to care too much
	About what you think of me
	But I'm young enough to remember
	  the future
	And the way things ought to be_

	Amazingly enough, Rush will celebrateits 20th anniversary next
year.  A tour is planned to start in January (no word yet on a local 
date), but, for the moment, this album will have to suffice.  And suffice
it does with a jarringly virtuosic, socially conscious batch of songs
that should heighten a respect cemented in 1991 with the disc "Roll the
Bones," followedby a sold-out Worcester Centrum show.
	Rush may be too preachy for some listeners, and too unmelodic for
others (guitarist Alex Lifeson can still play with dental-drill relentless-
ness), but this album marks a major step forward.  The former Rush sin of
bombast creeps into the new track "The Speed of Love" ("nothing changes 
faster than the speed of love," Lee sings), but most songs challenge the
mind, even as they're ripping through the brain with monster guitar riffs
and the big-beat, arena-size drum sounds of Neil Peart.
	Befitting Rush's role as cerebral rock philosiphers, the song
"Animate Me" pays tribute to psychologist Carl Jung, notably Jung's
thesis of merging the anima (feminine side) and animus  (masculine side).
How amny rock bands delve this deep?  And a bright overlay of optimism 
coats the last track, "Everyday Glory":  "If the future's looking dark,
we're the ones who have to shine."  The band keeps that promise here.

A picture of the boys is above the article, Geddy at left in a short
sleeve shirt and his specs, Neil left of center, in a striped shirt and 
"He's got Cancer!" bandana, and Alex is standing apart from them on the right.

Well there have a few posts from y'all out there wondering why some of
us including yours truely love *cold fire* and *speed of love* so much.  I will
attempt to elucidate:

1) SUBJECT MATTER: Since I'm about to get married, I'm in perfect state of mind
to relate with both of these songs.  The negotiations on *Cold Fire* in
particular ring close to the heart if you will.  

2) GROOVE:  *Cold fire* is one of the tightest Rush songs IMHO.  (Of course
 the fact that is in 4/4 helps).  Geddy's bass and Neil's drums lay down
and incredible foundation for alex to soar over

3) TEXTURES:  Both songs contain some incredible textural playing by Alex.
Listen to the "steel guitar" like lines in the first and second verses of
*cold fire*.  The fit the melody of Ged's singing/bass playing perfectly.In
*speed of love*, Alex covers the track with a beautiful wash of chords and
arpegios (sp?).  In the past they would have used synths here.

4) VOICE: Geds singing is the best on these songs IMHO.  Listen
carefully to the verses on *cold Fire* and the chorus on *speed of love*

I agree that these are two of the slower and less complex tunes on the album
but that doesn't make them inferior.  
Besides the Parakeets love 'em. 'Nuff said !!   8-)
