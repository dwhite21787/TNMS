Thanks to all who contributed to the "Satanic Edition" of the digest, it was
great! And some posts that people sent in just came in too late to make that
issue, so if you didn't see yours in the digest that's probably why.
This issue should catch up all the posts that have been waiting to be sent out.

Rushia,

All this unplugged talking reminded me of THE unplugged song by Rush:
Rivendel (just MHO). I think that the acoustic guitar is played by Geddy,
not by Alex. On the album it says under geddy's name (something like)
Bass Guitar, Occasional Acoustic Guitar and Vocals. Since Geddy wrote
the song with Neil I think Geddy plays the Acoustic Guitar. You can
hear Alex play some synth-like notes on the electric guitar and I also
think that if Alex would have played it a little bit more complex than
the current version by Geddy (if this is true ofcourse).

I donot hope this is a FAQ (the last time I read it was quite a while ago,
I wasn't even subscribed then) but if its not I'd like to see this dis-
cussed.

Oh BTW if there is anybody out there that has info on RTB on vinyl.
pleasepleaaseplease let me know it too. I dont have a CD player and I have
alll the Rush album except RTB :^( This is off ocurse not acceptable for
any Rush-aholic.

Greetings from the Sundog!  Guess you could say I'm a long time listener,
first time caller.

I think this Satanic discussion is going to people's heads:

Message to Andy C...The song Anagram, especially that chorus line, has NOTHING
to do with satanic ideas.  If you'll take a good look at all the lyrics,
every(or almost every) line uses a certain word(s), then changes the letters
around to create a new word, which is then used to complete the line.

This is the whole meaning of "anagram" and it's used with ferocious cleverness
by NP (no surprise there.)

Hope that ends that satanic sidetrack.

Well, I enjoyed getting that off my brain.

If this question should have gone in the faq I applogize but I didnt see it
covered in there.

	Does anyone know what city that is used for the subdivisions video?
I have heard that it is Los Angeles but it seems too small.

One last quick thing.  Has anyone recently tried to buy Neil Peart signature
sticks? I put in an order over 3 weeks ago and they told me that the
warehouse was out of them.  Apparentally they dont keep them in stock.
I am wondering...did Neil only put out a limited amount?

Thanks.

Hy,
   A matter of curiosity, are the text passages within the lyrics to 2112, in
the lyrics directory of syrix the work of Peart, or are they the clever
addition of the person who put the lyrics there?

<A NAME="667007">Subject: Rush for lunch</A>

i'm telling you this pathetic story because the NMS is the only place where i
can find sympathetic ears.  today at noontime i was listening to robert
johnson (truly amazing music for those of you interested) when i called up a
friend to see about lunch.  we agreed to meet in five minutes.  so i took out
the cd i had in, and as i usually do, i checked to see what was on the radio.
during the noontime hour, KSHE (a st. louis station mentioned on the NMS
before) plays an artist for lunch, and then one for dessert, which means they
play one artist or group for forty minutes, and then another for the remaining
twenty.  thus i turned the station to KSHE to see who was for lunch--this was
at about 12:06, right at the beginning.  for those of you who have difficulty
anticipating obvious plots and who also failed to look at the subject of this
post, i found myself in the middle of the "Working Man" jam.  i also caught
the first verse of RTB, but i had to go eat.  i missed forty minutes of Rush.
i tried to console myself thinking that i have all of the songs they'd have
played on disc anyway, but let's be honest, it's always best to hear your
favorite group on the radio, even if it is only "normal" Rush.  thank you
for listening.  i feel much better now.

   Not to worry, my friend.  IMO, Presto was the best album Rush
put forth since Moving Pictures.  It was refreshing blast of
musical energy. The boys seemed to be really enjoying
themselves once again and almost every song gets me singing.
   My only complaints about Presto are---1) the complete lack
of presence of Geddy's bass and 2) the album cover.
   Let's see what others think...

TO: Redpaco...
   So, you're making a move to the land of the Blue Devil.
Well, ma'am (as the gentlemen say in the South), be prepared
for a welcome culture shock.  I'm a Durham resident (my wife's
a nurse at Duke).  You'll be happy to know that most of the
stereotypes are untrue in the RDU area.  Many of us are trans-
plants from up North who have come for work (VERY LOW
unemployment rate here).  You won't find the exceptional variety
of Bahston, but you get an abundance of nightlife, sports, and culture
at a more relaxed pace.  Oh, and just to keep this message barely RUSH
related, WRDU 106.1 usually plays only the standard fare plus too much
Southern rock.

Hello, i don't know if anyone said this yet, but i'm pretty sure a
fretless bass was used on Pink Floyd's "Hey You", and according to David
Gilmour he played it, instead of Roger Waters.

Also, Chris Maka wrote about how he hasn't seen many non-white,
non-hispanic Rush fans.  I'm from Texas also(and i'm Indian), and I know
people from all different backgrounds that like Rush in Texas.  Here in
the Bay Area, i've seen a lot of Indians with Rush shirts on, and i've
noticed quite a few Indian names on the NMS.

Hi

First of all thanks for correcting the Jaco tune title, sorry about that.
Secondly, and more importantly
I think Presto is one of the bands best albums. When it first came out i
thought it was a real improvement on HYF which I think is one of the boys
lamest (but of course lame in regards to Rush is a relative term). In
particular I loved the intro to Show Don't Tell (still one of my favourite
Rush songs)

Just my $0.02!!!

ASOH on laser - Yes, it is out and my friend has it.. As a matter
of fact, they add a bonus song to it- Lock and Key live.. It is
really cool. I couldn't believe it the first time we watched it.
It has like a 30sec intro on the rear vid screen of this wierd
guy in jail talking (like the clips from the video).. really
cool. A must have for you laser disc owners..

New World Man Parody - Yeah, they played it down hear in Baltimore
as well on 98 rock.. "He's a wayne's world man.." Pretty funny.
I was wondering when they would do a parody of a Rush song..
I've heard lots of other artists.. like AC/DC (PMS instead of
TNT).. :)

anyway, take it easy

	Here is my Rush fantasy:

	The setting is Fantasy Island.  I approach the island in
the Love Boat, with Captain Stuebing at the helm and the Blessed Virgin
Mary as yeoman purser, because Gopher is away for the weekend.  Anyway,
we pull up to Fantasy Island, and I get off the boat.  I approach
the palm trees and see the lighted bamboo poles to welcome the new guests.
Suddenly I notice Alex as Ricardo Montalbon saying "Welcome, welcome
to Fantasy Island" and who should be running up to his side but
Neil Peart as (short as) Herve Villachez, shouting "the plane! the plane!"

	Geddy begins to dance in a grass skirt around the lighted
bamboo poles.

   As for the tempo of songs changing, I distinctly remember the
Pittsburgh concert for RTB.  In their encore, the Boys played Spirit of
Radio and Finding My Way at blazing speed.  It was much faster than the
songs off the original and live albums.  It still sounded good, of
course... :-)    I haven't the slightest idea why, but maybe they had
the buses warmed up and were late for a date?????

	For all those Neil fans out there, did you know that Neil origionally
began playing traditional grip.  From day one, he learned all of the rudiments
using traditional grip, playing on a pillow (a good technique to build wrist
strength).  When he switched to matched grip, he decided that he wasen't going
to learn all of the rudiments again with this new grip.  That's why, on some of
the songs, Neil can be seen playing traditional grip.  Neil is awsome, but I
still think that "The Man" Dave Weckl is the greatist!

<A NAME="667017">Subject: Rush live</A>

in NMS 665, someone ended a post by saying that Rush is best live and that no
other band comes close.  I agree with the first part, but i don't agree with
the second part.  certainly we'd all agree that Rush is among the best bands
ever in terms of musical ability, and i personally believe that there is no
other band out there with even close to the amount of talent that Geddy, Neil,
and Alex have between them.  But they don't use all of it.  as an example i'll
use phish.  my roommate is a big phish fan, and has gotten me to go to the two
st. louis shows this year, and i can say from experience that phish concerts
are insane.  even though i'm not too familiar with their discography, i can
think of only two or three songs that they played at both shows, and you must
keep in mind that each show was almost three hours of music.  phish has oodles
of material (and yes, "oodles" actually is a scientific unit of measurement,
commonly understood to mean "17") that don't appear on any album, and likely
will never be released officially.  the reason their shows are so insane is that
they jam--they'll take a song, and play it for about 13 minutes.  then they'll
take another song and play it for 10 minutes.  then they'll do something
weird like throw beachballs into the audience, but i digress.  and, as far as
i know, NEVER plan out a show until the day of--maybe not even until the show
itself.  Rush does not do this, and i think their shows, which are already
incredible (and better than phish shows IMHO, even with what i've been writing),
would improve ten-fold.  imagine going to two shows, and hearing maybe four
songs of overlap (CttH, Tom Sawyer, etc...), but hearing completely different
stuff otherwise.  or imagine Alex deciding to do Broon's Bane, but having it
last 5 minutes before they go on and play The Trees for 10.  Rush would ROCK
so hard if they did their shows like this--they'd take about the best show
around and leave all others behind.  let's be honest--if you name a band with
a better guitarist than Alex, Geddy and Neil will leavthere is no band playing
today that has even close to the talent of Rush.  there should be no concert
out there even close to as good as Rush's.  now, please don't take my post
as one long flame.  i love Rush as much as anyone, and will go to their shows
as long as they keep playing (a long time, God willing).  but I want to see
Rush play. I go to their shows primarily to see them perform--i really could 
care less what they play, even though in all honesty their songs are what's 
best suited for them to play.  so i guess what i'm saying is, for how amazing 
Rush is, they could be better, as hard as it is to believe.

long live Rush,

This is a short blurb for John Lee (johnlee@sirius.uvic.ca) and anybody else
out there who's been wondering about Black Holes on the _Great White North
Album_.  It took me about for two years before I found someone who had the
equipment to play that part of the album backwards via a digitized sound
board.  Anyways, I'm sorry I don't remember the exact words, but the two just
rambled on for about fifteen seconds saying nothing of significance:  "Hey,
this is Bob, this is brother Doug.  How's goin', eh?" or something to that
effect.  Someone else may have a complete transcript of the short conversation,

P.S. I've heard that Rush is releasing it's next album (Critical Mass) sometime
in September.  I can't wait!  But I was wondering if anyone knew when they
would begin touring.  I'll be sure to catch them in Atlanta, or anywhere in the
South if can get there.

has to pee so he invites me to sit in his guilded cage of Ludwig

we jam through 2112 and Tom, the band invites all of us to become

Hi,

   I was lucky enough to get an interview with the drummer of Dream
Theater last week (see the DT list for this in the next few weeks), and
that meant I got to watch them all soundchecking.  Guess what DT
play to do a soundcheck?  You got it. Rush stuff!  I heard a few
mins of 2112 (presentation).  It was really quite amazing to see &
hear my 2nd-favourite group play stuff from my 1st-favourite
group.

   In the interview, Mike Portnoy also seemed to think Rush's new
album would be out in September - I don't know whether being in
the biz gives him inside info or not, but every extra source of
info about Rush helps.:-)

Hello Rushians....
         I have come up with a novel suggestion for Rush during their
next tour. To include a medley at the begining of the show that would
consist of covers of other bands' works as a display of superior
musicianship. Suggested titles would include Wipeout as good catchy
instrumental, a LedZep tune such as Rock and Roll with Alex on lead
vocals, and perhaps Brown-eyed Girl with Neil taking a crack at singing.
The drum part is simple enough so as not to distract him from doing
the vocals, plus it would be cool to hear some other tunes played
a-la Rush.
         Also just in case anyone else was wondering, Rush Limbaugh's
e-mail address is as follows...

         70277.2502@CompuServe.COM

This is a hard to get address because you basically need a subscription
to the Limbaugh Letter to get the number....

I just dropped in my copy of Saga's _Heads or Tails_, which I like quite
a bit. Turning the CD over I noticed that it was produced by none other
than Rupert Hine! This disc seems to have quite the same production feel
as "Presto" in fact. Just thought I'd point that out. The guitar playing
on the album seems to bear some relation to what Alex was doing on _Signals_
and _Grace Under Pressure_ too. So if you like that period of Rush and
are looking for something interesting you might check out this disc.

Fellas,

>  From what I've seen recently, I guess my opinion of Presto is a rare one.
I actually think Presto is the best album RUSH has put out since Signals.  I 
have been a RUSH fan for a long time, and I've always liked their older stuff 
even though I still enjoy the new stuff.  However, ever since GUP came out, 
I've waited with anticipation for RUSH to go back a little to their older 
style.  Again, that's not to say I don't like the new stuff.  However, I 
believe I actually had to get used to albums such as Power Windows and Hold 
Your Fire.  But the first time I heard Presto, I loved it.
    Also, about live tempo:  I was really disappointed with the way RUSH played
Superconductor and Show Don't Tell.  They are both great songs, but they just 
didn't sound right when they were slowed down.  That's all for now. Lata.

<A NAME="667028">Subject: Unplugged, boots ...</A>

Hi folks !!

Unplugged
---------

The subject of Rush unplugged keeps croping up, along with various arguments
for and against. So here's my opinion; I would love to hear Rush do an
unplugged set. Many of their earlier songs have significant accoustic portions,
eg: Panacea (COS), Rivendell (FBN)., and would be obvious candidates for an
accoustic set, as would _Broons Bane/Trees_, and _Closer to the Heart_. Many of
their more famous songs could be accoustised, for example _Spirit of the
Radio_, the rhythm part of which sounds brilliant on an accoustic 12-string (the
opening riff is a swine to play on a 12-string, but wouldn't pose to much
problem on one of the Ovation roundbacks that Alex uses anyway). The point I'm
making is for musicians as talented as those in Rush rearranging songs for use
in an accoustic environment should prove no problem.

The question of the use of electic bass in an unplugged set is not quite as
vexed as some are making the issue. Granted I think Geddy might struggle with
an upright accoustic *double* bass, but many manufaturers including Ovation are
making guitar style electro-accoustic basses anyway, thus solving the problem.

Unfortunately I do not see Rush doing an unplugged set - it is far too trendy
for a start; and the music they would end up playing would be old material,
much of which they seem to be shying away from in the Live environment. Much to
my chargain 'cos I wasn't old enough to see those old tours at the time; but
who can blame them when you've played a song continually at shows for 10 or 15
years you are likely to get rather cheesed off with them, and move on to
pastures new.

Bootlegs
--------

Which leads me to another topic the question of bootlegs from times past. I
appreciate that the NMS doesn't condone Bootlegging for obvious legal reasons -
like making bootlegs is illegal, on both sides of the Atlantic. Is there,
however, a list of bootlegs that are widely available ?? I couldn't find one
when I did an ftp search, maybe I didn't look in the right places! Other than
the Pink Pop Festival Concert I mentioned a while ago - which isn't strictly a
bootleg but a radio show recording - I have only come across two other bootlegs
of Rush in the UK. One says it is from St Louis, USA 1980 - while it is clearly
the Perm Wvs tour (they play Natural Science), it is NOT recorded entirely in St
Louis since Geddy is heard quite plainly to say something along the lines of
"Thank you, Wembley!" at one point. There are however a number of gaps in
background noise suggesting it has been cobbled together from more than one
show. Despite my copy being at least third generation it is reasonably good
quality and must be a desk out take.

The only other boot I have seen, but never heard, was a Show of Hands tour
outake from the Wembley gigs, and really wasn't worth the money they were
asking when SOH itself was available at a cheaper price! I'd be particularly
interested to hear from any UK fans who have early Rush boots - mail me please
so as not to clogg the NMS with unneccessary clutter.

Satanism
--------

Talking of clutter the Satanism=Rock lyrics backwards thing seems to be
dragging on  a bit. We all know that certain ultra conservative christains
accuse everyting that dosen't fit with thier ideals of being conected with
Satan, so whats new they've been doing it for years ?? Don't let it or them get
you down - *we* know we as Rush fans aren't Satanic  so its there problem not
ours.

Secondly satanism is a serious issue in the UK at the moment, sparked off by
several incidents of possible satanist conertations to child abuse scandals.
Although I make no pretence to be a Christian, Satanism and its followers are
evil people, seeking to destroy the world as we know it, and it therefore is
inappropriate to joke about it. (Any Ultra Conservative Christians or Satanists
wishing to flame about this should do so by Email)

MIDI
----

I noted in NMS #665 that someone had noted Alex pressing a foot switch at a
time when there was no *apparent* change in his guitar sound, and this
coincided to lighting changes. Do Rush change aspects of their own lighting
rig?

It is quite feasable that i) Alex was infact altering some of his effects
units, not all make obvious differences in sound, eg Equiliser set up
ii) perhaps he was calling up the next patch he wanted to use. Either way it is
quite possible that implementing a change in his guitar rig he could have it
linked by MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) to a lighting control
board, so that upon implementing a certain set up the lighting rig changes
automatically. I have heard of other big bands such as Pink Floyd doing this,
as well as small venue bands in the UK who cannot afford a full time lighting
technician. For anyone who knows a bit about modern technology its not really
all that difficult to do.

All for now, sorry it was at length, but you can always skip the bits you don't
want to read.

Just kidding!  I haven't kidnapped Alex (yet).

-I found it extremely interesting to see the wide divergence (college word, like
it?) of opinion on Presto.  Personally, I think that "The Pass" is full of great
lyrics and emotions (besides Geddy said in concert that it's one of their faves)
I also love the raw energy of "Superconductor"; the song kicks ass!

-To jeffrey r brinkman  <brinkmaj@gas.uug.arizona.edu>:  I agree completely and
utterly with your assessment of Eric Johnson.  The man is a guitar deity.  If
you like "Cliffs of Dover", you might want to check out the live version on a
compilation called "Guitar for the Practicing Musician - Volume II"  I won't
go into praising Eric too much here (as this is the Rush list, not the EJ list).
Does anyone know if an Eric Johnson list exists?  If so, please mail to me at
ahung@discover.wright.edu

-As for the vein of discussion about "I like Rush doing this" or "Rush should do
this" or "Rush should stop doing this" (you get the idea).... The fact remains
that Rush is comprised of friends who are MUSICIANS that will continue to write
music that they like.  Unlike most bands, they don't write music to please their
fans or "get chicks" or "to make the big money, man".  They do it because they
like it.  That's good enough for me.  I will continue to look forward to their
new music and growth as musicians.  'Nuf said.

-As I promised a few posts ago, here is a contact address for the band.  I got
this address from "The Music Address Book" by Michael Levine (copyright '89).
I haven't written to this address (yet), so I can't vouch for its validity.
The posted address differs only in zip code from one I saw in back issues of NMS
(I think).  Here it is:

Fellow discliples of the fab three-

I saw one of the most hillarious things on the sports news last
spring training (March 1992). It was channel 5 (NBC in St. Louis) and
it was a piece on the Cardinals spring training camp. All of a sudden
they were interviewing Bryn Smith who was a pitcher on the team at
the time (and Canadian) and Bryn was hanging out with Geddy Lee
in Florida!!! It was so funny. Geddy was dressed in a Cardinals
uniform complete with mit and hat. This might not ordinarily be
so funny if it were not for the fact that Geddy weighs like 100
pounds and the hat barely fit on his hair. (Incidentally, Geddy
throws like a girl.) They had a brief interview with Geddy and
he told that he was good friends with Bryn Smith and that he likes
baseball. Pretty wild, huh?

On a different note- how about everyone posting their best Rush
Concert stories. Y'know something funny, cool, etc. I have one that's
pretty gross. I can vouch for complete validity but I heard that
when I was at the Presto Tour at the Meadowlands (yea Jersey!) some
kid got so drunk before the show that he passed out in the parking
lot. Not only did he miss the whole show (the fool!) but when his
friends found him, someone had actually taken a shit on the kid.

<A NAME="667033">Subject:      Assorted Stuff</A>

Hello, everybody!

I hate using the quoter on our mail software, so I apologize for not responding
to people by quoting them first.

First off, someone mentioned they saw the lights react to Alex pushing a foot
pedal.  This is not very strange, since modern technology has provided the
musical world with MIDI programmable lights.  So, therefore, lights can be
programmed to move and react to MIDI program changes in another instrument.
Alex was probably adding a background note.  He does this often: he just hits
a note on one of the foot synths and it sustains untill he hits it again, just
for background.

There has been a lot of talk about Presto.  My personal view of Presto is
kind of strange.  I sort of ignore it until for some reason I put it on
for a change, and then I am astounded.  (BTW  The CD mastering of this album
SUCKS.  The tape is much warmer and fuller with my sterio equipment.)  Actually
I like Presto a lot more than RTB.  In my opinion the themes of the songs
reach me alot more, I feel that more effort was put into the writing, more
thought, and I like the textures of it more.  I feel that it is considerably
darker than RTB, and less accessable to the majority.  This was the album
that turned me on to Rush.

As far as Jeff Ament playing a eight string in the beginning of Jeremy, I think
after listening to it that it is actually a regular guitar with a sub-octave
pedal and a harmonizer pedal set to an octave above.  The high and low notes
seem too electronic to be natural to me.

Greetings all,

I must preface this by saying it is my first post. I have some
questions that I thought someone might know the answer to.
I was just wondering why the B-man writes in _Visions_ that Alex is
MIA on Losing It. There is obviously guitar in the song. What is meant
by this?

Also, how come every time I read another bass player analyse a Rush
song, such as Billy Sheehnan or T-Bone Wolk, they say that Geddy uses
a pick. I've never seen him uses one. Just something that bothers me.

My Rush Fanatsy is simple. I want three hours on Neil Peart's drum
set, not his current one. Maybe the one from Presto, (the pink one). I
don't care if he's there or not. I just want to play on the best drum
set in rock n roll.

If Rush ever does a box set to commerate the time they've been together

25 Years of Tull. I spent last night over a friend's listening to the set and

    Yesterday, I received a "Permanent Waves" and I've already listened to
it about four times over. Listening to it got me thinking again about an
opinion that many of us have discussed in the NMS. The fact that RUSH is
grossly underrated and underplayed. I think that Neil Peart himself has
(unintentionally, of course) given an answer to the question:

    Why has'nt RUSH been given the recognition it deserves?

    I found an answer to this question in the lyrics of the song
"Cinderella Man". In this song, the Cinderella man is considered insane because
he is moral. The same can be compared to the music of RUSH. Because it
is of such a highly quality lyrically and instrumentally, a lot of people
may not appreciate it. In addition, RUSH does not have the rebellious or "bad
boys" image. This might have unfairly limited its popularity. To put it in
a nutshell, most people need not appreciate a good thing when they see it,espe-
cially if it is very realistic.

    At the same time I feel that RUSH gets enough attention from a small group
of committed fans who are able to appreciate the effort that goes into creation
of their albums. The people who subscribe to NMS are proof that Rush has
fans who value their work. I don't think there are mailing lists like this
for a lot of other groups. And,IMHO, do we have to look up to something as
lacking in quality as MTV to give RUSH the recogniton it deserves. Should it
be grouped with the rest of the commercial and popular (IMHO) junk that is
played on MTV. MTV can never aspire to reach the standards set by RUSH and
I think it will be a very long time before any group can fill the void if
RUSH quit.

     A lot of times I feel like I'm listening to complete trash if I listen to
any other group after listening to RUSH (Pink Floyd, Alan Parson's project
and Jethro Tull being the exceptions I can list). Does anybody else out
there feel the same way?

Jim Stevenson asked if all of 2112 had ever been played live. It seems to me 
that the whole thing was part of one of the encores they did in Detroit during 
the Presto tour. I could be wrong -- I just getting into the older stuff at 
the time -- but my friends were very excited about them having played the 
*whole* thing. Now I'm really sorry I didn't know the old stuff better back 
then...

As for finding out what states and countries NMS goes to, couldn't you just 
take a look at the mailing list? Of course, you'd need a way to decipher the 
internet addresses... And to the person looking for Rush Limbaugh's CompuServe 
mailbox -- try using the "finger" command on your computer system (assuming 
you're using some version of UNIX). I've tried to find it for you, but the 
network connecting me to internet won't recognize compuserve.

Um, Hello fellow Satin worshipers

	Hi.  I'm Kinda drunk right now and I was just listening to a 1980
live version of By-tor and the snowdog and its ausome.  It was recorded
in Saint Louis and then broadcast on FM radio.  If any of you have this
then I think you know what I mean when I say that this has to be the
BEST version of By and snow ever recorded.  Ged just simply rocks during
this recording.  I was just thinking... We all know from the wonderful
information contained in Visions that Neils real name is Rotyb, (His
father was of Russian dissent...) so when we say Rotyb backwards we
get Bytor.  This leads to one logical conclution... Neil is Bytor.
So, By-tor, being the Devil's prince and all, must mean that Neil,
or should I say Bytors father must be satan.  I know this is
confusing, but I felt that all of you should know this important info...
I would like to say one last thing...

   Snowdog said backwards every other letter is Gdos.  Everybody knows
that Ged's real name is Gdos... So Ged is really God.  His birth
cirtificate says so, but the middle part of the "o" on the cirtificate
has a piece of lint on it so it looks like an "e"...

Digest #666 really  made me laugh, especially the guy with his cat.  Also
Patricai Evans synopsis of HYF was excellent - more believable than any of the
explanations given by those type of Christians who investigate this kind of
thing.  But then I suppose Patricia Evans is a follower like the rest of and

Seriously guys I guess it just shows us how careful we must be when

Imagine my dismay to find out that my "revelation" about hidden messages and
interesting numerology in Rush history was not included in the special 666
issue of NMS.  Could be it was intercepted by evil daemons invading the
Internet trying to prevent the truth from being exposed, thus inviting an
invasion by the FBI or ATF?  Good issue, we apparently have some active

Thanks to all who contributed to the "Satanic Edition" of the digest, it was
great! And some posts that people sent in just came in too late to make that
issue, so if you didn't see yours in the digest that's probably why.
This issue should catch up all the posts that have been waiting to be sent out.

Rushia,

All this unplugged talking reminded me of THE unplugged song by Rush:
Rivendel (just MHO). I think that the acoustic guitar is played by Geddy,
not by Alex. On the album it says under geddy's name (something like)
Bass Guitar, Occasional Acoustic Guitar and Vocals. Since Geddy wrote
the song with Neil I think Geddy plays the Acoustic Guitar. You can
hear Alex play some synth-like notes on the electric guitar and I also
think that if Alex would have played it a little bit more complex than
the current version by Geddy (if this is true ofcourse).

I donot hope this is a FAQ (the last time I read it was quite a while ago,
I wasn't even subscribed then) but if its not I'd like to see this dis-
cussed.

Oh BTW if there is anybody out there that has info on RTB on vinyl.
pleasepleaaseplease let me know it too. I dont have a CD player and I have
alll the Rush album except RTB :^( This is off ocurse not acceptable for
any Rush-aholic.

Greetings from the Sundog!  Guess you could say I'm a long time listener,
first time caller.

I think this Satanic discussion is going to people's heads:

Message to Andy C...The song Anagram, especially that chorus line, has NOTHING
to do with satanic ideas.  If you'll take a good look at all the lyrics,
every(or almost every) line uses a certain word(s), then changes the letters
around to create a new word, which is then used to complete the line.

This is the whole meaning of "anagram" and it's used with ferocious cleverness
by NP (no surprise there.)

Hope that ends that satanic sidetrack.

Well, I enjoyed getting that off my brain.

If this question should have gone in the faq I applogize but I didnt see it
covered in there.

	Does anyone know what city that is used for the subdivisions video?
I have heard that it is Los Angeles but it seems too small.

One last quick thing.  Has anyone recently tried to buy Neil Peart signature
sticks? I put in an order over 3 weeks ago and they told me that the
warehouse was out of them.  Apparentally they dont keep them in stock.
I am wondering...did Neil only put out a limited amount?

Thanks.

the lyrics directory of syrix the work of Peart, or are they the clever

i'm telling you this pathetic story because the NMS is the only place where i
can find sympathetic ears.  today at noontime i was listening to robert
johnson (truly amazing music for those of you interested) when i called up a
friend to see about lunch.  we agreed to meet in five minutes.  so i took out
the cd i had in, and as i usually do, i checked to see what was on the radio.
during the noontime hour, KSHE (a st. louis station mentioned on the NMS
before) plays an artist for lunch, and then one for dessert, which means they
play one artist or group for forty minutes, and then another for the remaining
twenty.  thus i turned the station to KSHE to see who was for lunch--this was
at about 12:06, right at the beginning.  for those of you who have difficulty
anticipating obvious plots and who also failed to look at the subject of this
post, i found myself in the middle of the "Working Man" jam.  i also caught
the first verse of RTB, but i had to go eat.  i missed forty minutes of Rush.
i tried to console myself thinking that i have all of the songs they'd have
played on disc anyway, but let's be honest, it's always best to hear your
favorite group on the radio, even if it is only "normal" Rush.  thank you
for listening.  i feel much better now.

   Not to worry, my friend.  IMO, Presto was the best album Rush
put forth since Moving Pictures.  It was refreshing blast of
musical energy. The boys seemed to be really enjoying
themselves once again and almost every song gets me singing.
   My only complaints about Presto are---1) the complete lack
of presence of Geddy's bass and 2) the album cover.
   Let's see what others think...

   So, you're making a move to the land of the Blue Devil.
Well, ma'am (as the gentlemen say in the South), be prepared
for a welcome culture shock.  I'm a Durham resident (my wife's
a nurse at Duke).  You'll be happy to know that most of the
stereotypes are untrue in the RDU area.  Many of us are trans-
plants from up North who have come for work (VERY LOW
unemployment rate here).  You won't find the exceptional variety
of Bahston, but you get an abundance of nightlife, sports, and culture
at a more relaxed pace.  Oh, and just to keep this message barely RUSH
related, WRDU 106.1 usually plays only the standard fare plus too much
Southern rock.

Hello, i don't know if anyone said this yet, but i'm pretty sure a
fretless bass was used on Pink Floyd's "Hey You", and according to David
Gilmour he played it, instead of Roger Waters.

Also, Chris Maka wrote about how he hasn't seen many non-white,
non-hispanic Rush fans.  I'm from Texas also(and i'm Indian), and I know
people from all different backgrounds that like Rush in Texas.  Here in
the Bay Area, i've seen a lot of Indians with Rush shirts on, and i've
noticed quite a few Indian names on the NMS.

Hi

First of all thanks for correcting the Jaco tune title, sorry about that.
Secondly, and more importantly
I think Presto is one of the bands best albums. When it first came out i
thought it was a real improvement on HYF which I think is one of the boys
lamest (but of course lame in regards to Rush is a relative term). In
particular I loved the intro to Show Don't Tell (still one of my favourite
Rush songs)

ASOH on laser - Yes, it is out and my friend has it.. As a matter

really cool. I couldn't believe it the first time we watched it.
It has like a 30sec intro on the rear vid screen of this wierd
guy in jail talking (like the clips from the video).. really
cool. A must have for you laser disc owners..

New World Man Parody - Yeah, they played it down hear in Baltimore
as well on 98 rock.. "He's a wayne's world man.." Pretty funny.
I was wondering when they would do a parody of a Rush song..
I've heard lots of other artists.. like AC/DC (PMS instead of
TNT).. :)

anyway, take it easy

	Here is my Rush fantasy:

	The setting is Fantasy Island.  I approach the island in
the Love Boat, with Captain Stuebing at the helm and the Blessed Virgin
Mary as yeoman purser, because Gopher is away for the weekend.  Anyway,
we pull up to Fantasy Island, and I get off the boat.  I approach
the palm trees and see the lighted bamboo poles to welcome the new guests.
Suddenly I notice Alex as Ricardo Montalbon saying "Welcome, welcome
to Fantasy Island" and who should be running up to his side but
Neil Peart as (short as) Herve Villachez, shouting "the plane! the plane!"

	Geddy begins to dance in a grass skirt around the lighted
bamboo poles.

	Whoops -- sorry.. That is my Rush Nightmare.

   As for the tempo of songs changing, I distinctly remember the

songs off the original and live albums.  It still sounded good, of

	For all those Neil fans out there, did you know that Neil origionally
began playing traditional grip.  From day one, he learned all of the rudiments
using traditional grip, playing on a pillow (a good technique to build wrist
strength).  When he switched to matched grip, he decided that he wasen't going
to learn all of the rudiments again with this new grip.  That's why, on some of
the songs, Neil can be seen playing traditional grip.  Neil is awsome, but I
still think that "The Man" Dave Weckl is the greatist!

<A NAME="667062">Subject: Rush live</A>

in NMS 665, someone ended a post by saying that Rush is best live and that no
other band comes close.  I agree with the first part, but i don't agree with
the second part.  certainly we'd all agree that Rush is among the best bands
ever in terms of musical ability, and i personally believe that there is no
other band out there with even close to the amount of talent that Geddy, Neil,
and Alex have between them.  But they don't use all of it.  as an example i'll
use phish.  my roommate is a big phish fan, and has gotten me to go to the two
st. louis shows this year, and i can say from experience that phish concerts
are insane.  even though i'm not too familiar with their discography, i can
think of only two or three songs that they played at both shows, and you must
keep in mind that each show was almost three hours of music.  phish has oodles
of material (and yes, "oodles" actually is a scientific unit of measurement,
commonly understood to mean "17") that don't appear on any album, and likely
will never be released officially.  the reason their shows are so insane is that
they jam--they'll take a song, and play it for about 13 minutes.  then they'll
take another song and play it for 10 minutes.  then they'll do something
weird like throw beachballs into the audience, but i digress.  and, as far as
i know, NEVER plan out a show until the day of--maybe not even until the show
itself.  Rush does not do this, and i think their shows, which are already
incredible (and better than phish shows IMHO, even with what i've been writing),
would improve ten-fold.  imagine going to two shows, and hearing maybe four
songs of overlap (CttH, Tom Sawyer, etc...), but hearing completely different
stuff otherwise.  or imagine Alex deciding to do Broon's Bane, but having it
last 5 minutes before they go on and play The Trees for 10.  Rush would ROCK
so hard if they did their shows like this--they'd take about the best show
around and leave all others behind.  let's be honest--if you name a band with
a better guitarist than Alex, Geddy and Neil will leavthere is no band playing
today that has even close to the talent of Rush.  there should be no concert
out there even close to as good as Rush's.  now, please don't take my post
as one long flame.  i love Rush as much as anyone, and will go to their shows
as long as they keep playing (a long time, God willing).  but I want to see
Rush play. I go to their shows primarily to see them perform--i really could 
care less what they play, even though in all honesty their songs are what's 
best suited for them to play.  so i guess what i'm saying is, for how amazing 
Rush is, they could be better, as hard as it is to believe.

long live Rush,

This is a short blurb for John Lee (johnlee@sirius.uvic.ca) and anybody else

equipment to play that part of the album backwards via a digitized sound
board.  Anyways, I'm sorry I don't remember the exact words, but the two just
rambled on for about fifteen seconds saying nothing of significance:  "Hey,
this is Bob, this is brother Doug.  How's goin', eh?" or something to that
effect.  Someone else may have a complete transcript of the short conversation,
but I doubt I'll be able to replay Black Holes backwards again any time soon.

Hello Rushians....
         I have come up with a novel suggestion for Rush during their
next tour. To include a medley at the begining of the show that would
consist of covers of other bands' works as a display of superior
musicianship. Suggested titles would include Wipeout as good catchy
instrumental, a LedZep tune such as Rock and Roll with Alex on lead
vocals, and perhaps Brown-eyed Girl with Neil taking a crack at singing.
The drum part is simple enough so as not to distract him from doing
the vocals, plus it would be cool to hear some other tunes played
a-la Rush.
         Also just in case anyone else was wondering, Rush Limbaugh's
e-mail address is as follows...

         70277.2502@CompuServe.COM

This is a hard to get address because you basically need a subscription
to the Limbaugh Letter to get the number....

I just dropped in my copy of Saga's _Heads or Tails_, which I like quite
a bit. Turning the CD over I noticed that it was produced by none other
than Rupert Hine! This disc seems to have quite the same production feel
as "Presto" in fact. Just thought I'd point that out. The guitar playing
on the album seems to bear some relation to what Alex was doing on _Signals_
and _Grace Under Pressure_ too. So if you like that period of Rush and
are looking for something interesting you might check out this disc.

Fellas,

>  From what I've seen recently, I guess my opinion of Presto is a rare one.
I actually think Presto is the best album RUSH has put out since Signals.  I 
have been a RUSH fan for a long time, and I've always liked their older stuff 
even though I still enjoy the new stuff.  However, ever since GUP came out, 
I've waited with anticipation for RUSH to go back a little to their older 
style.  Again, that's not to say I don't like the new stuff.  However, I 
believe I actually had to get used to albums such as Power Windows and Hold 
Your Fire.  But the first time I heard Presto, I loved it.
    Also, about live tempo:  I was really disappointed with the way RUSH played
Superconductor and Show Don't Tell.  They are both great songs, but they just 
didn't sound right when they were slowed down.  That's all for now. Lata.

<A NAME="667073">Subject: Unplugged, boots ...</A>

Hi folks !!

Unplugged
---------

The subject of Rush unplugged keeps croping up, along with various arguments
for and against. So here's my opinion; I would love to hear Rush do an
unplugged set. Many of their earlier songs have significant accoustic portions,
eg: Panacea (COS), Rivendell (FBN)., and would be obvious candidates for an
accoustic set, as would _Broons Bane/Trees_, and _Closer to the Heart_. Many of
their more famous songs could be accoustised, for example _Spirit of the
Radio_, the rhythm part of which sounds brilliant on an accoustic 12-string (the
opening riff is a swine to play on a 12-string, but wouldn't pose to much
problem on one of the Ovation roundbacks that Alex uses anyway). The point I'm
making is for musicians as talented as those in Rush rearranging songs for use
in an accoustic environment should prove no problem.

The question of the use of electic bass in an unplugged set is not quite as
vexed as some are making the issue. Granted I think Geddy might struggle with
an upright accoustic *double* bass, but many manufaturers including Ovation are
making guitar style electro-accoustic basses anyway, thus solving the problem.

Unfortunately I do not see Rush doing an unplugged set - it is far too trendy
for a start; and the music they would end up playing would be old material,
much of which they seem to be shying away from in the Live environment. Much to
my chargain 'cos I wasn't old enough to see those old tours at the time; but
who can blame them when you've played a song continually at shows for 10 or 15
years you are likely to get rather cheesed off with them, and move on to
pastures new.

Bootlegs
--------

Which leads me to another topic the question of bootlegs from times past. I
appreciate that the NMS doesn't condone Bootlegging for obvious legal reasons -
like making bootlegs is illegal, on both sides of the Atlantic. Is there,
however, a list of bootlegs that are widely available ?? I couldn't find one
when I did an ftp search, maybe I didn't look in the right places! Other than
the Pink Pop Festival Concert I mentioned a while ago - which isn't strictly a
bootleg but a radio show recording - I have only come across two other bootlegs
of Rush in the UK. One says it is from St Louis, USA 1980 - while it is clearly
the Perm Wvs tour (they play Natural Science), it is NOT recorded entirely in St
Louis since Geddy is heard quite plainly to say something along the lines of
"Thank you, Wembley!" at one point. There are however a number of gaps in
background noise suggesting it has been cobbled together from more than one
show. Despite my copy being at least third generation it is reasonably good
quality and must be a desk out take.

The only other boot I have seen, but never heard, was a Show of Hands tour
outake from the Wembley gigs, and really wasn't worth the money they were
asking when SOH itself was available at a cheaper price! I'd be particularly
interested to hear from any UK fans who have early Rush boots - mail me please
so as not to clogg the NMS with unneccessary clutter.

Satanism
--------

Talking of clutter the Satanism=Rock lyrics backwards thing seems to be
dragging on  a bit. We all know that certain ultra conservative christains
accuse everyting that dosen't fit with thier ideals of being conected with
Satan, so whats new they've been doing it for years ?? Don't let it or them get
you down - *we* know we as Rush fans aren't Satanic  so its there problem not
ours.

Secondly satanism is a serious issue in the UK at the moment, sparked off by
several incidents of possible satanist conertations to child abuse scandals.
Although I make no pretence to be a Christian, Satanism and its followers are
evil people, seeking to destroy the world as we know it, and it therefore is
inappropriate to joke about it. (Any Ultra Conservative Christians or Satanists
wishing to flame about this should do so by Email)

MIDI
----

I noted in NMS #665 that someone had noted Alex pressing a foot switch at a
time when there was no *apparent* change in his guitar sound, and this
coincided to lighting changes. Do Rush change aspects of their own lighting
rig?

It is quite feasable that i) Alex was infact altering some of his effects
units, not all make obvious differences in sound, eg Equiliser set up
ii) perhaps he was calling up the next patch he wanted to use. Either way it is
quite possible that implementing a change in his guitar rig he could have it
linked by MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) to a lighting control
board, so that upon implementing a certain set up the lighting rig changes
automatically. I have heard of other big bands such as Pink Floyd doing this,
as well as small venue bands in the UK who cannot afford a full time lighting
technician. For anyone who knows a bit about modern technology its not really
all that difficult to do.

All for now, sorry it was at length, but you can always skip the bits you don't
want to read.

	I think that to change a song live, can prove to be very interesting.
	Check out 'No Surender' by Bruce Springsteen, on the Born in the USA
	LP it was an uptempo song as opposed to the live 75-85 LP in which
	the song was slowed right down, and a part of it was changed.
	I just wish they would play nearer to part part of the country,
	(South-West England), its a real bummer having to travel a fair
	distance to see them!

	Fantasy..
	Just to get up there and play guitar along side Alex.
	We'ere not all bass playing fanitics!

	Ok, thats enough of my ramblings now, let the show commence!

Just kidding!  I haven't kidnapped Alex (yet).

-I found it extremely interesting to see the wide divergence (college word, like
it?) of opinion on Presto.  Personally, I think that "The Pass" is full of great
lyrics and emotions (besides Geddy said in concert that it's one of their faves)
I also love the raw energy of "Superconductor"; the song kicks ass!

-To jeffrey r brinkman  <brinkmaj@gas.uug.arizona.edu>:  I agree completely and
utterly with your assessment of Eric Johnson.  The man is a guitar deity.  If
you like "Cliffs of Dover", you might want to check out the live version on a
compilation called "Guitar for the Practicing Musician - Volume II"  I won't
go into praising Eric too much here (as this is the Rush list, not the EJ list).
Does anyone know if an Eric Johnson list exists?  If so, please mail to me at
ahung@discover.wright.edu

-As for the vein of discussion about "I like Rush doing this" or "Rush should do
this" or "Rush should stop doing this" (you get the idea).... The fact remains
that Rush is comprised of friends who are MUSICIANS that will continue to write
music that they like.  Unlike most bands, they don't write music to please their
fans or "get chicks" or "to make the big money, man".  They do it because they
like it.  That's good enough for me.  I will continue to look forward to their
new music and growth as musicians.  'Nuf said.

-As I promised a few posts ago, here is a contact address for the band.  I got
this address from "The Music Address Book" by Michael Levine (copyright '89).
I haven't written to this address (yet), so I can't vouch for its validity.
The posted address differs only in zip code from one I saw in back issues of NMS
(I think).  Here it is:

Fellow discliples of the fab three-

I saw one of the most hillarious things on the sports news last
spring training (March 1992). It was channel 5 (NBC in St. Louis) and
it was a piece on the Cardinals spring training camp. All of a sudden
they were interviewing Bryn Smith who was a pitcher on the team at
the time (and Canadian) and Bryn was hanging out with Geddy Lee
in Florida!!! It was so funny. Geddy was dressed in a Cardinals
uniform complete with mit and hat. This might not ordinarily be
so funny if it were not for the fact that Geddy weighs like 100
pounds and the hat barely fit on his hair. (Incidentally, Geddy
throws like a girl.) They had a brief interview with Geddy and
he told that he was good friends with Bryn Smith and that he likes
baseball. Pretty wild, huh?

On a different note- how about everyone posting their best Rush
Concert stories. Y'know something funny, cool, etc. I have one that's
pretty gross. I can vouch for complete validity but I heard that
when I was at the Presto Tour at the Meadowlands (yea Jersey!) some
kid got so drunk before the show that he passed out in the parking
lot. Not only did he miss the whole show (the fool!) but when his
friends found him, someone had actually taken a shit on the kid.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!!

yway, keep on keepin' on.

Hello, everybody!

I hate using the quoter on our mail software, so I apologize for not responding
to people by quoting them first.

First off, someone mentioned they saw the lights react to Alex pushing a foot
pedal.  This is not very strange, since modern technology has provided the
musical world with MIDI programmable lights.  So, therefore, lights can be
programmed to move and react to MIDI program changes in another instrument.
Alex was probably adding a background note.  He does this often: he just hits
a note on one of the foot synths and it sustains untill he hits it again, just
for background.

There has been a lot of talk about Presto.  My personal view of Presto is
kind of strange.  I sort of ignore it until for some reason I put it on
for a change, and then I am astounded.  (BTW  The CD mastering of this album
SUCKS.  The tape is much warmer and fuller with my sterio equipment.)  Actually
I like Presto a lot more than RTB.  In my opinion the themes of the songs
reach me alot more, I feel that more effort was put into the writing, more
thought, and I like the textures of it more.  I feel that it is considerably
darker than RTB, and less accessable to the majority.  This was the album
that turned me on to Rush.

As far as Jeff Ament playing a eight string in the beginning of Jeremy, I think
after listening to it that it is actually a regular guitar with a sub-octave
pedal and a harmonizer pedal set to an octave above.  The high and low notes
seem too electronic to be natural to me.

The ultimate Rush fantasy just occurred to me . . .

"Critical Mass", of course, was just a hoax.

After a long delay, Rush releases their first studio double album-
Cygnus X-1 Book III, a four - side epic in which Neil Peart finally
reveals to us the true meaning of life.  The subsequent tour features
the Cygnus Trilogy performed in its entirety.

------- Here's to the new album!

<A NAME="667080">Subject: Alex MIA?/RUSH Fantasy</A>

Greetings all,

I must preface this by saying it is my first post. I have some
questions that I thought someone might know the answer to.
I was just wondering why the B-man writes in _Visions_ that Alex is
MIA on Losing It. There is obviously guitar in the song. What is meant
by this?

Also, how come every time I read another bass player analyse a Rush
song, such as Billy Sheehnan or T-Bone Wolk, they say that Geddy uses
a pick. I've never seen him uses one. Just something that bothers me.

My Rush Fanatsy is simple. I want three hours on Neil Peart's drum
set, not his current one. Maybe the one from Presto, (the pink one). I
don't care if he's there or not. I just want to play on the best drum
set in rock n roll.

Thank you,
RSH

If Rush ever does a box set to commerate the time they've been together
(Chronicles just doesn't cut it IMHO), they could take a pointer or two from
Jethro Tull. The 20 Years of Tull box set was simply amazing, second only to:
25 Years of Tull. I spent last night over a friend's listening to the set and
reading through the mag. If you get a chance to see it you'll know what I
mean. I'd love to see Rush do Tull one better by releasing the ultimate box
set.

I know that this discussion of Rush being satanic is just a running joke
in TNMS, but I've actually met people who believed that crap.  There's this
right-wing religious nuclear engineering student I know who is convinced that
Rush is an acronym for Ruled Under Satan's Hand.  I'll concede this much:
Rush is THE band for science students and outcast sci-fi nerds, but that
doesn't make 'em satanic...just makes them cool.

I've been listening to Rush for 10 years now and I'm still wondering whether 
Peart would be a radio ham. He played morse code during YYZ and told us about 
the Spirit of the Radio.

Any hints??

<A NAME="667084">Subject: Rush and recognition</A>

Hi,

    Yesterday, I received a "Permanent Waves" and I've already listened to
it about four times over. Listening to it got me thinking again about an
opinion that many of us have discussed in the NMS. The fact that RUSH is
grossly underrated and underplayed. I think that Neil Peart himself has
(unintentionally, of course) given an answer to the question:

    Why has'nt RUSH been given the recognition it deserves?

    I found an answer to this question in the lyrics of the song
"Cinderella Man". In this song, the Cinderella man is considered insane because
he is moral. The same can be compared to the music of RUSH. Because it
is of such a highly quality lyrically and instrumentally, a lot of people
may not appreciate it. In addition, RUSH does not have the rebellious or "bad
boys" image. This might have unfairly limited its popularity. To put it in
a nutshell, most people need not appreciate a good thing when they see it,espe-
cially if it is very realistic.

    At the same time I feel that RUSH gets enough attention from a small group
of committed fans who are able to appreciate the effort that goes into creation
of their albums. The people who subscribe to NMS are proof that Rush has
fans who value their work. I don't think there are mailing lists like this
for a lot of other groups. And,IMHO, do we have to look up to something as
lacking in quality as MTV to give RUSH the recogniton it deserves. Should it
be grouped with the rest of the commercial and popular (IMHO) junk that is
played on MTV. MTV can never aspire to reach the standards set by RUSH and
I think it will be a very long time before any group can fill the void if
RUSH quit.

     A lot of times I feel like I'm listening to complete trash if I listen to
any other group after listening to RUSH (Pink Floyd, Alan Parson's project
and Jethro Tull being the exceptions I can list). Does anybody else out
there feel the same way?

Jim Stevenson asked if all of 2112 had ever been played live. It seems to me 
that the whole thing was part of one of the encores they did in Detroit during 
the Presto tour. I could be wrong -- I just getting into the older stuff at 
the time -- but my friends were very excited about them having played the 
*whole* thing. Now I'm really sorry I didn't know the old stuff better back 
then...

As for finding out what states and countries NMS goes to, couldn't you just 
take a look at the mailing list? Of course, you'd need a way to decipher the 
internet addresses... And to the person looking for Rush Limbaugh's CompuServe 
mailbox -- try using the "finger" command on your computer system (assuming 
you're using some version of UNIX). I've tried to find it for you, but the 
network connecting me to internet won't recognize compuserve.

Um, Hello fellow Satin worshipers

	Hi.  I'm Kinda drunk right now and I was just listening to a 1980
live version of By-tor and the snowdog and its ausome.  It was recorded
in Saint Louis and then broadcast on FM radio.  If any of you have this
then I think you know what I mean when I say that this has to be the
BEST version of By and snow ever recorded.  Ged just simply rocks during
this recording.  I was just thinking... We all know from the wonderful
information contained in Visions that Neils real name is Rotyb, (His
father was of Russian dissent...) so when we say Rotyb backwards we
get Bytor.  This leads to one logical conclution... Neil is Bytor.
So, By-tor, being the Devil's prince and all, must mean that Neil,
or should I say Bytors father must be satan.  I know this is
confusing, but I felt that all of you should know this important info...
I would like to say one last thing...

   Snowdog said backwards every other letter is Gdos.  Everybody knows
that Ged's real name is Gdos... So Ged is really God.  His birth
cirtificate says so, but the middle part of the "o" on the cirtificate
has a piece of lint on it so it looks like an "e"...

Digest #666 really  made me laugh, especially the guy with his cat.  Also
Patricai Evans synopsis of HYF was excellent - more believable than any of the
explanations given by those type of Christians who investigate this kind of
thing.  But then I suppose Patricia Evans is a follower like the rest of and

Seriously guys I guess it just shows us how careful we must be when

Imagine my dismay to find out that my "revelation" about hidden messages and
interesting numerology in Rush history was not included in the special 666
issue of NMS.  Could be it was intercepted by evil daemons invading the
Internet trying to prevent the truth from being exposed, thus inviting an
invasion by the FBI or ATF?  Good issue, we apparently have some active
imaginations out there (or people with no life?).  Worship on...
