Here are my favorite basslines by the Gedster (not necessarily in order
of difficulty, some are just damn fun to play):

"classic" = Beneath Between Behind, Freewill, YYZ
"middle" = Turn the Page, Digital Man, Distant Early Warning
"recent" = Show Don't Tell, Where's my Thing

Two notes that are semi-related to Rush:
- Bass players out there:  I have a lefty M V Pedulla for sale,
  contact me through the net or at (607) 256-8303 if interested.
- Dream Theater fans:  I think we need to start a separate discussion
  list, contact me if interested in getting this going and/or circulating
  boots of shows (I already have one).

Really?  I don't think so.  For one thing, on the basic beat there is time 
enough to swap your hand around and lead with either hand, if you feel like 
it.  But the basic point is that to *lead* with your left hand means that the 
down beats are done with that hand, and you seem to imply that it's necessary 
to do so for The Weapon.  Not at all.  Not only is it possible to lead with 
the right hand, but it it is also very natural to do so.

While his left handed lead abilities are better than most rock drummers, I would
agree that they are nowhere near the abilities of many jazz and fusion drummers.
It's a very difficult thing to do.

Hi kids,

   Short one today.  First of all Dream Theater will be playing
Hammerjacks in Baltimore on February 27 (Saturday).  $8.00/ticket and
doors open at 8:00pm.  Anyone else planning on going, E-mail me and we'll
see if we can meet!  Cool, man.

   Secondly, anyone who would like a copy of the Roll the Bones Radio
Special can send me a tape (at least 71 minutes in length) and $3.00 for
the return postage.  I will be more than happy to do it.  ALSO, make sure
that your return address is clearly written somewhere and include any
special instructions if desired.

   I am sure of the identity of an old unreleased Rush tune that I have on a 
bootleg from 1974 (Stellar Dynamics).  The song is without a doubt "Fancy 
Dancer."  Quality ain't super, but I got it.  If you have any questions about 
it, buzz me!

<A NAME="617004">Subject:      Rush v. Yes</A>

All this talk of why people don't like Rush has reminded me of what
my Freshman roommate used to tease me about.  He claimed that Yes and
Rush were the same band and that they just called the band by two
different names.  Now I tried to explain, first by the logistics of a
different number of people, and then by citing the different music
styles why they were different but it just didn't work.  My ex-
roommate thaught that Jimmy Buffet was the greatest musician on
Earth, so he's obviously not too musically literate and I finally
gave up.  Oh well, he just couldn't see why anyone would need any
lyrics not about beer, sex, or drugs other than "A Cheeseburger In
Paradise"  And he is even an English major, while I'm a Chem major,
figure that one out.

Anyone know where Geddy got the idea for Necromancer from or is that
an original idea? Just curious to expand my knowledge of Rush.

Thanks,
Paul Barrett

Muff,

As I understand it, the song is not that difficult, but there is that *one*
lick after the guitar solo *just* before Geddy comes in with "He's not
afraid of..." which is a good test of your dexerity.

<A NAME="617009">Subject: Fourth member?</A>

Just a quick response to the mail in the last NMS about a fourth
member in the band.In my opinion this would be a very bad idea as it
would just be totally wrong after all these years as a trio.I did
read something by Neil Peart a couple of years ago just before
Presto and basically he said that they had considered getting a
keyboard player for the next tour (ie the Presto tour) but they all
decided against the idea as they thought it would feel and look
wrong, which is something i entirely agree with.As their last 2
albums have had much less in the keyboard department (and i'm
assuming the next one will be the same in this respect) a fourth
member in Rush just (hopefully!) is'nt necessary as they have been
able to play all the synth parts by themselves and let's hope it
stay's this way.
         Just a word on Peter Collins, glad he's back as Rupert Hine
was definitely the wrong producer for the band as he gave the
album's a slightly U.S. FM rock sound whereas Peter Collins kept the
band sounding slightly "English" imo, which suited Rush's type of
music.

<A NAME="617010">Subject: John Dos Passos</A>

John Dos Passos was brought up in NMS #616.  I have only read one book by
Dos Passos, the 42nd Parallel, which is the first book of his famed U.S.A.
trilogy.  I purchased the book because I had heard about Dos Passos'
influence on Neil Peart.  I was not expecting much, but this book was
excellent.  I had not read much literature from the 1920-30s until my
exposure to Dos Passos.  He has been called a "leftist" and very "political"
writer, but these are overstatements.  Though the 42nd Parallel featured
quite a bit of political commentary and one of its main characters was a
leftist who aided revolutionary causes, it can be appreciated for its
quality in plot and characters alone.  I researched Dos Passos' career and
discovered that his work has influenced such Rush works as The Big Money,
Grand Designs, and The Camera Eye to name a few.  He has also written a
book called Manhatten Transfer, which might be the source of the name of the
jazz vocal group.  I would not say that there is much similarity in Dos
Passos and Peart's writing styles, except that they both pay great
attention to detail and like to fully explore their characters.  I have not
had the time to read more of Dos Passos' work, but I intend to and would
recommend it to anyone who is interested.

Yes, I've been playing with my new GIF watcher utillity and blowing of work
(hey, I work for the government anyway....).  Well,  I just noticed that if
one looks at the picture of Geddy playing the double neck bass/guitar in
doubleneck.gif, one notices that with his eyes completely shadowed, and as
thin as he is, Geddy looks just like Morpheus in Vertigo's Sandman (at least
some of the older issues such as during the Seasons... story line).

Do many Rush fans read comics?  Just curious...

Hi Rush-maniacs!!!

   I want to discuss to some fans of Rush and Dream Theater what they
understand about the concept of "Progressive Rock". I will copy an article
(only fragments) that appears on the Guitar Player Magazine of JAN/90.
Dream Theater is influenced by Rush and I think that maybe Dream Theater
would be the group that will take the old vision of music from Rush,not the
same but almost. But I still thinking that the concept of music from RUSH is
unique.

	[ Ok, just a friendly reminder this is a Rush mailing list,
	  *not* a Dream Theater list.  With that in mind, we'll let the
	  the following DT "plug" go through the digest.  :rush-mgr ]

DREAM THEATER :New Definition for Progressive Rock

    The term "progrssive rock" can bring many conversations to a screeching
halt,polarizing event the most mild-mannered music aficionados.For some,it
conjures complex,compelling,sometimes classically derived rock,while others
view it as bombastic musical excess.Both sides generally concede that,for the
most part,it died with the '70s.
     However,Dream Theater is cutting a path into a new territory that's heavy
on the metal,light on the classicism,and thick with excitement.
     Their debut album WHEN DREAM AND DAY UNITE shows the quintet taking
chances in odd meters,scaling complex harmonies,and burning on their instru-
ments.At times they travel the road paved by Emerson,Lake & Palmer,Genesis,
Kansas, and RUSH,while laying down a thick coating of grit that only comes from
the type of metal forged by Iron Maiden,Metallica,et al.

  { analyze the influence }

   ...."It was the same thing with using a tremolo. I listened Steve Vai's
Flexable,and then Brad Gillis when he palyed with Ozzy Osbourne.
       Another guy who has an interesting approach to the bar is ALEX LIFESON.
He doesn't use it in a really radical way,but he uses it to put vibrato on
chords and to slur into notes-like Allan Holdsworth.I want to learn a lot
more."

 { and the said }

   ...."My main influences came from Iron Maiden,RUSH,Yes, and Jaco Pastorius."
                                                                        {end}

 **
   I think that RUSH set a new standard of music a long time ago and that kind
of music would never comes again.
   RUSH is my favorite group and maybe in the 22 century this music will reborn
again. {if they reborn again }

	Yeah, this is a good point...it gets on my nerves the way
some songs sound slowed down, but I've noticed the KEYBOARDS a LOT
better in this recording!  The sequencer in Force Ten JUMPS out and
the backing keyboards (pedals) in songs like RTB and Xanadu are
GREAT!

About the possible fourth member...GOD I HOPE NOT!!!  I would HATE
that!  I LOVE trio music (The Police, RUSH, etc.) and one of the
things I like about RUSH is that they do what they do AS A TRIO!  The
thought of one of my favorite trios becoming something OTHER THAN a
trio just sucks!

	...just my 2 cents...
