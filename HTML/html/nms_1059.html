Hello all-

I see we are supposed to introduce ourselves, so...

I am 27, graduating in May, and hopefully moving to Denver (now in Lafayette,
LA) this summer.  I became a Rush fan in '81 because this cute girl I knew
thought Tom Sawyer was a cool song.  I bought the single, never really got
the nerve up to talk to her (Caroline Brown, you out there?) and the rest is
history.  Anyway, I thought I'd share a story with y'all.  First, for Amy's
YKYARF if:  you work in a shipping/recieving area and try to peel the *rush*
stickers off of the packages; and I think the best four song sequence is Red
Barchetta, YYZ, Limelight, and The Camera Eye.

I and a few friends managed to get backstage in Shreveport, LA for the HYF
tour.  One of the guys' brothers had been a roadie, and this guy had met Nick
Kotos (tour manager).  They let us all in and set us up with a balloon
machine and about 3K of those HYF balloons.  We blew them all up, then helped
move cases and stuff.  We got to watch them set up the whole stage (we were
there from about 10am till concert time), which was way cool.  Since I was in
from out of town, I hadn't brought any CD sleeves or anything for the guys to
sign (if we met them) so I brought this Bass Superstars Series (Geddy Lee, of
course) book with me.  I felt really stupid afterward walking around with a da
mn book, but anyway, we got to eat lunch with the road crew, some of which
had these cool polo type shirts with Rush HYF tour 19-- embroidered on the
front (I asked Nick for his, he told me "suck my d---" (and laughed).  While
eating, I was trying to hide my bass book, when someone behind me says: "Hey,
who plays bass?"  I wasn't going to answer, but all my friends pointed to me.
 The guy then says, "Hi, I'm Skip, (Gildersleeve) why don't you come check
out the rig."  Barely containing my enthusiasm, I went up on stage with him,
was given a tour of Geddy's nieghborhood, and was given the WAL for a test
drive.  I put it on, walked towards the middle of the stage and began playing
a bit...THE HOUSE SYSTEM WAS ON!!!  I thought I was gonna die!  Some guy
messing with the cymbals started playing along with me, and my friends were
there in the front (only?) row cheering me on.  Skip soon called me back to
earth, explaining that they had some more checks to go through.  I handed the
WAL back, and he gave me a pack of Geddy's bass strings (Superwound
Funkmasters), I still have them.  We didn't get to meet the guys, although we
got to see the whole soundcheck, and Geddy playing catch with a roadie, and
Neil riding his bike around the arena (We were told where to be during this
time, and were almost *gaurded* amking sure we didn't get too close to the
guys) and so on.  The final bonus is that this was a general admission
concert so we definitely had the best seats in the house!  I've seen the boys
7 times altogether, but that day will NEVER be forgotten...

Hope y'all enjoyed this...

<A NAME="1059001">Subject: Three new albums soon???</A>

Sorry if the following news is old, but I've not read the last few
issues of the NMS.

In last weeks Kerrang magazine (British rock mag), there was a small
piece on Rush. It claims that the guys are hoping to release a live
album to celebrate their 20 years together. A quote from Neil Peart
stated that they hope to do a small number of shows in the USA (yes
again they are going to miss out the U.K!!), and they are thinking of
re-recording some of their old classics for a future release. Neil
said they "don't want to do the usual thing of releasing a box set",
and so I guess these items will be released individually. The article
also stated, that a new (original) Rush album will also appear in a
year or so.

I don't know how true this info is, but the article did have quotes
from Neil, and so I'd say its pretty accurate. The re-recorded classics
sounds very exciting - what does everyone else think??

    Well, Ron ... what can I  say. 'yer indeed dead *wrong* man!
    Sorry bud!  I've  already  set the story straight for Holly,
    now I'll do it 'fer you ... Make no mistake about it,  there
    *never* was any publication  (publically or private)  called
    "Raindance Over the Rockies" There were 4  private  journals
    he wrote, none of which though were called raindance.  The 4
    that he wrote, that I have shared with some of my friends on
    here, were very limited in print and graphic in description.
    Read 'yer Shock Rock book, that was a straight  rip'n'polish
    from his last journal ... the closest Neil wants his fans to
    get to his personal writings, no doubt.

> printed for him to distribute privately amongst his friends/or
> whoever he would want to send/sell it to.  I don't recall if this is

    Who are you kidding man?  Neil wrote those journals for his
    own pleasure and, if you had read any of  them,  you  would
    soon realize in his writings that his intent was to "share"
    them with his friends, not "sell" them to his fans.

Hi fellow Rush fans,

  This is my second post here. I have two copies of _Visions_ because
of some reasons; one bought in early 1989, the other bought a few
years later (I don't remember clearly)
  One day I looked at _Visions_ (bought later), I found pictures which
I didn't have remembered looking at. It's really strange! I looked at
both books to compare them. And I found out that several pictures are
different perfectly. I was NOT mistaken.
  The pictures which are different between two copies are five pieces.
(p.18, p.28, p.34, pp.52-53 and p.60) Beside this, captions add and
several pictures are different layout too.  Some sentences and some
words (address of exclusive distributor for example) changed. But I
couldn't make sure two copies are another edition clearly, and I don't
know a lot overseas publication.
  I have read NMS since half a year. This may be the thing which was
already pointed out by someone or discussed here.
  You don't may understand because I don't get used to writing in
English.

	Fellow Rushians-

I was just wondering about some opinions on FoL.  I was looking at the
cassette poll, and it didn't get on it!  I can't imaginw why.  FoL is one
pf the best songs by the boys.  I think people should take another listen
and write what they think.  It will be good for the NMS instead of some
of the other stuuf of late.

	I can certainly relate.  It's pretty obvious when I wear my Roll
the Bones concert shirt (which, unforunately, some dimwit put in the
DRYER yesterday, shrinking it to a size comfortable for my toddler
cousin, but *much* too small for me!  AIE!  Anybody know if I can get
another somewhere?  I have (had?) the black RTB shirt with dates on the
back along with part of the RTB rap and the album cover on the front)
that I'm not a Rush Limbaugh fan, but when I wear my blue Counterparts
hat, I get the funniest looks.
	Unfortunately for me, most of the people in Utah look at me
hopefully and say, "You're a Limbaugh fan, too, huh?"  I never know quite
how to react.  My responses range from snickering to fiercely denying any
involvement with Limbaugh to outright running away from the questioner.
	My dad suggested taking a little piece of athletic tape and
writing "(The Band)" on it and sticking it right under the RUSH name on
the hat.  It could work!

	All the more reason we need those "Rush is a band" stickers!  To
whomever is considering creating them, mark me down for at least three!

<A NAME="1059007">Subject: Orbit Room: Al's son!</A>

Hey folks, check this out:
     Took a cruise up to check out the beautiful city of Toronto (12 hour
drive from the Jersey shore) and to see Mr. Lifeson's new joint, the Orbit
Room.
     We arrived in the city around 9 on Friday night and the first thing we
did, of course, was head for the Orbit Room for some beers and some grub.
Mind
you, we didn't even have a motel room yet.  At the top of the stairs we
paid a mild 5 dollar cover and proceeded into this small, quaint, dimly lit,
hip, slightly elegant nightclub.  At the time we arrived, only a handful
of people were hanging out, having drinks, and picking away at various
different interesting looking dishes.  The food was quite good - gourmet
even.
I had a little trouble with the Calimari Stri Fry (I like my squid disected)
but my Satay w/ Wontons was delicious!  The band (I forget their name) came
on towards the end of our meal, and politely played some softer jazz while
people were eating.  Toward the end of the set, they were jammin' HARD!
VERY impressive!  Good musicians.  They were a four piece: guitar (electric),
bass (elec.), drums, and a keys guy with a Hammond.  It's funny, the bass
player had a Fender Precision cut into a teardrop shape like Ged's old one
(I know.  Ged's was a Jazz). On an occasional tune the guitar player sang,
and the bass and keys guys did harmonies.  They play there every week Wed.
through Sat.
     Then my friend, Ron, begins a little conversation with the waitress:

RON:      "Is it true that Alex Lifeson owns this place?"
WAITRESS: "Yes!  Him and -so and so- and -so and so-, but he's not here.
          He comes in once in a while and sometimes plays with the band.
          His son's here though!"

     Needless to say, our faces dropped to the floor as our lovely waitress
pointed him out.  He was sitting at the first table by the entrance having
some drinks with a female.  Kind of an eccentric looking dude with died blond
spiked hair.  We refrained from interupting his date(?) but caught some
quick,
dark, zoomed video shots of him (please, no requests for our 1.5 second clip
of his face).
     We returned the following night, and the place was packed!  We had a
great time.  Met some really nice, friendly, and very pretty, Toronto native
girls.  They couldn't understand why the joint was so hoppin'.  They
also had no idea that Alex owned it.  They were like, "Oh, maybe that's
why this place is doing so well."  Of course we meet beautiful Canadian
babes right before we had to leave.  Toronto is too great.  I'm defecting.
     A side note:  We also visited the Parliment Building in Queens Park
(from MP cover).  The front steps were under renovation and were boarded
off, but we still got a million great shots.
     My advice for those who've never been?  Go see Toronto and have a
beverage at the Orbit Room!  See ya there!

Hello.

This is addressed to: James Noble, and just about anyone else reading.

He asked about the video's to "Fly By Night" and "Anthem".
Well they do exist. I now, because I have them!!!
They are just video shot in a TV studio much like the AFTK and Hemisphere
Promo's.
You can tell they were recorded to the studio sound-track cause of the sound
of the audio. It sounds just like the album.
Does anyone now if this was ever aired on the "Don Kirshner Rock Concert"????

Also. Someone told me that ESL was originally an HBO in-concert thing, then
after that was aired, it was released on home video & laser disc.   Can
anyone confirm this!????????

And I heard that the ESL laser disc was put in the first commercial Laser
Disc players released as sort of a bonus, and to show off the good quality
that laser discs get. Has anyone else heard of this as well????

Now, let us set some things straight. I was just merely making a simple entry
in this fine publication, and all of a sudden, I get attacked and yelled at.
 Yes, I now know that the entire song is about drugs, WAIT I AM SORRY,
MARIJUANA and that was the reason I was bringing it to the attention of you
all. I did say "I do believe the song is about". I didn't say the song WAS
about angel dust and heroine. Those of you that took offense, y'all need
help.  Attack dildos who ask questions about RUSH being in cults, and saying
that the cover of 2112 is a pentagram.  THE FRONT OF  2112 IS NOT A
PENTAGRAM!!!!! No, I am not getting offended, just merely stating how
ignorant these comments, to some, mine may have been. Don't hold that against
me though, that I am not involved in drugs.

Well, I guess it's just because it seems to be pretty true. I only know one

material for a new record to emerge sometime before the end of the year."

Looking back at the A Farewell To Kings tourbook this weekend I noticed some-
thing that I'd like to see again - a nice short but interesting description of
the crew's jobs. It only took up one page and it was really interesting to
see what each did, and their jobs have switched around in 18 years since then
 - it'd be something different. And I know there's enough room that isn't filled
in the tourbooks - just non-picture space with the background design - granted
I love Hugh Syme's work and you need some design structure, but I'd rather
see twice as many pictures and less open area.

What do YOU think?

Hi everyone,
I haven't posted in months, but I'm back.  I recently had a bad spot, my
boyfriend and I broke up and I've been feeling pretty depressed.  (I should
have known it would never work, he hates Rush!)  I've been wallowing in self
pity, but then had a thought. (Yes, it does happen sometimes.)  Why don't I
get on TNMS and try to find someone nearby who is into Rush.  I go to
Stockton college in Atlantic City.  I'm 19 and I also play keyboards and
bass if there are any musicians nearby.  Ayn Rand is my favorite author, and
We the Living is my favorite book.  I'm just looking for a friend, since not
many people like Rush here, or Kate Bush, Yes, The Police, or NIN. I'm
surrounded by Green Day and Hole. HELP ME
Although you don't have to live nearby, I get a little down when I start
becoming friends with someone in California or Australia because I know
we'll never meet.  But anyone can write.  I'll talk to ya later.

PS-I got a kick out of the country rush song list.  Spirit of Rodeo made me

Hello all,
  I know this is a question many of us older fans have and that is
will there ever be another 20 minute rush story-line epic. I thought
long and hard about this one and took into consideration quotes I'd
heard from Neil about progression and style. I believe a lot of the
reason why the band shys away from the longer songs is thatNeil's
writng what he is living, in a realtruthful sense. It seems that
as wise as he is, his hunt for honesty and truth is permanent. Just
listen to the mid-eighties albums and the answer is right there.
But, I for one would love another Cygnus, or if they really want
to go back, revive By-tor!!! Either way the music is still top
notch and Neil is still writing incredible lyrics. That's my
two cents.

Yes, Rush is up for a grammy in best rock-instrumental.  I was just

wondering if the best rock instumental will even be shown in its full
presentation or if it will be just flashed on a graphic.
Also, this Honkey-Tonk, Heartache album or whatever it is called sounds
like a big cruel joke to me.
	 I heard that Metallica is going into the
studio to do a song with the three tenors, apparently some joint
project.  I heard that at first they were a little reluctant, but now
they love opera and rock.  Look for an album from Lars "Pavoratti"

 Greetings,

I was browsing through The Encyclopedia of Popular Music and came across
a rather extensive Rush section. It mentioned that Alex and Geddy met at
a High School in Sarnia,Ontario. Does anyone happen to know what school
this was? I've been to several schools in Sarnia and it would be really
cool to know that I have walked through the same halls as greatness once
walked through.

I live in the Detroit area an I receive CBC which is a major Canadien TV

Barenaked Ladies on some variety show. They were pretty good!

Hello there,

I have been reading NMS for some time but this is my first post...

Firstly (and nothing to do with the subject line of this post) I'd like to
publicly thank Brian Burns for the info on the new Rush country and western
album. Personally I can't wait and have already dusted of my old cowboy
gear in anticipation.

Secondly, after watching the Brit Awards on telly last night, I couldn't
resist responding to Kevin E. Mort. On the subject of Geddy's earphone, he
said...

>Actually they are quite a popular item as of late.  Phil Collins began
>using them on the We Can't Dance tour, and Branford Marsalis uses them on
>the Tonight Show.  Oh..and yes, they are coloured to match one's skin tone.
>Quite a cool toy I think.

Yes it's true! All the best musicians are wearing them. Only last night I
saw Robbie from Take That wearing, not one but TWO skin tone earphones. I
wonder if that's where Geddy got the idea?

Howdy y'all,

Just a lil' ole follow-up to Brian Burns posting of
2/20/95...

Just received word from a few industry sources that RUSH enjoyed
making their first country album so much that a second is already in
the works.  Early song titles are...

Mud Between The Wheels
Manhattan (Kansas) Project
Freewillin'
Counties (follow-up to Territories)
AutoBody Electric
Ride By Night
Huck Finn (follow-up to Tom Sawyer, of course)
and, last but not least,
21,12 (My age and her's when we got hitched)

Ouch, sorry about that last one.  Hey, it's just s joke, right?

There's even a rumor that if these two albums sell as well as
expected, they may just change the name of that town in Tennessee to
Rushville.

See y'all,

nobody I know saw him out there that day. An open

some tee times for you. OK, next.. who is this guy who is
using Alex Lifeson's name on NMS postings but claims not
to be "the Lerxst". Anybody else wondering or am I missing
something? If you are the "real" Alex, I apologize (I sent
an e).  Next... if you folks don't know the differnece
between Rush and Mahogony Rush(Frank Marino's band), I
wonder if you should be posting here. ... pinched harmonics
(not harmonicas?!) are fun (duh huh) I love to squeeze it

The catalog you were looking in is called The Videolog. I noticed this same
listing a couple of years ago, and took the time to investigate. The answer is
that this tape contains a video by Merrilee Rush, who had a hit some years back
with "Angel Of The Morning". The video on the tape is not even this song; it's
some other title that never charted. So... mystery solved!

<A NAME="1059033">Subject: Mobile Fidelity releases?</A>

Just a question to the general crowd...does anyone have one (all?) of the Rush
CDs that were remastered by Mobile Fidelity Labs (the gold CDs)?  I got a chance
to listen to _Moving Pictures_ (_2112_ and _Signals_ were also available) at the
store, and to look at the artwork (which faithfully reproduced the album's,
with all three band members, red lettering for the lyrics, full front and back
cover art).  As nice as it was, I couldn't help noticing how crummy the head-
phones sounded, so I really couldn't tell whether it was worth the investment
($24 on sale).  I also had my wife in tow, and if she saw me plunk down that
kind of cash for a CD that I already (sort of) have, she would have gone
medieval on me.  :-)

I guess what I should have done was ask them to play the $10 version in compar-
ison to the other, but I didn't have the heart.  From what I understand, they
sound better than the original issues if you have the equipment to notice the
difference (i.e., personal/portable players won't make it).  So here's the
question...how do these premium versions compare to their unleaded counterparts?
I'm looking for _audio_ comparisons only; I realize the artwork is almost worth
the price in itself, but to me that alone won't justify the kind of green that
these things fetch.  If you prefer, you can email me directly to avoid spamming
this newsgroup, but I'm sure others out there would be interested in this.

Thanks in advance!

This is my first posting, so don't laugh, ok?  I read an insert about
someone who was looking for some other bands besides Rush to get into.  Well,
I really don't know who to recommend besides Dream Theater, but you really
should listen to these guys.  The drummer (although not as much of a God as
Neil!)  really plays some jammin stuff, and in my opinion they favor Rush in a
couple of ways.  I haven't heard their new album yet, but "Images and Words"
really impressed me, especially the track called "Under A Glass Moon".  Give
these guys a shot--see what you think!

	I also am dying to get my hands on some Rush merchandise--particularly
posters and live albums, being bootlegs or whatever.  Would someone please send
me merchandise information if you have it?  I'm dying for a pair of boxers.
	I must thank my older brother Jay for introducing me to the world of
Geddy, Alex, and Neil.  I first heard it blaring from his bedroom about five or
six years ago.  Then I didn't think any of it at all, but he convinced me to sit
down with him and really listen to some of their stuff.  I immediately fell in
love with the band, and have been a hard core fan ever since--just ask some of
my college buddies who get tired of hearing "Hold Your Fire"  blasting from my
stereo!!  Thanks Jay, and thank you NMS for keeping me posted.

	If this next album is gonna be their last, I'll crap a brick!

I am always hearing that the first album sounds like Led Zeppelin. I
personally don't see it. IMHO, the first album (and possibly FBN as well)
sound much more like Budgie. Budgie was a British heavy metal band in the
early 70's (or at least the band's heyday was in the early 70's). They
recorded some great stuff, especially the albums "In For The Kill" and
"Bandolier".

Anyway, those of you who have heard these albums - am I crazy? Or is this
the band that the early RUSH albums REALLY sounded like?

Hey all!

	Just thought I'd add to the discussion about Rush playing
3hrs in Kansas City when the opener couldn't perform. Actually,
I know this happened in Detroit once. If I had more time, I'd check
out the concert details but I'm pretty sure it was the HYF
tour and the opener was Tommy Shaw. Anyhow, the opener was sick
and the boys in Rush, being the nice guys that they are, decided to
play the whole evening to make up for it. I was kinda pissed off
because I went to the first of the two shows and the opener was just
fine then. Oh well. Tommy Shaw was pretty good though. At least he
didn't get quarters and lighters thrown at him like Marillion did!

	One other note...in the last NMS someone was ranting about
'fillers' on Rush albums. I'd have to disagree with most of his
selections, but I have thought that Everyday Glory from Cp is way
outta place. It sounds like an outtake from HYF or Presto to me. It
just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the album. Cold Fire
would have been a great place to end. I also get the feeling that
the days of the solid album are through, for most artists, because
of the irresistable urge to fill up a CD. Now that more music can
be crammed on, we're getting songs that would never have made it
to albums in earlier days. Some of you must think that it's a good
thing to hear as much as possible, but I really enjoy a solid,
unified album. That's what makes it great for me!....

Anyhow, thanks for listening!
