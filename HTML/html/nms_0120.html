	The subject says it all (although for some reason the Digest
<A NAME="120002">keeps interpreting my Subject: lines as "none" at the top of the Digest.  Mgr?</A>

[ Gee, looks fine to me!  And I didn't do anything!               :rush-mgr ]

Anyway, Alex Lifeson makes a cameo appearance in Gowan's latest video,
"Lost Brotherhood", playing along to the guitar solo.   Not really a
great video, and most fans can do without seeing this appearance.

Good day, eh?

     Last issue someone asked whether any of the boys had "mixed and
matched" with musicians from any other progressive rock groups.
Well, I've mentioned the "Lost Brotherhood" album by Larry Gowan
before, but I guess I'd better tell you who's on it.  Tony Levin,
that bald bad bard of bass of King Crimson and Peter Gabriel's band
(and Pink Floyd, Paul Simon, John Lennon, Robbie Robertson, ABWH, etc.)
played bass and stick.  One of his colleagues from Peter Gabriel's
band, drummer Jerry Marrotta plies his trade.  And of course our favorite
axeman Alex adds his special touch.  They work very well together.  The
album is very slick, but quite popish in its orientation.  Despite its
pop leanings I would suggest it to anyone.
     Also, Neil played on one of Jeff Berlin's albums.  Berlin has played
with almost as many people as Tony Levin i.e. Bill Bruford (King Crimson,
Yes, ABWH), Frank Zappa, and Kazumi Watanabe (also with Bruford).
Granted, these people may not be well known, but they are the backbones
of many of progressive rock's "biggest" names.

     Now I'd like to talk about sampling, bunnies, rap, broken strings,
pentagrams, rap, religion, sampling, Neil's favorite flavor of ice cream,
bunnies...  Agreed! It gets tiresome, But if you are no longer interested
in these subjects (or dont consider them "worthy" of TNMS) then do what
I do --DON'T READ THEM!!  Quite frankly, I'll talk about anything I feel
like.  So let everybody put in their $0.02 without getting so grumpy
about it! Sheeesh!

<A NAME="120004">Subject: Doctor Peart?</A>

     Yesterday in the NMS someone mentioned that Neil has some sort of
graduate (or even bachelor's) degrees, just thought I'd clear this up.
According to Mr. Peart himself in a recent interview (unfortunately
I'm at work and can't think of which one) not only does Neil not have
a graduate degree, but he was in fact, a high school dropout!!!
Just goes to show that degrees are somewhat meaningless.

If you think about it, when could he have had the time to go to college?
As I understand it, he left high school around 16, went to England to
be a musician, failed, and came back to be in everyone's favorite group!
I suppose that my info could be wrong so if anyone knows something I
don't let me know.

That's all, nothing else.

<A NAME="120005">Subject: Who is Max Webster</A>

Well who is Max Webster?

[ To summarize, and hopefully abort a flood of responses:  Max Webster is
  a Canadian band whose members are friends with the guys in Rush.  M.W.
  used to tour with and open for Rush in the late 70's and early 80's.
  Rush plays on one of M.W.'s albums, in a song called "Battlescar"; the
  lyricist for M.W. co-wrote "Tom Sawyer" with Neil.  There are more details
  in the FAQL, the most recent copy being in Digest # 116.        :rush-mgr ]

In reading through the 11/30 posting of Frequently Asked Questions
about Rush I noticed that one "hold you fire" symbol was missing from
the list. Namely, in one of the upper right hand windows of the right
hand most apartment building you can see part of the head and crown
of the Statue of Liberty who we all know holds a burning torch in
her right hand.

Ho...
Wouldnt it be neat if RUSH came to play at the Cole Feild House at the
University of Maryland College Park? I think so...and im sure alot of
Maryland rush fans do to...after all this is the home of the Temples of Syrinx
and the National Midnight Star!

I wonder if we could somehow pull this off (or is this just hopeful dreaming).
Id be happy to assist in anyway possible and I wouldnt mind some input on this.

thanx...and May the force be with you.
