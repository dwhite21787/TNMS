Ok, folks, here we are, back on the air.  It's been a long time, and I
apoligise, but I hope we can re-start the regularity of the NMS now.
This issue will be the current/latest mail, and other issues will come
out in the next few days to catch up on the backlogged mail (around 120
items).  There will be two mailings per day until this is caught up.  I'm
sorry if some of the time-critical stuff missed the mark...

I will NOT be moving mail with spoiler information to the ends of the
digests; posters please put "SPOILER" in your subject if you post about
a show you've seen.

There are a bunch of new things:  new tabs in the ftp tab directory (take
a look), plus an updated tab creation program.  There are also some new
images, too many to detail here.  Check the images directory - the CONTENTS
file is updated.  A file containing the song spoofs is available in the 
'special' directory under the name "song.parodies".  It contains songs from
the current album and a couple of old ones.  The headers were left intact
so we can credit (blame?) the authors.

Well, that's all for now.  Hopefully this is the start of the regular
deliveries again!

  Pushead has done loads and loads of work in the hardcore scene.  Many old
fanzines are graced with his tender pens and brushes.  Pus' distinctive
style sticks out from the usual boring and/or campy-shocking music artwork.

  Pushead did covers for a number of albums.  The one that immediately comes
to mind is Corrosion Of Conformity's _Animosity_ (their 2nd release).  CoC
is a hardcore (kinda' speed metal) band out of Raleigh, NC.  They are a
mighty mighty band, with a brand new release (whose name I forget; with
only 2 original band members though).  You can pick up _Animosity_ and
the new one fairly easily.  Well worth it.

Pushead did the cover art for Prong's _Beg_to_Differ_, and has been doing
work underground bands for about ten years in California.  He was asked to
do the artwork for Anthrax's _Persistence_of_Time_ but either refused or
wasn't allowed to by Brockum, the company that releases all his published
artwork.

Prices are the usual: $29.50 for Gold Circle Coin (forget it.  I don't even 
knowwhy they bother advertising it) and $19.50 for Peon/Serf Seating.

Not to mention the $2.50 Ticketbastard "convenience" charge (read: another way
to scalp the concertgoer).

Good luck to all of you searching for tickets.

Greetings...

RTB is somwhere arond 47 (I think) on the Billboard album chart and has
a notation that it has sold 500,000 copies
(gold status).

A gripe ... people in the music industry wonder why tours are being canceled
and shows aren't selling out. Tickets for the Dec. 3 Rush show in Philly
went for $29.50 and $19.50. When I saw the band during Presto, I paid $21
for sixth-row (yep, sixth-row) seats. (Got 'em over the phone, too.)

I wasn't that lucky this time. The phone lines were tied up forever, and I
had to call a ticket agency. I got second-level seats for $25 a pop.
Most people cannot afford tickets going for $30 and up. Who can I complain
to?

A second show has been added in NYC, Dec. 7 at Madison Square Garden (the first
show completely sold out!)

Has anyone seen the RTB video on eMpTyV? I hear it's really good!
I have a hunch Atlantic will release a video compliation shortly.

That's about it for now. Donna S., are you still hosting a Rush party the
weekend before the show? Rush-mgr, will you be driving up the interstate
to see the Philly show?

Keep 'em rolling...

My copy of the Signals album songbook, arranged for keys/piano, has the

   I was reading through the Rush FAQ whn I noticed that the copies of Exit

By the way, the Rush concert in Pittsburgh was awesome.  :-)

Well, I recently got a new Mac, I digitized the rap and played it back at
a higher speed.  It does sound more like Geddy than anyone else.  Some of
it is difficult to tell, then he will hit a word that gives it away, even
someone listening to it over the phone thought it was him.

As far as MTV is concerned.  I missed the premiere of the video.  Did
anyone tape it???  Please let me know.  I called and he said that they
will be playing it but he couldn't tell me when.  If I get it on tape I
will do a review as soon as possible.

If you want to you can call their 1-900 number and request it, but hey,
who knows if they even listen to that!

Greetings!

Since I haven't had a chance to post in a while, this message will
have a lot of subjects within it...

--  I read that the new video is on MuchMusic.  What is MuchMusic??
    And why isn't it on eMpTyV?

--  Anyone on here listen to the King Biscuit Flower Hour?
    Here in Pittsburgh, I can sometimes get good reception on
    Z107 (106.9).  Anyways, last week they broadcast a concert
    from P/G, taped in Toronto.  I don't have the P/G video, so
    I'm not sure if it's the same thing, but this is what they
    played:

Three Stooges Intro, but the King Biscuit guy was explaing Rush
to us over it.
The Spirit of Radio
The Enemy Within
Witch Hunt
New World Man
Distant Early Warning
Red Sector A
Closer to the Heart
Tom Sawyer
Limelight
Freewill
Finding My Way/In The Mood (I think.  I've never heard In The
  Mood, but I think that's what this was.)

Anyways, the concert was one hour minus some commercial breaks.
Also, he talked again ("we now return to Rush live in Tornoto", or
whatever) over the opening for Limelight.

--  $23 for a T-shirt??

--  My Rush tape collection has grown by 4 albums in the past
    few weeks:  I got FBN, COS, AFTK, and Hem.  Wow!!!

--  I never could have imagined Rush doing "Rivendell."

--  Does anyone else thk that the chorus to "Cinderella Man"
    sounds Beatle-esque?  I do, but I don't really know why.
    Maybe something related to "Nowhere Man"...

--  Is there any chance of Rush appearing on In Concert '91?
    They've had Yes, Neil Yound, Elton John, Grateful Dead, so
    it's not really a matter of taste.  Very little pop on there.

--  Do other radio stations out there play stuff like "Tom
    Sawyer" a lot?  'DVE here in Pittsburgh hardly ever does,
    but instead they really like The Trees, Subdivisions, Time
    Stand Still, Freewill, The Spirit of Radio.  Hardly ever the
    more popuplar MP material.  Oh yeah, and they seem to be
    playing a lot of Ghost of a Chance...

--  On a quasi-related note:  would you people recommend Eric
    Johnson's Ah Via Musicom?
Well, I'm done for now... TTYL

Yup it's true, the video was finally on and I taped it.

I was house sitting for the weekend and the people I was sitting for
happen to have MTV.  So I was taping on 6 hour shifts hoping to get it.
For two days I was scanning the tapes only to find this 2ligit crap and a
bunch of other nonsense.  Then it happened...

As I was fast forwarding through a Tom Petty video, I looked down at the
TV Guide, and when I looked up... lo and behold,  there they were rockin
infront of the wall of dice.

I was suprised because they played the entire thing from beginning to
end.  Here is a brief synopsis,  if you don't want to see this just cover
your eyes or something.

The video starts out showing some album cover posters in a window, it
then shows a closeup where the kid on the cover comes to life.  We then
get to see gedster and those other two cool guys.  Neil has his new
drums, and yes geddy's hair is down, like the photo in Guitar Player.

They are playing before the wall of dice and it cuts between them and the
kid infront of the wall.  Soon the kid falls and breaks down a part of
the wall exposing the blue sky and other killer things.

The solo takes place with Alex in a sorta snowstorm of dice (way cool)
with some distant shots of him a geddy, you can only see their siloettes
infront of a bright light.  The rapper is a nifty skeleton, not really
animated but more like a marionette.  Very funny,  mohawk hair and all.

Neil sports his colorfull bandana and plays with energy, some coll shots
of him.  Overall, probibly my most favorite video of all time.  I have
watched it so much I think the quality of my tape in faultering.  If
anyone wants a copy please contact me via e-mail.   vinnie@darkside.com

The only rub to the whole thing.  I calculated when it was played on MTV
according to my tape.  Not during the day.  Not primetime.  Nope, at 1 in
the morning PST, that means 3 or 4 on the east coast assuming there is no
delay.  Hey they played it,  but in great MTV fashion, they played it at
a very cheesy time.

After you see it answer this one question.  Who wouldn't like this video?

        Dan-

Well maybe some Finlanders....  but that's about it!\
