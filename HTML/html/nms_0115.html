I just wanted to interject quickly here to make one request:  would it
be possible to cut back on the sampling debate, unless it directly
pertains to RUSH?  I don't want to censor the stuff here, but we're 
tending to get into general discussions of sampling rather than talking
about RUSH.  These discussions belong in more of a general forum.  (I've
gotten a couple of complaints about the abundance of sampling articles
recently.)

Thank you for your support.

Re:  Rap et al
	I will admit that the sole person who so diligently expressed his
	feelings about the rap music discussion here on the digest does have a
	point.  Again, we are talking about opinions.  Most of us do not like
	rap but some do, it's that simple.  Of course, we will have a defender
	of rap when it get degraded (case in point).  Also, there will always
	be an opposition about how much talent is involved.  Those in favor
	say, yes these groups have lots of talent.  Those opposed, say what
	talent?  I don't see or hear any talent.  Opinions, opinions, we all
	know what to do with them :-).

This would be "Bad Boy", from the Beatles 4th album (so Geddy says).

That would be the Electry Lady(land?) studio tape; I think it originally
was a promo of them and their new (FBN) stuff, and new drummer Neil Peeert.

They also did a cover of "Not Fade Away" (B. Holly) as their first single,
backed with "You Can't Fight It", a Rush tune that never made it to an
album (unless you count pieces stripped off & used in other songs).

There is another tune I still wonder about.  It's on the _Stellar Dynamics_
bootleg album; it's called "Fancy Dancer".  I don't know where it's from.
Any ideas?  Anybody know where I can get lyrics?

Notice both of those are bootlegs from 1974; I've been listening to Rush
since 1976-77, and have been seeing them since '79.  I've never seen them
or heard of them doing any (serious) covers other than the two I mention
above.

Well, I don't know if this counts, but it's a third-hand account of Alex's
antics one evening after a show...  (Pardon me if I've posted this before.)
It's relayed to me by a friend who worked for a (concert) lighting company
who did lights for RUSH when they hit here on the tour.

This was on the Hemispheres tour (back in their younger, rowdier (?) days.
They played here near Washington DC, and stayed at an area hotel.  After
the show, Alex apparently got a little (lot) sloshed, and started to get
generally rowdy; loud talking, stomping around, etc.  Somebody complained,
and the police eventually showed up on the scene.  They (RUSH people) had
to resort to somebody stashing (hiding) Alex while somebody else talked to
the cops and convinced them everything was under control.  I guess it
wouldn't do to have your lead axeman jailed when you have a show in another
city the next day!  :-)

o   there were no people dressed in bunny costumes

I've heard it.  It's out there.  In fact, it's by 'Mellow Man Ace', and
is called "Hip Hop Creature".  A friend of mine (also a Rush fan, ok?)
bought it and played it for me.  I'm not a rap fan, so won't (in fact,
CAN'T!) comment on it properly.

He (they?) sampled the synth intro to "Tom Sawyer".  That's it.  That's all.
No lyrics, or anything else.  He repeats the synth sounds multiple times
during the song.  I don't know if any credits were given, and in my opinion,
I don't think it would be required (a nice touch perhaps, but that's it).

Yes, it's out there.  Yes, they sampled Rush.  It's doesn't match my taste
for music, but I'm not qualified to say if it's good or bad; it's just
different.  Why not leave it at that?

As for the person(s) who mentioned Vanilla Ice, he was in fact contacted
by Queen's/David Bowie's lawyers regarding his use of "Under Pressure".
That song is currently unavailable due to a number of legal questions.
Due to said contact between Vanilla Ice and the attorneys, all songwriting
references to "Ice Ice Baby" now state that it was written by
Vanilla Ice/David Bowie/Freddie Mercury/Brian May.

I do not know if royalties were paid.  However, in that case, a much larger
sample was used.

Another poster mentioned M.C. Hammer's "U Can't Touch This".  On that
song, Rick James was given both co-writing credits and paid royalties
for the use of his song.

Sampling is here.  It isn't going to go away.  And the copyright law
is very vague on the legalities of it.  So let's make the best of it,
shall we?

Greetings Fellow Rush Fans,

I've been getting TNMS for about a month now and really enjoy
the reading!!!

About Rush cover songs, I remember hearing one of their
specials from The Source.  I vaguely recall them discussing
that Rush used to do a song entitled _Not Fade Away_ by Buddy
Holly back in their VERY early days..  Anybody else hear this??

I have 2 specials from The Source taped.  If I ever have the
time, I can type them in.  I believe that 1 is just after
Exit...Stage Left, while the other is after the release of
Signals.  The show does contain some unreleased versions of
some songs like "The Spirit of Radio" (different opening with
a car radio changing stations in the backgroud), a live
version of "By-Tor and the Snow Dog" taped in St. Louis, as
well as "Not Fade Away".  Although, I'd have to listen to the
tapes again to be sure (it's been at least 5 years).

I also have 1 BackStage newsletter from the same time period.

I'd like to send a special thanks to the manager of the file
server...  I really enjoy reading the Tour Books (Especially
since I havn't seen a show since P/G.. :( )

Well, looks like I've said enough...

     Sorry about this Lewis thing.  I was in a terrible hurry yesterday

Seems that in my haste I mistakenly accredited this literary gem to
C.S. Lewis instead of its rightful creator Lewis Carrol.  Thus, I extend
my humblest appologies to all you "Jabberwocky" fans (especially the
Oxford chap) for any offense/confusion this may have caused :-)

<A NAME="115010">Subject: Sampling</A>

Ah, a debate...

I saw a response to my recent posting about sampling being "thievery" of
music.  Where do we draw the line?  What's the difference between "stealing"
actual music and using or expounding on other peoples' ideas for lyrics
(Peart)?

Truth be told, we can't go through life without using other peoples' ideas
in any form.  We are continually elaborating on and distilling ideas to
use as our own.  Those ideas came from someone else, who undoubtedly got them
from others, etc., etc.

However, I think that there's quite a difference between using ideas and
using music.  It's a lot easier to "track" someone's voice/lyrics/music than
it is to take an abstract concept and flesh it out with your own input.

This is, of course, not a diatribe against rap.  I don't listen to rap but
at the same time I don't think it's  s**t like some people have been saying
on other newsgroups.  It's a music form of its own, even though it's a little
heavy on the sampling at times.  There are some things which were not meant to
be "rap," though, and "Tom Sawyer" is one of them.  I'm convinced of that.

Finally, Bob Friedman mentioned in the NMS of 11/29 that Vanilla Ice didn't
have to give Queen/Bowie credit for robbing the music track from "Under
Pressure."  Actually, according to eMpTytV Music News (and other sources),
Ice's record company got a bit upset at him for this stealing and forced him
to give Bowie/Queen credit on the charts since "Ice Ice Baby" had hit #1 by
then.  This plus the recent controversy over Mr. Ice's version of his past
life (slightly exagerrated) puts  him in a dim light indeed.  I'm waiting
for IceGate next...

But enough with Vanilla Ice.  After all, this isn't the VI Fans List...

If anyone ever hears this supposed rap version of "Tom Sawyer," please let
us know.  I'm curious if the boyz authorized it.  If they did, that says
something for the group who is (may be) doing it, as was already mentioned.
If not, well, can you say "lawsuit?"

Rushically (?) yours,

Mike

<A NAME="115011">Subject: VIEWS ON RAP/SAMPLING</A>

I HAVE READ ALL (ACTUALLY, MOST) OF THE MESSAGES ON RAP/SAMPLING
AS IT MAY APPLY TO "TOM SAWYER".  I FEEL THAT AS LONG AS THE (ORIGINAL)
MUSICIANS/WRITERS GET CREDIT FOR THE WORK AND IN THE CASE THAT THE
SAMPLING IS DONE NOT ON AN EXCESSIVE LEVEL THEN IT IS FINE WITH ME.  AS
AN EXAMPLE, I'VE SEEN A RAP SAMPLE/REMARK OF "ONCE IN A LIFETIME" BY
A RAP ARTIST WHOSE NAME I FORGET IN WHICH DAVID BYRNE APPEARS IN
THE VIDEO.  IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE WELL DONE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE
CAN BE THOSE WHICH ARE DONE RATHER DISTASTEFULLY; I.E. VANILLA ICE.
I MUST AGREE WITH THOSE WHO LET OTHER PEOPLE MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES
(YOU DONT OWE IT ALL TO ME).  IN OTHER WORDS, LET THEM LISTEN TO
RAP...I DO.

ON A SIMILAR NOTE, WHILE IT MAY BE ONE THING TO SAMPLE, IT'S ANOTHER
THING TO DO A COVER OF A SONG.  I DONT UNDERSTAND THE RECENT SURGE
IN HEAVY METAL GROUPS REMAKING SONGS (ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT I LIKE...AND
I GUESS I'LL HAVE REPURCUSSIONS (SP?) FROM THIS STATEMENT).  FOR INSTANCE
"CAN'T FIND MY WAY HOME" IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS, EVER.  IT HAS
RECENTLY BEEN REDONE BY SOME GLAM/METAL GROUP WHOSE NAME I CARE NOT
TO KNOW.  IT REALLY DISHEARTENS ME WHEN IT COMES ON THE RADIO.  IN ADDITION
AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT HAS BEEN REMADE IN THE PAST, "KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S
DOOR" COMES BLARING OUT OF MY RADIO, IN THE INSTANCES I AM NOT QUICK
ENOUGH TO TURN IT OFF, FROM, NONE OTHER THAN THAT MOST HIDEOUS GROUP,
GUNS AND ROSES. YUCK!! OR FUCK!! WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE.

Seasons' Greetings to all fellow Rushians...

I was wondering if any of you out there knows what Terry (Broon) Brown's
been up to lately.  In case any of you don't recall who he is, Terry
produced all of the Rush albums from Fly by Night through Signals...

Also, I'd like to know if anyone has heard anything of a new band being
formed by ex-Saga members- I recall the name of the group was to be called
"GNP", or something like that... If they have a disc out, is it any good?

Also, does anyone know the Digest # that discussed this a while back

I assume that you get a file of code which you can encode into a

As I was the one who opened the Tom Sawyer rap can of beans, I felt it was
time I cleared up a few things, before discussion gets *way* outta hand...

(NOTE: Quotes from previous issues inserted without attribution; youns know

>Has anyone actually HEARD this song?  For all I know (nothing personal)
>someone may be trying to pull our collective legs!  Before we continue

Yes, it *does* exist.  As I don't normally frequent the Pittsburgh stations
that would play it, I have yet to hear it myself, but a relative and a good
friend have both, INDEPENDENTLY, told me about it.  I, too, await word of
the title, artist, degree of bastardization, etc.

>is it just music that ANNOYS you that should be? Besides that, what's the
>problem with it if the artist consents?

First of all, using other material (e.g. 1812 overture; ELP) by actually
*playing* it (adapting it, rendering it, covering it, whatever) is a totally
different thing than simply *sampling* it.  The latter requires no musical
talent at all.  Can't you see the difference there?  Tesla did their own
rendition of "Signs"; Manfred Mann of "Blinded By The Light"; even Run-DMC
did a new rendition, not a sample, of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way".  (By the
way, there seems to be no question of consent with that last one, as two
members of Aerosmith actually performed on it!)  But where's the *musical*
artistry in sampling "Tom Sawyer", "Owner Of A Lonely Heart", "Superfreak"?

Second, those who are flaming me and others who find this reprehensible are
calling us "anti-rap", "closed-minded", etc.  Personally, I have no problem
with rap for what it is.  I daresay it's an art form unto itself.  But for
the most part, it is *not* music, even when it uses samples of real music!
Now we could debate what is and is not music till we're blue in the fingers,
but that would digress from Rush...

Third, I guess the unanswered question here is: Did Rush consent to this?
Did Yes consent to the "Tic Tac Toe" ripoff?  Did the artist who did
"Superfreak" consent to Hammer's "U Can't Touch This"?  Someone mentioned
that either Queen or Bowie was asked about the Vanilla Ice ripoff, and they
replied, "yeah, I guess we *could* sue...".  Did V.I. *have* the consent of
whoever owns the copyright?  Who owns the copyright for "Tom Sawyer"?  Does
it matter whether the band members consent, individually or collectively?

Hi all...

	A question for those of you out there with the _Power_Windows_ compact
disc:  Have you noticed the immense amount of tape hiss at the very end of
"Mystic Rhythms" (where the song fades out and eventually ends)?  Granted, you
have to crank the volume up quite a bit just to hear this, but my beef is why
is it there in the first place???  The CD sleeve clearly indicates that it's
a DDD disc.  Wot's the deal here?!

So do I.  As I understand it, the five-pointed pentacle was originally
a pagan symbol for Life itself....The four side "points" of the star
represented the four basic forces of Nature (Earth, Air, Fire, Water)
and the fifth one indicated "good/evil" orientation by the direction
in which it points.  Anyone know if this is right???

Also, remember, "good" and "evil" are subjective.  From "evil's" point
of view, "good" might appear "evil"....(Say what??  8-)

Personally, I couldn't care less whether a band is "Satanic" or
not...It's their choice (This IS America!!).  Their music is the
only thing that matters, and the idea that "Satanic music will subvert
my mind if I listen to it" is pure BS, and like all other
propaganda, I simply ignore it.....

When Rush played Indy (06/14/90), the bunnies inflated from the top

Sawyer (That's was one COOOOOL intro they did for Tom Sawyer!!!!)

There's been talk about bunnies in the Presto tour...I caught the opening
show at the GW Forum in Los Angeles, and between songs (can't remember
which) three bunnies came on stage with drinks for the band.  Two of
them were rather attractive and scantily clothed--Geddy and Alex got
these two beauties--but the third was dressed in a head-to-toe fuzzy
bunny suit, not very sexy, and poor Neil got stuck with her (him? couldn't
tell)  Geddy muttered something like "Our work's kinda tough..." I guess
Neil's wife won't be jealous....

I'm pretty sure I've heard "Protect our children!" in there.  I really
can't make out much of the other noise.  But as it was explained in that
interview (issue #111, I think) the intro to Witch Hunt was a bunch of
random ravings recorded by the boyz themselves.  I haven't heard of
anything happening in Florida, but it wouldn't make sense to blame the band
for something that happened at their concert.  (Which isn't to say that
people wouldn't try -- particularly the type of people referred to in Witch
Hunt.)

Obviously a very blurred line. I've been trying to resolve it
for myself (which is pretty academic; I can't afford samplers!).

I think that sampling degrades not the art of music, but of
_making_ music. If it's sampling a sound which the players couldn't
otherwise achieve then I have no complaints, synthesizers have
been doing that for years. But I do complain when samples are
used to steal another's work. It simply strikes me as an attempt
to cash in on another's creativity while hiding one's own lack
of talent.

OK, so stealing other people's work isn't creating something new.
But if you take someone else's music and play it in your own way
something different to the original will emerge. Led Zep stole
the lyrics to "Whole Lotta Love" from Willie Dixon (I think),
but they played the song themselves, wrote new music, and made it
their own. At the time they didn't even give him a credit, but
Robert Plant admitted later on that they should have done.

So I don't mind people using other people's music as long as they
make the effort to play it themselves. That way everything played
comes from the new artist, and remains cohesive. Simply stealing
the original recording and dubbing your own stuff doesn't. I don't
think I'd mind so much if they gave the original artist the credit,
and indeed the royalties, but I still can't see it as a valid work
of art. In the name of art one might reasonably make a sketch of
the Mona Lisa in a new setting, but one wouldn't take the original
canvas and scribble a beard and glasses on it with a crayon. :-)

I checked the video after reading this. It's definitely editing rather
than just a guitar switch between Overture and Temples. During the stabs
at the beginning of Overture it actually alternates between black and white
from shot to shot. In synch with the stabs as well. Methinks the boyz' sense
of humor is manifesting itself again...

I really dislike checkout counter tabloids, but...

I, like many of the rest of you have a keen intrest in Rush Oddities, and
when Marshall (Yea! Marillion!  Yea! Fish!) replied to my inquiry into the
nature of the "angry mob" ("This is one of the weirdest Rumors I have heard
about the band") at the begininng of Witch Hunt, I was thinking...

What are your most obscure Rush Facts? (Not rumors, but actually concrete-
style articles)

For example, to get the ball rolling, here are a few of my favorites:

(1) (Again, I am indebted to Marshall for the inspiration here) Alex has
     an illegitimate son, who in 1988 (HYF tour?) was 18. (Justin?)

(2) As far as Rush covers go, I have heard tapes of Rush playing Bad Boy
    (That Beatles Song), I Walk The Line (yes, Johnny Cash), and Rawhide
    (Rollin', Rollin' Rollin,).  (Do those count as covers?)

(3) Neil Used to play with a band called "The Mumblin' Sumpthin'" (sp?) --
    was that in Visions?

Re: Lewis and Cover Tunes.
     I have heard three recordings of Bad Boy (That Beatles Song).  One played
in Cleveland (With Donna Halper introducing the band), one at Electric Ladyland
Studios in NY (An FM broadcast with what sounds like a limited audience, the
most common of the three recordings),  and one at the Whisky A-Go-Go (in
Hollywood).  I am unsure if these were dates on their first tour, and have
very little info about the nature of the shows, except the dates and song
lists.  Any additional info would be really appreciated!

So..  Until Next Time...

I can't positively remember where I heard this, but I believe it was
eMpTyV News:  Vanilla Ice, along with his producer, manager, record
company, etc., tried to pull a fast one and were caught.  They used
"Under Pressure" without permission.  They knew what they were doing
when they did it.  Fortunately they had to pay the royalty fees to
Queen and Bowie.  I'm not sure if this precludes a fraud lawsuit on
the part of Queen or Bowie, it wasn't mentioned.  Perhaps they agreed
not to sue when they accepted the royalties.  But it makes me very
happy to see a poser like Vanilla Ice be forced to cough up the cash.
