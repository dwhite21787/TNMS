	Geeks? Us? Well, I for one happen to be a Chemical Engineering major
here at Hopkins, but that doesn't make me a geek. I know that a lot of us
happen to be musicians from the replies I received when I asked if there were
any other bassists out there. I can definitely see how RUSH would attract
musicians. Also, I've noticed a lot of people on the list from well-respected
colleges and universities, like U Penn, MIT, Caltech, Dartmouth, Yale, etc.
(No offense to anyone I didn't mention; you're in the 'etc.' Trust me.) RUSH
certainly has an awareness in its lyrics that is unparalleled by any other
band (with the possible exception of Pink Floyd). It would take a relatively
high degree of intelligence to properly appreciate RUSH. That is what I would
suppose to be our common thread.

Hello...
Since I was one of the people that told Shane Faulkner of the new book by the
B-man...i will speak on his behalf (I dont think he will mind!!) A friend of
ours , Ray Wawrzniak, received a phone call last week from the B-man himself
In this phone conversation the B-man asked Ray for some assistance with the
book. A small role, but something none the less. He also said that he would
credit Ray for his assistance in the book. I was told that the book is to be
completed by the end of this year and will be published and released in the
first half of next year. I hope that answers all questions concerning this
matter.

On the subject of Alex's stage troubles-

Both times I have seen Rush, he has had trouble with his wireless.
In March of '86 at the Rosemont Horizon, he did a semi-Pete Townsend
windmill and nothing came out. So he turned off-stage, pointed at
the guitar, turned around and started waving his hand in the air like
a conductor. At Alpine Valley this past summer, the wireless on his Paul
Reed Smith croaked, and he tossed it (!!) off stage in exchange for his
white Signature. He also had a few other troubles throughout the show,
but they were taken care of back stage.

Background vocals-

If you listen to ASOH with closely, you can tell that Alex does
sing background on some of the songs. They're not sampled, and you
can tell because they're not the same every time, they aren't exactly
in sync, etc...

  "Right-wing mumbo jumbo," Dean?  Try reading Anthem or some other Objectivist
literature before making these negative generalizations.  And always remember,
that the ability to collectively force others to conform to your social
vision is the keystone upon which all totalitarianism rests.  No, I don't
consider myself to be a total Objectivist, but it does have some admirable
qualities.

  Since Rush lyrics have always (more or less) supported individualism and
personal responsibility, I wonder how you can interpret this as right-wing
propaganda (enforced collective morality).  Unless, of course, you're looking
at it from a left-wing (enforced collective economy) point of view ;)!

  I've always liked the lyrics to "Anthem," because they seem to break the
standard mold as far as "acceptable rock philosophy" is concerned.  Any
other opinions?

Hi kids.  This is my first "real" post since I belonged to NMS and I would like
to say you all are crazy (And I *LOVE IT* :-)  I was amazed at the number of
Rush fans as well as the amount of knowledge there is about the band. So I
would like to throw some brain food to the masses.  This has probably been
brought up before but a friend and I were talking the other day about 2112 and
it's christian implications.  We are by no means religious fanatics but did
notice some similarities between the crusifiction of christ and the death of
the main character in 2112.  Christ died for our salvation and the character
in 2112 died to bring back the elder race (which brought salvation from the
priests).  Question: why did the character have to die?  Why did the oracle
show him the great worlds of the past only for him to go and kill himself?
Was Neil having a bad day or did he want to leave a bigger question mark than
usual.  Any clues?

Well, just to add my own 2 cents to the discussion. I have degrees in

I have now jumped (or should I say straddled) the fence and spend a
great deal of my time with computers besides teaching in the Fall and
Winter. My research group is designing computer based methods for

On a soundcheck bootleg I have, Alex actually sings. The problem is,
he sounded like a lounge singer!! I mean, can you imagine "Hey yeah,
SUBdivisions, that's right." :-) Sheesh. Actually what he was singing was
something along the lines of "Whoah...she's so ugly...she's so fat and
ugly...and you know...she has no hair!"

I've seen some French in liner notes, and in a Vid boot from the Forum
in Montreal Gedster started off the night with "Nous avons beaucoup de
chansons de jouer pour vous ce soir" (sorry if that's grammatically
messed up, my french is pretty rusty). So I would guess they would
know a little. Then again, I bet they say that in Japanese when they
did a show over there.

Well, I'm sure they could pull off most of the stuff (They have in the
past). But a lot of the stuff between MP to HYF would be hard if not
impossible due to all the extra sounds, layering, etc. Up until Signals
their main concern with writing songs was to be able to reproduce it
live. I believe it was the producer for P/G who convinced them not to
worry about that due to sampling and MIDI technology would fill in
what they couldn't handle. This doesn't mean that RUSH is pulling the
wool over our eyes, however. It's not like Alex is hitting a trigger for a
guitar solo or anything. I think that they are busy enough up there
without having to not use computers. Hmmm...if they couldn't use
computers you'd probably find them playing a lot older stuff tho... :-)

Hello to all Rush fans,

I have just been added to the mailing list and have only received one
issue, so bare with me if this has already been discussed.

When Neil got his new set a few years back, he held a contest to give away
his old one.  He asked anyone interested to send in a letter explaining why
they wanted his kit (or something to that effect).  I heard he finally did
give it to some lucky kid, but I never heard any details of the letter or
who it was that got that awesome piece of Rush history.  Does anyone have any
information on this? I would love to read the winning letter!

Please e-mail or post.

Thanks in advance,

Tom Heruska

<A NAME="104011">Subject: Beneath, Between, Behind (Satanic? <gasp!>)</A>

This summer I was flipping through 120 channels of crap on my (D.C.) cable
system and came across a program on "The Family Channel" about backmasking.

So there I was, laughing to myself about all these things that this religious
freaks (yes, I said and meant freaks) dream up in order to point out our evil
ways.  The show pointed out the classic "offenders" like Zep's "Stairway" and
Queen's "Another one Bites the Dust".  Heck, it even looked down upon the
music's forward message!  Anyway, who should they turn to at the end of the
show but.... (try and guess)

Rush. (didn't guess did you?)  Anyway, it turns out they say the live version
of "Beneath, Behind, and Between" secretly contains satanic backwards
messages such as "Satan, you are the one who is shining" and "Satan, you know
you are the one I love"!  The live version was taken from the Grace Under
Pressure video, and they showed the video portion too when they played it
backwards.

So here they are, showing the Boyz jamming in backwards mode

	AND SHOWING THE SATANIC LYRICS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN!!!

Now this is FUCKING objective, isn't it? (Rush-Mgr, feel free to edit this! :-(

The fact that satanic messages may be hidden in Rush songs is totaly absurd.
On top of that, the freaks actually made an effort to imply that the
backwards messages were *intended*.  Third, the "satanic" captions were
designed to lead on the viewer into actually believing the messages were
there.  Personally, throughout the whole show I was closing my eyes to
avoid seeing what I was *supposed* to hear.  Since they repeated the clips
about 5 times each (to BEAT it into your head), I could try to find my
own message on the first four times and see what they thought on the fifth.
Somehow, I just didn't hear it, and that's saying something since I'm a
musician and ex-audio engineer with good ear-training experience.

I think Neil would tell these people to "get a life" also!  :-/

First of all, I'd like to say that I think that this type of forum is a
fabulous idea, and am glad a friend bumped into the address on a news net.

On the subject of Rush's opening act for much, if not all, of the Presto tour,
Mr. Big.  While I do have to admit that as a live act they lacked a lot of
pizazz, but as for Bob Friedman's comment as to them sucking, Billy Sheehan
and Paul Gilbert are really fine musicians, and while their arpeggio laden
classically influenced technique may not appeal to everyone, they are a good
band.  And while Sheehan doesn't have the great feel of Lee's bass, he is a
fine technical player, argualby one of the best of all time.  I'll of course
take Rush over Mr. Big any day, seeing as there never has nor ever will be
a greater band, I just wanted to voice my opinion on Mr. Big.

By the way, I saw the Presto tour in Phoenix, and the sound kinda lacked there
too, but as far as I can figure from what I heard (By the way, I agree with the
opinion that the drums were too loud), I'd accredit the poor sound on the poor
acoustics of the forums they play.  Basketball arenas and the like while are
cool for getting a large crowd, they weren't built with music in mind for the
most part, so I think that has a lot to do with it.

A lot of bckgrnd. vocals on Presto tour were triggered, but if you saw Alex
singing into the mic, you can be sure it was really him.  The Boyz have more
integrity than to fake something like that.

Someone questioned my source for the new B-man Book.  An aquintace of mine
(one of the biggest Rush Fans/collectors in the world) was asked by the
B-Man for minor assistance in the preparation of the book.

After reading Neil's response to the digest , I wondered... how many of you
would have the nerve to approach Neil if you saw him in the street? I
totally respect his right to privacy, but I think he carries it a little
too far.  This is just my opinion, I could be wrong, maybe it IS just the
groupie types he dreads.  What do you think would happen if you saw him and
asked, 'Excuse me Mr. Peart, could I ask you a quick question about your
lyrics to Presto?'
It'll be interesting to hear what you all think about this subject.

Since nobody got my trivia question........ the question was, What song

	Just to add my 2 cents...  No we arent all techno-geeks,
staring at computers day and night!

	I graduated in World Arts & Cultures, music concentration.
'Bout as far from science as you can get.  As you may figure, I'm a
musician too.

	And ashamed though I am to admit it, I'm currently working
in real estate.  Also not very scientific! :-)

 I'm also female! (I guess there are more of us female folk now than
when the list first formed...)

<A NAME="104020">Subject: cancer rumors</A>

I've never heard the rumor about Neil having lung cancer.  I once had quite
a few people -- like about half of BITNET -- tell me that Geddy had throat
cancer.  Of course they also tried to tell me at the same time that 'Hold
Your Fire' was going to be their last album *ever*.  I think we all know
how that worked out...	And on the Yes mailing list, someone said they'd
heard a rumor that one of Yes's members (or maybe ABWH) had cancer.

Personally I think that all these cancer rumors are a load of crap.  I give
them about the same amount of credibility as I give whatever rumors the
tabloids have attached to the rest of the world's stars on a given week.
In other words, none at all.

If anyone has any *definite* information to the contrary, let me know.
Otherwise we can probably dismiss it, IMHO.
