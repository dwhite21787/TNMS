Hey Rushland,
	I have been talking to a few people after I recently posted on the
NMS about the DS version of 2112 being 21 minutes and 12 seconds.  Most
people have added the time of the separate sections and get something over
21:12.  However, if you take into account the amount of fade out applause
after the Grand Finale I believe the time of the actual song from
beginning to end on DS is 21:12!  Can someone with some patience and a
stopwatch confirm this?  One thing we need to agree on is when the song
actually endds before we can try this (I believe it is when Alex's guitar
stops after the final "we have assumed control"  Later- Brian

Fine Fine Fine.
I understand what yIIk means now.
I still believe that the shirt says fIIk because that tour is from a
Farewell to Kings so the shirt should be too. 
I do understand the yIIk things now so you can all stop biting my head
off for it.

PS. DS ROX. I have been reading the prices you guys got it for and I
guess I was ripped off. I payed 28 dollars at my local Record Town.
Geddy's bass solos rock. Who was that guy yelling in the back ground?
Are you on this list. This by far the best live CD by anyone yet.

as far as anyone around the age of 16 liking Rush, slim (why do people

the few Rush fans (age 16) in this area!!

i know it makes no sense whatsoever, but when i first looked at his
shirt, it looked to me as if it says "R  U  S  H" on the front on the
bottom.  this is particularly pointless for me to bring up since the
shirt says "R  U  S  H" at the top of the starman.  then again, the
geniuses that they are, they may be trying to throw us off the track,
maybe it's really the government, or it's a sign that elvis is going to

i don't know about anyone else, but i'm positive there is at least one
meaning to the tinkertoys, maybe dozens.  (no offense rush-mgr) i don't
like to believe it when someone "important" says something is false,
because you usually know they're hiding something.  simple example: id
software (makers of doom, doom 2, quake, etc.) says in it's quake manual
that (as in all of it's other games before) there are no cheat codes for
quake.  as any doom, wolf3d, quake, etc. player knows, that's pure BS.

Not if you've ever heard Alex or Neil sing.

Make it fun-ky! Sounds to me like Ged took a big hit off the
helium tank (less technical way of describing this effect). I
tried it at work today-sounded great. Everyone looked at
me like I was nuts (or added more proof to the fact)! What
a great version of CM.

Ohhh Chicagooo

All three jewel cases are done and look pretty damn good.
For disks one and two, the front cover is the same. Inside
the case for disc one is the cp stage shot, disk two is the t4e
stage shot. Disk three cover is the front Odean shot, inside
cover is the Odean stage shot (neil tosses stick in the air?).
The back cover for all three is the same, with tracklist for
each, the crowd/tinkerlith. Is it like a monolith or obelisk?
I kinda like tinkerlisk better than tinkerlith. I digress. The
side of the case, or binding if you will, is the same as the
factory one, only I added a yellow dot for disk one, a red
dot for two etc.. Gives them an identity on the rack up there.
Now I can keep the factory case in perfect condition for
occasional viewing.

>it never couldn't be February... the t-shirts just don't fit in
>there... brrrr....! Martin U.

You'll notice the pics of the boys, the kid and the resthome
"caregivers" are from 1998 (hairstyles, clothing etc.) and the
other "players" in the picture are from 1978 (same reasons).
The '78 players are in warmer clothing. Neil looks as if he's
possibly wearing a down vest.

The tickerlisk means nothing to me besides a symbol for the
Different Stages, the cds. Anybody who thinks Neil would
display any type of emotion towards his loved ones on the
cover of a Rush cd (for everyone to see) should really rethink
their positions.

First you tell me I gotta vote, then you tell me to send them into

I don't disagree with "costs more to produce this way", but the
higher cost would be attributed to materials and not assembly.
I believe you would find, if you were crazy enough, that if you
seperated all the seams of the DS tri-holder, you would have
one big biece of paper, very odd in shape. This is printed by
machine, the disks are dropped *onto* the paper, and then the
paper is folded and glued, again by machine, over the top of
the cd. The same is true with the 78 sleeve, and the booklet
beind the center panel.

Well, back to disc two, have fun everyone!

I've never posted before, but I am writing a persuasive essay about Rush 
for my history class (yes, I'm in high school, and yes, I am a girl.)  I 
was wondering if anyone knows of books containing entries on Rush or 
where I'd be likely to find a copy of the books on the TNMS website.  
I've found two sources already--The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Music 
and Encyclopedia of Rock Stars, but any help would be much appreciated!

hey all you crazy guitar players,
	if you're trying to trascribe alex's wicked guitar parts, i recommend
listening to the live version of the songs on DS rather than the studio
versions.  the way it's mixed makes the guitar parts for alot of the songs
much more clearer and easier to figure out 8c)!!!! Oh, and by the way, I
too agree that Lerxst is a MUCH better guitar player than Eddie Van Halen.

        Had a friend who tried to buy DS at the local Best Buy here in
Austin earlier this week.  They were sold out!!  Pretty amazing, considering
the stupid bastards at Best Buy didn't even put it out for display in the
New Release area, & just threw it in w/ all the other Rush. (But I guess I
shouldn't be too hard on them, as $16.99 for DS is probably the best deal
I'll be getting on a CD purchase for a loooooooong time...)  Also extra
amazing since DS has gotten zero, and I mean ZERO airplay here since the
fools at the local rock station (yes KLBJ, I'm talking about you!) decided
to become another dead-end classic-rock graveyard on us, but I digress...

        So I got to wondering if anyone has any word on how the album's sold
thus far?  At that price it must be selling like hotcakes.

Good point! However it cannot be a 1978 pic because the UK license plate
on the truck 'DYU 502V' is a 1980 registration ... sorry guys!

The UK still awaits.

Does anyone know whether any of the band are vegetarians? I've no desire to
preach my beliefs, especially since I know the band stand for liberty, freedom
of choice, etc. However, I used to love Metallica until it became apparent
that James Hetfield gets his rocks off by blowing away small animals and
supporting the NRA (with every magazine interview and album release I find
myself liking this band less and less, but I digress.) I don't want to find I
have a reason to lose respect for the best band in the World. They are all
intelligent people, and can't be ignorant of the horrors of factory farming,
especially Mr. (Books) Peart. Can they?

I can see this message pissing off a lot of ordinary meat-eaters who don't
consider themselves 'animal-abusers' - but hey, I only became a strict
vegetarian 18 months ago.

   [ Let's not get into a holy debate over eating habits PLEASE. AFAIK,
     Rush are not vegetarians (based on Neil's book, and what I've seen for
     their tour food requirements)                            : rush-mgr ]

Watney's Red Barrel wasn't one of them!  It was actually famously 
reviled in comedy sketches by Monty Python and Jasper Carrott - 
very weak, and a bit fizzy.

Funny you should say that but, following up on an earlier posting I made
about Geddy's 'Scottish' intro to Resist, I checked my video of the 2nd July
TFE show at Molson Ampitheatre and apart from the fact that Geddy mentions
Scotland, his intro to Resist on Different Stages is quite different and yet
it's supposed to be taken from the same show. 

The plot thickens...

 Which is right?

Hey, all,

Has anybody noticed on introduction on 'Xanadu' on Disk #3 that Alex is 
using a pitch shifter.  It sounds like it comes in at about 1:03 or 1:04 and 
stays on up until about 1:50 or so.  It's a little difficult to notice with 
all the other delay and reverb etc. bouncing all over the place.  But it 
sounds to me like it's set for a perfect 5th below the tone and is delayed 
about half of a second.  I didn't know they had such devices that far back.  
Anybody care to comment, refute, etc.

Buenos Nochas Mein Froinds!:

In a recent trip to cyberspace, I bumped into 
http://www.wallofsound.com/ . Last September 25, 1998, they made a 
contest named Wall of Sound's Top 100 Albums poll, but no Rush were on 
the voting list. What caught my attention was another category in the 
voting called "write-ins". This allowed participants to vote on albums 
that weren't in the default list of nominations.
Dirk, Lersxt & Pratt faired very well in the 70s write-in section, with 
2112 coming in at #4. In the 80's write-in section Moving Pictures, the 
band's second album in the eighties, did a little lower by placing at 
7th. The interesting thing of this is that 25000 people participated in 
the voting, which had to mean that a large number of these, are partial 
to the group, don't you think?.

Although I think you are ripping some of the songs apart alittle too much Ben,
I do have to agree with you on CTTH. I always found this to be a "classic"
part to this song,
it has never been the same since Neil got rid of his tubular bells. The
glockenspeil never really
did anything for this part of the song. I also agree that they need to fill
 that part with the bass pedal note. Otherwise the song rocks.

For the people that were talking about how Bravado is one of the best, or
one of the middle-rated Rush songs,
To Whoever said that Bravado was one of the formerly average Rush song until
different stages, I agree. I still love the song, as I do all Rush songs,
but that is just me.
To Whoever went off on him saying that Bravado was one of the best Rush
songs of all time, and that the guy that said that it was average just
didn't get it, settle down buddy. Everybody is entitled to their own
opinion. The other guy was simply making an innocent comment, not looking
for an arguement over "Rush song of the century." We all have favorite songs
obviously, and all of our favorite songs aren't nessesarily the same.
Besides, if everybody had exactly the same taste in music, Rush wouldn't
even exist probably due to lack of individualism. Why can't we all just get
along?

HERE HERE.....well said.   i have to agree with Dan. i don't think Hugh would 
be so callous as put Neil's tragedy out there on public display.  he has been 
a friend of the band for at least 24 years.  i'm sure he has the same respect 
for Neil and his wishes as Geddy and Alex.  and since all we get from them is 
a simple statement that RUSH is on hold and they're giving Neil space, we 
should expect nothing more from anyone in the RUSH camp.  the "Afterimage" 
quote and dedication is enough.

and acually Dan, the number 3 is on the Moving Pictures cover as well.

that's all folks

True for the recent Chinese-made Squiers, but the Japanese Squiers made
in the 1980s are awesome guitars - better than most US-made Fenders.

Hey Guys,

I can't believe the problems those in Europe are having getting DS. Here
on OZ I got it on release date (US) , however it did cost me $52.95.
*&(%(^& that's expensive, but worth it!

They asked my question on the Fancast under "mike_au98" ! It was the one
about being satisfied with their sound development. They also asked my
question (it sure sounded like mine) about the internet. I had a pretty
good feed, but a little jerky.

<A NAME="2145034">Subject: TNMS CONVENTION?</A>

I beame quite inspired this weekend upon my discovery of the Message Boards
and hearig the entire DS...cover to cover.

I've got this idea.......I wonder if this is something that could happen? It
occured to me while listening to the new CD and fooling around with
Clusterworks on my Sveeeeet Gateway G6-300 (with super sweet concert sound!),
and talking to some very entertaining people this weekend on the message
boards, I got this strong feeling that it would be an incredibly fun and
entertaining thing to do to have a TNMS Convention.

I envisioned lots of web site owners with booths, clothing vendors,
memorabilia/t-shirt vendors, tablature seminars...not virtual, but real chat
rooms...where we can all finally put a face with the name (if certain TNMS'ers
are present, we'll obviously have to have a Celebrity Deathmatch!)

Lots of .... refreshments .... 

I made a post about this on the General Rush Discussion TNMS Message Board and
just planted the idea.  But the more email I get about it, the cooler the idea
seems to morph into.

I've gotten some great suggestions:
1.	Get a major head count and $ contributions for people that are serious
about it;
2.	Reserve blocks in hotels/exhibition space/make sure that the area is at
least cool 	enough to go out & enjoy the nightlife.
3.	Hold it on a non-major-holiday weekend
4.	Hold it in an inexpensive spot
5.	Hold it in Toronto

The only problem I have with this scenario is that for me, I have severe time
limitations as to the amount of time I can devote to the actual planning.  I
work a demanding full time job, I do part-time medical transcription, and I go
to court reporting school Tues. & Thus. nights and all day Saturday.  To
remain on the dean's list (and to keep up my end of tuition reimbursement), it
takes me about 5 hours study time per week.  Not to mention housework, and all
of the lovely other things that accompany life's journey...need I say more?

I've gotten quite a number of posts back from a lot of people saying they'll
do what they can:  volunnteering their time, etc., work and life permitting.
They've all said, though, that they'd get the time off from school or work
(travelling hundreds of miles for a handful of them) or whatever it takes to
make sure that when the day comes, they were there.  They're all basing their
expectations on all that they've seen of TNMS.  The boards and the list.  And
I can tell you, most of the people that responded to me don't post very much
on TNMS.  There are no genuine assholes that post to this digest.  To each his
own..........Bytor-a-playing at the moment....DS no less.

If some kind soles would be willing to come together and organize this thing,
I can tell you right now, from the respones I got from personal emails is
phenomenal.  There's certainly no lack of interest.  Please believe me .. if
this were about seven years ago and I didn't have all of the responsibilities
I do now, I'd be taking this thing by the horns.  

One strong argument by a Female Rush Fan:  We could visit all the Rush places
like the Parliament Building (where the cover of Moving Pictures was
photographed)  and Danforth & Pape. (We have co-opted the Parliament Building!
It's Rush's now!) Practical cons: would it be a hassle for all the Americans
to cross the border? I don't know. 

ONE TNMS'er said:

I would think it would be really easy to have a convention; I've organized
camping festivals before of up to 200 people. Primary thing is communication:
get the word out, then get people registered and get at least a down payment
to cover the cost of the hotel rooms; work with a hotel to get a block of
rooms and guarantee a number of people attending. The best way to do it is as
a team, where reliable people are responsible for certain areas: bands,
website operators, trading, other merchants, registration, accounting,
whatever. 

I'm with the Emster, cuz I'm working PT but going to school full time. I'm
pretty strapped for time and I'd have to make special plans to get off from
school! So I'll just suggest things! 
 
Oops, one more thing: A suggested date: a year in advance gives lots of time
to plan, so how about December 1999?  

Let's Roll the Bones and see what happens!

Hello Fellow Rushians...

So much to do, so little time...

Hey, there have been some very entertaining posts...keep it up...

    O.K... so I told my Highman associates the best show was in Chicago. =
 They didn't want to hear it since I was there with my wife, but now =
there is vindication.  I was there in row D right in front of Ged.  It =
was awesome!  You can hear me screaming through out the show but =
specifically at the beginning before the first notes of Dreamline I got =
in a couple distinctive hoots.  I was yelling early since this was my =
8th show* and I already knew how awesome it was going to be.  The night =
was electric.  I'm sure Geddy couldn't help but see the Chicago Bulls =
locker room championship hat I had on right in his face.  One of my =
theories on why the show was so hot was Rush showing their musical =
talents are world champion worthy just like the Bulls were the night =
before.  As you may recall, the Bulls won game 6 and the NBA =
championship the night before.  Neil's drum solo that night was =
definitely the single greatest musical performance I have ever =
witnessed.  It was tight and was longer than any of the other ones I =
saw.  I was in utter disbelief when I saw it and to have it make the =
album is even more incredible.  I flew to the Chicago show cause it was =
on a Saturday and I wouldn't miss more work as I had already from the =
tour.  The whole trip was unbelievable.  We met Scottie Pippen and =
Rodman at the "Drink" on Friday night thanks to New York Highman Neil S. =
 My wife and I were the very first people that Pippen walked into inside =
the bar as he walked in through a side door and we both got to shake his =
hand, only about 2 hours after the game.   (I though that was going to =
make the trip in and of itself!  Little did I know at the time how =
insignificant this was compared to the Rush show)  Eddie Vedder was =
there too and did his patented jump of the balcony as did Rodman after =
he bare assed every one in the bar first.  (it was easy for him to get =
his pants down as he was still wearing his Bull uniform)  We also went =
to a Cubs game on Sunday, the day after the show.  (very anti-climatic =
compared to Friday & Saturday night, but still fun)
    As you can possibly imagine, this was one of the greatest single =
party weekends in mine and my wife's life.  My wife only saw the Chicago =
show on this tour, and she is a complete convert now (Thank you God!).  =
To have this show chronicled in DS is such a miracle for a Rush maniac =
like myself.  I have been getting more emotions i.e., goose bumps, =
laughing, crying, grinning in the last week listening to the album then =
I can remember.  Its so darn exciting!  Is this like the greatest deal =
ever for $20 bucks!?!   Who could (would) possibly pack in so much music =
for so dirt cheap!  We are all so lucky to have our favorite band =
cranking out such great music and not reaming us for it like so many =
other bands do. 

*Highman T4E shows:
Knickerbocker Arena, Albany, NY-Show #1   5th row center..Crowd was =
basically stunned..quote for the show..Geddy says "no     mistakes.... =
just new parts"  and "are you guys O.K.??"
The Shark Tank, San Jose, Ca  16th row  Great vantage point..could see =
the "laser beam star" perfect..good show
Shoreline Amphitheater, Mountain View, Ca  4th row center  Band seemed a =
bit subdued, still a great show
Echo Arena, Sacramento, Ca  5th row center  This show rocked!  I felt =
best of the Northern Cal shows
Thomas & Mack Center, Las Vegas, NV They were a little tired I thought =
but still a lot of fun.
The Rose Garden, Portland, Or  5th row Ged's side  My second favorite =
show, they we're really animated and having a good time.  Great sound.  =
Classic fountain outside for post show entertainment Oregon style.
The Gorge, George, WA.  I felt like this was Woodstock, Rush style.  =
Great camp out, great venue, lots of partying and fun.

back.  We will be there.   Rock on!
