Hey look, a whole week of consistent digests! Amazing! :-)
And something I forgot to mention yesterday...

The new "The Spirit Of Rush" issue that just came out has an ad in there for
the NMS (which I didn't do), and since they mentioned us just thought I'd
mention them. Great fanzine, if you saw them a few years ago and decided not
to pick it up because of quality, you really should see them now! Wonderful!

I was thinking that an all-instrumental album would be an interesting thing.
I'd like to see what they would come up with, since they'd have to do more to
make up for the loss of vocals.  Geddy would get a chance to concentrate more
on his bass/synth.  He's pretty damn good while singing, but i'm sure there's
always room for improvement.

It just wouldn't be the same though.  And it wouldn't make for that exciting
of a live show.

Fellow rushians..

       My first experience was in about 1984.  I was sleeping at a friends
house, in the morning (this happened every time I slept over) my friends
brother would ask if we wanted to hear Rush or The Good Rats. I always wanted
the good rats. Mike, (my friend) always wanted Rush. Well, Frank  (Mike's
Brother) ALWAYS played Moving pictures. now I understand why!!!  I was
hooked!!!!  My first album was obviously Moving pictures, then I remember
seeing the commercial on TV for Signals. The dog was sniffing the hydrant,
the the cap fell off and water poured out, while the water was coming out,
the  music from the album was playing...how many can remember that??? I think
the next was 2112, then all the rest from 1976 to the present. The first
concert I went to (Literally the first) was Hold Your Fire at Madison Square
Garden in 1987, I've been to every one since. I must add though, The Good
Rats, who live here in town are a good band. The only original members from
the band from 1984 is the lead singer. I used to see them every Tuesday night
at Faradays......BUT, NO ONE TOPS RUSH!!!!!!!

        Any other stories????                   Bill Laukaitis

OK, someone started a new thread last time about what you were doing the first
time you heard a new single off of Rush albums.
well, the only one that comes to mind for me is Dreamline.
Since i wasn't subscribing to this list way back then and i had been working
many many hours per week, i wasn't very up to date in record releases.
To put in bluntly,
I had no clue whatsoever there was a new Rush album coming out.

so I'm driving down the road in a state owned truck (from a prison actually :)
zooming down a country road, and the dj says, "Here's the new one from Rush"
and then Dreamline starts rocking.
hell, the statement about new Rush was enough to send me through the roof,
but when the song started, i about had a wreck.  To tell the truth, I should
have pulled over.  not kidding, i was pretty lucky to survive that drive.

thats what i was doing the first time i heard Dreamline.

<A NAME="1010005">Subject: Rush Limboo (Reprise)</A>

To all it may concern,

   It is indeed good to know that my post on naming one's child Rush garnered so
much of your attention.  In so calling Mr. Limboo a "fat ass liberal", my
reference was to the fact that he is of no loss for "LIBERAL" assertion of his
many narrow minded opinions.  Which of course is his constitutional right. (No
more no less).  And I, in dubbing him "fat ass", am refering to his obvious
liberal attention to "fork to mouth".  Which is my right . Said and done.  So
from this day foward, I, as I am sure many NMS readers, would love to hear from
you via personal e-mail. Instead of wasting MNS space with opinions unrelated to
a Canadian trio.  (Two of you did reply and it was great fun. Was it not?).
And I will no longerr waste this space for non music matters.  To all NMS
readers... no offence was intended by my comments, just to take the point a step
futher.  All posts from this address on matters of Un-Rush (Limboo,Rush that is)
topics will be sent directly to the originator. Justly letting this wonderful
medium return to what it does best... Keeping the Rush fan informed of all
things RUSH. (Rock and Roll RUSH, that is).

                       Thanks for listening,
                       See ya soon!

Hello all!

In response to Gary Barnette on Neil's interpretation of Apollo and Dionysus:
My handy "Cliffs Notes book of Mythology" does list Apollo as being (among
other things) the god of intelligence.  The same book says Dionysus "served
to liberate the emotions and to inspire men with joy."  I think these would
support the gods as written in Hemispheres.  Besides, Neil did not limit his
idea of Dionysus and Apollo to the strict Classical version, per se; he was
inspired by the book _Powers of Mind_ by Adam Smith.  Check it out!

On another topic: I noticed that the producer of "The Big Money" video is
Alan Weinrib.  Is this any relation to Geddy (aka Gary Lee Weinrib)?

    I can't believe this Gord,  I'm talking  to a lame-ass here man!
    I made it clear that I was one of those  people who got internet
    access free through my place of employment.  And I also though I
    made it clear that I was becoming sensitive to those  net  users
    who had to pay for lists like these. Jump in here anytime Laura!

    Here's the real question: How many "N.M.S." subscribers would be
    willing to pay for each issue of the star?  Jimmy can take a bow
    because some obviously were faced with the decision and  decided
    go through with it.

Hi guys, im new to the Midnight Star. Ive read the latest issues and wanted to
reply on the general request for stories of how you got hooked onto RUSH. Well
heres mine...
My roomate always listened to it but i, beiing a faithful follower to all thing
s rock/indie refused to listen. One day we set out early in the morning on a si
x hour road trip with only one tape between us, Roll the Bones. Needless to say
i was pissed and refused to listen, but finally was overruled. The tape progres
sed to the title track and i began to like it, but would not give my friend the
pleasure of knowing, so i kept the facade. Eventually my addiction got to the p
oint that i was stealing his tapes and listening to them in secrecy. Since then
ive gotten a real taste for the music and always crank the volume when RUSH com
es on the radio.
Just a side point, my favorite song is 'Cut to the Chase'. It has a certain hea
dbanging/moshing quality that taps into my primal side.

<A NAME="1010010">Subject: My path to Rush discovery</A>

Hi to all of you out there... here's a first-time posting from England about
my original Rush experience.

It happened when I was about 12 years old, my brother and I used to listen to
contemporary music - it was disapproved of in our house, my parents only
thought we should listen to classical music. Anyway, 'A Farewell to Kings' came
on the radio. That was like a 'tempter' for me, but my brother liked it more
than I did, and bought the album. I was hooked when I read the lyrics in the
gatefold! At that age, I couldn't believe a drummer could write lyrics like
that ;-) - or anybody, for that matter. Sheer poetry - especially 'Madrigal'.

Onwards and upwards, the years went by, and I collected a fair amount of stuff
up to ESL on cassette and vinyl. Then I got PoW on tape, and at about eighteen
and into my 'heavy rock' phase, I didn't like it. My Rush listening dropped
off. <sob>

I'm 26 now - about eight years down the road without much Rush listening. Got
a job, etc. I suddenly had this incredible urge to play 'Red Barchetta'. I did.
At the same time, I started giving a lift to work to a girl who had the musical
knowlege of a lump of wood. This lasted for about seven weeks, and as I
gradually ran out of tapes, trying to give her a whole new listening experience
( she liked Madonna ) PoW came to the top of the pile. And yes, you guessed it,
this time I loved it (loud cheers from the back of the audience). So I
subscribed to TNMS, and made a committment to catch up on those lost years,
and albums - only thing is, I've got to get everything on CD now... So I guess
the tracks that got me hooked are AFTK first time, and 'Red Barchetta' and
'Grand Designs' second time. So that's my story of Paradise found, lost and
rediscovered. There might be more postings if people don't roundly condemn me
for rambling about my youth - anyone else had a similar torturous path to
self-discovery?

My special thanks to everyone who took the time to
respond to the Golden Rule issue.  It's given me something
(else) to think about.  I feel that it helps when you know
what you're singing about as opposed to blindly singing
along w/Geddy while driving down the highway.  For the
benefit of mankind, I do this with the car windows up.  Rush
songs just seem to lose a little when a guy who sounds
like Lurch is singing along with them. Now if someone
could only explain what Siberian Katru (sp?) is all about :-)

Jon Anderson: What the hell is he talking about?

Hey Folks,

I've been reading the discussions on Kid Gloves and I think that some people
are overlooking an important fact.  Some have said the song is about " kids"
and smoeone even said that "kid gloves" are a reference to boxing gloves.
However, The AH Dictionary defines Kid Gloves as "n. 1. a. A glove made of
fine, soft leather, esp. kidskin {goatskin}. -idiom. with kid gloves. Tactfully
and cautiously."  I think the definition of Kid Gloves really adds meaning to
the song.  Hope this helps!

I just got caught up reading the last few back issues of the NMS and found a
real treasure, A Port Boy's Story, thanks NMS!!!  Needless to say I was
really liked the part about him living in the MARTINDALE area of St.
Catharines and skating on MARTINDALE Pond in Port Dalhousie.  Very cool given
my last name!  Now I have yet ANOTHER reason to really love the music and
lyrics of Rush.

Here's my contribution on the 3CD on a deserted island thread:

          2112 - My first Rush album - Discovery and the whole sience
                 fiction/fantasy theme really got to me in 1976 and I've
                 been hooked ever since (I was 11 years old then)

          The Wall - Pink Floyd

          Grand Illusion - Styx

Speaking of CDs I have finally completed converting my Rush collection from
vinyl to CD and have recently gotten into listing to GUP again.  I used to
listen to it all the time while I was at college and made it through many
long nights because of it.  I hadn't been listening to it for a while though
because it was one of the last Rush albums on vinyl that I upgraded to CD.  I
love the music especially the guitar by Alex on Kid Gloves, but its one of
the few albums that I couldn't draw a conclusion on some of Neil's lyrics.
What's the message in Red Sector A, Between the Weels and the other songs on
the CD?  Anyone care to comment with their opinion?

Later,
Paul

Well, it was like this.

A couple of new friends of mine asked me if I was into Rush and I said I'd
heard of them but not heard their music(a sad state of existence).  So I
was lent a copy of Power Windows(the latest album at the time).  Well, by the
time I'd listened to Manhatten Project, I was blown away.  So next time
I saw my two friends I said let me listen to all you've got.  So one Sunday
I started at Rush and listened to every album one after the other.  I've
been hooked ever since.

Of course living in England the chance to see them live doesn't come up
that often, especially when they decide not to tour an album here!!@@??
But when all's said and done it's always worth the wait.

Now though I have this, TNMS, which means I can keep up with all the news
and views even from here across the pond.  It's great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

'Till the next one

Hey.

   Actually, Kid Gloves refers to handling something very carefully.

>I'm more confused by "Anger wear a crown of thorns."

   This line always bugged me too.  The way I've always interpreted it was 
that anger was the reason that Christ ended up wearing a crown of thorns.  
And obviously Pilot was doing unto Christ something he probably wouldn't want 
done to him.  That kind of ties the two lines in question together.  For me 
at least...

In much of classical liturature Appolo is depicted as the god of reason, while 
Dyonesis is depicted as the god of pleasure.
Surely the Dyonesien cult was one that worshipped pleasure, not wine.
There were many era's of greek gods, and in many mythology texts they try to
compile them into one mythos, but actually the greeks had many mythos.
And many more cults.
When the dark ages hit Europe, most of the greek knowledge was lost.
The Europleans had to redicover the greek history from the books that the
Arabs had.  It was during this time the idea of two opposites (duality)
priciple influence came from the east.  That is how the two gods have come to
replresent the Hemishperes of man's actions: passion vs reason.

Hope this clears some things up.

Actually Neil uses the two gods correctly.  Apollo is the god of those
things but he takes on a greater role as the god of or (symbol of) the "I"
or the individual.  Dionysius or Bacchus is the god not only god of wine,
but of orgies and wild frenzied celebration.  This is the exact oppisite of
the "I" (He can be thought of as the god of "losing one's self in the
crowd").  In hemispheres Apollo is frequently represented by quiet
contemplative sections, while Dionysius is represented by loud screaming
sections.  It is the classic concept of the battle between the two halves
of a person.  The struggle to be an individual and think for oneself and
the need to "party" and lose oneself in the crowd in order to escape the
stress of dealing with the "I".  To be a healthy human being, we need a
proper balance of both.  Hence the end of the song has the two parts
unified into a single perfect sphere.  There are entire college classes
dedicate to the representation of Apollo and Dionysius in this eternal
conflict of man.  This can be also though of as the conflict between the
logical brain and the creative brain.

I'll never forget hearing the first snatch of Power Windows.  I was at
college, and some friends of mine and I were at a little basement cafe-
type room where they showed movies.  It was before the movie, place was
packed, it was NOISY, my friends and I were talking, and WAY in the
background they had a radio going.  Now I had no idea there was a new
Rush album coming out, and suddenly, through all the noise, I realized
I was hearing a new Rush song.  I could barely hear it, but my mind just
focused in on it and went "That's Rush!"  I fought my way through the
crowd to the radio -- it was the ride-out section of The Big Money, with
Neil's wild measure-hopping snare fills.  I went back and told my friends
there was a new Rush album out; they were skeptical that I could be so
sure, but they were amazed when the next day proved me right!

hello all. Im languishing in my recitation, where we are learning how
to get e-mail accounts(ooh-aah).

My first rush experience came in the basement of my then best
friend's basement room. He called me in there and said, "Listen to
this, dude." Manhattan Project came over the speakers of his crude
boombox, resonating the plastic with that wierd airplane noise at the
beginning. I was blown away almost instantly by Neil's storytelling,
the complexity of the drumming, and the layering of sound in that
song. (Keep in mind that I was listening primarily to "Slippery: When
Wet at the time) I immediately asked to hear it again, and soom after
borrowed PW to take home. This was just before HYF came out, and when
my friend found out it was out, hew immediately got it on tape(those
newfangled cds were still too expensive) and we listened for hours.
After exposure to that phase of Rush, it was very difficult to accept
Presto and the earlier stuff, but eventually I came to love all of
it, even I Think I'm Going Bald!

First song of a new album - that's an interesting topic, sort of a twist on
the usual threads in the NMS.  I'll try to list all the ones I remember:

Tom Sawyer:  I was working in a kitchen, scrubbing pots and pans.

New World Man:  Simply laying in bed, listening to the radio.

Distant Early Warning:  Heh - I got the tape before I heard anything on
the radio, so I heard it in my car.

The Big Money:  I can't remember, to be honest.  This came out my freshman
year in college, so I probably heard it while doing homework. :^)

Force Ten:  I was at an amusement park with a bunch of friends, drinking
beer out in the parking lot.  A few friends had already heard the song,
and told me "Hey, that's the new Rush song."

Dreamline:  I requested it at a local radio station, a few days before the
album came out, and heard it about 15 minutes later.

Stick It Out:  I was driving by Rockford, Illinois, on my way to see
friends for the weekend, and heard it on the radio.  I had heard the song
described, and knew it was Rush after the first held out guitar chord, even
though it sounded "non-Rush".

        Okay drummers, I need your professional opinions. I was doing some
close listening to CP last night and during track #2: 03:13-03:15, Neil makes
a bridge (hi-hat) to verse (ride cymbal) transition and lands back on the
hi-hat in (I think) beat #2 of the first measure of the verse. He does this
nowhere else in the song that I can remember. Could he have made an _error_
here and miscounted the bars in the bridge and (barely) caught it in time? If
he didn't it seems far too odd a place to just glance the hi-hat.

 This is a very common mistake that jillions of drummers make all the
time, so this might not seem like a big deal, but I have never heard even the
slightest musical (let alone rhythmical) blemish left in a Rush _studio_ album.
I think it's great. If someone has a bootleg, check to see if he does this live.

Craig Branham

PS. On the CP tour, did Neil begin his solo with an extract from "The Drum Also
Waltzes" or was that something he made up on his own? It was incredible watching
his play 4 over 3 in any case!

Let me say that I'm enjoying this discussion of "reverse the golden rule".  I
think that in the last issue, Gene and Matt had some really good ideas, 
especially Matt's concerning the dichotomy between "anger wear a crown of 
thorns" and the above phrase.  Additionally, Gregg I could be way off base 
here but I don't think Neil was talking about boxing in 'Kid Gloves'.  I 
believe that the term 'kid gloves' is a colloquialism (sp????) which means to 
handle gently.  Please, some one either tell me I'm an idiot or elaborate on 
this.  Kudos to the rush mgr. for providing a reference for 'crown of thorns' 
other than the obvious.

Jason was asking about Rush at small outdoor venues.  Here is my $.02.  I'm
not sure what you consider small for outdoors, I would say under 20,000 is
small, in which case I experienced Rush at Merriweather Post Pavillion in
Columbia, MD for the RTB tour (My first Rush concert, an utter tradgedy that I
haven't seen them before that).  There were probably about 20,000 people
there, the sound was outstanding, much better than when I saw them at U.S. Air
Arena (Capitol Center) for CP.  Every indoor show I have been to, the sound
never quite makes it to the level of quality of the outdoor shows, and I would
prefer to see the boyz outside.

For my hero of the week EMILY, "Three Cheers and a Tiger for You" for giving
your radio station manager hell, what Fascist state did he crawl out from
under???  I could not even fathom such garbage, especially from a college
station?????

Craig, the first time I heard both 'Dreamline' and 'Stick it out' I was
driving in the car...surprise!   I immediatly made plans to get to the music
store there after.

Mike, my first Rush experience came at the hands of my cousins.  I was about
10 at the time and we were 'jamming' at their house.  They had a drum set and
electric guitar, and we would *crudely* play some songs, and listen to other
music.  A favorite of my drummer cousin was Rush, and I became interested in
them as well.  I bought MP when I got the tape deck for my car and listened
exclusively to it through 8 months of driving (beleive it or not I still have
that tape and it still sounds the same as when I bought it).

Rushers

 Now I have time to write and tell you some news from Brasil.

 - Last week we had a big Rush party where we initiate officially the
newest Rush club, it's name is "Red Sector A Club". There was almost 500 people
in the party and we also had a Rush Cover Band show. The guys are really good.
If someone want to watch them, just e-mail me couse we have the entire show on
VHS. They played : Chemistry, Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, Freewill, Animate,
YYZ ( with drum solo !!), Time Stand Still, Subdivisions, Limelight, CTTH,
The mood, Turn the Page, DEW ... Great show, and for us, the only way to go to
a "Rush show" !!
 - A radio station played almost entire Northern Heros in a special
program about Rush.
 - They also played another boot called Closer to our heart, that is
a single CD with a show from Madison Square Garden. This one is much better
than Northern Heros. Meg, you want some informations about CTOH just e-mail me.

That's enough for today

Naming your pet after Rush.  My brother Glen, who is a card carrying TNMSer,
had a doberman pincher named ByTor. One of Glen's friends had ByTor's sibling,
you guessed it, his name was Snow Dog! Is that cool or what? The names were
shortened to Bitey (very appropriate for a dobey!) and Snow. Also, these dogs
were AKC registered, so somewhere in the records of The American Kennel Club
there exists the names By Tor and The Snow Dog!

Hi yall.

I must admit this question about "reversing the golden rule" was a good one.
I didnt realize there could be so many ways to look at it.  When I first read
the question, I assumed reversing the golden rule would work something like:

G Rule:       Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Rev G Rule:   Do unto yourself as others would have you do unto them.

Kinda goes along with the selfish idea expressed in other songs ("it was for 
me not you that I came to write this song...").

Just a thought.  I think I might get a list of all of these reversals tho.  Any 
more?

 I agree.  I think that's what kind of turned me off to Counterparts.
I noticed somewhat of a trend on other earlier RUSH albums:  it seemed that
many attempts at 'love songs' were written by Geddy (sometimes along with
Alex).  I'm thinking in particular of "Different Strings" and "Entre Nous"
from the Permanent Waves album.  To me, those songs are just somehow a lot
weaker than the ones Neil writes (in terms of lyrical content).
 When it came to Counterparts, a lot of the songs just reminded me of
the ones from PeW.  To me, it just sounds wrong for RUSH to be writing love
songs.  It seems like a waste of the power trio's talent to be writing stuff
like that.

 And just in case anyone is wondering, my favorite RUSH album is Hold
Your Fire.  (A Show of Hands is a close second.)

1) NEIL PEART - TO DISCUSS THE DEEP MEANINGS OF RUSH LYRICS
2) OZZY OSBOURNE - TO SUPPLY THE ENTRE OF SAUTED BAT
3) STEVEN TYLER - TO GRACE US WITH HIS WISDOM & TO EAT THE
                  RICH.

DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY RUSH WAS NOT ON THE GUEST LIST AT
WOODSTOCK? I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVITED. IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN KEEN.

WITH REGARDS TO THE PAST ISSUE OF "DO UNTO OTHERS AS THEY
DO TO YOU", WHY IS EVERYONE MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL OF THIS?
  WHAT'S UP WITH DAT?  FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO TOO MUCH TIME
ON THEIR HANDS, GO FOR IT, PLEASE ELABORATE ON THIS. BE MY
GUEST.

SORRY RUSH MANAGER IF IT SEEMS LIKE I'M SHOUTING!

   [ Actually yes, it does. You should use mixed case (upper and lower) if at
     all possible... it makes it much easier to read.  : rush-mgr ]

THANKS FOR LISTENING TO ME.
SEE YA!
MIKE
