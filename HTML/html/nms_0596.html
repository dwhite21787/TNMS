Greetings-

I am looking for any and all transcribed Rush bass lines.  So far, I
have one book with about ten songs (mostly from Signals and Moving
Pictures).  However, there are two problems with buying books,   First,
they cost about 15 dollars each.  Second, from what I can tell some they
aren't easily located.

I would be willing to share the songs in my book.  Additionally, I would
be more than happy to pay for any and all copying and shipping expenses.

Email me if interested.

Hello All,
Now that I am back at school and reading all the NMSs from the last
month, I see there are many new topics.  Here is some input from me...

#1...I hope that nobody thought that, in my last post, I was inferring
that someone like Yngwie Malmsteen is a more talented musician than
Alex, actually I meant the opposite.

#2...Punani wanted suggestions on how to get Rush to go to Hawaii.  I
suggest a hunger strike.

#3...The comment by rush-mgr to 'let us in on the new producer since we
all know anyway' led me to speculate a bit.  The hubbub over the new
producer, since some people already know who it is, makes me think that
it is a producer Rush has used in the past.  I would guess that it is
either Terry Brown, who produced most of the albums up to Signals, or
else Peter Collins, who produced PoW and HYF, both superb albums IMO.
Am I right?  If so, a cookie is in order.

Good night everyone.

Gerry Good

Hey Oliver,

cool tidbit about seeing Howard U.. I was always used to seeing his
name in the liner notes till lately. I think it is excellent that he
is working with Queensryche. I enjoy them alot as well. In fact, it
is not so strange, as Peter Collins and James "Jimbo" Barton produced
the last two Q-Ryche albums after producing and engineering HYF.
The fellows from Q-ryche always talk about Rush as being a large
influence on them, also saying how they enjoy to warm up playing a
few Rush songs.

Enjoy - and welcome back to the hell of school!

I know this isn't approved TNMS material, so I'll be brief:
            Does anybody have an ESL video that I could copy?  I'd pay for the
tape and the postage, of course.  E-mail me if so.  Thanks/Sorry!!!

Any of you Pittsburgh people know if Buhl Planetarium still does the
Laserush show occasionally?  That one and Laserock Gold were pretty good.

Hi all,

I was listening to the radio last Friday or Saturday night, and Sabastion
Bach of Skid Row was being interviewed.  During the interview he mentioned
Rush a couple of times (he is obviously a fan!).  He told a story of going
to Ronnie Hawkins' farm, where Hawkins' asked him if he had heard of a group
called Rush.  Sabastion said that he may have heard something about that
group (with sarcasim).  Hawkins then told him that the drums for Tom Sawyer
were recorded in a barn on his farm.  Sabastion then exclaimed something to
the effect of "So that's where the most amazing drum sound on the planet
was recorded!'.

I though this was odd, because I assumed the drums were recorded at La
Studio with the rest of the band, like in the TS video.  Anybody have any
information on this?  I guess that they may have simply recorded the video
at La Studio.  There would be little point in either Ronnie Hawkins or
Sabastion Bach lying about this.

I was just wondering if anyone had, or planned to, put the Roll the
Bones tourbook on syrinx (in the 'special' directory). I never got
a chance to look at that tourbook so I don't even know if there is
any written information in it or not.
If someone has a typed up version of it let me know. I suppose most
people probably just bought it.

  [ The majority of it *is* on syrinx, in the rush/special directory called
    "row.the.boats.Z" -- all it's missing are the notes from each of the band
     members, otherwise it's the same as the tourbook.		   : rush-mgr ]

Thanks.

As I recall, the FAQ stated that, as of May 1992, the album (Roll
the Bones) had gone gold. From what I understand now..it's
platinum. At least that is what I read in Billboard Magazine (in
the end of the year issue for '92, Atlantic took one page to
congratulate all their artists - those who went gold, platinum,
double, etc. and they had Roll the Bones listed as Platinum).

Jello --

(Ugh, I start school again today...sigh.  Haven't these people
ever heard of a VACATION???!!!  anyone else starting today??? :-)

About them shirts -- I discussed with Meg about a month ago the
sizes since an XL would be a dress on me :-) and I decided to hold
out for the L's.  I don't want to go over anyone's heads, but it
might be a good idea, for those who don't want XL's, to wait for the
smaller sizes -- but please talk to Meg about it first -- don't just
take my word for it! :-)

Just wanted to confirm what our rush-mgr mentioned before (!)  :-)

Happy shirting! (????????)...

A JPEG viewer for DOS is available by ftp-ing to:  sseop.jsc.nasa.gov.  I
believe it is in the root directory and the filename is DVPEG1l.EXE.  The
file is compressed but will automatically decompress the first time you
try to run it.  After the file decompresses, simply type DVPEG or DVPEG286
if you are running it on a 286.  When you execute the program, a list of
files in the current directory will be shown.  Assuming your image files
are in the same directory as the viewer, simply arrow down to the file you
wish to display, and hit enter.  A parameter menu will pop up and allow
you to change various items (fairly self explanatory), you may change the
parameter values by typing the Capitalized letter in the menu.  Hit return
again and you image is displayed  (quite good on my mono VGA monitor).
Hit F1 for help.
Also available at this ftp site are mega space shuttle photos.  See
README.TXT, STS45IMAGES.TXT, and ABOUTIMAGE.WORD for more info on
available images and the JPG viewer.

!!WARNING!!  THIS FTP SITE IS VAX/VMS.  I ENCOUNTERED SOME PROBLEMS IN
DOWNLOADING TO UNIX.  IN PARTICULAR, UNIX HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE VMS
VERSION NUMBERS APPENDED TO THE SITES FILENAMES.  TRY DOWNLOADING TO A
LOCAL FILENAME (e.g. if you want DVPEG1l.EXE;9, download it to DVPEG1l.EXE).

ALSO, THE FILE NAME IS DVPEG1l.EXE THAT'S 'ONE-LOWER CASE L' AT THE END,
NOT 'ONE-ONE'

e-mail to gazaway@u.washington.edu if you have any problems.

Well I've been getting some great ideas for the NMS cd here! So many that
perhaps it should be a double cd? :) But I need to know if *anyone* has
the 1/23/88 show -- I heard Neil's drumset collapses, and I want to see
if this is the show with the 'dead drums jam', although I had heard the
mics just went out for that. I'm not asking for a copy or anything, just need
some info on the show itself.

Also, if you have any cool concert photos you (or a friend) has taken and
wouldn't mind sending them to me for the cd booklet, please drop me a line.

For the Rush CD boot list I still need help on filling in a bunch of stuff
(esp. if you have "Atmospheric", "A New Reality", "Bravado", "Kaleidoscopic
Harmonies") most importantly the length of the CDs. I need times and track
numbers!

And since I'm rambling here, just an interesting fact that has no meaning
whatsoever: Those GK amps/speakers/whatever that Alex used, at least in the
later part of the tour, are made by my second cousin (the K stands for Kruger,
which is him -- don't remember the G person).
So do you suppose he met Alex? :)

meg@syrinx.umd.edu  <-- mail here for NMS shirt info/Rush CD boot list/boot
                             mail order list (please tell me *which* list!)

ps. We're going to mail out another 12 shirts later tonight (and almost be
    caught up!) so if you're waiting for them, expect them by Monday.

Errr... Hello? I'm a first-time-caller, so please be gentle.
So which of you rushians knows all about bootlegs then? 'Cos over here in
Middlesex Uni, London I have a few which I'd like identified. I've got
Rush's Pink Pop Festival (on tape, from Radio1 FM quality) plus a show recorded
on the 23rd May 1983 @ Wembley (or that's what it says on the label) with lots
of Power-Windows songs. (PoW tour? Name? Quality? Info?)
The tape I have (according to the woman in the shop) is a master copy,
(Which is actually, a believable story) I'm soooo puzzled by it though...
Its got SOR,Tom,Freewill,DigitalM,Subdiv,VitalSig,TCE,Closer,Analog and Trees.
My >pride and joy< is a CD bootleg on X-rekords entitled "Red Stars of the
Solar Federation" and is the best quality I have ever heard. I believe it
to be mastered from a pukka RUSH tape, about the time of ESL. It says "Recorded
@ Montreal Forum Canada,
by the Alternative Mobile with assistance from the Doll Mobile" Kinda Kool..:-)
I wonder if anybod could throw light on this and any of the others ??
(info about Pink Pop etc...)
ALSO! Calling British RUSHIANS! (Hello Mr1cy1) Where do YOU buy your Boots??
