The local album rock/heavy metal station, KLOL, plays quite a bit of Rush
here.  They hold a 'superbowl of rock' on superbowl weekend, a call in
popularity contest.  Last year Rush was first.  This year they were
second, just behind Led Zeppelin (Pink Floyd and AC/DC were 3rd and
4th).  It was a great weekend for crusing in the car since they were
playing blocks of Rush constantly for the 'final playoffs'.

   In my opinion, Voivod is the best kept secret in metal. I bought their
Nothingface tape and it is excellent! Very avante garde and interesting,
although the singer kinda irritates me. That would be great if Geddy
produced their new album! I'll be anxiously awaiting both it and the
new Rush offering.

I'm sure that there will be TENS of replies to today's final posting in NMS#160,but here's mine:

I noticed NO problem with the sound quality of the Video Compilation.  However,
I have to admit that I wasn't paying much attention at the time.  I was paying
considerably more attention to the videos themselves, some of which I had never
seen: The Trees, Closer To The Heart, or Limelight.  I was quite impressed, and
I liked the selections that were made, which showed the band's evolution, if
only the 'look' of the band as a whole (or something to that effect).

So, Steven E Green, my personal conclusion is that you have a defective copy of
the video.  Of course, as I stated above, I wasn't paying much attention to the
sound quality, so I could be mistaken.  Sorry, man!

Anyway, since this is my first posting since X-mas, I'd like to wish everyone
out there a Happy New Year, especially those people who have recently joined.
I hope that you find this Digest as informative as I have.  A simple hint --
if you don't find a topic interesting, don't read it (as others will recall,
there was quite a heated debate over this point, and we ought to try to keep
it from happening again), and if you do, reply!  We welcome your comments!

Bye for now, fellow RUSHers!

i got the album too. i think its great, its really refreshing to hear Alex
PLAY guitar w/ other bands. the rumour about Ged doing work w/ Voivod.
its definitely true to the best of my knowledge. a friend of mine in town
actually is friends w/ the band. i'll have to ask him for specifics tho.

On first listen of these songs I thought the same as you.
But then I realized that this was an indictment of *big* money,
not money itself.  The difference being
that, and this relates to your second comment, Rand held that Big Business
and Industry manipulted Government into coercing other individuals.

Much of big business is crooked.  It is critical to understand that these
businesses which use government to their own coercive ends are NOT
Capitalistic (Rand's definition).  There are also big businesses that are
persecuted by OTHER big businesses.  (all this according to Rand.  No need
to argue actual fact -- just Rand's interpretation.)

I think Rush was reflecting many of the negative interpretations of the
'80s.  Yet it is also important that the '80s was NOT a model of
Capitalism.  (Hellishly far from it, I might add.)  Thus, an indictment of
the '80s is not an indictment of Capitalism, or contrary to Rand's
philosohpy.

<A NAME="161008">Subject: Neil Peart as a Metaphysical Poet (?)</A>
Date: Mon, 28 Jan 91 17:41:38 CST

In my English class the other day we were talking about the Metaphysical
Poets, especially John Donne. I noticed some similarities between Donne's
writing and Neil's. Anyone care to comment on the following?

It seemed like Metaphysical Poetry was characterized by unusual analogies,
pseudo-scientific parts, and wit. First off, unusual analogies and
comparisons. Two off of the tip of my head: It's so hard to stay together,
Passing through revolving doors. (Relationships progressing like walking
though revolving doors?:-). Things crawl in the darkness, That imagination
spins. (Interesting, imagination spinning darkness.)

Secondly, and I think most obvious, pseudo-scientific bits. (I say pseudo-
because the Professor isn't primarily a scientist. Ignore it if you want.)
Examples: "Chain Lightning", "Entre Nous".

"Entre Nous" reminds me a LOT of Donne. The bit about "we are planets to
eachother..." is quite similar to Donne's writing.

Lastly, wit. By that, I mean small things like the reversal of word order
in "Kid Gloves" - That it's tough to be so cool vs That it's cool to be so
tough.

Anyway, this has been a pretty disjointed argument, but maybe someone would
like to comment on it.

	Hello everybody.  I found out that the other song on the King Biscuit
was "Witch Hunt," thanks to someone's signature file.  I'm still looking for
the other song the band plays with "Finding My Way."  

[ Drop some lyrics - this bunch will name it in 5 words or less!  :rush-mgr ]

                                                      Also, I think my
Chronicles tapes are defective.  There is a short blank spot in the intro to
"New World Man."  Has anyone else noticed this on their tapes?  If it is just
mine, is there a way to get a replacement, (like some have done with the
Moving Pictures CD??

You can perhaps imagine MY surprise in finding that this address is about
5 minutes from where I live, in West Caldwell.  If this is some sort of
permanent location, I was never aware of it, because I have driven by many
and have never seen any big signs about modern drummer.  Oh well.

And, in regard to various radio stations' top whatever lists, here's some
results from 102.7's (WNEW, New York) latest top 500:

 34: Tom Sawyer
219: Limelight

424: Closer to the Heart

(I was also happy to find that a Genesis song [Follow You Follow Me] had made
it as high as #37.   :)

I had heard a while ago that Rush got their name from a drug.  Gimme a big

I remember someone asked about the messages on some of the RUSH albums that said
'Brought to you by R' or some other letter.  Well I've found out what they mean.
Strange as it may sound (oops I'm talking about RUSH; how strange can it be.)
I was baby sitting my nephew who is 16 months old and we were watching Sesame
Street, and at the end of the show they would say what the premire letters of
that show were by saying 'This episode has been brought to you by the letter W'
I started laughing and rolling on the ground saying "That's It!!" Needless to
say my nephew thinks I was going nuts.

Once again the boyz have managed to turn something from strange to stranger!

Good day, eh?

     To answer Burnett, YES, anybody else out here has "Lost Brotherhood"
by Gowan.  I bought it the week it came out (sometime in september I think).
Alex's guitar playing is excellent, supporting an overall sound rather than
standing out per se.  Not only is Alex on there, TONY LEVIN of King Crimson
and PeterGabriel's band plays bass/stick on the album.  It's also worth
mentioning Jerry Marotta (also with Gabriel's band) plays drums on the
album.  This album attempts to raise the intelligence ( and artistic)
level of pop-music--it's a beauty!
