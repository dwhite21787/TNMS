rushians,

I'd like to have some more information about 'the feaR' trilogy. i recently
read some information about it, but i don't remember. So, i want to know
what this 'fear' really means.

All Rush fans must read this post too! (Hey, if you must read the
other one, and it has all those stars drawing attention to it, you
ought to have to read mine too. I wonder why you'd get TMNS if you
didn't want to read the posts, but I guess that's one of those things
we'll never know.)

Why not eliminate the middle man and just trade boots with someone?
No middle man really needs to be involved here at all. It looks to me
like the middle men get all these high quality audio tapes. And your
tapes get to be one generation more from the source. Direct trades
would certainly cut down your own personal overhead expenses.

For example, was an actual experience that happened a month or two
ago: I have a 1987 bootleg of a Hold Your Fire show. This other guy
had an early 80s show. We swapped tapes. It worked!

All you have to do to get me to trade is dangle a live Yes recording
of Perpetual Change in front of my face... there are a *lot* of people
on the net who'd be willing to trade at the drop of a hat.

|Also, about the song Freewill:

|the lyrics in the CD booklet say: "If you choose not to decide you
|<cannot> have made a choice"

|and Geddy sings "If you choose not to decide you <still> have made
|a choice"

|Other thoughts?

I noticed that too! Other than that line, I can't make out a word
Geddy is singing, and needed to consult the lyrics -- and they're not
even what's on the album :)

Why? My theory -- theory, I said -- is that it's one of those songs
that had a lot of different versions, and they couldn't decide which
set of lyrics to use until *after* lyrics went off to the album cover
maker. The one on the album was changed after the point of no return.

Has Rush ever addressed this?

First of all I like to say for those who sent their money into
slythex and keeping word on going to toronto I give you guys/gals a
big thanx...

but for those who said "yeah, I'll deffinitly go" then backed out on
slythex was pretty rude.. considering how much time the guy put into
organization of this gathering I think IMHO you all should
apologize...

it would have been nice to meet you all, but i guess thats the way
the big wheel spins...

so if I get flammed, please do so, i really don'
t and i'll stick up for my friends who make a honest attempt on
bringing people together who share much with the band Rush... going
thru all that hell to organize an event....

think about it people....

<A NAME="679308">From: "The Wombat" <mfrazer@skidmore.EDU></A>

Hey guys, I mean, those of you who complain aboutr black holes, and
then have a 12 line sig containing only one word in big ol' ascii
picture format, cut it out.
Well, actually this is not why I'm writing, and yes, I know my sig is
a little longish...
Starting to get my Rush...
OK in 1991-92 school year I was a freshman at Skidmore College, and I
met this guy second day of orientation. we discovered that we had the
police between us, the band that is, now I'm a bit of a musician, I
sang alot, but he had been onb the drum kit since he was 3, he also
played the Bass (Black Rickenbaker if thats how to spell it) etc... so
eventuaally I moved in wirth this guy since we had gotten to be pals
over the semester and my roomie beat girls while I was in the room,
and the roomie was an ass to boot.
So Jon (The Guy) and I move in, hge tried to interest me in Rush, but
it wasn't working, so he let it rest, altrough I got another earful
after he returned from the RTB show in albany.
So anyways, Jon and I were pals, and something stuck with me over the
summer, that damn bass line from Roll the Bones, sometimes I couldn't
shake it.
Like most fools I got into the grunge stuff with Pearl Jam, quite a
contrast to the Sting Police U2 life I had been living, Achtung Baby
contributed to my digression from U2 the band that had gotten 90% of
my stereo time b4
So come september I hooked up with Jon again, I got hooke first on
King Crimson (The Red LP) and then on the earlier Crimson, then, I
borrowed Chronicles mainly for my radio show, and Subdivisions I fell
in love with, gradually I tuned into the likes of Lakeside Park and
Fly By night, and now, you can't get Rush off my stereo too easily. In
fadct the voices that once called into the radio show to say hey man,
what is that stuff it's kinda cool have become hey man all you ever
play is rush and king crimson.
I try now to put a little more in the show, but if anyone gives me
hell I just say, hey, it's a public station, get yer own show if you
don't like it.
Rush is some of the best damn driving music arouond.
Favorite stuff is on p/g HYF and RTB as well as FBN CoSteel
Have I bored you sufficiently, are the typos a pain? well you try to
correct on a 1200 baud line :>

<A NAME="679009">Subject: MuchMusic Coverage of Lampoon Ceremony</A>

Greetings all. Though it's old news that the Harvard Lampoon has named
Rush "Band of the Millennium," I thought some NMS readers might be
interested in hearing about the attention that MuchMusic, Canada's MTV,
gave to the award ceremony. Today's installment of "Fax," an entertainment
news show, had a story on the event.

The story showed footage of the band receiving their award--three pizzas.
It also showed clips of the fictional Mark Twain ("I'd like to thank you
boys for putting me on the map") and a bizarre, droning version of "Tom
Sawyer" as sung by the Male Choir of Our Father Augustus. All three
members seemed amused, though Neil a bit less so. By the way, I was a bit
taken aback by his goatee and moustache. He looks a bit Satanic. Also, Alex
seems to have put on a little weight.

The best part of the story, IMHO, was Alex's brief but very funny speech
to the Lampoon crowd. "College kids," he chuckled. "What do you know about
life? What do you know about lying in a hotel room, ordering room service?
Getting in a limo, sitting around, not being responsible for yourself,
having someone do your laundry...?" Alex also mocked the students's
attempt to party with the band. "I thought they could drink," he snorted;
"Hmmph. Big Al could show 'em a few things." In short, the band seemed
very tongue-in-cheek about the whole thing--appropriately so, considering
who gave them the award.

Now, if we could only get those people at the Junos to lighten up a bit...

As I was typing up a final paper for my socioology class today, listening to
Over the Europe on my Discman, I noticed a cool little thing, and just had to
post it.  At the very end of "Where's my Thing," from 5:26 to 5:28, there is
a voice (possibly Geddy or Alex, or maybe digitzed) from Monty Python that
yells out "No one expects the Spanish Inquisition!"  Kind o' cool.  Python
and Rush:  two great tastes that taste great together.

Oh, this is good.  I can see the flames now from those who feel that we
shouldn't worship Rush and kiss the ground they walk on.

I'm a "fly-by-night" bass player (pun intended) whose main instrument is
guitar and don't find "Marathon" to be that difficult.  It's all in the
technique of playing those 16th notes properly (try letting your fingers
swing out a bit before coming down to hit the strings.  This helps for now
but I would stop using this as soon as you can, since it develops bad
habits).

firstly i'd like to know if anyone else out there has a copy of
Visions which spells Neil Peart's name as Neal, i have one which
has this mistake and i think it's pretty sad that they should get
the name of one of the band members the book is about wrong.This
error is on the back cover (below the photograph's),however i
have seen others with the name spelt right (on the back) the main
text itself does have the proper spelling.
       About the box set idea i think this would be a great idea
as Chronicles is crap- i did'nt buy it there was'nt any
point.Something i'd really like to see on any potential boxset
would be the entire Cygnus X-1 concept live as it would sound
amazing.Unfortunately i don't think there are many unreleased
studio cuts so maybe they could include a future album as part of
such a package?.
      Now just a couple of non Rush things, has anyone heard
about a new Yes album coming out some time in May, and did Neil
Young just play acoustic stuff on his last tour or did he play
some electric Crazy Horse material as well, he's coming to
Ireland,i just hope he brings Crazy Horse with him(not that his
acoustic stuff is bad!).Email me direct if you know about these
last 2 things.
     Finally about black holes..... well maybe not.

<A NAME="679013">Subject: Stray "beep" in The Pass</A>
Date: Wed, 12 May 93 10:58:58 PDT

In the last issue, Jamie W. Sandford notes:

> Instead, the noise (after more CAREFUL listening -- it does help to
> listen to the song before you open your mouth! :) ) is acutally between
> "Static on your frequency/Electrical storm in your veins." and the next line

I don't normally spend time dealing with such trivia (a resounding
chorus of "get a life" is heard), but by wild coincidence, I happen
to have the CD near the diskman, and have lost much of the will to work.
That seems to happen a lot... hm...

Anyway.  Assuming there is no "beep" or "click" on just _your_ disk, due to
a bit of dust on the CD, then you're probably talking about the following:
There _is_ a non-musical sound between "Electrical storm in your veins." and
"Raging at unreachable glory".  At 00:41 into the track, just past the
downbeat of 4 (for all you musicians), there is a sound which is
something like what you'd get if you tensioned a spring, then run your
hand quickly across it.  The same sound appears earlier in the track,
at about 00:03.5, also about beat 4.

This also the sound you'd get if you were playing electric bass (which
has several thick, wire-wound strings), had your hand on the strings to
keep them silent, then quickly lifted your hand, brushing one or more
of the strings.

Given what's going on in the song at that point, I'd bet this where it's
coming from.

 Did Rush really make CNN news? I thought I'd read that in the last issue, but
 I wasn't sure.

 I agree with all that's been said about the song Presto lately. I think it's
 one of Peart's pseudo love songs. It's also my favorite. :)

 I also think that Red Lenses and Anagram (for Mongo) are excellent word plays.
 I am an English major, so I ecpecially appreciate this aspect of Peart's
 lyrics.

 Later all... Good luck to all those who are stck on the quarter system and
 still have finals to look forward to. (like me)

Hello fellow Rush fans!!  This is my first post so please be patient. ;)
I don't know if I am the only one out there, but to me, COS is the _best_
album to listen to if you are driving alone at night (especially if it is
raining)...  It is a wonderful, dark album that carries your spirit up
(Lakeside Park) and back down (Necromancer).  The emotional aspects of the
music make the drive worth it, and besides, it really is a great album
(even when not driving..)  Highly underrated....

I also wanted to commment on the "breaking in period" for starting to like
Rush.  I personally took two years before I really started to like them.
I only liked Tom Sawyer and Red Barchetta (my all-time fave!!) and thought
that the rest was trash (sorry).  But, much like fine wine, I aged and
matured, and the lyrics started to reach me.  I must say that I grew up on
Rush, and they helped to shape my view on life.  I personally am writing
them, not to tell them that they are great (they know that!), but to help
a young, borderline boy become an intelligent, cultured man.  We should
all thank them for thier contributions to our lives.  Thanks guys...
