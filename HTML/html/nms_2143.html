I enjoyed the Clusterworks program, but have one problem: why do you have to
have the Rush disk in the drive to use it?  When I try to launch it w/o the
disk in, it says "this program will only work with one of the CDs from the
Rush "Different Stages" Anthology installed in you CD-ROM drive."  

This really blows?  Is there another way to install the software so the disk
isn't needed.  I'd like to use it as a screensaver but I sure as hell am not
going to take the disk out of my stereo!

<A NAME="2143003">Subject: DS packaging costs (a new take on the subject)</A>

I know this has about been beaten to death, but I have a few comments on the
Different Stages packaging.  Although I am not in the music biz, I am in the
graphic arts biz.  The bottom line is that whatever is mass produced is
typically automated and therefore cheapest (i.e. plastic jewel cases), so I
don't think Rush payed less for the Different Stages pageing.  On the
contrary, it may have cost more as it is certainly less automated to produce
than a standard jewelcase printed brochure (I like to see a machine that can
insert a cd into the package as found in DS).

The Hammersmith disk may be loose because it may be a limited pressing, which
is easily accomplished package-wise through a simple change in the film of the
next printing of the cover.  In fact they may have already been printed.

Personally, I love the look and feel of the paper cases, similar to the album
covers of old (but they do get a little banged up).  I have a few paper cases,
Sting's "Soul Cages' and the first four U2 releases as well as "Actung Baby"
come to mind, and always thought of them as unique.  "Actung Baby" was first
released in paper and then in plastic, so if you hold out awhile, "Differnt
Stages" may eventually be in a plastic jewel case.

Van Halen's "Live Right Here Right Now" is 2cd's and came in a paper case with
four panels, and 2 jewel case style plastic panels glued to the paper where
you store the cd's.  The problem here is there can't be any graphics printed
where those CD's go, right?  

On the other side of the coin, I have a limited edition of Led Zeppelin's 2CD
set "Live at the BBC", which has a limited 3rd CD of various interviews.  The
3cd's are in two slimline plastic jewel cases inside a stiff paper box (like
the Car's Anthology set came in: the size of an old style 2cd jewel case).  It
would have been nice if "Different Stages" was in 2 paper cases contained
inside of a paper box, with a unique paper jewelbox just for the 3rd CD, but
I'll take it anyway it comes.

It wasn't not a good thing for us Europeans to read the NMS for the last
week. Everybody is extremely excited about DS and how good it is, and in
Europe (at least in Germany) the release date has been postponed twice! So
we don't have it yet, we don't even know what it looks like exactly (of
course, no advertising or promos).
It is now scheduled for Nov. 23rd. Does anybody know why ? My record dealer
said that even you guys in the U.S. shouldn't have it yet, as DS isn't on
the U.S.-List of his distributors.

Well, I guess we'll have to wait and stand the suffering from reading the
NMS until it's our turn,

<A NAME="2143006">Subject: Geddy's taste in beer</A>

In Working Man, Ged was probably saying "ice cold beer."  After all, it was
a Canadian company (Molson, I believe) that created the ice-brewing process,
which results in a lager with almost no flavor at all (if you ask me...).

Personally, I think Ged should have said "nice warm ale," but I don't think
a "Working Man" would want anything fancy...just cold and alcoholic.  I
would have said a "Victory IPA" or maybe a "Dog Fish Head."

Hello all...

Am I the first one to recognize that the "RUSH" font on the cover of
"Different Stages" (and on all three discs) is EXACTLY the same as that on
the cover/CD of "Moving Pictures"?

By the way, "Different Stages" kicks serious @$$...

Well, if symbolism is a must, then that might make a pretty good theory.
On a more superficial level though, maybe those are just plain old garden

Hey there, hi there, ho there!

I don't know why people are complaining about Closer to the Heart 
being on DS.  I know it was on the last two live albums, but you've 
gotta admit that the version on DS is much "livelier" than on the 
other two albums.  They really rock out on this version.  The only 
thing that was missing is Alex introducing Neil as Karen Carpenter...

WOW!! Isnt this the greatest Rush CD  Released this year?? :)

i dont know if anyone noticed, but if you look closely in the sleeve of
the hammersmith disc, you can find all the band members:

Geddy (frontmost left) appears to be scalping tickets or something

Neil ( in the window to the right of the sign) looks out the window

Alex (Right) getting hauled away in a straitjaket

i suppose how i could go on to the present trail on how this relevates to
neil's loss or something.. btw it was stated that the tinkertoys have no
meaning.. kida like the trees but that didnt stop a huge debate anyhoo..

and the fancast was ok.. the realvideo was verry choppy and the audio
incomprehensible at times.. i would have liked to see more questions
awnered and only one question per person.. no multiple question crap

oh well.. at least we got to see em! :)

<A NAME="2143015">Subject: "Play it again, daddy"</A>

How a RUSH release can pull a willing listener into their
world...all i can say is DS pulled me in!  As i was
listening to disc 1 in depth, especially 2112, it reminded
me of earlier experiences (2112, MP, SiG, PW) when i was
mesmerized at what i was listening to for the first time.  I
listened to disc 2 the next day & got to the Rhythm Method.
It was a Saturday morning and my 7 year old daughter was
drawing with crayons in the room with me (Sat. a.m. cartoons
aren't what they used to be).  as soon as RM was finished,
she said "Play that again, Daddy...i like that!".  i
willingly obliged, & she told me that she really liked "that
part...that's my favorite" (the vibra-phone sounding part).
this remind anyone of the lyrics to Chained Lightning? - - -
reflected in another pair of (ears).

when i opened the cd and read the dedication, i got choked
up too.  very appropriate for this release.

for those of you counting the Tinker-Toys:  are you
including the ones on the actual cd's themselves?  funny how
red, yellow & blue are also Superman's colors (yep, i'm the
Supes nut...Camera Eye, anyone?)

last but not least, a fun tid-bit.  on two of the
Tinker-Toys (it's clearest on the actual front of the whole
package), the side holes (especially on the yellow & blue
ones) look like hearts, cuz of the angle they are at.  not
insinuating anything, just an interesting observation to
share.

happy DS listening to all,
david ;-)

An emphatic no.  I recall reading in a previous NMS a while
ago that 
Hugh Syme has admitted himself that there is absolutely no
meaning in the
tinkertoy design
_________________________________
Totally disagree.  Go back and look at every album cover. 
To say that there is absolutely no meaning in this particular
cover is to assume that there has been absolutely no
meaning in any cover.  What about the three satellite dishes
on the cover of test for echo?  What do they represent?  I
admit that I don't know, but I still believe that a great deal of
thought was put into this album cover and I also believe that
with the cover of Different Stages, the artist is continuing his
theme of depicting the trio.

Well I am going to have to put this dog to rest. Jose, I don't mean to
flame, but you have to put the pipe down for a while.

Those are not hearts. They are simply the holes viewed at an
angle/perspective.
The tinker toys are not square. You are looking at a circle on a
cylinder..This makes it eliptical. Sorry Jose....

I am having problems with the clusterworks program. I only see the tracks

	I was reading "Metallica:  Fuel and Fire", a collector's guide to
Metallica, and the book includes a brief timeline of Metallica's history.
Here's an interesting excerpt taken from that timeline:

"1980:  Obsession split up, but James [Hetfield] and Jimmy Arnold start a
new band, Syrynx [sic].  They get Jimmy's brother Chris on drums, Kenny
Eichert on vocals, and Warren Heyman on bass.  Their set consists entirely
of Rush songs."

Aside from the misspelling (or maybe it was intentional) of 'Syrinx', I
thought that was a pretty cool tidbit.  If anyone is interested in more
info about the book, feel free to email me.

<A NAME="2143033">Subject: Vocal on The Analog Kid</A>

Is the version of TAK on DS supposed to be the same one that is on the
pro-shot Auburn Hills video bootleg from the Counterparts tour?  Because I
did some close A/B comparisons between DS and my video, and I can say
without a doubt that they are not the same vocal performance.  Anybody
else out there with this video or the Critical Mass CD (I believe they are
the same show) needs to check this out.  Either Geddy borrowed a vocals
from a different night and slapped them on top of the instruments from
Auburn Hills, or he re-did some parts in the studio.

Also, I know I am going to get reamed for this.  First let me say that I
love the new album.  I have no complaints with the packaging or the
setlist.  But I am unhappy with the way they performed some of the songs.
On Closer to the Heart during what is supposed to be the chime part, it is
sorely lacking that low D bass pedal that can be found on E..SL.  That
bass part is largely what makes the chime interlude sound good, and I
think it sounds like shit without it.  And that toy bell sound he's using
has to go too.  What wrong with a good chime sound.  On Limelight, the
last super high squeaky note of the solo is supposed to sustain all the
way up until "those who wish to be."  Alex doesn't do that anymore.
That's part of the song.  That's the way the solo is played.  You don't
just leave that shit out.  Natural Science is missing a synth part during
certain parts of the song.  Again, that part needs to be there.  It's part
of the song.  That's the way the song goes.  And on 2112, especially
Finale, Neil is supposed to do a fast roll with the double bass and toms,
which is supposed to be followed by a cool bass run from Geddy (this is at
19:20 - 19:26 on the studio version, and at 14:19 - 14:25 on ATWAS, and is
on every bootleg version of it that I own).  This was the biggest
disappointment of all.  I even remember being a bit miffed about this
omission when I saw them live 3 times on the TFE tour.  Again, that stuff
shouldn't be left out.  It's parts like that that make me love those songs
so much.  All those double bass fills and bass runs, and especially the
interaction between Geddy and Neil that you hear on the classic renditions
are what make me say to myself "this is the most kick ass band on the
planet.  I think if they're going to "brink back" classics like that, they
need to play them like they played them back in the day.  Some deviations
from the original version are good, like the end of Bravado, the end of
LTTA, Alex's solo on Discovery, the bass solo on Driven, the extra chorus
on TAK...  Those were changes for the better (TAK is debatable).  But the
deviations/omissions that I'm complaining about were not for the better.
It's seem like they just don't think those parts are important, and
they're just not bothering to play them.  But to me, they are part of the
song, part of the way the song goes.  Oh yeah, and Geddy's solo on
Freewill is not nearly as stellar as it was from Permanent Waves through
the Signals tour.  He never really starts dealing.  There's no high
fretting like there was on E..SL.  Its mostly just eighth notes, which I
could play.  That solo doesn't say "I am Geddy Lee and don't even fuck
with me on the bass, because I can smear your ass all over the stage with
this solo" anymore, like it used to on E...SL and all my bootlegs.
Those are my complaints about the way the songs were performed.  But other
than that, I love the album.  I think it sounds great.  I listen to it
non-stop.  

Ben Leimkuhler

Oh yeah.  Alex's guitar covers up Geddy's bass too much.  I usually can't
hear it apart from the guitar unless I'm listening with headphones.  Then
I can hear it.  And Geddy's bass sound doesn't have enough bass it in.
It's mostly fuzz and fart sound, with not enough bottom, or roundness.  
And Neil's bass drum gets lost in the mix most of the time.  You can
usually feel it, and you know its there, but there's no slap to help the
sound poke through the mix.  The bass drum sound from the Counterparts
tour comes through a little better.  I hear the bass drum better on most
of my bootlegs.

I've only ever once got the feeling of being at the live show from one album 
and that was a Rolling Stones double-lp bootleg named Garden State '78 
recorded at Passaic, New Jersey on their Some Girls tour.
In comparison to record company releases of any band's live albums, this Stones
album sounds absolutely raw and really THERE!! Official releases of live albums
sound very much more "rounded" and "tame" against this one. If you've ever 
heard it, I'm sure you'll agree with me.
When I first got it in the early 80's I took it in to a local radio station and
they were so blown away by it that they played the whole album non-stop.

Having said that, I'm still thrilled with my DS purchase. Have listened to all
three cd's three times in a row. That killed nine hours and 2 litres of 
bourbon and noise control only came round twice.

While my ears are still bleeding from too much DS listenings at higher than

Think geek, Chris...
	yllk = Y 2 K
You know that our boys are techno-freaks [especially Ged], so I am betting
that that is what is on the kid's shirt.  Although your explanation does
seem logical too.

Ummm...what does it mean when you have gooey gray stuff oozing outta your

<A NAME="2143038">Subject: "Natural Permanent Stages, Different Science"</A>

Hello,

    I went over to the local Newbury Comics and purchased the new live Rush
3 cd set for $18.99.  In contrast to Strawberries price of $25.99, Tape
Worlds $26.99 and Spinnakers $21.99 I think I have an excellent purchase
that sounds quite nice.  In fact "Different Stages" is the best live concert
cd that I have heard since KISS Alive! from 1975.  The first dozen rows of
audience sound weaved into the music as it should be heard from
somewhere, anywhere in the concert venue is the approach that I like best
and RUSH has delivered a quite excellent package.

"A simple kind mirror, to reflect upon our own.  All the busy little
creatures chasing out their destinies.  Living in their pools, they soon
forget about the sea..."

    I do have some questions about some of the songs.  During the end of
"The Trees" it sounds as if there was another song to start during the end
of "The Trees" or perhaps the ending could have been smoother and with more
finesse.  Was that planned? The entire 2112 recording took place in my home
state of Massachusetts
and I do remember the reviews of the show.  2112 needs an outdoor setting to
really be appreciated.  During the ending of 2112, Geddy rushed the
announcement of the bands break while the sound effects were still going,
why?

 "Wheels within wheels in a spiral array."

    I still manage to let my imagination go with me when listening to Rush.
It is one of those moments and things I cherish about this music over most
others.  Interestingly enough, most people enjoy the music they hear from
most artists when the music is forefront and the bands name has yet to be
discovered.  "We Are One" by KISS is one of those songs.  "Roll The Bones"
is another.  The other day a dry cloth car washer person was listening
through the car windows to the rap part of the song.  She was rather busy
for there was another car yet was far from relaxed like she turned out to be
after I had to go through the wash a second time and was able to watch her
demeanor before she saw my car coming through again.  "Roll The Bones"
really has effects.

"A quantum leap forward, in time and in space."

    I appreciate the approach to RUSH music over the years that RUSH has
come forth with.  Each album seems to be a diary of the raising of the RUSH
family.  From reading different lyrics from each album every stage of
raising a family is
brought to us the listeners.  Over at two pages of mine, one called "W. O.
M. P." and the
other called "Musicality", Rush songs are present.  "Natural Science" is a
favorite and the song lyric
content in contrast and in conjunction with the studies of the human brains
relation
with computer operating systems, the song "Natural Science" is befitting.

"The mess and the magic, triumphant and tragic, a mechanized world out of
hand."

    The other day I found myself getting irate at what I thought was a
persons attempt  to show me that persons
ability to use "toys" that are most likely used within a military level.
Those "toys" include advanced Windows type operating systems that I can
safely say only those with high level authority have.  As I was attempting
to post to the usenet the whole I. S. P. and all that I was doing was
subject to some rather intricate developments  The person I refer to, "Mr.
M" also is a private businessman and develops as he will.  Maybe the I. S.
P. and my work was malfunctioning due to my own doing and not he  Many
people have wondered and few have asked why some family members never are
face to face.  As I was chatting about that and other developments  in a N.
F. L. chatroom of the EFNet / IRC, I remember two things. What I said seemed
to be reflected by the New England Patriots performance thereafter and one
word I typed came back in a unique way afterward.  While having to reboot
the computer and shower, I was thinking of that one word.  When I came back
to the computer, the mouse had failed to load properly but all the other
functions were working.  That  is only one of dozens unrecorded and recorded
by me.  There is a natural science to thinking via the brain and watching
correlating events via computer.

"Art as expression, not as market campaigns, will capture our attentions.
Given the same state of integrity, it will surely help us along."

    I remember last night while giving a ha ha ha to myself and my wife for
a bill statement states I have credit to me, I heard Mr. M laugh from where
ever he is.  After rebooting the computer for the new Outlook Express 5 to
take effect and while the two antivirus systems were checking out the
computer, the Windows 95 intro music seemed to laugh as well.  I remember
telling a Mr. Donovan of Norfolk, Virginia about that last night via email.
Today on my way to the registry, I heard a Mr. Donovan of somewhere on Cape
Cod speaking with lower Cape Cod d. j. named Kat about something not so good
and then something excellent.  While at the Registry of Motor Vehicles stood
a woman who's very existence reminded me of both the d. j. and a woman a
thousand miles away.  Today at work a man named Bill came to me and asked
"what is Norfolk" in Jeopardy terms.  Tonight at work, on my way to go home,
my employer seemed to mimic that same noise my computer made, the same sound
that Mr. Donovan of Norfolk, Virginia was told of.  In fact, Mr. Donovan was
the only person made aware of that.

"The most endangered species, the honest man, will survive annihilation.
Forming a world, state of integrity, sensitive and strong."

    I can stay here and type about my life, your life for a long, long time.

"Wave after wave will flow with the tide, and bury the world as it does.
Tide after tide will flow and recede, leaving life to go on as it was...."

Thank you RUSH.
