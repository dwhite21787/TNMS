Just a couple of things; there are a couple of new image files in the
'rush/images' directory; a reworking of the gif of "The Pass" in a few
different renderings.  Also, a a partial transcription of the tourbook
from the _2112_ tour has been placed in the 'rush/special' directory.
See the "CONTENTS" file in the apropriate directory.

The Lord of the Rings would make a truely excellent song - Mind you

*/    read the book! :')

Dune has got a good Sci-Fi feel to it ( I thought the film was quite good )
never read the book.

[ The book made the movie look feeble, IMHO.  It's just too great an epic
  to do well on screen.                                           :rush-mgr ]

Try this one.

        How about the Legend of Camelot - you know King Arthur and that
lot......

or

        Neuromancer by William Gibson - If you haven't read this one
do yourself a favour and go buy it tommorrow...!!

Oh BTW I want to kill the presenters of "New Music"!!!

	I successfully ftp'ed the audio files from sciences.sdsu.edu. Sounds
pretty good. I would like to thank the people responsible for sampling and
storing these files for public use. I would encourage anyone with a SPARC
station to ftp these to your machine.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone know if it's possible to play sparc sounds on an IBM? ;)  I'm
sure they wouldn't be as good without some kind of extra sound
capabilities... like a sound blaster or a self-constructed one...

[ On a related topic, are these playable on a NeXT machine?  Can they
  be translated into a format NeXTs can understand?  Ed?  :-)

Hello Everyone,

I was just sniffing around in the early 80's of the digest and noticed
some nice discussions about ``Red Tide'' (check 'em out!). No-one seems
to have given an interpretation of ``Let us not go gently into the endless
winter night''. It seems to me Neil is talking about a nuclear holocaust
because what would be more of an endless winter night than a `nuclear
winter' (a post-nuclear-war environmental hypothesis championed by
Carl Sagan and others). What do you think?

Hi, I've got a few comments on the Red Barchetta ending and also women
and Rush.  (I know . . . let's wear out something, eh.)

But first, I want to say, "I finally bought Chronicles to finish my
Rush CD collection, and I'm working on the Exit...Stage Left video."

Now--I know everyone has their opinions, but I love everything about
Red Barchetta.  For one thing, it is sometimes a sweet, beautiful
piece, and other times (like after the solo) it is energetic and
trashing.  I think they built the song conciously to fit the feeling
of riding in a car.  I recently experimented with this in the country,
which is about 100 feet away in any direction.  Let me tell you, you
have to try going for a drive with MP blasting.  Hell, why not do it
every week.  (wink, wink)

The subject of Rush and women brought to mind something that Harry
Anderson said in his role as Judge Harold T. Stone in probably one
of the first Night Court episodes:  "I own every record Mel Torme
ever made...I'm going to marry the girl that's impressed by that."
I know precisely how he feels.  Well, ladies, did you notice my
earlier statement?  ;-)

That's enough feeling lonely for now.  I think I'll go and try to
find the ESL video somewhere near Middletown.  (I think I was the
best friend who was far away...and still am.)

Harry had just gained a little of her respect.
   Miss Wagner:  It would be an honor to call you...Harry.
   Judge Stone:  ...And it's fortunate I have that name.

BTW, is there only one person here in the upper midwest?
