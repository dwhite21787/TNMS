For all of you wondering about where to send condolences...

   "Peart family wishes to grieve alone"
   By JANE STEVENSON -- Toronto Sun (July 8, 1998)

   This past weekend's tragic news that Rush drummer Neil Peart lost his 
   wife, Jackie, to cancer has prompted an outpouring of grief from the
   band's fans wondering where they can send flowers and/or condolences. 

   But Rush's Toronto-based management company, SRO, said yesterday: 

      "As per the family's wishes, it's kept very private. There's no service, 
       or any charity, or anywhere to send flowers etc. They just want to be 
       left alone at this very sad time." 

   Peart also lost his and Jackie's 19-year-old daughter, Selena, in a car 
   accident last August.

<A NAME="2071002">Subject: bass player, etc.</A>

Hello,

Well, I suspect folks' Rush moods will be pretty sullen for awhile, but I
wanted to mention a bassist that I think a lot of folks here might enjoy.

Oteil Burbridge is a great bass player in the jazz-funk tradition.  He's my
2nd favorite bassist in the world.  He appears on 3 albums with (and is a
member of) the Aquarium Rescue Unit (aka ARU), he's a new member of the
Allman Brothers Band, and his new CD is out soon and available only from
his web page: 

http://www.nilerecords.com/

By the way, ARU is supposed to be working on a new album right now, so look
for it around Christmas (I hope)...

Now to Rush.  I hope we can all be respectful in this time.  What a
tragedy.  Let's hope that Mr. Peart's network of friends and family can
help ease his pain through this.  And I hope the rumor-mongering that so
many of us despise (Mr. Peart included) is kept to a minimum.

On to less important Rush things.  I know there are several people on this
list who are working in the record industry (can't remember, is Donna
Halper still in the industry, and if so, are you still reading NMS, Ms.
Halper?)  Anyway, does anyone know if there is an industry standard
regarding when song lists, etc., are announced prior to a new release?  I'm
looking forward to the live set, whatever it is...

Hey, tried out your Rush quiz.  Just thought you might like to make sure
all your answers are correct before you put up a quiz.

Question 13:  Didacts and Narpets are what?

They are NOT both anagrams.  Narpets is an anagram for Parents, yes, but
"didacts" is actually a real word.  A didact is someone who is didactic --
that is, they force their own views on someone else as though what they say
is absolutely true.  In other words, Neil is negatively describing a
teacher.  So "didacts" is not an anagram -- therefore there is no correct
answer to that question :).

You should probably correct this :)

Other than that, the quiz was fun (if a bit easy for this Rush-obsessed fan
who has read Visions cover-to-cover a number of times).

I am so saddened by this recent news about Neil. I feel so bad for him
because his heart must be just crushed.  A person can only go through so
much, and this is just too much for anybody in such a short period of
time. I wouldn't be surprised and would understand if this marks the end
of the band. It might pull the group closer together as people and
friends, but the band is another question, and it will probably be a
long time before we know if it will continue.

As far as people flaming the Rush manager about not having this news
sooner, that is just pure ugliness and disregard for common courtesy.
People are just bizarre, you see the absolute worst and best in the same
day...

By far the coolest song intro I have ever head Geddy do to Cold Fire on the
Counterparts tour. The nice thing about it is that it seems to be different
every night, judging by the boots I've heard. For those who havn't heard
this one, I recommend you try to track down and MP3 or something, because
it really is quite priceless!! Anyway, the one from the Toronto show
(Animated) goes something like this:

Geddy: "Good evening TO! How's it going, great to be back home" etc.
<Alex and Neil break into a stereotypical country and western tune>
Geddy: "so let's get with it, and play the music that ya love. Yes, that's
country and western music, so we're gonna play two hours worth of it. Yes,
a new direction the band has taken, some good ol songs, from way back when -"
<Music stops>
Geddy: "This is a good ol song called I gotta Cold Fire"
<song starts, crowd goes nuts>

It's all said in a slow country drawl - quite hilarious. And of course Cold
Fire rips, what a great song!!!!!! I hope it's on the live album...

Live album title spectulation: Brought to you by the Letter "R" (cheesy
isn't it, maybe I'd prefer if they DIDN'T use this title...)

Good day

<A NAME="2071006">Subject: In Defense of Rush, again</A>

After getting my inbox set on fire from Michael regarding my earlier post, I
want to clarify my viewpoint and apologize to Michael if he took it as a
personal attack.  I'm sorry my post caused you to be so verbally critical of
me, but who was it that "dared" someone to defend "... Going Bald"?  Does the
lyric "once we smelled the flowers, now we ask the price of the land" remind
anyone else of Hillary Clinton, and how she went from "peace, love & war" to
real estate speculation?  If I would have taken my Red Lenses off long enough
to clarify my point, I could have done a better job getting my point across.  

First, let me say I have no problem at all criticising Rush's songs.  It was
Jimmy Lang (Rush mgr #1, in an early issue of the NMS), that stated the NMS
was founded to discuss Rush without negative criticism from people who don't
fully appreciate Rush.  I have no bones at all with constructive criticism,
and I admit my post was confusing when I tried to express that specific point.
What I have a problem with is repeated lists of "skipable songs" without any
explanation.  I'm not blind to criticism, just that I think it needs to be
backed up with some explaination to lend itself to healthy discussion.  Anyone
can send in a post of his least favorite songs, but without some "meat" to
back it up, what's the point?  We could have 5,000 posts of least favorite
songs, but I would rather discuss WHY they are skipped.  

What I love and want to encourage are posts like Alex Grey's comments about
Natural Science.  Rather than just saying he skips it, he gave an explaination
why.  Saying Everyday Glory is muzak or comparing it to Kenny G doesn't make
the cut.  

If Rush really worried about what the fans/critics had to say, they may be
recording Tom Sawyer clones to this day.  They honor their own high standards
to produce their distinctive music, and I'd rather leave it to them than to
the average fan as to what gets put on THEIR albums.  If radio airplay and
critical response really bothered them, their music would reflect it.  I don't
think there is any blind acceptance by even their die-hard fan base, in fact
common that so few of us rarely like their albums upon first release, most
likely because they don't fit into our Rush paradigm.

Hanstones

ps. Hats off to the Rush-mgr for your discreet handling of the passing of
Neil's wife.  I'd bet he would appreciate it.

I have to disagree.  I had a copy of RTB on vinyl for quite some time. 
I've also seen Presto on vinyl.  There definitely *were* copies of those
on vinyl.

rushfan.2112 (Christopher L.) wrote of his favorite non-Rush acts:

>3)  GORDON LIGHTFOOT  "I love how he says Detroit in TWOTEF--"Detroy-et
>parade"

Sorry, Chris, but the lyric has nothing to do with a parade. I hope you 
were just spelling out Gordon's pronunciation.

For those thinking there's a parade in Detroit every November to 
commemorate the sinking of the ore-carrier Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake 
Superior, there isn't. Gordon sang, "In a musty old hall in Detroit (with 
aforementioned pronunciation) they prayed/At the Maritime Sailors' 
Cathedral." The church is still there on Jefferson Avenue, along the 
Detroit River.

And, rushfan.2112 (or Christopher or Chris or whatever you prefer), you 
can get all the Detroy-et you want by watching hockey games on CBC (you 
mention a bunch of Detroit-area radio programs, so I'm guessing you might 
be able to watch CBC). At least one of their guys says Detroy-et all the 
time. Must be a Canadian thing.  :)

At least no one uses the French pronunciation of Detroit, "Day-twah."

You also mentioned liking Queensryche's "Empire" and that it is a Peter 
Collins production. So are "Operation: Mindcrime" and "Hear in the Now 
Frontier." "Mindcrime" is one of the best albums ever.

Later, David

Hi gang --

I've been out of the Rush loop for months, now.  So I just found out
about Neil's wife.  I remember when I heard that Selena died, I thought I'd just
creamed into a speeding Mack truck.  But this, on top of that....I'm
numb, y'know?   :(
    I thought I'd check in to see if anyone was taking up a collection
for a cancer foundation, or anything like that.  I'd like to pitch in,
if that's the case.  Please e-mail me on details, if there are any.
Thanks.

ALL of Rush's tuff so far has been vinyl released, in increasingly

Greetings fellow Rushians !

For months now I've seen everyone submit their ideas (ad nauseum) as to
the proposed content of NMS issue #2112.  Well, I'll take a different
direction, and proposed what it should NOT contain !

1.	People listing what songs they think suck !  You know who you are !
	STOP IT!!!

2.   	Comments by or regarding certain obnoxious former Rush
	confidants.  Forget them !

3.	Looooooooooooooooong drawn out stories about how someone 	heard a
Rush song on the radio whilst vacationing in the Ozarks. 	Boring !

4.	Debates on whether or not the remastered CD's were in fact  
	remastered.  Just 1 listen'll prove it.

5.	Song list suggestions for the live album.  It's done & in the can.
	Accept it !   The boys rarely let us down.

6.	People bellyaching about other's behavior at concerts.  I've seen 
	acts ranging from Prince to Korn, all kinds of people, music, & crowds.
	It's a pain in the neck sometimes, but concerts are meant to have
	human interaction, good & bad.  Rent a video or play a record at home
	otherwise.

7.	Any other drummer's solos.  Enough said.

8.	Political drivel and/or propoganda.  Vote, volunteer for your favorite
	candidate, but for heaven's sake, take it elsewhere.  I'm all for
	freedom of speech, but there's a reason you don't discuss politics or
	religion in mixed company.

9. 	Debates regarding whether or not a musician OWES their fans
	anything other than what was paid for.  Sure, we'd all love to have a
	brew w/ the boys, but if you buy a concert ticket, their job is to play
	the concert. Same for albums & memorabilia.  You bought the item in
	question, not the person.

Let's enjoy this page, and not bore or disrespect others.  As previously
stated, I'm all for free speech, but there are loads of web-sites I can
visit if I need negativity or a verbal brawl.

Our sympathies to Mr. Peart & his family.

Drive defensively & may the Lord be your companion !

We are saddened once again by the death of a loved one.

Please refrain from turning Neil's wife's death into a fiasco.  I mean this 
with great intent.  Neil has been through a lot in the past year and he 
doesn't need us to help him with his anquish.  He knows how his fans feel 
about him and knows we sympathize and share in his sorrow so please, let 
this one go quietly into that gentle night.  Most of us (me included) didn't 
even know she was ill.

As an oncology nurse for the past 9 years I've seen it all.  Cancer is a 
devastating disease that has taken someone each of you knew or loved.  
Remember that feeling and ask yourself what you wound want.  Silent support 
from thousands or a massive letter writing campaign to say how much your sorry?

 So please, say a prayer to whomever you worship and ask for strength for Neil.

Respectively,

Chris Babson

Rush Manager,

If I were you I would tell all these inconsiderate bastards to fuck off, and
pock their noses in someone else's hole!!
Neil Peart is probably one of the most reserved and private artists around,
but some people have such a simple existence that all they can do is mumble,
crumble and delve into other people's lives.
It is a pity that they can't fathom that sometimes a little discretion is
needed.

going to need the band to keep busy.

<A NAME="2071021">Subject: Other groups I listen to, various reasons I love Rush, how I </A>

	Hello again Rushians....
	I want put in my 1 1/2 cents about other groups I listen to. 
Rush has been my favorite for the last few years, and I think they will
be for a long time.  Others I like:
	Boston
	Yes
	Van Halen (Van Halen and Rush are tied, in terms of number times
I have seen the most times in concert, twice each)
	The Cars (Don't laugh)
	Not really a group, but I have a sh'load of 80's CD's (what can I
say, I am a child of the 80's).

	Other groups/acts I have thought of as the "best-ever" over the
years:
	Tiffany and Debbie Gibson in '87 or so, then Vanilla Ice and MC
Hammer came along in '89!  Then I thought THEY were the GREATEST of
ALL-TIME!  Now Hanson, Spice Girls, the Wallflowers are the best...in
fact, I can decide which of these acts I like second after Rush, they are
all so awesome!!!
	(Disclaimer:  the above paragraph was stated with tongue firmly
planted in cheek.)

	Now, some reasons why I love Rush:
	They never let their egos get inflated.  I like they all still
live in Canada and didn't "transplant" themselves to LA or something. 
This is probably the main reason I love Rush.
	They never have, and never will, sell out to a corporate
interest.  Unlike Aerosmith and U2.  Doesn't Aerosmith feel ANY shame
whatsoever?  (No offense to any Aerosmith fans out there.  In fact, I
kinda dig their older stuff.)
	Awesome concerts.
	Speaking of Rush concerts, you won't see any of that stage-diving
or mosh-pit shit at a Rush concert.
	And of course, their wonderful music.

	LAstly, someone asked readers to describe how they got into Rush
music.  Well, I must say that I have always known who Rush was.  I must
admit, there was a time where I only knew "Tom Sawyer", "The Spirit of
Radio", "Freewill", you know, the general Rush staples that are played on
FM radio.  In Fall of '91, I started college at Northeast Missouri State
in Kirksville (now known as Truman State University).  One of my buddies
that I had just met freshman year, Sam, lived down the hall in Missouri
Hall 5th floor (dorm).  He had Rush playing quite a bit, and "Roll the
Bones" had come out not long before.  I became amazed listening to the
music coming from his room.  He let me borrow his library of Rush CD's,
and I was hooked.  To this day, we still hang out, and I think I play
Rush more than he does! (lafs).  Anyways, Sam and I roadtripped on
Halloween 1996 to Madison and Milwaukee, WI to meet up with an old
college buddy going to school at U. of Wisconsin.  The next day, saw my
very first Rush concert at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee.  That concert
is forever etched in my memory.  Also saw them in Kansas City last June.
	Well, I have written enough.  If you are still reading this,
thank you!
	Good Livin' to you all,
	Jon G.

Welcome Griswold.  

I would be happy to obliged your questions.  With regard to your question on
Cygnus X1 book 2, the song you hear in the background is from Cygnus X-1 Book
1 off AFTK.  The story goes, if you are following the lyrics, in book one, the
Rocinante gets sucked into a black hole.  Book two is the continuance.  This
world is where the Rocinante comes out on the other side of the black hole.

Hello,

    Been a long time since I was part of this list and I am glad to be back.
Mr. Neil Peart:  There is as you know two angels on each arm and leg of
yours and most importantly, your heart and mind.  My own grandmother lost to
cancer and won into heaven.  The live recordings: One double word:
Limelight (title and song for the new recordings imho.)  Webspace:
http://www.gis.net/~mahler  And there you will find that the page
"Musicality" has a link to the RUSH page of choice.  When you see the two
boys along side the road with one carrying a branch well there you have a
Olive Branch RUSH which brings me to the other favorite page of mine right
now and perhaps will be of use to RUSH and all us Rush-a-longs.  The page is
called "WOMP" and that stands for "Weapons Of Mass Protection" -  I promise
nothing and only state that "Natural Science" is indeed the fact that make
some of lifes best times happen.

Sincerely,

This is my first Rush submission, I've been a fan since Permanent Waves and
haven't missed a tour since then.  My condolences to Mr. Peart as he has
seen enough tragedy for one year.

I haven't really read these things till I heard about Neil's wife dying,
mostly I just hit delete.  I have read the past editions this week, and
would like to add a new twist to the favorite/least favorite postings.
Here are my top 5 Rush songs in the "Fun/Funky/Or Otherwise Wacky" category.

#5. - Vital Signs (funky sound, great lyrics)
#4. - I Think I'm Going Bald (I play that one whenever there is a balding 
                             person in my car or house :)
#3. - red lenses (very cool drum beat, just all around funky song)
#2. - Roll The Bones (proving what Vanilla Ice proved years earlier ... 
                     white people shouldn't RAP ;)
#1. - Double Agent (the best, on CD and in concert, just superb)

Finally, yes Virginia there are un-playable Rush songs and Rivendell is 
number 1 on that list. However, whoever wrote Heresy and Bravado as part
the few bad ones has got to be kidding.  And why all the bad stuff about
Dog Years, I kind of like that one and think one of the better guitar and
singing parts come at the lines: "I'd rather be a tortoise from Galapagos,
Or a span of geological time".  Very pretty.

Hey everyone!

This is in response to Double Agent's post.  Just a question.  What's the 
point of everyone bashing certain songs?  They all have a valid reason for being
on the albums, whether for self-indulgence, being a single, whatever.  Not many
other bands have made half the quality of songs as Rush's less-liked songs 
and they have multi-platinum records.  Why make it if you don't want it 
on the album?

So, let's come up with some more interesting things to come up with other than
debating the worthiness of a song to have the NMS seal of approval unamimously
placed on it.

This is in reply to the comment made regarding why there are no 
skippable Rush tracks:

     The gentelman who belong to the group Rush are musicial artists. 
Every note that vibrates from thier instruments was painstakingly made 
at a precise moment, and put together these notes (and all the other 
noises) make up a song. These songs make up what the group Rush is all 
about.When I listen to an album, I listen from beginning to end, and I 
do not skip any songs. Because I feel the group's intent was (and is) to 
make a statement with an album as a whole, not broken up into little 
parts. (Hence there being a few albums in which over half the music is 
one song) When I draw a picture, or paint, it is my intent for viewers 
of my artwork to see the whole picture, not just part of it. Music is an 
art form. And Rush is the most talented group of individuals who have 
made music in this century. 
     I don't consider myself "Mightier than thou". I just find it very 
ironic to see all the negativity on these postings. The phrase "Looking 
through the eyeglass in reverse" comes to mind. I mean, lets appreciate 
what these guys have done. After all, they are the reason the NMS 
exists.

respect the decision by the digest manager to not publish the

It's been a long time since I wrote to the TNMS, but after what I've
been reading lately, concerning Neil's wife, and what people, most of
them stupid to flame a person which doesn't have to tell you or not
what's happening, makes me mad.

Whoever is flaming the rush-mgr don't deserve to be receiving the
National Midnight Star, period.  The NMS is something that keeps your
informed on what's happening to our favorite group.  I have to thank
the NMS because this is how I knew when Rush was having a tour, and I
had the chance to see them live for the first time in my life, a dream
that came true, after 15 years of just listening to them on LP and CD's.

The rush-mgr have to withstand the continuous and tedious e-mails that
people send, which are repetitive, like Rush and the devil, which
person/actor can portray Rush on a movie, comparison of whoever with
Neil, Geddy, or Alex; etc.  It's been two years since I joined this,
and treads like Rush and Satan have been resurrected a lot, which make
me hit the page down or, like sometimes I do, just read the outline at
the beginning of the NMS, and if there is no "administrivia", just
erase the e-mail and keep goin'.

The rush-mgr keeps us updated of recent Rush activities, and
sometimes, things that are happening to them, like Serena's death last
year, and this year, Neil Peart beloved wife's death.  If you feel
like flaming somebody because you think the info was late, flame
yourself, and don't bother other people's job, OK!

Thanks to rush-mgr to keep us informed, and one suggestion from me:
use the delete key!

working on a follow up to the Victor cd.  And they said a NEW RUSH studio 
album is scheduled to be recorded and released on January 1, 2000.  So we 
get a live album, a year wait and then new material.  Perhaps, another

  The radio station that day played a doulble shot of Rush.  The songs
were Tom Sawyer and Closer to the Heart.  Also an ad on the radio plays

Hi everyone:

    It does seem that sadness comes in threes:

    Yesterday, I was in the bookstore, and I had just eaten some bad
Thai food and needed to blow some chunks.  So I picked up that crappy
book of Jewel poetry and did what I needed to.
    Later on, I picked up yet another fan-type picture book about Jewel,
and it seems that Peter Collins, the one we know and love, is producing
her next record.
    I guarantee you that everytime Jewel screams 'well, this should be
louder!' Mr. Collins thinks to himself 'shit, why can't Rush be doing
another record?'

    Ah, the planet is going through some weird and tragic part of the
galaxy.
