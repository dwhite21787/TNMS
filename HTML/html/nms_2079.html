Whoa, still takes a bit getting used to, not using the "syrinx" email addy
any more (I still find myself typing it out :-)

Anyways, I sat down last night and spent some quality time on the web site.
Redid the front page (sorta), adding new information, some real and some
fun. And until you have to use a cable modem that is SLOWER than a 2400 baud
modem, I don't want ANYONE complaining that I don't update the page enough!
(what you see on the front page took me nearly *3* hours to do, thanks to my
crap connection!!)

Oh yes while I'm thinking of it, if you are planning on having a Rush
live album release party (either in the store you work in and/or own, or
in your own house), I will be putting up a section on the web page. So
send me your details (date, time, location, goodie info) and I'll have
something up in a few weeks, maybe around the first of September just in
time for the single :-)

But in other news, I grabbed the MP3 of the TS remix thanks to Brent, and
stuck it on there. I also checked out the "Whatever" web site, and the
soundtrack listed TS courtesy of Mercury, so I guess we know who approved
it.

And ok ok enough with The Pass. My brain was on overload yesterday and I
couldn't get it out of my head that The Pass was on RTB! (I knew TP was 
played on its album tour, and one tour beyond, and in my warped thinking
that was putting it as being played on the CP tour). But Doug has said
that they might go back to the RTB tour to get a few songs for the live
album... (that'll teach me to check facts before I open my big mouth)

I'm sorry rush-mgr, maybe I am hallucinating, but I am almost positive
that The Pass was not played on the CP tour.  I know that they added
Bravado to the set list near the end to get a version of this on tape.
 Am I wrong?  Did they add the Pass into one or two shows at the end
of the tour?  I have not heard or seen this mentioned anywhere before.

Rush-mgr:
I must humbly disagree here.  The Pass was not played at any of the CP
shows I saw, nor is it on any of the CP boots I have.  So unless it was
introduced at only a few select cities (which could have happened, I
concede), The Pass was not played on the CP tour.  Do you know of a
specific show that it was played at?

Mike, this is Raven.

A couple of "Working Man" comments.

"...Stuart Hamm, who doesn't try to outdo Ged on YYZ, he just plays it his
way.  AS enjoyable as the original--Stu is good."

First, I tend to think that Stu Hamm overplays "YYZ" just a little bit, but
not much. Then again, anyone who can pull off "Linus and Lucy" on bass SOLO,
isn't doing too badly...

"Mike Portnoy does a decent job on drums, but he sounds as if he's
intimidated by the daunting task of keeping up with Neil.  He'd do better to
relax.  He's good."

Agreed, though he ends up something like that in Dream Theatre, too.

"Steve Morse handles most of LVS guitar, and could have done it all.  His
playing is tasteful and original."

Frankly, Morse can play rings around Lifeson - he makes Lifeson just sound
"good".

"Fates Warning does a really good rendition of CTTH, as a straight cover."

And makes it shine as such. Nothing fancy - just the straight song.

"...listening to him makes one realize that Ged is actually a VERY
underrated keyboardist,
considering he plays bass and sings simultaneously."

Remember - (1) Geddy's been getting studio and sequencer help for a long
time, and (2) *I've* been doing the bass/synth bit longer than Geddy has,
without any automation. (just don't ask me to sing)

"Robert Berry does all the instruments on Mission, save the drums, and a
REALLY good interpretation.  I don't know who he is, but I want his other
stuff."

No, you don't.

Robert Berry is primarily a producer, working for Magna Carta records and
co-ordinating their tribute projects (Jethro Tull, Rush, Yes, Genesis, and
Pink Floyd). It seems his "house band" is a group named Magellan, which
comes off ok. As for his own work, the first time I heard him was in a band
with Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer (but no Greg Lake - Berry sang and played
bass) called 3. The idea was that he would do all the writing, and they
would do the arrangements. I saw them at the Vic in Chicago - great show,
but then again, Keith could play rings around anything. Berry is boring by
comparison - the only think I like about him at this point is that he
produces the Celtic rock band Tempest (who's on tour, again, incidentally).

Had a good laugh last night with a minor Rush sighting.
I was watching one of my favorite TV shows, Viva Variety on
Comedy Central.  It was their Vegas special

Anyway, Mr and the former Mrs Laupin were discussing
various gambling games from around the world (fictonional 
and hilarious, of course), when she said that in Switzerland, 
they play a game called goldrush, where you "answer questions 
about the rock band Rush and win Nazi gold!"

woohoo
great pairing of references though...(sarcasm)
mostly, I guess it was a slam at the Swiss banks
that have reportedly been hiding all kinds of Nazi loot.
(or so I think I've read somewhere)

In responce to the question of which song to prove that Neil is the best
drummer, I would have to say that in my opinion there is not one "best
drummer". There are alot of drummers out there, that in the type of
music that they play, that have achieved a level of artistic greatness
that really pushes thoes that follow them to new levels. I have played
the drums for over 20 years. Neil has always been my favorite drummer. I
enjoy his style very much, as much as I enjoy the style of music of
RUSH. Some other drummers I enjoy listening to are Terry Bozzio, Simon
Philips, Jonathian Mover and Jeff Campitelli. And as to the question I
would have to recomend Rush XSL, the whole album is percussionist master
piece. Expecially :
Xanadu
Jacob's Ladder and of course
La Villa Strangiato
If you listen to these three very carefull it shows Neil's playing
ability very well and also his style. His more recent work is his
expanding on his repertoire.Hope you convert at least another fan to
RUSH.

there! I pulled out FBN and on the album liner there were the lyrics
written out by geddy (or alex or neil not sure) and come cool drawings.
Anyone else have the FBN vinyl? I think i might scan them and put them up

really?  i must of missed that.  you sure it wasn't the RTB tour?  or 
maybe the pass was dropped from the setlist early?  it's just not on any 
CP boots and i don't remember them playing it at the arrowhead pond in 
anaheim.

IMHO

Dimlit Stages for all ages.

WILL NOT be the next title of the album

Here is my thinking:

The following albums reflect something to do with being on stage.:

Moving Pictures  -  The Backdrop of thier setup.. it has moving pictures
Exit Stage Left - Where you leave the Stage at.
Signals - What you get from the audience when you get on stage
Grace Under Pressure - How the perfomers act in front of a croud.
Presto - When the show opens.. Presto, we are here
Roll the Bones - every time you get on stage, you roll the bones and see
how the performace is
A Show of Hands - what you see from the stage
Counterparts - the people in the audience....

I think, it might be something like

A RAZORS EDGE.

or we COULD ask Neil to go back to REAL percussion--none of that
adjustable head, tuneable garbage they came out with in the 1830's.  It
just destroys the whole natural tone of the drums....
think about how many instruments the man has.  As he said in the Presto
Tourbook, "Sure, it would look good.  But where would the other guys
stand?"
I fail to see how playing digital percussion requires any less skill. 
He still has to hit things, repeatedly, hard, and even more precisely.
And the music is not played back from a recording, it is MIDI-triggered,
which replaced vocoding in the early '80's.  Vocoding has been around
since the 50's...

	It's hard to believe that Devo actually went out of fashion before
1983, but they had such a huge impact on popular music that it seems like
they lasted much longer, and I guess they're still in the business but
more behind the scenes than behind their axes.

	The Rush video that had Casale involved for sure was "Mystic
Rhythms."

I had a problem just like this and so I whipped out the video tape (I 
believe it was Chronicles) and played subdivisions where they did a few 
closeups of Neil doing some fills where he alternates his hands in some 
nifty ways while making it sound fluid and easy.  
The other song I suggest is Jacobs Ladder or Cygnus X-1 where his 
playing is not only excellent but the timing is so irregular that it

I'm not one to put much stock in the pre-release track listing-type stuff
until it's official, mostly because I don't want to get my hopes up.  But,
here's a vote for at least the plausibility of the inclusion of Vital
Signs.  I seem to remember an interview where one of the members of Rush
said that they wanted to include Vital Signs on ESL (that in fact they had
a great version of it from the shows recorded for ESL), but it just didn't
make the cut because there wasn't room.  I would guess that is how the live
version of Vital Signs came to be on a single--I believe New World Man or
something else from Signals.  I'm sure some of you out there own the single
I'm talking about.

Anyway, perhaps they are going to use this old version of Vital Signs.  It
would seem a bit out of place with the CP/TFE stuff (13-15 years' maturity
for the band).  There are many other things to consider as well, but my
hope is that Vital Signs is included, whether it's old or not.  To be
completely honest, I'll be happy to get whatever they release.

Cheers,

Chris

Hi rush mgr.  
just wanted to let you, and the rest of the list know that "the pass" was 
not played on the counterparts tour (as was previously posted).  it was 
most definitely played on the roll the bones tour, but not on 
counterparts.  i'm fairly certain of this because i checked the rush 
setlist project at this url:  
http://cartoon.ecn.purdue.edu/~branden/rush-setlist/
and it mentioned nothing of the pass being played on counterparts at any 
point during the tour.  this makes me wonder how "the pass" (and vital 
signs) might be on the forthcoming live cd.

The remix give the song a new funk.  Not necessarily better, but definitely

I was passing through VH-1.  My fav since eMpTy-V stopped playing videos
(what was the start of that anyway?  It was too long ago to remember : )
and The Moody Blues were on.  When I flipped back Yes was on.  I noticed two
distinct things during the Yes showing.

 The first was the music.  It seemed they were playing there 2 or 3 most
"popular" songs.  For some reason, it seemed like a band trying to relive
there glory days.  I don't know what it was, but it seemed empty of the
spark of old, or there heart was not in it, or something.  It just kinda
annoyed me.  Not that I probably would have watch a new Yes track, less it
really floored me.  I hope that people who see Rush (like that could happen)
don't think that.  (I don't see how, but I'm some sort of Rush Nut) .

The second thing was the triangle thingamabob from the counterparts CD in
the lights that were swirling and shining on the floor.  Anyone else notice
that and think of Rush?  I know I'm not the only nut left in the barrel.

First of all I don't subscribe to Neil being the greatest drummer alive.  I 
saw a guy by the name of Billy Cobham put on a clinic here in Dallas that 
was mind numbing....there are so many great ones out there.  I haven't 
played a set in many years, but I still keep my rudiments in check every so 
often with my trusty practice pad!  If I had to choose though, these would 
be my top 5 (for the day ending of July 29, 1998 that is):

1. Grand Finale
2. Red Lenses
3. Tom Sawyer
4. Test For Echo  (never even tried this one!)
5. Natural Science

Neil's work on 2112 is great, those little snare fills through Presentation 
are tricky.  Then there's Lessons...one of my all time favs.  Anyway, I 
don't think you can influence your friend's taste, let him choose his on 
mentor, you certainly chose a good one!

I too am a bit puzzled by the possible inclusion of Vital Signs on the

recently traded for a tape which has filler material including Vital
Signs, and was surprised to see it labeled as coming from 1992. My guess
is that it might have been played on the second leg of the tour, but it
definitely wasn't played the first leg (at least they didn't play it at
the show I saw in Philly in Dec. '91). Either they did play Vital Signs
(maybe as a one-off) or my tape is mislabelled. Can anyone help us with
this one?

<A NAME="2079040">Subject: Spiral review</A>

I have just received Spiral from Scarred Records. It is another MP3
compilation of some of the better Rush bootlegs. I thought you might
appreciate a short review. Remember, this is a review of the compilation
and packaging, rather than the actual boots. Reviews of those can be
found in numerous places on the web.

First off, I have to say that once again the level of service from
Scarred Records has been superb. I ordered their first Rush MP3
compilation (watchful.eye) and received it within a week. This time I
pre-ordered Spiral and was kept informed on its progress by both their
web-site <www.geocities.com/SoHo/2236> and by personal e-mail from Ryan
Whitaker.

The boots on the disc are: Rush Hour, Signals From London, Experience To
Extremes, First Time In Tucson, and Virtual Songs. Each boot has its own
directory on the disc containing the individual tracks. Also included on
the disc are the better MP3 players ready for you to install. The disc
is a CDR and is of good quality and the MP3s play perfectly well. The
disc is also painted, which is a nice touch.

The packaging is just about the best I have seen for a bootleg to date.
The jewel case has a back/spine insert with track listings and credits.
The front insert is a 3 fold, beautifully printed semi-glossy collage.
Printed on both sides, each fold is dedicated to one of the bootlegs and
contains a Rush logo, boot title and info, and track listings/timings,
along with some great photos of the band (live and promo).

All in all, an exceptionally-produced package, and a must-have for
anyone into Rush and MP3s.

 ----------------
On another note, does anyone else feel that 'Dimlit Stages for All Ages'
is naff? Hopefuly it's just a working title, and the REAL title will be
something a little more...inspirational. Even just 'Dimlit Stages' would
be better.

<A NAME="2079043">Subject: Working Man</A>

I recently picked up "Working Man." As a whole, I don't think it's as
bad as some have let on, although there are some real stinker
performances. 
 
First the good points- Mike Portnoy and Billy Sheehan are great, as are
Steve Morse, Stu Hamm, James LaBrie, Fates Warning, Eric Martin,
Sebastian Bach (in an 80's kinda way), and even Mark Slaughter, whose
mere presence at first was embarrassing, does alright.
 
But what's the deal with Jake E. Lee? He's just plain bad. And the guy
who sings "The Trees" is my candidate for "worst performance." He's a
bad Geoff Tate impersonator with timing problems at best. 
 
The ridiculous overplaying award would most likely go to the guy who
does "The Analog Kid" solo. Simply ridiculous. Obviously never heard of
the expression "less is more."
 
Overall, the album is enjoyable and it's nice to know that these guys
have such a high regard for Rush. It's just too bad that 80's guitar-god
producer Mike Varney had anything to do with it. He should've spent a
little more time looking for musicians to participate rather than using
his whole stable of "Magna Carta" (probably former "Shrapnel") players
to fill spots.
