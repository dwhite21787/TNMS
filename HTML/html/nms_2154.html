With the holidays I've been lax in updating the web page, so I am working
on that this week. Thanks to Will Holt, I now have up a QT and RV version
of one of the DS commercials. I'll be redoing the QT tonight to make it much
much smaller, I used the wrong compression last night (the RV encoder I have
will only accept videos with a certain compression, but the QT vids I do
use a better one and I forgot to redo it after I made the RV file! such is
life)

The studio RV files are down again, not because of any threatening mail but
because the machine they were on got moved. I haven't changed the link yet
because I'm not sure if the machine'll be moved again soon or not. Hopefully
I'll be able to bring them back up late next week.

I also got my Japanese version of DS yesterday in the mail. A COMPLETE 
surprise, since I ordered it way back in October. I never actually expected
to see it :-)

I will make an MP3 of Force Ten tonight and upload that as well. The packaging
on the Japanese version I think is nicer than the US one I have -- all the
cd's were put inside little cloth envelopes, THEN in the cardboard holder.
They also included mini versions of the AFTK tourbook (UK version) and the
TFE tourbook, plus a huge booklet of all the lyrics to every song on the CDs
in both English and Japanese. I wish the other verions would've included
the mini tourbooks, they're really neat to see and a bonus for folks who 
don't have them...

And with the Showbiz Today interview, I have someone insisting that it did
happen, and someone telling me they asked the program director and they don't
know of any interview with Rush. So I dunno if it really happened, was 
supposed to happen and didn't, was just someone's imagination or what...

I was going to chide the Rushmgr for leaving Imanaz Holl's tirade
unsnipped, but on second thoughts, thank you - I suppose it takes strength
of character.

I'm curious, which post exactly was the last straw? Since you didn't
mention Adam's CD scam post, that definitely wasn't the one. But you've
been very comprehensive, you've gone through them one by one. Did you by
some chance, find it acceptable? Things like this really tick me off.
nickb@teleport.com is bogus, we all know that. Here's a guy trying to get
other people to not pray for Neil Peart!!! <LOL> I'm an atheist too, and I
couldn't be less bothered with trying to change other people's faith. All I
care about is that no conflict should arise between their faith and mine.
No conflict whatsoever at this end. Life is bloody elsewhere, goddammit!
Take a break. 
But *small penis*, mediocre education, shrink - is this all necessary?
Don't get me wrong, this is sterling material - I had the biggest spit-take
in history (I was drinking tea). But I wonder where it's really coming
from. Let me ask you this - is the TNMS all you have to take your
frustration out on?
It was your nomination of worst thread that really struck me. I thought the
magic note thread was the best thread in years! It was very informative -
I'm sorry if you didn't get it, but the marvel of that trick shouldn't be
completely beyond the grasp of a lay person (in terms of guitar playing
that is). I always like to read insights into Alex's genius. It's the main
reason I subscribe - I sure don't want to hear people go on and on about
non-belief, un-belief, centrism, egotism, etc. For once, I felt proud and
glad that there are so many knowledgeable guitarists who are also Rush
fans. It shows that our heroes are indeed going to leave behind a
formidable legacy. Bravo to all who participated in the thread - had I
known shit from shinola before I read it, I might have participated too.
Yes! Instrumental virtuosity *is* one of their main legacies - and like it
or not, it's going to be discussed here on the TNMS. And people like me are
going to keep looking forward to every edition. Who was it that said rush
fans are essentially geeks - I think he/she maybe on to something. The term
geek extends itself to serious guitarists who pursue their craft with the
blind fanatical devotion - these people get things done, they know things.
You should be envious of them.
I'm also wondering, what would you rather talk about? Any attempts to delve
into Neil's rather tortuous philosophy comes up with 'un-belief and
non-belief'. Personally, I think these people are missing the point to some
of these songs, what he's really trying to say. Hence the tired, jaded crap.
And 'techno-babble' doesn't seem to work for you either. 
Penis-envy, masturbation, alcohol, shrinks, maybe? 
Cure: Take it somewhere else.

Rgrds,
Ashim.

   '*RUSH FANCAST AVAILABLE IN DIGITALARENA*
On November 15th, in conjunction with the release of their multi-disc
live set,"DIFFERENT STAGES," Rush members Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson
stopped by the newly opened Atlantic DigitalArena Studio in New York
City for a special, direct-to-web "FANCAST."  The event featured a
question-and-answer session moderated by renowned music journalist
Lisa Robinson and a look back at the band's extensive video archive.
If you missed this unique oppurtunity to participate in an interview with two
living legends....well, what else can we say except for "You what?!
You missed it?!?! &*!@%!!  For the love of !@#$, how could you?? 
#$?%*!?!?"  Tee-hee, just kidding.  The event was pretty amazing,
though.  But don't take our word for it, the good news is that you can
still check it out, through the next two weeks, by clicking on the
DigitalArena icon on the Atlantic website.

Enjoy!

   [ They have the entire interview up in RV format. If anyone can download
     the entire thing I'd be more than happy to put on the NMS web site..

I am not a musician or remotely connected to the music industry, so if I
am missing the point  go easy on me.

Someone posted that the entertainment industry uses the term
"masturbatory" to desrcibe music with excessive notes/lyrics...

I was wondering what the EW reviewer who described DS as "masturbatory"
thought of Meat Loaf?????   Personally, I am a fan of Meat Loaf.  Using
this definition Meat Loaf  seems almost ejaculatory!!!!

Hello all.  This is my first post since i've subscribed to TNMS.  Its a Rush
sighting so here goes.  I have a game called Buried in Time, Journeyman
Project 2  (anybody know that game?)  well it's set in the 22nd century or so
and in it there's a part where there are some dossiers on some characters and
one of the characters is Neil Geddy and his interests are Baseball, The Three
Stooges, and 20th Century Rock.  coincidence?  maybe somebody on the
production team likes Rush, ya think?

   [ The guys who made this are Rush fans (and friends of mine). Their name
     is Presto Studios, named after Presto the album (it was the latest 
     Rush album at the time they came up with the name). Also one of the
     years in that game is 2112 :-)                             : rush-mgr ]

That is the sound of a heartbeat, fading out, indicating CX-1 book 2
will follow.  It is audible on my non-remaster, and on cassette.  And on
my old LP.  You just have to turn it up LOUDER.

Rather than ripping off a store by trying to exchange a non-remaster
that has a different cover, which can get you nailed for fraud, or
trying to claim your cd's never arrived from BMG here in Indpls, which
can get you nailed for fraud (US law says if it was mailed, you received
it, unless you can prove otherwise--this is why you can't skip a court
date by saying you didn't receive notice), I suggest a much easier
method:  Just walk into your local CD store with a fucking gun, point it
at the owner's head, and demand the CD.

If you are the kind of trash who thinks fraud or shoplifting is cool,
you are invited to come to MY store--I'll teargas you and cuff your ass
myself and hand you over to the cops personally--after I tattoo "LOSER"
on your chest 2112 times, so I can call in a Rush sighting (and whoever
had the 2112 Rush sighting idea, thanks, I love you.)

The stores, regardless of what you think of their service, are owned by
stockholders (PEOPLE) of all classes.  And by defrauding them, you are
taking money out of their mouths, and forcing the store (in order to
stay in business) to raise its prices and have invasive security like
cameras and goons. 

So do honest Rush fans a favor, and unsubscribe.

besides which, BMG products have their licensing stamp on them, and the
band gets less of a take, and the sound quality is inferior to standard
run disks.

<A NAME="2154017">Subject: things I like most about DS</A>

Delurking for a brief moment, I'd like to provide my 2.34 cents on DS.
Here are the finer points:

1. Cygnus X-1- This goes without saying. Alone it made the CD worth
buying.
2. The Rhythm Method- Not only a lousy means of birth control, but it's
also an awesome drum performance by our favorite percussionist. Drum
Also Waltzes rendition as good as Bruford's.
3.Animate- Very good cut of this Jungian anthem.
4.Anthem- Animated performance of the Randian manifesto.
5.Natural Science- Ahhhhhh...

The CD is great overall, but these 5 songs make it special. I like the
cardboard packaging. Now my Pearl Jam CD's don't stand out alone in a
swath of plastic cases anymore.

Hi rush-mgr,

Thought this should be thrown at the top of the next digest:

I just went to http://www.800.com and found a special on CDs - 3 for $1!
Included in the list of about 200 titles is Different Stages!!! YEAH!!!

The best part is there is NO TAX and THE SHIPPING IS FREE (I'm not sure
about overseas - this may be limited to the U.S. only)! This is not a club
you join. How do they do it???

Quantities are limited, only one deal per household, they say, so hurry and
take a look!

 Dan

P.S. If you already have Different Stages, get another copy as a Christmas
gift! They also are running a special on 3 DVDs for $1!!!

It is most definitely NOT theft. Theft is when somebody leaves the store 
without paying for the CD. What I described is merely using the policy 
of the store to your advantage. It in NO WAY harms the business. The 
Wall Music stores in the NorthEast U.S. offer this service as a way of 
getting people to pay insanely marked-up prices for the CD's. I should 
know because I worked for them for 4 years, from lowly clerk to Store 
Manager. The only harm this does is that it tends to annoy some of the 
store employees, but even they know that it does no harm to their 
business. The store experiences no 'shrink' in the inventory. All one 
has to do is say the magic words, "My CD skips".

My apologies to you, Paul. I do not mean any offense, I just wanted to 
plead my case. I do agree that the BMG scheme is totally stupid and most 
likely will destroy your credit rating somewhere down the line. Don't do 
it, boys and girls!

Hi fellow Rushians,
	Yesterday, I saw an issue of Hit Parader and it had an interview with
Geddy Lee. It said that Rush is getting ready for a world tour. This is
just what we have been waiting for. The magazine also had a cool
advertisement for DS.
	By the way, somebody was talking about that they saw a guy on Comedy
Central (who was talking about South Park) who was also waering a
Starman T-shirt. I never saw it, but a friend of mine did and he told me
about it.

Anyway, on to my 2 questions:

1)  How long has Rush been using intro music at the start of the concert?  ie,
3 Stooges on Signals, P/G tours, Cartoon guys on HYF, Presto tours, RTB?, 2001
on CP/T4E tours.  When did this start and what was it?  On ATWAS, you get the
"Alright, will you please welcome home....RUSH!" intro, then on DS Disc 3 from
the AFTK tour, a similar announcement.  What did they do on Hem tour?  PeW?
MP?  

2)  When did the rear projection screen start?  My first concert was Signals
and it was in full force then.  Anybody know or remember when and how this
started, ie, what kinds of stuff did they show during which songs?

> Anyone know anything about a band called Sky???

Yep - They were an all-instrumental, classical/rock 5-piece band,
including the legendary classical guitarist John Williams. Other
members were Francis Monkman (Drums) Herbie Flowers (Bass), Kevin Peek 
(Guitars), Tristan Fry(1st 2 albums)/Steve Gray (Keyboards). I think I 
got this right - I'm going from memory & it's been a while since I
read any of the album liner notes... I know the bass player was
featured on Jeff Wayne's "The War of the Worlds" album, and the
drummer is apparently very highly respected.

They released their first self-titled album back around 1980, and also 
released "Sky 2" (2 record set), "Sky 3", "Sky 4 - Forthcoming", "Sky
5 - Live" (2 record set), "Cadmium", and "The Great Balloon Race". I
think there may have been one more album as well. There's also a
couple of best of compilations around as well. I think my personal
favourite would be "Sky 2" - very representative of their work, plus
it features possibly their best known track - that being a
rock/guitar-based rendition of J.S. Bach's "Toccata". WooHoo! :)

It would be one hell of a lot of work.  Obviously you've never worked a
soundboard.  And they are not the Grateful Freakin Dead.  Thank God.
(Nothing wrong with the Dead.  They ain't Rush, either.)

And there would be no damn market for the disks, and they would lose the
integrity they have about perfection in their sound (even if it means
overproducing and overdubbing sometimes).

It would take no work at all.  Then all you non-bootleggers would have a
chance to hear the songs that didn't make the cut on the first live
offering in NINE years."

That's all fine and dandy in a utopian world, but it's not as easy as you
make it out to be, even with todays technology.  Pluging a DAT machine into
the headphone jack of the sound board wouldn't give you a great sounding
recording, considering the fact that hall acustics and other various
factors wouldn't allow you to get a good, round sounding recording.  The DS
CD's were recorded by a bank of ADAT-XT's recording every (well, nearly
every) microphone on and around stage.  Only then could it be EQ'd and
mixed properly into a decient recording.

In addition, don't forget that RUSH is under a contractual obligation to
Atlantic.  I'm reasonably sure that they cannot just release an album
whenever and wherever they wish.

Pete goes on to say:

"Oh, I forgot.  If Rush did that, then the recordings wouldn't be
absolutely, positively perfect and free of errors."

If you believe that DS is "positively perfect and free of errors" as you
suggest, perhaps you should go back and take a careful listen.  I
distinctly remember Neil flubbing a riff during his solo.  That and other
various minor errors were included in this release.  But let's take
something else into accout - what about the pride of the performers???  If
it were me recording a live album (and I've done my share of recording), I
would want to present my very best.  Sure they're human, and human's make
mistakes, and those mistakes are funny and humorous at times, but if I'm
plunking down $20.00+ on a recording, I would like it to be their best work.

Personally, I think they succeeded.

We are starting now, and will produce 48.  Only if there is overwhelming

You're right, of course.  I was being unforgivably lazy

FWIW, Rush played in St. Paul for the Hemispheres tour at

Hello.  It's been awhile.  Taking 6 classes this term and can proudly

Just got a look at "A Work in Progress."  Pretty good.  I mean, a non-
drummer like myself, it was entertaining and understandable.  I
personally loved watching him drum.  It amazes me how complex
his drumming is, but when he breaks it down, he presents it like
it really isn't that difficult.  I still say it is, though.

If this is already been mentioned, I apologize, but did anyone catch
the name of Neil's boat?  I believe it says Mz. Jackie.  Is Mz. the
