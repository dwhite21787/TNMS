In case anyone cares, I've fixed the problem with the funky double ending
of the last few digests.  I don't know how/why, but the file that contains
the last bit of each digest (the 'tail') which normally doesn't have the
last three lines in it got them added somehow.  This meant that when the
software put together the NMS and added those lines as it always does, they
got added to the end of the file that already had something like that at
the end, hence the duplication.  (If you're not lost by the above description,
you are in worse shape than I am!)  Anyway, the thing should be fixed now.

I shall be off work next week Mon-Wed due to the University being closed for
spring break.  I shall attempt to log on and put out a few NMSs over that
time, although there will probably not be one for Tuesday, as I'm attending
the Richmond show.  I will also try to get the FAQL out this weekend or early
next week.

Well I'm following up my post from last week regarding GOAC and Top 40 radio
with some specific information.  I think it is really interesting to note
that according to the March 6 edition of Radio and Records GOAC is now on
13 Top 40 radio stations across the country.  The stations range from the east
coast to the west coast.  I have heard that more should be adding next week.
Although it is still a bit early to tell, GOAC is making a strong showing
onTop 40 radio.  As far as rock stations go, GOAC is doing great!  In fact
believe it or not (as Lisa from Suny Buffalo notes) Bravado has just been
released from Atlantic to stations officially.  So now stations will start
playing Bravado.  And guess what, according to my friend at the record
company soon Bravado will be released to Top 40 radio.  Double Yikes!!
So Rush now has the spirit of radio.

>From the rumour mill regarding outdoor shows this summer, I have heard two
rumours:  A) Mr. Big will again be supporting and B) Rush will be doing
two nights at Jones Beach here in the New York area!!!!  More rumours
and hopefully some confirmations to follow.

Later.

<A NAME="442003">Subject: Other musical lists; Canadian opening acts</A>

Someone asked recently about a Yes mailing list -- yep, it exists, and it's
called Notes from the Edge.  The address to subscribe is... (quick shell here)
borella@snowball.cs.ucdavis.edu.

I have a suggestion for the FAQ -- although it's supposed to be a *Rush* FAQL,
it seems like THE most frequently asked question is "Does anyone know the
address for the --- mailing list", where --- is usually Yes, Led Zeppelin,
Marillion, Genesis or King Crimson.  (Obviously *excellent* taste hereabouts,
eh?)  What I suggest is that at least SOME mention of the Musical List of
Lists go in the FAQL -- such as that it's available via anan FTP at
cs.uwp.edu in the directory pub/music/something.  (Can't remember the exact
directory, but it's not too tough to find.)  Reasonable idea, no?

Next, someone asked if Voivod opened in Toronto -- I believe that was on the
Presto tour.  I remember hearing about that and wishing fervently that I could
have been there... Voivod's a most excellent group, and their latest CD is
really top notch.  Think I may go to see them later this month here in
Montreal; probably be better acoustics than at Maple Leaf Gardens anyway.

On the RTB tour, some *extremely* crappy metal band from Toronto opened in
TO, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec.  It was incredibly boring.  I was quite
disappointed at not getting to see Eric Johnson.  (And yes, all I've heard of
his was `Cliffs of Dover'.  Bodacious song, and while I generally profess
to not giving a flying you-know-what to such obviously contrived and
artificial crap as the Grammies, I would have been quite glad to see either
EJ or Rush get it.  Or Steve Howe, too bad *he* wasn't nominated for
`Masquerade' instead of all of Yes.  Or better yet for something off
Turbulence!)

Oh, one more thing -- gee, I had no idea Caress of Steel was supposed to
be a "bad" album!  Personally, I like it much more than *2112* as an album...
CoS seems to be much more coherent and together as a 35-minute unit than
does 2112.  (Same reason I prefer AFTK and PeW to Hemispheres, even though
the actual Book II Hemispheres and Strangiato make me go quite ga-ga.  So, for
that matter, do The Trees and Circumstances... it just seems like the
whole album is dominated too much by `Hemispheres', and that there just
aren't enough different songs on it.)

'Nuff rambling.

	The `Greek God' description of the 2d side of `Caress Of Steel'
was a pretty good description. It is the overall sound of that album
that I liked, and like. The differences between CoS and FBN are so
tremendous, it is apparent that the trio did an enormous amount of
growing during the time between the albums. There is a certain solidity
in the `sound' of CoS that they did not approach again, IMHO, until
`Hemispheres'. Probably due to filtering some highs.
	How many readers of this have been or are in a band that plays
music of RUSH? I used to be in one (bass, Geddy Lee has the most
difficult bass parts with the single exception of Stanley Clarke that
I've ever tried to copy), and we chose to play the ones that you NEVER
hear, such as `Tears', `Hemispheres' in it's entirety, `Beneath, Between,
and Behind', `Bastille Day', `Anthem', etc.
	The clarity of Rush, and the single mindedness of the best stuff
are what makes the band's music so classical, so intellectual. I hope
trhat they never stray from that. New musical styles, sure, just retain
the approach that makes the music so enjoyable, the straight-forward
musical interpretation of a thought, without all the cheap garbage that
doomed bands like Guns'n'Roses, which I simply will not listen to, and
Van Halen, which makes me want to vomit (with the exception of `Dance
the Night Away', which conjures up memories of a particularly good
sexual outing on a Florida beach in the moonlight!

Howdy again fellow Rush freaks...

Well, I have this to say about CoS:  It sure isn't the boyz best album, but I
like it.  I seem to be in the minority here...But I'm listening to it right 
now.
The entire album, in its entirety, does not gel with me for some reason.
However, specific songs like "Lakeside Park" or "The Necromancer" are greatly
underrated.  I'd even vote for bringing "Lakeside Park" back on the tours.
Then again maybe I'm just insane...

to do this email any updates.  Whoever should do this stands to make some cash-
what are ya waiting for?

    Second, has anyone heard if RUSH (or VH) is coming to Pittsburgh or
Cleveland for an outdoor show??  I wrote 102.5 WDVE in Pittsburgh, and I have
not gotten my SASE back yet, when I do I'll share any news.  The dj
(7 pm to midnight), Jack Malloy, did say that the promoter and the radio 
station

Does anybody know if any of Rush's album artwork is available commercially?
(i.e., some sort of poster-sized print).  I am specifically referring to the
inside of Roll the Bones (3 wishbones suspended over the water).  That has got
to be one of the coolest pictures I've ever seen.

Also, I remember somebody mentioning the Vital Signs live thing... I also
found it on a King Biscuit 'best of' kinda thing when I rummaged around at a
radio station last summer.

(By the way, KRKX in Billings, MT plays quite a bit of RUSH, as does KSUA in
Fairbanks, AK...)

  I bought a bootleg called 'Rushian Roulette' (CD) and were quite disappointed
to La villa strangiato's sound quality. There have been some serious damage
on the master tape, i suppose, because in the middle of the La villa (i don't
remember section's name) it begins to sound like a C-cassette which has been
too close to a magnet. And also in the beginning of La villa, the left (or
right?) channel fades out for a minute. It really bothers me. Anyboby else
have the same bootleg?
  I have also bootleg called 'Currently in vogue' and it sounds quite good.

<A NAME="442011">Subject: First time (be gentle)</A>

	As my subject says this is my first time posting (I've only been
a reader for about a week).  But I wanted to make a few comments.

1)  In reply to Alex(Jealous Knight)'s question about The Necromancer and
J.R.R. Tolkien's works.  I am and Avid fan of his Middle Earth works and
have practically memorized half of them (I'm working on the other half).
There are one or two similarities between the song and the stories but
not enough to say that it's based on the stories.  Maybe losely inspired
by.

2)  In reply to however's initial coment on CoS.  I also feel it's a great-
ly underrated album.  It was coherent but also had a wonderful veriety of
styles (compare 'Bastille Day' and 'Panecea' sp?).

3)  In reply to Larry Salomon's question about childhood-RUSH memories.
Unfortunately I led an underprivelegded childhood (aka I didn't discover
RUSH until late in life).  But I do have some good RUSH memories.  But
this leads into my next topic.

4)  I've noticed, in this area at least, a big corolation between RUSH fans
and sci-fi/fantasy and GPR's(e.g. AD&D).  Is this true in most areas?  Is
it a coincedence that many of the old songs seem to be written for that
audience?  Quite often when our group gets together to play AD&D (or others)
we have RUSH playing in the backround as 'mood music'.  Weird?

5)  As I mentioned earlier,  I discovered RUSH late in life.  Unfortunately
, as a result, I have yet to see them live!  Due to a small arguement with
my credit card company I missed the Pennsylvania date.  I've downloaded
the remaining tour dates from the ftp site but I've heard talk about addi-
tional dates (summer) that aren't on the list.  I would be really grateful
to get notice of any, especially if they are near north-central West Virginia.
Especially if the rumors of this being their last tour are true (unlikely).

Thank you for your time.  Responces are welcomed, flames will probably be
ignored.  P-]

   Gregg, we all know already that you worship Rush as gods, but perhaps
 you should be reminded like this every once in a while that they are just
 human beings like everyone else. And the fact that you think their lyrics
 are the best in rock history doesn't make your opinion the gospel truth.

Well, there are three ways that I know of:
 1) Get a spot first in line to get tickets the day they go on sale
    at a reputable ticket outlet (if you can call TM reputable).
    Hints on details here were given seveal issues back... December,
    I think.  And there's my own personal victory here: get tickets
    from an outlet 200 miles from the show (stood in line at a Tower
    Records near San Jose for a show in Sacramento, CA, and ended up
    in the third row -- Thanks for the tip, Doug).
 2) Sometimes, tickets held back for the band or promoters are left
    over up to the show's date.  Pester TM starting a week before
    the show and see if new seats are available.  Example: called TM
    while in Atlanta (for business... yeah, sure), and when I asked
    if seats were available for Rush that night, the guy on the phone
    said: "Oh, I thought you were going to ask about U2" (sold out for
    months)... Some spare seats in the back of the floor had just become
    available (who could resist).  Of course he had nothing for Rush then,
    but some went on sale that day at 11:00 (only 40 seats, but it was
    unadvertized, so there was not much of a demand).
 3) Look in the Yellow Pages (no pun intended for you Sun employees) under
    "Ticket Sales" or something like that.  Every major metro area has
    some scalper who is willing to buy and sell tickets for a premium,
    and they usually hire people to stand first in line to get the good seats.
    Many of these places advertize that they can get tickets for shows all

Hello all! I have read the latest chatter about lack of CoS
material on the current tour playlist (like none!) with great
interest, being that CoS ranks as one of my top three fav
Rush recordings.

Those of you who heard the last Rockline interview with Neil might
recall that a caller asked that very question! Neil's response went
something like " it's nothing intentional" then went on to say
something to the effect of "we don't really feel comfortable
playing any material from that record now". To me that sounds
like a bit of a contradiction. Maybe the painful memories of the
"Down the Tubes Tour" have something to do with it? If memory
serves me, it was mentioned in Visions that the Boyz were super
excited and pleased with what they had accomplished on that
record, only to be shot down in flames by poor albums sales, negative
feedback from the record company, and the following tour from hell.

"Scars of pleasure, scars of pain, atmospheric changes make them
sensitive again".

Cheers,

----Dave

	Well, I'd just like to mention that this is my first posting here, and
I've been reading the
I've been reading the NMS for about a month, and I really like it.  Anyhow,
doen to business:
	First of all, about these rumors of Neil having cancer, I first heard
about it from a CD store clerk one day when I was trying to uncover the release
date of RTB ( this was back about July of '91).  Well, I always wondered if
there was any credence to this rumor, and seeing Neil with a bandana on when
I saw the Roll the Bones video just added to my suspicions.  However, I went
to the show on February 2 in Vancouver B.C., and during the sound check, Neil
emerged without his bandana, and we could all see that he just had a really sh
short crewcut, and was not bald.  IMO, there's no cancer.  I just think
Neil is wearing the bandana because he WANTS to...
	Second, in response to whoever was wondering in NMS 440 why Where's
My Thing? was part 4 of a trilogy, it's all a joke.  Geddy and Alex pretty
much explained it during the North American CD launch of RTB on August 29th
of '91.  For the benefit of those who did not hear it, here's a partial 
transcri
transcription;

Alex: Well, normally most people don't write the fourth part of a trilogy,
      so we though we would.
Geddy:And because most people don't realize that you CAN have a fourth part!

Alex: Yeah, it goes to fourth!

	So there you have it!

	On another note, DID ANYONE get the ABC interview on tape?  PLEASE
email me if you did!  I am dying to see it!
	And finally, does anyone know how to get ahold of UK CD singles herere
  in
the United States?

ORQ: "A spirit with a vision is a drea with a mission."

This is my first time posting for TNMS, and I'd like to give
a few opinions on the most important things happening with
Rush.

1) The great Eric Johnson Controversy.  He's a good
guitarist, but to me Alex Lifeson is highly underrated.
He's not god, but Snow Dog gets my thumbs up.

2) In Concert '92.  Thd very first time I've heard Ged, Neil
and Alex talk.  Does MTV avoid putting Rush on 'cause their
too deep?  Or is it they actually have more talent, and
would be repulsed by their talent?  Maybe they're nearing 40
and have the sexiness of a baboon in terms of MTV?

3) The Neil Peart cancer controversy.  You know something, I
get PISSED when someone tells these non-contestable rumors.
Why is Neil still on tour?  He looks pale and tired, but not
walking-dead.  To those who like to tell rumors,
if you know, show, don't tell. (pun intended)  Otherwise
keep quiet.

4) Top 5 Songs:  1) The Pass	2) Freewill	3) 2112
	4) Subdivisions		5) Natural Science

5) Top 5 Albums  1) Permanent Waves	2) Moving Pictures
3) Roll The Bones	4) Signals	5) Chronicles
