Also, A Total Recall special on MTV featured Show, Don't Tell. Here in
Little Rock, there is a video production company called Show Me, and their
ad features Show, Don't Tell.

I remember in High School, when they would show you those Say No To Drug films,
   the song "Camera Eye" was used. Rush is used quite often, but most people 
   will hear it and not think anything of it.

Hi,
I was wondering if anyone had decode ANAGRAM(for Mongo). If this has already
come up, sorry. Either way can somebody send me a copy if there is one.

I remember reading here in the RushList several months ago (gee, last
semester!) about Ayn Rand's influence on Rush and its music. I seem
to have lost that posting.  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to
that connection.

Any casual listening of 2112 will reveal that *someone* had been reading
_Anthem_, one of Rand's most interesting novels.  (Hm, wonder if Anthem
Records has anything to do with this?)  I remember a discussion about
Rush perhaps plagiarizing _Anthem_ with 2112...

As an avid reader of and student of Ayn Rand's works, I would
appreciate any input on this matter.

Incidentally, I have been reading about the Chronicles debate. I wonder
if "Show Don't Tell" appeared on Chronicles because Rush went back
to Mercury? I remember in 1981 when the Who moved to Warner Bros (and
only put out 2 albums); MCA since bought the rights to "Face Dances
and "It's Hard".  So it's possible that Mercury just bought the rights
to _Presto_.  Difficult to imagine, but...

Thanks for the help.
