The QT version of the commercial has been fixed. I also forgot to flatten
the file, so only macintosh users would've been able to see the one I uploaded
yesterday (hah hah to those with pc's :-)

I'll try to dig up the information where I purchased the Japan version of
DS, but there's no guarantee they'll have any left. I ordered it waaaaay 
before it was released...

And can we please not flame each other, talk about fraud, theft or the

<A NAME="2155002">Subject: Hall of Fame</A>

Ok, this post is going to be SOMEWHAT tongue-in-cheek, but I am actually
half-serious about it!

Okay... you know how EVERY YEAR around this time, people start having
these "Ribbon Campaigns" for all sorts of topics.  When I was in high
school, it was red ribbons to support Students Against Drunk Driving.
Later it was yellow ribbons to support the Gulf War Veterans, pink
ribbons to support breast cancer victims, and so on and so forth.
EVERY YEAR there's a new ribbon.

So why don't *WE* organize a ribbon campaign, it could be called the
RED STAR RIBBON campaign to support "Getting Rush Inducted Into The
Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame".  We could go out and tie black ribbons
with red pentagrams to the antennas on all the cars.  Go up and down
your local main street, hit all the parking lots (especially the malls),
then stick flyers under people's car wipers, in their mailboxes, etc.

We're bound to get some media attention sooner or later, and especially
at this time of year.  So whaddya say?  Anyone know where we could get
several thousand black ribbons with red pentagrams on short notice?

Like I said, tongue-in-cheek, but I'm half serious.  TNMS wants to get
250,000 electronic signatures, and they only have about 5000 so far.
I'm sure that must include just about everyone on this mailing list,
but where are the other 245,000 signatures going to come from?  Are we
going to have to teach our dogs how to use email so they can register
for the electronic petition too?

If the idiotic "Powers That Be" don't want to listen to reason and DO
THE RIGHT THING, how will we ever get OUR BAND awarded the honor that
they so justly deserve?  Keep in mind that these are the same idiotic
powers that gave a grammy for Best Instrumental to some crap song (from
The Police I think?) instead of YYZ back in the early 80's.

How can a band with a 25-year history, 16 studio albums, and 21.5
million units sold (57th on the all-time list) be consistently ignored
like this?  Even the damn record company ignores them, AND WE STILL
make the albums go GOLD.

I didn't even know this until I contacted the Recording Industry Assn
of America (http://208.240.92.66), but EVERY SINGLE RUSH ALBUM,
including the live albums, including the two compilations (Chronicles
and Archives), have ALL GONE AT LEAST GOLD.  And 13 have gone either
Platinum or Multi-Platinum.  They're 13th on the list of ALL-TIME MOST
NUMBER OF GOLD AWARDS.  (See a pattern of "unlucky 13" emerging here?)

Something just ain't right here.  I felt it in my gut already, and now
that I satisfied my penchant for STATISTICS, I feel it in my brain too.

C'est la vie.  In the meantime, do everything you can to campaign for
Rush's inclusion in "The Hall", and check out my new RUSH TRIBUTE page
at the address below.  Now that I'm armed with all these statistics
from RIAA, I'll just HAVE to find somewhere to post them on my site.
Maybe later this week.   :-)

Seeya,

As of 12.08.98 we have not received this item in stock.  We

Hey Rush heads:

My sincerest apology to Denimking for stating that he is a thief and should
not steal or commit mail fraud.  I realize that my statement was improper
and hasty.

I did not realize, Denimking, that you were only telling us how to steal,
not telling us to steal.  Your disclaimer at the end showed me the error of
my ways.

Once again, my apologies.  I guess that you are not a thief or a fraud.  I
guess you are merely a cop-out, loser scum-bag who can't even own up to his
own mistakes.  We all make mistakes, Denimking.  The mark of a true
gentleman and mature adult is one who can admit that he was wrong.  

Flame all you want, dude.  I am confident in my abilities, and back up
everything I say unlike you of meager cerebrum.  For once in your life,
stand up for what you say and be a man!

Once again, your parents should have taught you better.

Peace,
Max

>From #35 to #97 ???????
I think our band is truly dead in America (not in our hearts of course)..
I swear that if it were not for TNMS I would'nt have even known that
"Different Stages" was released..
NO KIDDING !!!!!!
No flyers, no advertising, NO NOTHING !!!!!
Maybe in the bigger cities but here in the great center of
Wisconsin.......NOTHING !!!!!
 ----------------
   Yes.  Rush has lost 80 pounds, but so have his ratings, 80psi of hot air,
   that is.  Thank goodness for that.

   Oh, yeah, the band.  Well, strike it up for America.  Non-car sales exceeded
   car sales for the first time last month in the US as well.  Which just blows
   for those of us who realize just how practical F-350 4x4 w/ dualies and a
   super cab pickup truck are not for just plain ol' driving to and from work,
   and instead foolishly choose to hold on to our little Japo or Euro sports
   cars, and wish that more people drove them instead to and from work...

 ------------------------
I do wonder why the record company does'nt market the CD like they do other
artists ????
 ------------

   Just look at American buying trends of the past few years...
   "More is better". "Newer is better than old".  Rush is old.
   Almost geezer old.

   Oh, the price per pound for a Chevy Suburban is about 1/4th that of a new
   Chevy Corvette...better get that Sub!  OK, but do you regularly pull
houses around town for your job?
 ------------
Don't get me wrong.....I am surely not saying Rush should "sell out"...NOT
AT ALL!!!!
BUT #35 to #97 ??????   ....This is a MUST cd for even the modest Rush fan
!!! (for lack of better terms).
 ------------
   Yeah, it is.  But too many people are too much into trying to find the
   next "In" thing, be it Leanne Rhymes, Puffy Daddy, Pat Boone, or whatever,
   and be associated with it until it starts running out of steam.  Sort of
   like a musical stock market with too many people invested, as
   it were, in hyper-aggressive "growth" funds and overinflated Internet
   stocks.  Except unfortunately there isn't a musical equivalent of a
   S&P 500 (that Rush would be a part of) to keep all the hypsters
realistic.
 ------------
yeah Yeah I know....it's a LIVE 3 CD set...it's not expected to sell as
well....BUT STILL !!!!!
For a band with such a huge fan base I figured that sales would be much
higher...
I think it's pretty obvious that the "word" is NOT out !!!!
THANK YOU CANADA.....for keeping these guys in business...
 ------------
   Yes, the word is NOT out.  But at least it's selling at Costco (of course,
   that could be a bad sign in and of itself).  I'm sure the new Bruce Hornsby
   (for example) double-disc release, which is really good, by the way,
   is withering on the vine also, even though there have been a few TV
   commercials pumping it...

   On the plus side, let's compare Rush to a cookie...

   Rush, the Malomars of rock bands...

   I wonder where the pressures to NOT push Rush are?  are they from the band?
   Are they from deals that Atlantic has signed with other bands that require
   so much more investment in energy, effort and $$$ from Atlantic that
   prohibit them from really lifting much of a finger for a band like Rush?
 ------------
Oh well that's my thought for the day

RE:  David_Berg@stream.com's post asking about Geddy's bass solo in
Driven.

David-
I was at the Meadowlands show in December '96, and I distinctly
remember Geddy doing a bass solo in Driven that was very similar to
what's on DS.  Of course I can't remember it EXACTLY, but I do remember
hearing him do the "echoing" notes which are on the CD starting at 2:00
minutes into the track.

As for the guy yelling "Shake it off Alex", I think it may have been a
reference to the fact that Geddy was doing a solo instead of Alex for
once... Could be???

I write:

I was at the show in Chicago from which Driven was recorded.  Alex's =
guitar feed goes out shortly before the solo.  It also goes out again =
towards the end of the song.  I find it hard to believe Ged would have =
chosen this particular performance over one where Alex's guitar feed was =
working if there wasn't something unique (Ged's solo) about the =
performance.  I accept that this premise could be flawed.

Hey everyone! I found a site that has an actual red Barchetta. It's made by
Maserati. This car is newer than the song so I'm sure that there are more of
them (unless of course the car was named after the song). If I'm not
mistaken, Fiat made one too. If anyone knows of others or if the word
"Barchetta" has a specific meaning, post it or let me know privately. I know
this might seem like an ignorant pursuit to some of you. I'm just trying to

<A NAME="2155014">Subject: DS Review and Interviews</A>

Well, I managed to pick up not one but *two* new magazines with Rush 
pieces in them.  The first one I'm going to transcribe for ya is a 
complimentary review taken from Classic Rock magazine:

Different Stages
8 stars out of 10

With the precision of master craftsmen, Rush follow a quartet of studio 
albums with their fourth live release.  The Canadian trio's previous 
live albums have celebrated the recent past by concentrating almost 
exclusively on their immediate studio predecessors, thereby neatly 
drawing each chapter of their history to a close.  But on this occasion, 
as the title suggests, the band acknowledge the days of yore with a host 
of old favourites scattered among newer material as they dip in and out 
of their history at will.
'Different Stages' forms a three-CD set, with the first two discs 
consisting of material drawn from the band's tours to support their two 
most recent studio releases, 'Counterparts' and 'Test For Echo'.  Disc 3 
represents a trip way back to the band's 1978 Hammersmith Odeon Show.
Its the latter that will be of greatest interest to the completists, but 
truth told its a bit of a disappointment.  All the old favourites from 
the early days are here, from 'Working Man' to the much maligned 'By Tor 
& The Snow Dog'.  However, in comparison to the refreshing treatment 
that hoary old classics such as '2112', 'Tom Sawyer' and 'Closer to the 
Heart' receive over the course of the first two discs, the '78 gig 
sounds its age.
So then to the first two discs themselves.  While 'Presto' is almost 
ignore completely - 'Show Don't Tell' is its sole representative - the 
band concentrate more on 'Roll The Bones' and the harder-edged material 
of their two most recent releases.  For all the criticism they attracted 
for their experiments in the '80s with a panoply of keyboards, you could 
argue that Rush have prolonged their existence as a result.  But the 
comparative shunning of 'Presto' and the complete absence of any tracks 
from 'Hold Your Fire' (a contender for the band's best album of the 
'80s) suggest that Rush will not be heading down that particular 
synth-lined avenue again.
There's no doubt that Rush as a band have matured beautifully.  The 
playing on the first two discs is awesome, with bassist Geddy Lee's 
performance standing out in particular.  While his famously manic vocals 
have calmed down over the years, his bass work becomes increasingly 
virtuoso.  And while we're on the subject of musicianship, Neil Peart's 
drum solo reaches a level of invention that mere mortal rock drummers 
can only aspire to.
If ever there was a justification for live albums, the first two-thirds 
of 'Different Stages' is it.  Altered arrangements, extended sections 
and the sheer intensity of playing make this a very worthy companion to 
its studio cousins.
Given the band's increasing reluctance to tour and the personal 
tragedies that have befallen Peart recently, the prospect of Rush 
returning to these shores to play live seems unlikely.  In the 
circumstances their fans would be well advised to savour the delights of 
this collection.

Not too shabby, eh?  Look out for transcriptions of interviews from the 
above magazine and also Bassist Magazine (Geddy made the cover, it's a 
killer photo of him!) - these transcriptions will soon be hitting an NMS 
issue near you...

    Is this guy a drummer? I though I was the only drummer who could notice
the change of key (not to say I would know what key either the original or
live version was in!)
    But when I noticed the change of key was in concert here in Atlanta. It
almost sounded TWO whole steps lower! The first few riffs from Alex's guitar
sounded to me like he had broke a string or something.  I quickly realized
that it was just in a different key and just got lost in the song, so I
didn't even think about it until the release of DS.
    Anyway DS is the best live album I have ever heard, and I plan on
listening to the drum solo every single time the album is played (to the
chumps who won't and are criticizing the professor). Also I was very pleased
to see the space shuttle stuff in the pictures. I grew up 10 minutes from
Cape Kennedy and have seen it all of my life, so it was cool seeing it so
connected with RUSH!

I would say the most striking growth took place between 1976 and 
1981 - six short years!  Don't forget that Moving Pictures was 
nearly *18* years ago, and I can't honestly say that I think they
have grown very much since then, musically speaking.

Yes they can, but since we pay to listen to them, whether on a CD

I feel that production on DS is piss poor.  Here is what I think they
should have done:

Plan a two night stand a couple of months after opening night with a
professional live music production company.  In those two months, the
band would have time to master their live sound.  The production company
records, then mixes the CD with the band and a renowned producer (Steve
Lillywhite, David Hentschel.)  My point is:  let someone who does this
for a living take care of a live CD.  All of these recordings were taken
from Rush's own soundman (Robert S.) and mixed from ADAT's.  It's no
wonder why the CD sounds so compressed and noisy.  How hard can three
guys be to record??  Where is the clarity and room for dynamics that I
hear in other bands live recordings.  The mix sounds just like the audio
mix of the laserdisc of ASOH.  That was also produced by Geddy.  I think
Geddy should stick to bass instead of sitting in front of a sound
console.

Dear All,

I guess the time has come for me to explain myself.  I wrote the little
clip about artists abusing articles in their band names and song titles
that went like so (if you will allow my to quote myself):

>Rush Friends,

>Dare I add fuel to the fire?  There is yet another missing article.  I

Anyway, it was meant to be a joke.  In my own strange, sarcastic way, I
purposely misused articles (dropping them, adding them, using them
incorrectly) in the last paragraph in order to make the point that I
didn't think it was that big of a deal whether or not articles were
included in song titles. My purpose was not to rip on people who do
think that it is important.  I was just playing around.  I was in a
weird mood and started typing. 

Since then I have gotten more than one response personally, and I have
seen further posts regarding the same.  That is an obvious clue to me
that it wasn't very funny.  Any time you have to explain your joke, that
means it sucks.  My apologies.  In the future, I will keep my bizarre,
and obviously lame attempt at humor to myself . . . (and there was much
rejoicing).

They return it to the MFR, who then does not compensate them, as it it

they have one less saleable copy, and not due to mfr defect.  That is a
reduction in inventory.  You claim to have worked in retail.  You should
know this.

Besides which, it is dishonest.

<article>   
   Rush displays diversity in new 'Different Stages' 
   
   by ADAM MACHANIC
   Senior Staff Writer
   
   The music of Rush has evolved and transcended musical barriers over
   the years in a way that few bands have been able to match. From early
   heavy metal anthems to later progressive rock hits, the band has
   continued to change and grow, never allowing its music to become
   stale.
   
   Rush's newest album, Different Stages, could not be more aptly named.
   This live three-CD set contains music from every stage of the band's
   career. Further, it documents the musicians' superior skill as live
   performers. From a band that is known for ten- month-long,
   200-show-tours, Different Stages is a description of a way of life for
   the members of Rush.
   
   The first two disks are comprised of the best versions of songs from
   over 100 live performances recorded during the Test For Echo tour in
   1997. Rush has never been known as a band to disappoint an audience,
   and this collection of songs is quite amazing.
   
   Half of the songs offered are taken from more recent albums such as
   Test For Echo, Counterparts, and Roll the Bones. Also included,
   however, are the band's most popular radio hits -- "Closer to the
   Heart," "Limelight," "Tom Sawyer," and "The Spirit of Radio," as well
   as memorable renditions of less-known Rush songs such as "The Trees,"
   and the "2112" suite in its entirety.
   
   The fact that the members of Rush are able to balance such a diverse
   amalgamation of songs is further testament to how they have managed to
   remain popular for over 25 years. Somehow, the electronic-infused
   "2112" sounds good when paired with a mournful "Closer to the Heart."
   The contemporary rock sounds of "Test For Echo" compliment an epic
   "Freewill." Everything manages to mesh, and only the most perceptive
   listener can tell that the music spans such a long time period.
   
   The first disk is not purely music; it also contains a CD-ROM
   component. The ClusterWorks program that is included seems at first
   like a strange accompaniment for Rush's music. It is best described as
   an interactive work of art. As the user moves the mouse around the
   screen, showers of pixels form in various psychedelic patterns,
   responding to user input. Likewise, notes begin playing in a way that
   is all at once subtle, minimalistic, and yet somehow perfect for what
   happens on the screen.
   
   ClusterWorks has dozens of user-modifiable settings, including a
   screen-saver mode. Although the idea sounds strange at first, the
   program soon becomes highly addictive. Regardless of the fact that it
   has nothing to do with Rush, the program recalls laser-light shows, an
   early Rush staple. Its continually morphing textures draw a parallel
   to the ever changing music of the band. Either way, the program is
   really, really cool, and that's probably the reason that it was
   included.
   
   The true gem of "Different Stages" is the third disk. This is a
   recording of a single concert at the Hammersmith Odeon Theater in
   London from February, 1978. A much younger version of the band
   delivers an energy that somehow is not present in the live tracks on
   the other two disks. The music is more raw, more intense, and somehow
   more real. Included are Rush favorites such as "Bastille Day,"
   "Working Man," and "Fly By Night." Both seasoned Rush fanatics and new
   listeners should find this disk to be especially enjoyable.
   
   As this is Rush's fourth live album, there were doubts that it would
   live up to the quality and reputation that the band has built for
   itself over the years. All doubts have been shattered. Different
   Stages is yet another masterpiece amongst so many other albums that
   Rush has given its fans over the years.

I remember about 5 or 6 issues ago, someone posted an interview with Geddy
Lee.  It was the one where, at the end, he started talking about the
meaning of The Spirit of Radio, and about how the corporate battle is over
and we lost, and how all radio is for is to pummel you to death with the
same song every hour.  I was talking to Slacker, the night DJ on 99.7 KY
in Kansas City, and he said that he can't play as much Rush as he would
like because "all the corporate bullshit."  I told he I would send him a
Geddy Lee quote on that subject, if I could find it.  If anybody still has
that TNMS issue, or knows where I can find that interview on the web,
please let me know.  Or, if you would be willing to type out that last

The 'Tour of the Hemispheres' featured much the same opening

Well, I remember an interview conducted with Alex in June '1977, by
Metro Radio (Newcastle, NE England) wherein the interviewer 
congratulated Alex on their tremendous light-show presentation.  
Alex replied by saying thanks very much, but actually due to 
constraints imposed by playing much smaller stages in England, 
they had not been able to bring their rear-projection stuff over 
with them.  The first time I remember rear-projection being used in
England was on the brief tour they did before PeW (much bigger
halls by then).  I remember the Starman being displayed during
2112, but for the life of me I can't remember what else was shown.

How have you arrived at the conclusion that the sound quality of BMG
products is inferior to "standard run" disks?  A CD is a CD, and digital is
digital.  Manufacturers don't make separate CD pressings for retailers and
marketers like BMG or Columbia House.  If you disagree, I invite you to
prove me wrong.
