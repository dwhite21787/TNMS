     I was reading the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine yesterday, and
came across a survey in which readers voted for the "best" of quite a large
number of musical categories.  Anyway...Geddy Lee got the fifth-largest amount
of votes in the Best Bassist category (winner: Flea of the Red Hot Chili
Peppers) and Neil got third place in Best Drummer (winner: Larry Mullen of
U2.)  Considering virtually all of the other placings went to trendy,
mainstream bands (after all, this IS Rolling Stone) it was nice to see such
support for our faves.
    "New World Man" is seriously Rush's only top 40 hit?!  Jeez...I don't even
like that song...I would have thought that Tom Sawyer would have made it at
least, or maybe Dreamline or Ghost of a Chance from RTB, both of which I heard
on the radio quite often at one point.

I for one see no problem with Dan's polls.  I think they fit in with the
purpose of TNMS (MHO) by being informative, getting people involved and giving
us something to discuss when the results come out.  So, as far as I'm concerned
keep up the good work Dan!

That's one voice from the multitude, what does everyone else think?  We know
that one person doesn't like the polls, is he an isolated case or are there
others?  I think we should support Dan and his polls.  He puts a lot of work
into them and does a good job.  (once again MHO).

<A NAME="632005">Subject: More literary allusions (TS Eliot this time)</A>

Here's another one from the literary allusion files:

I was reading "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" by T.S. Eliot one
evening, and came across the following lines (around line 100):

	And would it have been worth it, after all
	Would it have been worth while,
	After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
	After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that
		trail along the floor -
	And this, and so much more? -
	It is impossible to say just what I mean!
	But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a
		screen:
	Would it have been worth while
	If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
	And turning toward the window, should say:
		"That is not it at all,
		That is not what I meant, at all."

Does anyone else see the similarity with *Open Secrets* here,
or was I just listening to HYF while reading that? The poem itself
strikes me as having similar sentiments as other songs on HYF, notably
*Time Stand Still*, and I imagined that perhaps Neil had just read
this (or reread it) while writing the lyrics for HYF.

So, this is your mission, if you choose to accept it. Go to your
library, get a good poetry anthology and read this poem. Then let me
know if I am just giving Neil more credit than he deserves (literary
allusion is a great thing, IMHO) or if you see the similarity
too. Also: what literary works do you think would provide good
inspiration for Rush songs in the future (we've already got Ayn Rand,
Dylan Thomas, John Dos Passos, Tolkien, etc.)?

<A NAME="632006">Subject: New World Man & why in Top-40 then....</A>

There are really three reasons why New World Man went Top-40 when Signals
came out:

1) Hit a moment in time when the "white reggae" sound of the Police, ska bands
and the Clash were coming out on the streets to the mainstream radio
acceptance.  With the great beat of the song, lower frequencies in the vocals
on behalf of Ged ( eg. no screetch vocals), and bouncy keyboards and bass
lines it attracts one's ears.  In short, precipitous timing for release.

2) Signals, as an album, seemed to be getting a great deal more push
by the record company in promotional output, via the radio stations and
the trade magazines.  In wake of the tremendous success of MP and ESL, there
was fortunately/unfortunately (depends if you believe in industry buzzwords)
a real momentum of great acceptance at a broader level of the public with the
band.  More females and a wider demographic range were tuning into the band.
Therefore, the radio stations were tuning into the song NWM.  Hence, a
foray into the Top-40.

3)  A relatively shorter time period for the song, then what was previously
(incorrectly) perceived by program directors and dj's that Rush was only
an "epic" conceptual album side long only band,....read, too long for most
formats in radio.  With radio seeing a song that fit a Dick Clark outlook,
(a good beat and you _can_ dance to it) and being under 6 minutes, it
fit into the newly developing formating slot of FM and AM radio, int eh
the early 80-'s.

Personally, the song is a Rush song.  People in the world only just
caught up to understanding and LISTENING to the band a little closer.
People just lost their attention spans and went onto their new flavour of the
month a little later.  Rush just went onto produce greater and intricate music
in different styles, thereby pissing off non-AOR formatted radio stations.

Then, no more Top-40 hits....

Any comments people on the above blathering...?

If you're talking about the same thing I'm thinking about, they're
called Ultradisc.  I can't remember who makes them, but I'll look
and post it as soon as I can.  They have an 800 phone number so you
can call and get a free catalog.  I ordered one and haven't gotten it
yet.  There was a question brought up about them in Stereo Review.
Supposedly, the gold will never deteriorate.  (I don't see my
regular CD's wearing out anytime in the near future, though.)  I've
talked with someone who compared _The Wall_ on Ultradisc and the regular
one and couldn't find the slightest differnce.  Anyhow, Moving Pictures
is the only Rush album that I know of on UD.  I'll post the company
name and number incase anyone's interested.

Keep the polls coming, Dan. They ARE interesting and as long as you keep
getting a good number of votes, then you should keep doing it. Just ignore
these people who bitch about it. They don't have to read the polls, let
alone vote. You're never going to please everybody, no matter what you do.
>From now on, tell them to "kiss some gluteus max." :)

Regarding 2112 on the radio, I've heard it before and just about shit
myself. It kinda doesn't count though, since it wasn't a "mass appeal"
radio station. Back when I was on my co-op (ie. making money unlike now), I
worked at a plant that was near a small town in Ohio called Streetsboro.
There is a public access station there, which I believe to be run by high
school students, cuz it was only on the air from like 8-5, and not at all
during Christmas break. Anyway, I used to listen to them all the time cuz
they played a lot of good heavy metal and progressive rock, including a
good deal of Rush. The only bad thing is, their range was only about a 10
mile radius, and since I was driving home, I was out of range by the time
"Temples" was finished... oh well..

See you all at convention in June!....

<A NAME="632009">Subject: Re: 24K Original Gold Masterdisk MP</A>
Date: Fri, 26 Feb 93 21:43:00 CST

	In reference to the post by
	LAUGHREN DENNIS P <laughren@spot.Colorado.EDU>, he mentions the
original Masterdisc recording of MP released by Mobile Fidelity.  There is some
background on this that NMS readers may or may not want to know...

	The recording is taken from the original masters of the album, not
copies of the master recordings used to make normal commercially available
discs of MP.  Since MP was most likely recorded with analog equipment, these
copies of the masters are not up to the signal quality of the original masters,
but with digital recordings, the generation of the recording wouldn't make a
difference.  The original master recordings, however, have lost none of the
signal that was originally put on the tape (disregarding tape degradation over
time, of course).  That basically means that the signal coming off the
Masterdisc recording is as true to the original recordings as possible without
breaking into Polygram's vaults.  Also, you may or may not like the novelty
of having a a limited edition version of MP.  (I am seriously considering it,
though... :-})  Another benefit of the Masterdisk is that it is recorded on
Gold, which doesn't degrade quite as quickly (reletively speaking) as the
Aluminum on which normal CD's are recorded.  Tests have shown that CD's
will degrade measurably due to oxidation from the seal plastic breaking down
in about 10-15 equivilent years.  This is counteracted by the Gold.  So if
all this is worth 100% more to you, buy the Masterdisc, if not, the original,
Aluminum Polygram release will be just fine...

<A NAME="632010">Subject: Why New World Man was in top 40</A>

This is pretty simple, if you think about it.  Rush's biggest album ever
had just been released a little over a year before, and there was still
quite a lot of interest in it (I'm talking about Moving Pictures, of
course).  Anyway, when the single "New World Man" was released in fall
1982, right before Signals, people were very excited about the new Rush
song and album.  My guess is that the radio requests were what primarily
drove "New World Man" into the top 40, though I can see a few Rush
fantatics buying the singe and not holding out a week for the album to
come out. :^)

I never rank this among Rush's best songs, but always found it pleasant
to listen to.  Many of the "old Rush" fans hated this song, as they
consider it the mark of Rush's "change".  [please don't start a flame
war over this; I'm just giving some background trivia]

<A NAME="632011">Subject: 4th member/guitar dubs during solo</A>

Hey Robert:
Thanks for the repost on the subject. It got me thinking as to what
I really wanted to say. I'm not sure what I wrote earlier exactly
(safe, eh?) but what I was trying to convey was the fact that
after listening to the actual albums for so long and becoming
'programmed' by their sound, I would get this empty, kind of
'something's missing' feeling when I listened to ATWAS. This
does not necessarily mean I don't like it. On the contrary,
I enjoy the raw sound, and like the trio aspect alot more than
part over part over part over part... However, it was just a
feeling I would get when, lets say, listening to 2112 and
alex would do a solo - the rhythm guitar was missing and I
would 'feel' it gone..

well anyway, while on live topics, I wish they would have released
a live album or video- I particularly liked this tour over
presto - maybe sound quality (I believe they brought back
the surround sound modules and the sound man from HYF??
can anyone confirm this?)

till next tour-
Chris

Hi all.....
I'd have to say (in regards to a post in #631) that many rock drummers these
days are influenced by Neil Peart.  I have seen a great many concerts in the
last five years, and I always find myself turning to the person next to me
during the drum solo and saying something to the effect of: "Gee, that sounds
a whole lot like Neil Peart.

Alex Van Halen, and others.  I saw Guns N' Roses last Tuesday in Austin
Texas, and Matt Gunner's solo had some of the same stuff.  ZZ Top's drummer,
and more.  I can see why they do it though. Neil has paved the road, and
everyone else is riding on it.

Thank you Puanani, at last, someone told me the answer to my question! :)

I agree also, that MTV should try to do a Rockumentary about Rush.  Why not?
They are one of the oldest bands around, and their influence is uncomperable.
Lets all write to those guys at MTV and tell them about the opportunity they
have chosen to ignore all these years.

Oh yeah, Lars Ulrich also sounds like NP during his drum solo too.

Don't forget to vote for your favorite song.  Just Email me!

Thanks.  Later.

Greetings fellow Rushians!

This is actually a question concerning something our rush-mgr said.

rush-mgr, someone ( I don't remember who) asked if Rush ever won a
Grammy award. You responded by saying that they never won an award, but
YYZ and Where's My Thing were nominated for best rock instrumental.
I remember about YYZ being nominated, but for the life of me I can't
remember what song beat it. I really would appreciate if you or
anyone else reading this could let me know the answer to this.
I also want to know what song beat Where's My Thing. I don't even
remember that song being nominated, and that was recent.

   [ I believe that Eric Johnson's song "Cliffs Of Dover" beat out "Where's My
     Thing?"... as for "YYZ" I don't remember...  		   : rush-mgr ]

Howdy all!
    I am currently listening to the Agora Ballroom '74 show and it just struck
me that during "The Best I can" Alex sings with Ged during the chorus.  You 
know, he doesn't sound half bad...I don't know whether this had to do with the 
mix or vocal processing (doubtful that effective processing was available in 
1974)...but the point is, has Alex gotten worse at singing, or did he just 
have good luck on this particular show?  Everything that I have from (oh...
let's estimate) Signals through Hold Your Fire tours Alex quite frankly sounds 
a bit like a dying cow.  (Flames?)  I do think that he has improved a bit 
during the Presto and RTB tours...but that's probably because the amount of 
singing that he actually does live on those tours is much greater than that of 
the aforementioned tours.  Just a note, but if anyone is interested, Geddy's 
bass playing on these early shows is just entertaining as hell.  Talk about 
energy.  Oh well.  Just a bit of discussion for no reason.  Thanks for 
listening.

<A NAME="632016">Subject: Re: Presto spine & Tour Dates listing</A>

Firstly, I'd like to point out that the Canadian (Anthem) release of
_Presto_ had the spine the right way 'round (i.e. the same as most
CD's).  Also, the label side of the CD is solid red with black (I
believe) printing, unlike the Altlantic version which is just plain
with the print on that.  However, all of the Canadian copies that
I've heard (and this has been confirmed by others) had the tracks
marked slightly off.  All of the songs started about half a note
before the actual CD table of contents indicated.  This was only
really noticeable if you had programmed your player for certain
songs or set it into random mode - at the end of each song there
would be a pause and then a tiny bit of the next song before the
player moved on.  A minor annoyance maybe, but I used to use the
shuffle mode of my 5-disc player quite a bit, so I found it got
on my nerves.  So I ended up buying the U.S. version (and detached
the spine and flipped it around - BTW, mine was perforated already).

Secondly, I really love this new tour dates listing, but I think
that we could make it a lot more useful by expanding the listing
to include songs played and any important notes about the shows.
Anyone ever seen DeadBase?  I just got my copy of DeadBase VI for
Christmas, and I think it is the most incredibly reference for
Grateful Dead "TapeHeads" imaginable.  Now if we could do something
similar with this Rush tour listing, we would really have something.
I realize that it would be a _lot_ more difficult to get information
on more than a handful of shows, but at least it would be a start.
As well as set lists (as complete as we can figure) we should
include notes on which bootlegs are from this show, and maybe which
are not (eg. the "Run From The Fans" confusion).

   [ This sounds like an AWESOME idea.  For those of you who haven't seen 
     the GDead DeadBase, it is pretty cool.  A Rush one would be nice.  
                                      			:rush-mgr ]

I think we probably can fill in quite a few shows from the past
few tours, as many people on this list probably kept set lists for
the shows they attended.  From there, add the available bootleg
stuff, and like someone suggested last issue, newspaper articles
could have at least partial set lists.  For those who have never
seen DeadBase or something similar, here is a sample entry:

12-30-85 Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Oakland, Ca.  ............ (MON)
   1: Gimme Some Lovin> Greates, West L.A., Esau> Stagger Lee, Rooster,
      Tennessee Jed> L.L.Rain> Don't Ease
   2: Mighty Quinn> Samson> He's Gone> Miracle> Crazy Fingers> Drumz>
      Other One> Wharf Rat> Sugar Magnolia  E: Baby Blue
      *(first "Mighty Quinn")*

Abbreviated forms of many of the song titles are used (with a separate
index included to get the full titles), and a '>' between songs means
that the songs were strung together without a break, as opposed to a
pair of songs separated by a ','.  In the book, the title line and all
of the set indicators (ie. '1', '2', and 'E' in this case) are in bold,
and all extra notes are listed after enclosd in '*(' and ')*'s.  For
an all text document, so other way of breaking up the text might be
better, but a PostScript version ready for laser printing would also
be fantastic.

If there is interest and anyone would like more information about the
style and content of DeadBase, please drop me a line and I will be
happy to oblige.  I realize that this is somewhat of an ambitious
project, but we already have some of the framework (the tour dates)
already there.  I would voluteer to put the thing together, but I
will be booked solid until near the end of April.  After that, I
would be quite interested in at least being involved in putting
the thing together.  But first I guess we should see if there is
any interest in such a project.  If the group in general doesn't
care, I would still be interested in collecting as much info as
people would care to provide for my own use.  But don't send anything
yet, please.

    [ Actually something like this has already been started although on 
      a smaller scale as the DeadBase version, contact jlang@syrinx.umd.edu
      for information.  Or perhaps team up and get this RushBase on the
      road!						:rush-mgr ]

I own this CD.  Bought it a few weeks ago.

The company that makes it, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, has a complete line of
digitally remastered CD's (not remixed) of different artists' albums called
Ultradisc II.  (Not sure if there's an Ultradisc I.)  All tout an ADD SPARS
code.

The inside booklet has all the lyrics, pics, credits, and the full color
poster that you would normally receive.

Sounds quality is great.  They had a 1981 analog master to work with, and
they did a pretty good job.

The real reason I bought it is because I noticed that there is a typo on the
CD.  Track 2 is "RED BARCHETTE";  however, everywhere else it is spelled
correctly.  I figured that would add some collector value to it.

Enough said.

  I have noticed two strange sounds that happen during the live version
of YYZ on Exit..Stage Left.   After reading so many discussions about other
weird noises in songs, I thought I'd throw these into the forum and see
if anybody knows what the noises could be.  I don't want to sound like
I just came up with the idea for these sounds... actually I have heard
them since I first bought my CD of ESL in 1989, and I find that they
are noticible enough that they stand out to me every time I hear the song.
I hope the CD times I'm about to use are in sync with all CD releases
of ESL.

NOISE #1:    "The Call of the Love Boat"

Now don't laugh at this!  The sound is honestly like the blast of a
cruise ship.  Heard clearly in the background of YYZ between the times
of 4:22 and 4:25.  Sometimes it stands out more than other times.
Depending on whether you use headphones or speakers.  Granted, it is
very low in volume, but still clear.  I suspect it is something the
drum mikes picked up.  Like a guitar getting unplugged & making an
electric hum.  Any suggestions?

NOISE #2     "Does Neil use a Metronome?"

Sometimes this really shows up when I hear the song in headphones
(loud) rather than on speakers.  It resembles 4 or 5 clicks of what
sounds like a metronome or click track going on in the background.
Located in YYZ between the times of 7:23 and 7:25.
'Click..click..click..click'  And it sounds totally separate from
Neil's tom roll, or the playing period.   Any suggestions?

I know the noises are quite minute and most likely trivial, but I
hear them every time I listen to YYZ.  Maybe it's just me, but whenever
I listen to a Rush song, I hear all the bells and whistles.  Especially
in headphones.   Have a good time !

I had a similar experience with the same album shortly after the
Irvine, CA show on the RTB tour.  I have all the albums on vinyl,
but I don't have a turntable (go figure!), so they're in a box in
my parents garage somewhere.  NEway, I've been slowly collecting
all the albums again on CD, but hadn't purchased Signals.

After the Irvine show (June, '92), I remember being really stunned by
"The Analog Kid", so sometime thereafter I went out and got Signals.
And suddenly I was transported back to 1983 -- as I listened to the
music, in my mind I could see the parking lot of the Music Plus store,
I could feel the crisp, cold (for LA) wind that was blowing on a *really*
clear day as I rushed [ :-) ] with some friends from school to grab the
new album so many years ago.  And today, listening to it again, I realize
how really wonderful it was and continues to be... it's *not* like a fine
wine that gets better with time, it's just always been a great album.  I
think, though, that it was the first album release that I anticipated (where
most of my music collection at that point had been older albums from Rush
and Genesis, and Supertramp), so it's bound to be indelibly marked on my
psyche for all time.

<A NAME="632023">Subject: Gifs, Freewill, COS, Countdown</A>

Ok this is pseudo-Rush at best, so I'll say it quick: I remember a
question about downsizing GIFs. If we're talking PCs, use Piclab. It
produces good results quite quickly, and will run on minimal hardware.
And it's free. Email me for more info/help/moral support.

Right, while we're twiddling our thumbs waiting for the new album,
here's a thought. If you hate over-analysing, hit space now! We've been
through the Freewill "still" vs. "cannot" have made a choice many, many
times, even in in the short time I've been receiving the NMS. But here's
something that we might not (collectively) have given much consideration
to - what are the merits of each? My interpretations: "still" - you
can't avoid the decision, the so-called 'choosing not to decide' remains
a choice. "cannot" - you haven't made any real decision, it's been put
off; essentially you've copped out of any meaningful decision.

So to me it seems like the "cannot" version is merely a subset
of what the "still" version means (IMHO). So I prefer the "still", but
"cannot" is compatible with my ideas.

I think COS is a very, well, odd album really. It's variable, that's
what I'm getting at - there's Fountain, one of my favourite Rush tracks
(uh, like all the rest :-) ) - and I Think I'm Going Bald. Say no more.
Still, it remains interesting because of that imbalance, especially if
you listen to it "before and after" some of their similarly early stuff
(if you'll excuse the pun).

But saying about it being underrated: Isn't it strange that some albums
do seem to be fairly unpopular in the same kind of way - Presto,
Signals, Rush spring to mind. With Rush I can see the point, but Signals
is frankly quite good, and Presto is rather better than that.

To keep up the 'sound quality' thread from those dark days of lore when
it was still nearly relevant: T'was asked what bass/treble settings (or
equalization or something like that) people found good for Rush albums.
In general, I use +5,0,+10 on my 3-band 100Hz,1kHz,10kHz equalizers on
both my stereo and rather battered Walkbeing (tm). But for Presto and
esp. RTB I have to turn down the bass, they're a bit bassy (?) for my
liking. I find that generally that Rush tapes seem to have a better
'feel' at 0,0,0 or equivalent than Rush CD or LP even if they're noisier
(from what I've heard on not-bad CD and record players). However, tapes
*really* need looking after. Oh well, such is life.

I've been trying to transcribe that communication sequence at the end of
Countdown, for the new Rush trivia thingy. I know we're not supposed to
send stuff to the NMS, but I need some help nailing this stuff down
here! Here's what I've got so far, pretty hazy in places:

Columbia is now .. precisely to its space for main engine cutoff

      someone could grab a copy of it and find the date and possibly decipher
      what's going on and being said.  				:rush-mgr ]

That's as good as it gets so far, any help appreciated - I guess it

Hi kids,

   Don't have much to say today except that I think that in '92, Rush also
won a Juno award for Best Album Cover.  I'm pretty sure they won two, the
other being of course Best Hard Rock Group.  Here's a related question...I
know that Rush are normally very busy with family life and/or recording
and touring, but do they ever actually appear on the Junos, even to just
accept the awards?  Just curious.  It just strikes me as odd to picture
Geddy in his glasses and Chuck Taylor sneakers on stage accepting an award.

A lot of NMSers seem to think Neil's
lyrics are remarkable for their great
attention to detail.  I think Neil is inept
at verbal portrait painting; he seems to lack
the ability to write lyrics in which the
accumulation of deatil speaks for itself.  Instead,
he always has to tell you what it all means; he isn't
content to let images stand by themselves.  I'm not
particularly knocking Neil--I like his lyrics quite
a bit--but I don't think we should confuse him with,
say, Chris Difford of Squeeze whose eye for detail
is far superior.  Peart is good at many things, but
detail isn't really one of them.

I have been tracking down a few dates (ok only 2), but thought that others
might be interested in what I found. First, some of you may remember my
questions about the "dead drums jam". The date is 1/23/88, The Myriad in
Oklahoma City. The drums go out just before they start "Marathon" (is that
an accident-prone song or what?), and Alex starts playing some funky guitar
song. At the end he says, "Well I betcha didn't know I could do that!" and
Geddy does some jamming as well before the drums come back.

The second date is the date for the boot CD "Bone The Rolls". It is the
4/23/92 Sporthalle, Colonge, Germany. This has been confirmed and I have added
it to the boot list I'm keeping.

Shirts should be in this week, and we'll probably do a mass mailing on Sat.
again. We also did mail out a few this past Sat. So if you're waiting for a
shirt just hold on, they're almost here!

And thanks to all of you who have been sending in corrections for the tour
dates listing. It'd be great if we could find some dates in the COS slot...
