Hey Guys,

I finally found a SPARC to play "Dreamline" on.  I love it!
IMHO, it sounds like a cross between Signals, PoW, and Presto stuff.
I can't wait for the rest of the album!  Well, enough rambling.

Ahh!  Paradise again!  It's good to be back!!  As all of the good
stuff about the new album has been coming out, the computer system
over here went D-E-A-D, so please forgive my ignorance on subjects
that may have been hashed to death or anything that's commonly known.

After reading my first post in almost a month and a half (thank you,
rush-mgr, for helping me back!) -- god, I haven't been this excited
since the GUP concert here -- I feel great!  It's
so neat to read about everyone's responses to the songs.  Now correct
if I'm wrong -- there hasn't ever been this many songs released at
once from a new Rush album before, right?  Damn, this is fun.  It's
like waiting for Star Trek 6 to come out...

BTW, would anyone be willing to e-mail me the list of the songs?  I
can't believe the damned system went out when it did... I would really
appreciate it as I have hardly any idea as to what's going on.  Help
me back into the light!

[ I got this one folks; I've already sent her mail...         :rush-mgr ]

On another note ("la!"), last week, I went scrounging around at a
local record store and found FBN with the original record jacket --
the one with the lyrics and the pics of Howard and the 3-man road
crew.  Is that an original pressing?  Simply a Canadian release?  It
was selling for $2.50 and I immediately cursed the idiot who sold the
album to the store.  (Maybe I should bless the idiot!)

Well, I'm going to call the local station tomorrow, or today, to see
if they even know the album exists.  They're pretty good about Rush --
I remember they played "The Body Electric"  a week before GUP came
out, so maybe they'll be just as generous.  Ah, this is great!!

Hi all!

Just wanted to let you all know -- I called 98 Rock (KPOI FM) last
night around midnight.  I asked the DJ if they had the new Rush album
yet.  She said no, that they were waiting on it.  Then she asked if I
was a big Rush fan; my response, "Ohhh, yeahhh!"  She mentioned that
she was one, too (YES!) and that when they do get the new album
they'll definitely play it.

So it hasn't hit us yet.   Just some updated news from the middle of
the ocean.

p.s.  So, do the new songs sound like anything from "Presto" or
anything?  Is there any evidence of "progression" from their previous
albums or does it sound totally different from everything they've
done?  Inquiring and excited minds want to  know!

Hello again...

Sorry for this, folks.  This'll be really fast.  Sorry, rush-mgr.  I
was  going to ask your help on this then realized that you wouldn't
know what i was talking about...  please forgive my, what, 3RD post...

Someone e-mailed me awhile back about the "Rush:Profiled!" cd.  I
haven't been able to get back to him since, soon after receiving his
mail, the computer system went nuts on me.  And for some strange
reason, I can't find the file I saved on him.  I remember his name was
Alex.  Alex, if you're out there, let me know if you still want the
info. on the cd, or  if you've already gotten what you need.  Again, I
apologize for not getting back to you, but I'd like to hear from you.
The address is:

Thanx for your patience...and now, we resume our regular programming
(yeah, watch this be the last post...)

  What I am about to talk about should still be considered a rumor,
because I am not sure about it's validity.

  Yesterday I called KSJO a rock station in the bay area to ask about
Dreamline, RTB etc.  The DJ didn't know much and I had to inform him
about the name of the single and the album name.
  He told me he would see what he could do, talk to the boss or something
to see if they had ot or if it could be played.
  Well I was in the car later when he gave out the information over the
air.  Remember, this is the first time I had heard anything over the air
about the new album, it was a good feeling knowing that someone now had a
clue and was mentioning what I think is a big release!  The entire bay
area radio scene has been really inept when it comes to this new album.
I don't know if it is their fault or Atlantic's
  Anyway, over the air he said that they (RUSH) were comming out with a
new album, this was after he played New World Man, and that the first
single, Dreamline, should be at the station and on the air in, get this ,
TWO WEEKS. First I freaked, then I thought, oh he just got the release
date of the album and the single mixed up. The he continued to say that
the album would be released in mid September.  MID my ass, I was pissed
then.  So I thought, ok somethign is seriously screwed, so I headed home
to call the station.
  When I got him on the phone he said that they had called Atlantic and
talked to the vice-president of something (don't remember the name).
KSJO was probibly going, why the hell have we not heard about this album
yet? My brother sean (who posts on here also) called and pretty mush told
the DJ about the album, it seems the station was completely clued out!
The DJ asked him how he knew all this stuff, he replied "from a networked
rush discussion area on the computer"
  So this VP person supposidly told the station that the release had been
delayed.  The single in two weeks the album in a month because they did
not want it to (get this) coinside with a release of a Stevie Nicks album
(like a give a) anyway, I asked if this was KSJO only he said, nope all
stations.
  Right about now I was confused, disappointed in the bay area's stations
and about to call Atlantic, but it was too late in the day.

  Well today we (sean and I, mainly sean) set out to get things straight.
 KOME said they will get the single on friday, and he called atlantic and
they confirmed the original release dates of friday and Sept. third!

  Personally I won't believe it till I hear it and have it in my clammy
palms, but I suggest everyone in the bay area to call up all the local
rosk stations and continue to hound them, it can only make things better.

  The numbers are

  1 800 367 KOME
  1 408 575 1800   <- for KSJO
  1 415 478 FM97   <- for KRQR

  Please call them and ask what the hell is going on.  Tonight the
Dreamline watch will start in the the bay area.  I will be ready to tape
it, especially on KOME, they have repeatedly stated that they will have
it.  One guy, as sean said, stated that it was in the back room.

                We can only hope!  Keep your fingers crossed!

    Well I am sure you have all already read my post about the wonderfull
bay area stations that don't have a clue.  Well tonight, thurs. night, we
have been over at a friends waiting for some station to play the new
single.  KRQR said they would, then I called again and he said they did
not have it and did not know when they would get it.  KSJO was clued out,
but I finally got a straight answer from KOME, it went a little like
this.

"Hello KOME"

"Hi, have you guys started playing the new rush single yet?"

"Nopw, we don't have it yet."

"Well when should you get it"

"Well we have a special deal and will be getting it before anyone else,
we are supposed to have it for today (friday) but it hasn't arrived yet,
it should come in later this morning in FedEx"

"Will you play it during the day then."

"Well we have the slots for it all set up, we just need the single, and
it should be in sometime in the morning."

"Thanks!"

"No prob"

"Rock-on!"

 .. click

anyways, it felt good to hear at least that.  Remember the call was made
at 1 in the morning on friday, so hopefully fed ex will arrive and bring
some much needed relief.

        I mean we all know we will hear it sooner or later, but better
sooner than later.  Roll on all!

	Similarly here in Buffalo I've asked about the new
	release of RTB and all of them looked at me like they
	didn't have a clue.

	One even tried to tell me that they were still in the
	the studio ( I straightened him out though =)

	Usually when people are so clueless about the new release
	it is delayed (a la Presto) but I saw the official release
	yesterday and they'll have it in on the 3rd........

	The subject was just to get you to read this posting.... Sorry

	I still have to wait until next week to hear new Rush though,
	called up the local 'good' station and they said next week....

Thanks to all who set me straight on the release date.
I hate to be a wet blanket, but all this weirdness with the radio stations
has got me doubting. I hope RTB doesnt end up in a mess like the release
of Yes' _Union_. I dont know if any of you were aware, but because of
the shipping dept. and bad carriers, Union ended up hitting the stores
about a month late. These stories of radio stations that don't have
the singles yet sounds like what happened then. I've been calling around
some of the DC/Balt. stations (DC101,98Rock, WGRX, WCXR) and getting the
same "we know it's in Boston, but we don't have it" story.  poop.
How's the employment & housing markets in New England? :)

A couple of days ago I got the NMS it's first (I think) dedication.  In the
process I learned this from "greg" at 102.7 wnew (new york):

1) we don't have the single (dreamline)

2) we have the album

3) we will be doing the premier of the album aug 29 at 11pm

4) it is very probable that the boyz _will_ be there for the premier

5) they may do a "rockline" style interview

6) Dano and Greg are _major_ RUSH fans

das all!!

p.s.- yes,mgr i did record the dedication!

Hi all,

There is a slightly larger (but not much) verison of the Available Boots
List in ~ftp/morgan/abl on chaos.cs.brandeis.edu (129.64.2.6).  This will be
the last posting about it for a couple of weeks.

Anyone who is planning on making a submission, PLEASE make it in the same
format as the abl/format file.  And PLEASE make it as complete as possible.

Also.  I am returning to school in about a week.  In the meanwhile, I am trying
to finish a program (wish me luck ;)  ), so if you could please hold your
submissions until after the 23rd of August, I'd appreciate it a lot.

Thank you,

<A NAME="316013">Subject:      Clueless here, too</A>

I called up KJKJ 107.5 in Grand Forks.  They're usually pretty cool to
play RUSH--I often here "Limelight", "The Trees", and "Force 10".
I called the afternoon dj and the evening dj.  Neither had heard of
the new single.  I also went to Budget Tapes And Discs and The Record
Shop in GF.  (BTW, this is North Dakota, eh?)  Neither of those places
had heard of, recieved, or cared about the new single.  I'm kind of
pissed that just because there aren't many RUSH fans here, the Midwest
has to be deprived of good music when it comes out.  I probably won't
even see _Roll_The_Bones_ here until October.  Sounds like I'll have to
move to New England (or maybe Old England).  Either that, or Atlantic
can set the wheels in motion and get RUSH's music distributed properly.
I've heard of a few other places like this from the digest.  Atlantic
should put two more bases in Fargo and somewhere on the West Coast.
I can't wait to hear the new stuff...

On the subject of Metallica...no, this isn't non-RUSH-related...
They have a song on the new album that has a couple of lines quite like
"Whichhunt".  It says something like "slow to understand/Arrogance and
ignorance go hand in hand."  You've got to hear _Metallica_; it's got
good sound, but a little more mainstream.  But at least they're being
progressive...I can't wait to hear what they do next!  Even less growling?

I also wish that RUSH would start ending more songs on the records.
If you listen to "Mystic Rhythms" carefully, you'll notice that it ends,
but it ends at the end of that long fade.  Also, if they did less fading,
the radio stations would let the songs go (hopefully) to the end.  I heard
"The Big Money" on KJ108, and they cut into another song at the end when
guitar starts the Asus4 riff.  BTW, since Neil mentioned Rod Morgenstein
in one of those interviews, I'll also mention that "Headed For A Heartbreak"
by Winger does the same thing as "Mystic Rhythms"--fades but with a definite
ending.  Some songs I would have liked to hear end on the studio versions are
all the songs on HYF, especially "Mission" because of the guitar solo.
