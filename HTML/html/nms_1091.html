<A NAME="1091000">Subject: A Great Rush</A>

Hi!
This weekend I had a great Rush experience that I thought I would share
with everyone.
It was a nice spring day. I had my door to my room opened, and no one was
around in the dorm. I was playing my Janis Joplin tape maybe just a
little too loud. Anyway, this total bonehead decided to assert a little
volume control. But he doesn't tells me to turn it down. He comes and
shuts my door. Normally, it wouldn't bother me, but considering how much
I hate this guy, I decided to have some fun.
I opened the door and considered my options. This guy needed to expand
his musical tastes. I was just the person to teach him. But how? Wait a
minute! I had a treasure that no one on campus seemed to have. The entire
Rush catalog! Of course! Not just any Rush, either. Let's take him back
to the beginning, oh say the first album and 2112. And then, let's show
him how I can sing as high as Geddy, only with a southern accent, and in
a different key, say the key of Z. And surprise surprise the volume kept
getting louder.
He didn't come back, and the door to the room he was in somehow was
closed the next time I looked out.

Yes, I know, I should use Rush only for good. But it worked. It's not
like I tortured small children. He was a big boy.

Well, thanks for listening.
Later,

<A NAME="1091001">Subject: a hungry fan</A>

I recently read in this fine digest that Rush will take the rest of the year
off, and then begin work on new material.  I guess this means that the
total time between the release of Counterparts and the new disc will be
around three years.  Like most of you, I am extremely dissappointed by
this.

IF the boys want to take some time off, fine.  I understand the need for
down time.  BUT, the boys should also recognize the musical appetites of
their fans.   IMHO - this would be the perfect time for Rush to release
a live BOX along the lines of Metallica's Live Binge and Purge box.  For
those of you unfamiliar with this box, it contains 3 VHS tapes, 3 CD's and
an excellent full-color book with lots 'o tour info.  Metallica released
this about two years after their last studio release, realizing it would
be awhile before the next studio release. (BTW - this box was put together
in just a couple of months time).

I also realize that Rush follows a pattern: 4 studio releases, then a live
release.  However, in terms of the number of studio SONGS released between
live recordings, I'll bet the number of tunes on Presto, RTB, & CP is close
to the number of tunes released on the four studio Discs/LP's before each of
the other live recordings.  The boys seem to be breaking patterns anyway
with this extended time off (its been almost a year already - looks like
it going to be another year as well).

I know that Rush do not read this digest, but over the course of the next
few weeks/months (years?) a few of you may get the opportunity to communicate
with the powers that be (e.g. talking to SRO/Anthem, seeing Alex at his
restaurant, etc.).   If you do get the opportunity, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE
mention that RUSH should hire someone to dig in the vaults, and put together
a GOOD box (multiple live CD's, and some video).  It would require minimal
time on the part of the members of Rush, would feed the hungry fans, and would
put extra change in the boys' pockets during their vacation.

Famished,

Hi there:   two quick notes.  First, in the latest issue of Modern
Drummer, in the Up and Coming section (I think-- biographies on unsigned
drummers) the drummer from Power Windows is featured.

Also-- a totally wierd Rush sighting.  On "NewsRadio 85 KOA" in Denver,
they played "Leave That Thing Alone!" as background music before starting
a story on Mosh Pits-- and they were at the Offspring concert.  Thank
goodness SOMEONE at that boring radio station has some taste!!

To the person who bought Geddy's pick from a friend for x-amount of dollars,
I sad to inform you that you got ripped off. Geddy has never used a pick in
concert. This weekend at a record convention in Milwaukee, I was reading
thru _Bass Heroes_, & in response to the question about picks, he said he
only finger picked while in the studio. The only time he ever used a pick is
when he played his double neck. He never uses one while playing his bass.

In the last issue Steven Horwitz suggested:

>The Spirit of Radio" lifts the last verse from Paul Simon's lyrics to
>"The Sound of Silence"

I'd just like to clarify that Neil didn't 'lift' it as in take it verbatim
and graft it onto SoR...

The part of the verse of Sound of Silence referred to actually goes :

"And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
 are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls."
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence."

(well, thats actually a little more than refered to, but i'm sure you know
what i mean)

and Neil's version goes...(according to PeW CD cover)

" For the words of the profits,
Are written on the studio wall,
Concert Hall -
Echoes with the sounds. . .
Of salesmen."

So there ya go...just thought i'd clarify...

Anyone know why Neil chose Paul Simon to refer to here?

anyway, later everyone...

I believe that the man who had the keyboards on side-stage was not a
musician at all, but rather the stage man controlling the lights and
effects going on.  This is also what the tv monitors would be used for,
to dial up certain stage effects.  There was an interview I read somewhere
about the lights man explaining how he would control the lights via a
"board" on side-stage.  This is probably what you saw!

Any other possible explanations out there?

Well, I don't know what kind of stuff Neil uses, but that's because I am more
of a bluesy/funk type of drummer, so I was never interested in capturing Neil's
'sound' if you will.  However, you asked about different sizes of equipment
and their sound.  well, I bought a used (2 years old) Pearl set from my friend
because it had that sound that I wanted.  Very sharp and cutting (if that makes
any sense at all).  It has what my friend called a 'piccolo snare'  which is a
very thin snare with a much higher sound than a regular rock snare.  Joey
Kramer (drummer for Aerosmith) used this type of snare on the "Pump" album if
you want to know what it sounds like.  I tend to have smaller drums than a
typical rock/metal type drummer.  I like the feel of them and I tend to stay
away from the plodding sort of dead sound that a lot (but not all) of rock
drummers have.   They tend to go for that 'big' sound, where as I go for a
'light' sound. Does that makes any sense??  Probably not :)  I hope this helps.

<A NAME="1091009">Subject: Option D</A>

I saw this book in the book store the other day, called "Buy This Book and
Make Me Rich," a parody of right-wing philosophy, especially of the other
Rush.  Since I personally can't stand the other Rush (no flames please), I
wanted to read something that made fun of him.

When I read the book later, I saw there was one section in it where you can
take a test to find out how much of a ditto-head you are.  This is where the
Rush content of this post comes in...

One of the questions on the test was

If you are applying for a job, and the boss happens to mention its okay to
listen to Rush in the office, you should:
A:  Thank her for being so considerate
B:  Politley tell her that you don't care to listen to Rush.
C:  Take advantage of the oppurtunity to pick your nose and wipe your finger
on her desk.

I thought, what about Option D:  Promptly go to your car and bring in your Mov
ing Pictures tape, (or CD if your car has a CD player).

There were a few other questions where references to Rush the band could have
been worked in, but this is the example that sticks most in my mind.

This book is a fine example of right-wing philosophy exaggeration.  If you
can't stand the other Rush, I highly recommend this book.  (Again, no flames
please)

<A NAME="1091010">Subject: Possible Rush tributes...</A>

In the April 19 issue of TNMS, John King was suggesting some good and bad
possibilities for bands to do Rush tributes.  Some buds and I tried this once
while we were on Prodigy, and we came up with a few.  A lot of bands seemed
impossible, but some seemed great. However, I can only remember two, so that's
all I have to present. Hopefully I can remember some of the others. They were
pretty good. But here are those 2:
    Despite what seems to be the growing trend among the NMS, I dig Primus. I
thought they'd do a killer "I Think I'm Going Bald."
    The Indigo Girls would be perfect for "Presto."

    My guess, I wouldn't have Neil Young do "Available Light" 'cause, though I
love Young, I'd hate to hear him hit those high notes...

I just wanted to respond a little, although I am sure that this is a
little late...
I too am a practicing Catholic.  Rush is probably my number one band
(maybe number two, depending on my mood :) ) I have the utmost respect
for them, and their music is some of the only music I have ever heard
that can make me cry, laugh and feel shivers up and down my spine.
	I do not always agree with some of the items I hear in their
songs, but I feel that many things they talk about is necessary for
religious people to hear!
	E.G.  In "Free Will", they speak about "choose a ready guide in some
celestial voice", and "I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose
free will."
	Any person of any religion should ALWAYS make up their own mind.
You have to decide that you want to follow something, make honest,
personal moral decisions, etc. ON YOUR OWN.  The Church is simply a
method of helping you realize what to do.  One method only!  If you don't
do something because you want to but only because the guy in the robe
said so, then you are not following God.  We were given Free Will, and we
need to exercise it.
	A last thought that I believe in (here in all my arrogance :) ):
remember this when you are asked about your religion.

	I do not believe in these things because I am Catholic; I am
Catholic because I believe in these things.

	And as was said last time, omnia maiorum gloriam Dei!  Rush
music, Rush themselves, and all of us.
Keep rocking, rush-fans.

Hi, y'all.  Thanks for all the kind words about my proposed tribute album.
 How about some more suggestions from the peanut gallery?

Thanks to all the gift people.  The T-shirt is a real hoot.  I'm glad to say
that I was pleasantly surprised at its high quality.  Well done, folks!

I just saw an ad on VH-1 (hey, lay off, I was just flipping channels).
 They're going to be playing old episodes of Don Kirchner's Rock Concert
weeknights at 10 PM (ET).  For those too young to remember, DKRC was a
syndicated live performance show back in the unattractive 70's, and Rush
appeared on the show a couple of times.  I have no idea whether or not VH-1
will air Rush episodes (they advertised stuff like the Eagles and Tina
Turner), but it's worth keeping an eye on, just to be sure.

Now, of course, if those lucky souls that have the Rush DKRC shows on tape
would just spring for a few copies, we wouldn't HAVE to watch VH-1 . . . ;-)

Later days . . . (and by the way, I FINALLY GOT A JOB!!! WHOO HOO!!)

Saw one on a British TV motoring programme called Top Gear.
Only problem for anyone here in the UK (& other similarly perverse

Hey all,

	'Jim' was asking in the last newsletter about people's opinions of
the MFSL 2112 and Moving Pictures gold discs. After reading time and again
how amazing they are in TNMS, I promptly went to a store in Rock Hill, SC
and found all three Rush gold discs there (2112, Moving Pictures and Signals).
I thought I'd start out slowly (whoa, boy...down, boy...) and just got 2112.
Personally, I think it's worth the $30 just for the complete album art and

lyrics (most of which do not appear on the Anthem release). But the sound
was indeed noticeably improved, especially the bass, I found. Never before
had Ged's bass on 2112 shaken the room! There are a few things I was
disappointed with though. The front cover is shrunken considerably to make
room for the MFSL graphics, the album art was reproduced a little crudely,
and I missed having the lyrics red on black like the album (if I recall
correctly). I have been having fun thinking lately though that in 25 years
the only digital artifact I might have left is that crazy gold Rush CD
that never oxidized like the rest of them (I sure hope this won't come true!).

	I was considering getting Moving Pictures next...I'd expect some sonic
improvements, especially in the bass area. MP was digitally mixed though, so
perhaps the improvements aren't that great. Anyone care to comment??

	As a last note, I got the MFSL catalogue and found the selection of
albums that they elected to reproduce very interesting, everything from
Elvis to Muddy Waters to the Police to Def Leppard. However, some of the real
classics are missing. Anyone know the criteria MFSL uses when selecting albums
to reproduce? Just wondering...

Also, will one of the Americans on the list kindly direct spring up to Canada
ASAP. Maybe it got hung up at the border. 8)

Re: Recent discussions on Jack Secret and his floppies, the Boyz use

They use this new technology A LOT live!  Ever notice Alex stomping on one
of his synth pedals when he sings "Superconductor" or "Subdivisions"
among others.

Or how about the intro to Big Money?  All I remember from the intro
to Big$ was Geddy hopping around (you know, that great "chicken hop"
he does so well) and hearing all the change($), arppegio (sp?) synths,
etc. going off and he's NO WHERE NEAR any of his pedals to trigger
any of this stuff!

Anywho...
Bottom line:  They're no LESS musicians for using what's out there.
In fact, its pretty cool to see them pulling off tunes like Witch
Hunt, Scars, Marathon, RTB, etc.

I even wonder if CP was a simpler production album (i.e., more
guitar/bass, less synth/sequencer) just because they're getting bored
(or tired) of touring with all that e-stuff over the last 10-15
years.  Maybe Neil's running out of hats (uh, helmets) to put
headphones in!!!!

How's it going fellow Rush fans?

I was wondering if anyone has ever actually listened to King Crimson.  In the
booklet with Rush Chronicles, it talks about how Neil Pert and Pink Floyd's
drummer were trained in similar art-rock forms as the King Crimson drummer.  Is
King Crimson good, or is it just their drummer that's good?

I would appreciate it if someone could send me a reply back to me directly,

Hi again, y'all!

Once again, I've followed enough threads here to think of a few things to
say in reply.

>Fiat, those nice Italians have just released a new model - The

I don't think Fiat is releasing a *new* model, rather reviving an old model
like so many American car makers have in recent years.  I remember, about 10
years ago, reading through a picture book on antique cars in a local
bookstore.  In that book there was a picture of a Fiat Barchetta, made in (I
think) around 1947.  *That* particular model looked more like an old
Austin-Healy than an MG, but I'm sure that for that era, it looked very
sleek and fast.  And yes, the car in the picture was red!

Christians and Rush music:  I can't say I belong to any single denomination,
being born Roman Catholic, raised Lutheran and then Baptist, but I do have a
strong belief in God.  There have been a few rare times when Rush lyrics
would conflict with my beliefs ("I don't believe in the stars or the
planets, or angels watching from above", or songs like 'Free Will'), but I
have always respected the right of all people to voice their opinions, and I
won't discount a great song (or the poignant message it contains) because of
a few words that don't fit *my* opinions.

I'd also like to respectfully submit my vote to kill the 'Trees' thread,
too.  In my last post I hinted to people that Neil's own words on this song
were contained in the FAQ.  I put them here because they're relatively
short... and I hope the rush mgr. won't exclude this letter because of it
(sorry ma'am/dude!)

You gotta hand it to a guy who can take one simple, silly image like that &
write a song about it, and have it turn into something so much bigger,
thought provoking enough to inspire such a lengthy thread as we've seen
here.  I've long said that one of the beautys of Neil's writing was his
ability to paint such a complete picture while leaving out so many details,
allowing us all to fill in the blanks and turn the content of the song into
something that we all, as individuals, can apply to our own lives and get
some real meaning out of.

Someone asked for a list of songs that Alex sings on, and favorite Alex
solos.  Well, I don't know an accurate list of the songs he sings, but for
the record here are a few of my fave solos:  Working Man, Losing It, Kid
Gloves, Afterimage, YYZ (duh!), La Villa Strangiato (son of duh!), and...
another little trivia tidbit... "Ghost of a Chance"... I heard, on
'Rockline', that the solo that we hear on the release of that song was the
very first 'take' that Alex recorded for that song while they were making
the album. Alex walked into the booth with only an idea of how he wanted the
solo to sound... they started recording, and he ripped it off perfectly...
they all looked at each other and said "that's perfect!"

One last thing... I very enthusiastically downloaded Paul Singh's "Rush Info
for Windows Help File" from the Syrinx server as soon as I knew that it
existed.  It must be me and my own inexperience with FTP, but I can't seem
to unzip the file.  I've tried pkunzip, gzip, uncompre.exe, uudecode, and
various combinations of all of these... what does it take to actually USE a
file that I download??

Sorry for the long post (again)!!!

About Geddy's bass tone on RtB: Geddy acquired a new, red Wal bass for the
album - one with a bit more low end grunt and a larger upper horn - the
"Horny" bass! I think it sounds great, but the twang he got from Peter
Collins' smaller, lighter-strung Wal on PW makes more sense - it cuts
through the mix better. Geddy had planned to use the Jazz, Rickenbacker or
Steinberger basses on PW, but fell in love with the Wal's sound. The rare,
"muso" look didn't hurt either - Wals are used by such luminaries as Jonas
Hellborg, Percy Jones and Mick Karn as well...

Mein froinds -

Just a few thoughts after cranking out the 2112 ultradisc...

Is there a better piece of rock than 2112 (the song)?  When you add it
all up: music, musicianship, lyrics, concept, etc. I don't think there
is.  How much would you pay to see the whole thing performed live?

As most of you have probably noticed, the same 7 note theme appears in
the "Overture," "Discovery," and "Oracle:  The Dream" sections of 2112
(the music that goes with "I stand atop a spiral stair").  Does anyone
who reads music know if that same note sequence appears in "Grand
Finale"?  It would make sense as that would mean the sequence appears
in each of the odd numbered sections.  This has always bothered me.  I
don't hear it in there.

Is it just me, or is everyone physically unable to stop themselves from
air-guitaring to the opening notes of the jam in "Presentation"?  Is it
also me, or does that jam sound best when it's so loud that your ears
hurt?

How great are the bass drums on the ultradisc?  I can almost smell
Neil's feet!  Also - I can't believe it was ever a matter of debate
whether "A Passage to Bangkok" was about getting high!  Give me a break!
What has this country come to when young people don't get obvious
references to marijuana etc..??!  I fear for the future...
It's all Nancy Reagan's fault....

I have been so moved by this listening experience that I am (at least
temporarily) changing my ORQ...

Along with Jared Strasberg's comment in NMS #1089 regarding Hemingway and
"lost generation":  you might want to check a little further back.  I
think Gertrude Stein actually gets the credit for this, as my copy of
Hemingway's _The Sun Also Rises_ has the following quote as an epigraph:

But the "grace under pressure" thing I know I've seen before, I think in

First of all, I was wondering if anyone knows of any guitar tabs for
Cinderella Man or Circumstances on the net. I've seen bass tabs for
Circumstances, but I've seen nothing for Cinderella Man. If nothings
available, I could probably figure them out and post them myself, but I
don't have the best set of ears so I wanted to see if anyone else knew
about these tabs.

As far as bands doing Rush covers, here are some I'd like to see and some
I'd rather not see...

   Finding My Way/Working Man   Metallica         Garth Brooks
   Closer to the Heart          Yes               Debbie Gibson
   Cinderella Man               Triumph           Wilson Philips
   Cygnus/Hemispheres           Dream Theater     Funkadelic
   2112                         Iron Maiden       Vanilla Ice

   La Villa Strangiato          Steve Vai         Weezer

One question I've got... not Rush related. There's this one song I keep
hearing on the radio, and I don't have any idea who does it but I think it
might be called "Last Chance (to believe in yourself??)" and it is pretty
progressive. I don't know how old it is or who does it, but if anybody has
any ideas I'd really appreciate them because it's a really cool song.

Hi,
	Before I begin my irreverant waffle, I'd better do the
traditional first post bit, so here goes.......My name's dave, I'm 21 and
live in Edinburgh, Scotland. I've been a Rushaholic since HYF (My God!!!!
That's almost ten years!!! - I never realised that before - Time stands
still indeed). I've been reading NMS for a couple of months and have just
subsribed and I'll take this oportunity to complement everybody involved
 - It is difficult to keep in touch with all things Rushy as they get very
little media coverage over here and only come over every 2 or three tours
 - so the NMS is spot on.

	That aside I was wondering if anyone has any info (however scant)
on Alex's rumoured solo project - something that I (most of us probably)
have always wanted to hear.

	Just an aside to all the discussion on geddy's use of a pick. I
remember reading an interview with him in a guitar magazine (I don't have
it at hand so I can't remember which one) around the time of RTB.
Apparently when he was young, the top of one of his fingers was almost
chopped off in an accident. When it healed the top of his finger and the
nail were exceptionally tough and he uses this as a pick when his Bass
playing requires it!

	Anyway, I've gone on faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar to long already......

	Brought to you by the letter "F"
	It's dark now.
