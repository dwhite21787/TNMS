Well, I don't know anything about Jaco Pastorius, but I have lots of
problems with the Geddy better than Sting statement.  Personally, I
can't provide any kind of rankings in terms of what groups/artists I
like.  It could be argued that Geddy is a better bass player technically
than Sting, but that's another story.  It's all in my mood--some days I
just want to hear Geddy, other days it's Sting, other days it's Primus,
other days it could be completely bass-less music (solo jazz guitar, or
whatever).  Oh well.  Getting relatively far off of Rush, so I'll stop
babbling about that...

> here are some of the more obscure songs I have

> [list deleted...]

True, most of those I've never heard on the radio.  Actually, some I've
never heard at all.  But Working Man, The Trees, and Turn the Page I
hear a lot on local stations.  At least, I used to...I don't listen to
the radio too much.  Red Sector A is also an occasional favorite.  In
fact, I think that Working Man might be the Rush song I've heard on the
radio the most;  it's right up there with Freewill and Spirit...

I'm pretty sure my suitemates will be getting this soon... Ugh...

On the topic of sampling Rush, does anyone have any good suggestions?
I'm taking Music 1441, which is Electronic and Computer Music, and I
just learned how to sample.  I made a tape of various things to take to
the studio and mess around with, and was wondering if anyone has any
good suggestions of Rush to sample.  Except, what I'd be looking for
isn't the same kind of sample that would be used in rap, since I really
can't stand rap.  I'd be using the sample more as a basis for some
melody line (I've already used Bill Clinton for that, but I like Bill,
so you can't really tell it's his voice..  (-:  )

About Rush on the radio:  Near Pittsburgh (meaning it's very hard to
pick up) is 107.1 (Z107) which basically emphasizes CSNY, Dylan, Doors,
that kind of stuff.  So I was shocked when I heard them play
Subdivisions one day.  Neat...  (Great station usually, unless you only
like Rush/harder rock--I haven't heard much like that since...)

Is there anyone who knows an alternative way to play the bass solo in
La Villa Strangiato?  I have the transcription from Guitar for the
Practicing musician but It just doesn't sound right to me.  Maybe its just
the fact that I'm not Geddy Lee but I would like to at least get my solo
to sound sort of like Geddy's and the solo in the magazine just doesn't click
for me.  thanks

	A friend of mine saw RUSH in Arizona on the Hold Your Fire
tour in 87/88 and he SWEARS that they played Open Secrets.  I was
under the impression that this song was never performed live...I've
never seen it on a boot or anything...

	Can anyone add any insight to this?

Hy,
   Ah, Back finally after so long away,
   was I missed probably not.
   Anyway I saw a thread about Radio stations playing Rush Music and
here in the boston area WAAF 107.3 does an awesome job with Rush music
They play everything, You can hear a very good mix of Rush songs and the
DJs love Rush, infact the other night night Tom Sawyer was introed by the Dj
saying that the band coming up had the best drumme{ going in music today,

Hello, Rusheads!  Here's two points of interest:

1)  It's no secret that Primus is heavily influenced by
Rush.  The first track from their live release "Suck On This"
is a song called "John the Fisherman,"  a song that starts
with the intro from "YYZ."  (It's not just the crotale part,
and it's pretty nifty to hear.)  As for the "Frizzle Fry"
reference in N.M.S. #647, that CD opens with the beginning
of "John the Fisherman" from "Suck On This."  Suddenly the
audio sounds as if the plug was pulled on a turntable, and
the first track, "To Defy the Laws of Tradition," begins.

2)  Does anybody out there have any quality Rush sounds for
the Mac?  I have a few and would be more than happy to attach
them as a file and e-mail 'em to you.  But if you have some
good Rush sounds of your own for the Mac, please e-mail me
at  BEEZUS@AOL.COM  and let me know what you've got.

A few things here... yes, the Rush newsgroup should be alt.music.rush rather
than rec.music.rush -- things got very hectic at work, and when I went to do
the digest my mind was apparently elsewhere... :)

Also, there was a digest sent out earlier, but it was truncated. This is the
REAL version of that same digest. Sorry about that, I didn't catch the culprit
posting until it was too late!

Don't forget about the NMS newsletter currently in the works. If you'd like
more info on that, send e-mail to: jlang@syrinx.umd.edu. Briefly, it will be a
hard copy newsletter with various columns, pictures, etc. and it will be
*free*, except for the cost of mailing it to you.

	In NMS #649 Kevin Field mentioned "Absalom, Absalom!" (Distant Early 
Warning and was wondering if it had any connections with a William Faulkner 
book.  I personally have no idea, but I have a fairly solid idea where 
"Absalom" originated.  If you don't already know, and I'm pretty sure I'm 
right, Noah was supposed to have had a son named Absalom (in the Old 
Testament).  That much I know.  As I remember, Absalom fell short of 
someone's expectations of him (God's or Noah's) and something rather dismal 
happened to him.  Perhaps he refused to accept that (Distant Early Warning) 
there would soon be a large-ish volume of water about and then got caught by 
the water.  High Water (no relation there I hope).  
	I have never delved into the Bible so you might want to verify it for 
yourself.

	Other possibly-unheard-of Rush lyrical roots:

--Rivendell (Fly By Night) was a safe haven for travellers in Tolkien's "Lord 
of the Rings".  The Illustrated version had some cool pictures.

--La Villa Strangiato was the result of a nightmare that Alex Lifeson had.

--YYZ was inspired from Lester B. Pearson International Airport, located in 
Toronto.  Ever check the 3-letter tag on you luggage when you pass through 
there?  I'm assuming the hustle and bustle of commuters had something to do 
with the way the tune goes.

--Next time you're at a library, find a copy of "Paradise Lost" by John 
Milton, the Eighteenth-century romantic poet.  It's kind of long, but if you 
scan through the part where Satan get ejected from Heaven and keep the lyrics 
to The Big Money in the back of your mind, some connections will throw 
themselves at you. 

--Xanadu came from Samuel T. Coleridge's "Kubla Khan".  Read it and be 
surprised.  He lived about the same time as Milton, both of them in England.

P.S.  If I had to pick my favorite all-time Rush song, it would by 2112 in its 
entirity.  That is quite an awe-inspiring piece of work.  Each time I listen 
to it it's like there's some new aspect that wasn't there before.  And every 
time it kicks ass. 

P.P.S.  Response to Jeremy Todd Strzynsi:
I have 2 Rush-related passwords.  One is for UNIX.

P.P.S.  For the Rush fan who has everything, don't forget Geddy's guest 
appearance on Bob & Doug MacKenzie's "Great White North" album release (1980 
or 81).  He sings "Take Off" while Bob & Doug squabble with each other.

And what do the NMS shirt prints look like?  Can't wait till I learn how to

Hey there,

well, let's react on some stuff.

Hmm, I think this may best be seen as a Primus-kind-of tribute to Rush.
Les Claypool in fact is a huuuge Rush fan. And when they do (partial)
covers, they bastardise them. He did the same in concert last year
with Zeppelin's Kashmir.

In the same (??) vain, I purchased a CD-copy of Signals to replace my
vinyl one. I played it at home, and to my astonishment some
Mexican sounding band started playing "Speedy Gonzalez". Of course
I thought the employee in the store had made a mistake, but the
CD itself also said "Signals" in big letters. I swapped it
at the store for a real copy.

Hmm, think this will do right now.

Oops, forgot to ask this: Just before I left, there was a lot of 
talking about NMS T-shirts. Did this beast ever get into existance
and if so, where can I get one?

Listen to _Van Halen II_ and _Women and Children First_?  There are a few
good bass RIFFS on those albums, but nothing that remains imaginative
throughout the whole song.

<A NAME="650024">Subject: Wedding Song, Passwords, DT Petition</A>

Hi kids,

   I read in yesterday's NMS that someone (Mark from here at U of D) asked
about Rush being played at a wedding.  Well, back in August, one of my
roommate got married and he made up a tape for the DJ to play during
dinner.  On the tape, he included "Different Strings."  Personally, I'd
like to hear "Ghost Of A Chance" at mine whenever that may be.

   Passwords...Well, both my login name (ghost) and my password are Rush
related.  "Ghost" comes from "Ghost Of A Chance" because of how much I
like the song along with some other reasons that stem from freshman year
and my fraternity.  

   I've been putting off this for a little while just because I don't want
any trouble, but here goes.  I know some of you do not like Dream Theater,
but MANY (very many) of us NMSers do.  While I am on the Dream Theater
list as well as being active on the NMS, I have taken the responsibility
of organizing a petition to have Dream Theater open for Rush on the next
tour.  I'm glad to see that some of you have already mentioned in posts to
the NMS that you would like to see this (or "no one" as one person said). 
If anyone here on the NMS would like to help in the cause, send me E-mail
and put "Send 'em to me" on the request line.  I will send you a copy of
the cover sheet w/ purpose and the signature sheet.  I know some of you
are saying "Oh, man, that's stupid.  I hate Dream Theater!" Well that's
fine, we all have our right to opinions, so if you feel you have something
to say (good or bad), don't post it, send it to me.  I'd prefer good
comments!!  I hope to get some support.  Thanks.

   I want to ask one thing...Is there any way to relay signals from radio
stations in other areas?  I would love to be able to listen to those
Massachusetts stations, Buffalo stations, and Q107 from Toronto at will! 
Just curious...

Greetings.... this is just a quick note to the gentleman down in Southern
Illinois who listens to WTAO "rock" 105.1.  I too realize that S.IL is
a gaping vortex which sucks as far a radio stations go.  WTAO (formerly
104.9 The Eagle) does play SOME Rush, but not as much as one would like.  I
think the most they played was when I sent in a "desert island disk" with my
Rush faves (Lock and Key) that was 45 minutes long, plus a midnight spotlight
on Rush for an entire hour back in '88.
 
I personally would recomend KSHE 95 (95.4 MHz) out of St. Louis... by far the
most redeeming radio station in So. IL, Ea. MO, and that general area.  I'm
not big into Chicago radio (cause I can't get it) but the AM/FM Loop (WLUP)
plays good Rush on occasion... B96 sux!
 
So, if you're in St. Louis for a RUSH concert, dial up 95.4 for pre- and post-
RUSH tunes... afterward they play the entire concert out (all the songs) for
that drive home!
 
Take care and keep those bones rolling.........    JHoke@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu

Hi All,
  Here in NEMO, we have an OK classic rock station (KRXL, 94.5) that
plays quite a bit of Rush.  Actually, the only band that I've heard more
than Rush is Zep and Neil Young.  I don't listen 24 hours a day, but it
seems every other time I turn on the radio they are playing a Rush tune.
Some of the uncommon ones that they play are...Anthem, Fly By Night
(I've heard this one twice), and the Big Money, as well as the old
standbys, Time Stand Still, Limelight, Subdivisions, etc.  It's actually
a very good station, few repeats.
I like the 20th anniversary idea.  Maybe the you-know-what could add a
line, "in celebration of the 20th anniversary of Rush" or something.

Hi Guys,
        A lot has been discussed on why our fav band has not got the 
recognition it must have got.I think every one in the group at one point or 
the other must've thought how much people who did'nt like RUSH missed.Well I 
feel that RUSH will always and always appeal to only a small sector of audience
(Just becos they don't conform to a lot of stuff all groups follow) The 
variety and the depthness of RUSH music and lyrics cannot be appretiated by 
most people who expect music to be always rhythmic or rebellic or to be 
enjoyed when they're in stupor! What I've written is hardly "flammable" but I 
welcome any comments or discussion.
         As about emotions in RUSH's songs.I warmly agree that there is a whole
lot of emotions in their songs.Infact by the time I finish hearing a RUSH song
I'd have gone thru a whole gamut of emotions.(ecstacy,pleasure.......)
         As for Radio stations which play RUSH songs here in Lexington,KY
(Central KY) there is always "a ghost of a chance" that you'll hear RUSH.I 
envy you guys!!!

Dear Rush Fans:

This is awesome!! A whole micro-cosmic planet, a complete society, even
devoted to the Great Ones. This is my first posting due to the fact that i 
have only been among you good people for three days now.

So please excuse any redundant, obvious, or just plain dumb questions I might 
pose.
   
Just curious to know how many books there might be out there about the boyz.
Would appreciate any info on obtaining them. I have been listening to RUSH
since 2112. (I first saw them on PerWav tour in Dayton Ohio. Seen them with my 
fellow RUSH fan duane (also a member of our group). At least once at their 
ability to drive the crowd into a frenzy, and to just plain blow your face 
off. Bring back Max Webster for an opening act. Also .38 Special has a song 
called Chain lighting. A twentieth aniversary bash does seem in order.

Gotta go. Would be great if we could get it off the ground and rolling.

                  Later,
