ORQ:  My station wagon can only carry 9 people to a Rush

BMG is based about 3 miles from me.  I've gotten stuff from them and
compared.  They work much like a book club (also based here), they buy
rtights for a fixed fee, and produce their own product.  The case has
their own ID code on the back.  The sound level is much lower.  The
quality I can;t say, the player was not good enough.  They may have
changed this policy--it was 3 years ago I fell for it.  But they are
cheaper due to lower overhead--production cost and rights,
specifically.  and from a collector point of view, book club and cd club
versions are generally worthless.

Lotus Land has been updated. New Pix and "My Lucky Rush Shirt" have been 
added. See me with my trophy winning fish!

Also, my boss/cousin heard the interview and told me about it 
yesterday morning. He was a little vague and led me to believe the Boys 
actually called it quits, but after reading the digest, Geddy's answers are 
still too ambiguous to get any hard facts. 

Ahh, it's Friday. Off to the bar I go.

Don't forget to visit Lotus Land, 19 people visiting so far since 12/10.

ive been waiting for the balence of my order too. i got part of it, but i im 
in for about 80 bucks. im not too worried though. if i dont get my shit or a

ill be sure pass that info along. i know the location of his bussiness and 
other tid bits that should make him pretty easy to find. just think how the

<A NAME="2157011">Subject: R&R HOF, ASOH vido review...</A>

I have a couple of things to say in this post.  First of all, in response
to Pete's post about Rush in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and how he
would rather that Rush wasn't inducted, I have to say that I agree with
you totally.  I really don't consider it an honor to Rush to be in the
HOF.  And I'm sure Rush doesn't consider it an honor either, and they
could probably care less if they were inducted or not.  HOWEVER, part of
me does want them to be inducted because I PERSONALLY want them to be
recognized publicly.  I want bragging rights to use against those who
don't like Rush, and who believe that the HOF actually is an honor.  I
want to know that at least they won't be REJECTED by the HOF.  What would
give me the most pleasure would be for Rush to be nominated, and then at
the induction ceremony, when it's time to do the customary thing and
accept the "honor," for Neil to denounce the R&R HOF for the joke that it
is, and then disrespectfully decline the nomination.

On another note, I think I am going to go out and buy a second copy of DS
to use as a backup.  This is because disc 3 is only a limited time bonus
disc.  Someday if my disc gets broken, scratched, lost or whatever, I may
not be able to go out and buy another one.  So I think we all ought to go
out and buy our backup copies now, and also increase DS sales in the
process.  

During the week when Showbiz Today was supposed to air the Rush interview,
they DID air a feature/interview on Phish.  I wonder if someone mistook
Phish for Rush.

And lastly, back in about 1989, when I was at the orthodontists office, I
was reading a People magazine and I saw an review in there for the ASOH
video.  So I ripped it out and it has been in my desk drawer for 10 years.
I have been meaning to post that review to the NMS for several years. Here
it is:

Even those who don't usually enjoy Rush may find this 14-song concert
video by the Canadian power-pop trio to their liking.  The band plays its
hits like "Big Money" <sic> and "Tom Sawyer" tightly and with a fuller
sound than threesomes customarily get.  Sharply edited, the video
integrates performance footage with computer graphics, film snippets and
animation.  A Show of Hands also clears up one nagging little 
microcontroversy.  Those who have only heard Rush's recordings may well
have doubted that a voice as high strung and impossibly zippy as Geddy
Lee's could actually issue from a human throat.  Seeing - and hearing at
the same time - is believing.  And witnessing the hatchet-faced singer
screeching out these songs on stage in Birmingham, England, should serve
to convince at least some Rush sceptics. (Polygram) --- D.H.

<A NAME="2157012">Subject: Re: Your name</A>

Hey, my name is Matt Maholchic, and I'm a teacher.  The other day I was so 
bored at a faculty meeting that I actually graphed RUSH's albums.  I e-mailed 
my buddy with the results.  Here is that e-mail, thought you'd get a laugh...

I was in a staff development meeting on Wednesday and was so incredibly bored
I did what I haven't done since college...actually GRAPHED Rush's 20 albums
on a 1-20 scale, 1 being the best.  Here are my results:

1) Moving Pictures (Best blend of drumming, writing, hot licks and keyboards
out there, coupled with super songwriting.  The album with which all that
Rush ever wanted to be blended like a beautiful musical eclipse...)

2) A Farewell to Kings (The ultimate Rush song- 'Closer to the Heart'- the
first epic song- 'Xanadu'- and the angry rage of 'A Farewell to Kings,' one
of the top 5 Rush songs ever...along with very underrated songs like
'Cinderella Man' and 'Madrigal'...rounded off by 'Cygnus', the weird prelude
to 'Hemispheres'...this album was about three years ahead of its time
musically).

3) Signals (some say too many keyboards...maybe, but the strength of the
songs is only matched by 'Moving Pictures', especially 'New World Man' and
'Analog Kid'.  'Subdivisions' powers it, 'Losing It' is melancholy artistry,
and 'The Weapon' is full of symbolism).

4) Permanant Waves (Has 'Spirit of Radio' and 'Freewill', enough said...the
rest of the album is good...this is the album that they wanted 'Hemispheres'
to be).

5) Presto (Rush's most underrated album, but incredibly addictive once given
a chance...all the songs on the record are great, and this is Peart's best
drumming since 'Hemispheres').

6) Counterparts (This is Rush's 'Synchronycity'...half power trio social
conciousness, half paen to the pain of divorce and the never-ending mystery
of what makes men and women so different.  Of all of Rush's 90s
return-to-rock records, this is the best).

7) 2112 (The culmination of Rush's early attempts to be a concept band).

8) A Show of Hands (Rush's best-sounding live record)

9) Test for Echo ('Counterparts' part two, this is full of awesome rock and
roll and some phenomenal lyrics, particularly 'Half the World', 'Resist' and
'Dog Years').

10) Hemispheres (A little self-indulgent on the first side, but musically the
band's most creative album, and obviously 'The Trees' is one of their top
five songs).

11) Different Stages (This is a brilliant collection of live work from the
last two years...nice to see the band return to old warhorses 'Natural
Science', 'Analog Kid' and 'The Trees'...nice to see, finally, a version of
'Limelight' on a live record...could have substituted 'Red Barchetta' for
'Tom Sawyer' and made it even better.  '2112' in its entirety was a NICE
surprise, but they play it in G now instead of A...:) Geddy's not a young man
anymore and his voice can't take it, it would appear...the 1978 show has a
terrific 'A Farewell to Kings').

12) Hold Your Fire (A lot of people didn't like this record because this is
Rush's last record before the 'Roll the Bones' comeback...but beneath the
layers of synthesizers are some great songs.  'Force Ten', 'Time Stand Still'
and 'Mission' all push for spots on the 6-10 section of a RUSH top ten songs
list).

13) Power Windows ('Territories' is maybe the ultimate Neil Peart showcase
song, while 'Big Money' and 'Marathon' are sound concert favorites.  'Emotion
Detector' and 'Manhattan Project' are terrific poems put to music).

14) Roll the Bones (The first of Rush's return to their roots, this record
has an exceptional first side, but peters out on the second side).

15) All the World's a Stage (A sweet taste of the band's 70s show).

16) Fly By Night ('By-Tor and the Snow Dog' is the band's early attempt at a
'2112', but 'Fly By Night' is still going strong on radio and 'In the End'
and 'Beneath, Between and Behind' are signs that this band is NOT Led
Zeppelin).

17) Caress of Steel (This is basically the b-side of 'Fly By Night'.
'Lakeside Park' and 'Bastille Day' are power songs, and the 'Necromancer' is
a weird distraction).

18) Exit Stage Left (Good songs, but whoever mixed the album was stoned).

19) Rush (This is Led Zeppelin).

20 Grace Under Pressure (Rush's black album, released in the Reagan vs. the
Evil Empire/"The Day After" early 80s...this is the band's weakest effort,
with dinky drums, a feeble attempt to sound like a mainstream 80s pop band
like Night Ranger or Journey, and pessimistic, Floydish songs about the
aftermath of the dreaded global nuclear prom.  Let Floyd play Floyd...Rush's
only song that conveys their message is 'Kid Gloves'...the only song that
doesn't leave you with an impulse to slash your wrists).

Whoa, are you listening to the same album as the rest of us?  Anyone else
feel this way?  I'd like to know what your example of a better sounding
live album is?  Or am I missing the sarcasm?

As for the BMG CD's, I've got some of the remasters from them, and some
from the stores.  I sure can't hear where the BMG ones sound any worse.  I
think that what people have posted about them being manufactured
independently from the ones sold in stores is correct, but I think the
standards have much improved from the past.  They certainly now contain all
of the graphics and printing on the discs that the "official" ones have.
So I'm curious, is there anyone out there who has actually noticed inferior
sound on BMG discs of the last few years?

Cheers!

To make this an official Rush sighting, the twelve second time stamp is
coupled with twenty one words in this sentence.

WOW, that makes 21 and :12 ... ooohhhhhhhhhhh.

But besides meaningless Rush sightings, my real problem is with those people
who actually counted that first sentence to make sure there were 21 words
there.  BECAUSE it's those same exact people who I need to talk to here.  TIME
STAMPING IS ONE STEP AWAY FROM OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER.

There I said it.  I mean, really it's pretty scary thinking about the time and
energy going into time stamping certain sections of a song to make your point.
 Here is the most tragic case example:

"If I recall correctly" is a phrase that indicates a casual knowledge of
something.  "If I recall correctly" means that I think it's that, but I may be
wrong.  However, the end of this sentence goes "... it's 21:35".  THIS
indicates a specific, even obsessive, knowledge of the facts.  So, he's trying
to look casual, but we all know he sat there with his stopwatch (because the
CD player divides each song up and doesn't give you the total for 2112), and
OBSESSIVELY figured out the TIME!!!!

Time stamping is a disease and should stop right now!!!  The only people who
really need to Time Stamp are the BAND MEMBERS who are playing the songs and
need to index it accordingly.  Spend the time and energy it takes to time
stamp, and pet your dog, notice how much the children have grown, or bathe.

Thanks, Uncle Joe!  For those who don't know, Joe Benson is a long-time DJ
on Los Angeles radio, and is currently the morning voice on Arrow FM 93.1.
One of his fellow DJ's is Bob Coburn, the original host of Rockline.  I was
thrilled to hear on the station yesterday that Rockline was finally
returning to LA, and that Mr. Coburn would once again be hosting.  He has
an extensive knowledge of rock & roll from his many years on the air, and
his Rockline shows were always well done.  (And, he once bought me a beer
at a Rik Emmett show, but that's beside the point...)

The promo on the air said that Rush would inaugurate the return of Rockline
on Jan 20.  Looking forward to it!  I see that as a very good sign that
they would bother to do a live call-in show 2 full months after the release
of DS!  Perhaps they'll be ready to talk of the future...

Cheers!

Hi Fellow Rushians,
	Wow. I recently checked out my site, and the counter says that I have
had over 1,000 visits since September 2. I would have never thought that
a 14-year-old like me would be able to create a popular Rush site. And I
owe it all to you guys. Thanks for coming to my site. My site would be
nothing without the help and inspiration of you guys. (that also
includes rush-mgr.)
	Anyway, I was recently at my drum lessons (which I get at a music
store) and I was thinking about the issue of Hit Parader with Geddy Lee.
As I was in (the name of the store is Minotti Music) I saw that they got
the new issue of Guitar World Magazine. The guy at the front counter
(who's a college kid named John) who's a friend of mine,  saw me staring
at it. He knows that I really like Rush so he told me that there was a
Rush article inside. There was. There were pictures of Geddy and Alex,
interviews with both of them, and there was also some guitar tabs. They
were talking about the new album. Another friend of mine said that he
saw an interview of Alex Lifeson in Guitar Magazine.

Hi,

First, a Rush hearing. I heard Entre Nous on the radio for the very first time 
the other day in St. Louis on 97.1. They play "80s rock that rocks". It is a 
mix of 80s hair metal and groups like Rush(lots),LZ,etc. I always thought that 
Entre Nous was a radio "natural".

>>P.S.  Is anybody out there still waiting for any CDs from Prism Records.
I'm still waiting for him to fulfill an order I mailed on May 5th.>>

I am waiting as well, but 'only' since July. I pulled this from the latest 
Prism website update, dated November 12 :
 "By now, many of you have your CDs, and of those that do not, many more are 
mere days or weeks away. My goal of having everything done and shipped by 
Thanksgiving is still within reach, and even if everything goes straight to 
hell, I'm still gonna be very close. "

So the bullshit just keeps coming, although I would love to her from somebody 
that has recently received their order. I noticed that the e-mail address has 
also disappeared. Can somebody send it to me? I know that it will change 
anything, but I will get the chance to send flames if I get in the arsonist 
mood.

I am thankful that all my other dealings with bootleg CDs have worked out well.

Shipping is usually around $3 and is waived for orders over $100. I've
bought a LOT of CDs from this site, always with great service. If your
order is over $100, but they can't get one particular CD, they still
waive the shipping fee even if your total order falls under $100. The

pages load VERY fast (they don't waste any time on CD graphics unless
you ask for specific info on a specific CD. CD Connection also have the
lowest day-to-day prices I've found anywhere. Compared to CD Now, Music

Dan Miers <DMiers@nmh.org> wrote the following regarding BMG CDs:

I will not dispute this statement.  However, I ask you to reexamine the
above.  The phrase in quotes says "manufactured under license *FOR* BMG,"
not "manufactured under license *BY* BMG."  BMG is a marketer, not a
manufacturer, of CDs.  In addition, this simple phrase is stamped on the
back of the CD to preclude retailers from buying the CDs (at reduced
prices) and selling them in their stores.  Other than this phrase, the CDs
one buys from BMG and retailers are identical.

I have been ordering from BMG since 1991 and have received nothing but the
same quality CDs I would expect from a retailer.  The packaging is
identical, the booklets are identical, the labeling is identical (save the
phrase identified above).  There is no skipping, no increased noise, no
defects of any kind.  Perhaps the one problem that can occur when ordering
from BMG is cracked jewel cases, but this is a rare occurrence and can
occur in any type of mail-order chain, not just BMG.

>The reason BMG can offer its discs at such a low price is that they are not
>selling the, for example, Atlantic release of "Different Stages."  BMG has

>cheaper for BMG or they wouldn't do it.

Incorrect.  BMG has purchased the right to *market* the CD on it's own.  If
they, per your example, are not selling the Atlantic release of "Different
Stages," why does the Atlantic label still appear on the CD?  Furthermore,
the prices of CDs that BMG sells are, in general, not cheaper.  They cost
between $14.95 and $16.95 each.  However, they have an introductory program
to lure consumers by offering 10 or 11 CDs for the price of one.  They
don't count on the fact that some consumers join up, get their 10 CDs, and
then jump ship.  Rather, they count on keeping customers after this
introductory offer so that they will buy CDs at regular prices.  However,
BMG is not losing any money with this introductory offer.  CDs are very
inexpensive (from a wholesale cost point of view).  The CDs you and I buy
at "regular prices" have an incredibly high profit margin.

>How the disc is manufactured, i.e. a digital pressing of a digital copy of
an original, I don't know, but I can
>speculate it is not of the same quality as the direct-label release (again,
>if it were, how could it be cheaper?).

You can speculate all you want, but you will be wrong in the end.  Again,
BMG has the right to market the CD, not the right to manufacture it.  And
again, the CDs are not cheaper (see above).

>Collectors have shunned BMG products as worthless because they are not
>legitimate releases.  I had a friend describe it to me as trying to claim a
>Memorex recording of the White Album is as valuable as the original LP in
>its original packaging.

Your friend has poisoned your thinking.  BMG is not making a "bootleg copy"
of released CDs and then selling them for their own gain.  This would be
illegal.  BMG is marketing the CD in a way that is separate from a retail
outlet.  Think of it this way...The record company can choose to sell its
CDs through retailers only.  But the record company enlists the help of
marketers like BMG to help widen the distribution of the record.  BMG has
to pay for this right, but as long as it can sell CDs at a rate that
outpaces the licensing fees, BMG makes money.  The record company wins
because more of a particular artist's record sells, more people get
interested in the music, and therefore more people are likely to buy future
releases, thereby making the record company even more money.

>You guys can re-awaken the "1's and 0's are 1's and 0's" debate if you'd

>Enough for now.

Hopefully, this is enough.  But somehow I don't think so.

Hey Pete <trigeek@mindspring.com>, hate to say it but I think if
anyone's IQ needs raising, it's obviously yours and not the reader
base of TNMS.  Since you had such a problem with my "suggestion" of
ribbons maybe you should take the time to actually READ my post to
see that I was making a JOKE.  But apparently my joke was far too
subtle to sink into your thick cranium.

Furthermore, if you think Rush doesn't belong in the ROR HOF then maybe
you ought to take it up with the management of the NMS Website, since
it's their campaign.  Maybe you ought to simply stop reading TNMS.

Just because the idiots that select members for the Hall have made
crappy decisions in the past doesn't mean that bands who are legitimate
"heroes" of the genre do not belong there.  Rather, you should try
thinking of it as us doing our part to point the HOF in the right
direction.

The baseball HOF has made some crappy decisions in the past and has
avoided many good decisions, but it doesn't make it any less of an honor
to be selected.  And the people who give out the Grammy Awards have made
some HORRIBLE decisions in the past, but if Rush was to win one I think
we would all be proud that "The boys finally got their due".

Just because Rush do not SEEK recognition doesn't mean they shouldn't
GET any.  Most geniuses are rather humble and self-effacing, and say
that their talent "is no big deal, really!" but deep down inside they
find it very gratifying when other people appreciate them.  They just
don't brag about it.

So if we want to honor our favorite band by pushing to get them
inducted, you should let us.  If you don't, then fine just step aside.
I'm sure all the RUSH TRIBUTE WEBSITES out there take up PLENTY of
bandwidth on the internet (mine included), but if someone told us not
to do it because "90% of the bands with tribute sites are losers, and
the other 10% are mainstream appealists", guess what?  I doubt any of
us would take our sites down.

Think about it.

<A NAME="2157026">Subject: Double necks</A>

I was wondering about the photo collection in DS's liner. What a great
collection of memories.  It's also really neat to see what the band considers
reminiscent of each particular album (and of their lives) as you look thru the
liner layout.  

But my question is where are the shots of Geddy and Alex with their double
necks?    There is alot of memorabilia from that era in the liner and I'm just
surprised that this angle of their playing didn't make it into the "DS
archives" the band has so graciously displayed. The double necks were part of
their calling card back then or so I thought.  Why weren't they in the liner?
Any thoughts? I haven't seen anything on this here.

What made me think of all this is that my brother handed me an old black and
white 8x10 the other week from a late 70's Rush show (Hemispheres?) where he
and his friend had front row seats and a camera. (don't ask why I wasn't
there. ^%##&*$) This picture he handed me was an awesome shot of Geddy and
Alex jamming with their doublenecks, and in the background is a decent view of
Neil behind his drum cage with the 2 red Rush stars on the front of the
drumkits,  the chimes hanging to the right side.  What a great picture.   :)
(Scanner should be coming at Christmas...)  Does anyone know of a reason the
double neck shots wouldn't have been used for the liner??  Is there any
stories that go along with this?

To change the subject, at one of the TFE shows that I saw, (in lovely Camdem,
NJ) the backdrop screen had a close up camera shot of the little stuffed
dinosaur (I think) they had sitting on stage on one of the amps, with a note
leaning against it that said "Not bad for 3 old dinosaurs".  Well, the crowd
went wild at this when it was shown. Geddy turned around to the screen to see
what the crowd was reacting to, and when he saw that shot, he just started
laughing. Did this happen anywhere else on the TFE tour?  Just curious, I've
never seen mention of this particular stage prop.

Hey -

I have read with great interest people's thoughts and opinion on the new RM.
Without wishing to appear too much of a drum-bore, I'd like to make a couple
of points.

First, I agree that the 2/3 section near the beginning is a respectful to nod
to Max Roach, who I guess did this kind of part many years before Bozzio?  I
don't know, but certainly it is like The Drum Also Waltzes.  Perhaps it is
even a nod to Bill Bruford....?

I was interested that someone thought that RMii was less athletic than RM from
HYF tour.  I certainly agree that it is more "musical", but there remain some
pretty scary moments of athletisism in my opinion.  Isn't this part of the
illusion that Neil has talked about?  The way sometimes what he is playing
seems simple, compared to an obviously wild drum part.  To be honest though, I
would say that the truly impressive features of the new solo are the
incredible limb independence displayed, and the way it sounds like a
percussionist playing, not "just" [excuse the expression, I can't think of a
better term here] a kit player.  Of course, that's probably because Neil is
such a good percussionist, for a kit player.

A question to all the drummers / better listeners than me out there:  in the
DS solo, some 4+ mins in, Neil plays part of Scars.  Before he starts to play
a snare back-beat [with a trigger?] on 2 and 4, he is playing the
tom/percussion voice part.  At this point, is he playing some snare notes into
the part......?  Or is it the snare buzzing?  Or is my hi-fi broken?  Or have
I gone mad?  

For what it's worth, to me, RMii simply beggars belief.

Warning:  Flame Wars May Result From This Post.

I have to agree with Pete, I'm not sure I want to see them in the HoF. 
It's nice to think that RUSH would get the recognition that they 
deserve, and don't get me wrong because I definitely think they deserve 
it, but pushing them into the Hall of Fame really changes nothing.   It 
won't make the existing fan base any more loyal, how could we be?  If 
their being placed in the Hall of Fame would make me a more loyal fan, 
then shame be on me.  

I cringe when I read about you guys who trade in your old CDs when you 
buy remasters.  I couldn't do it.  Of course it helps that I have a 
teenage son who I now don't have to share with, but I still couldn't do 
it.  Some releases, I have three copies of.  And, I really cringe when I 
go into used stores and see traded in CDs (Counterparts does NOT belong 
in a used CD bin).  So, I think I'm a fairly loyal person and nothing 
will change that. 

Will making the Hall of Fame bring in new fans?  I can't see that.  

Does RUSH need that kind of new fan, the kind who jumps on a bandwagon 
because someone showed up in the crappy Hall of Fame?  I can't see that 
either.  If someone is a serious music fan they'll give them an honest 
listen and evaluation, and probably don't pay attention to the HoF 
anyway!  As far as RUSH and the fans, they obviously have more to deal 
with now with us loyal types than they need or want sometimes. I shudder 
to think about having to leave my country or move from my home to keep 
my privacy.  

So, what would ranting and raving and pushing them into the Hall of Fame 
accomplish?   To my thinking, nothing. 

It  used to really bug me that they get so little radio time, and so 
little 'critical' recognition.  Now, I see that it truly doesn't matter.  
We love their music, they know that.  We are loyal to them, they know 
that.  It's a pure, unadulterated relationship.  Isn't that enough?

Flame away guys.  I'm a big girl, I can take it.

Nan

Anyone have any info or experience in dealing with Jart music?  I'd like

Hey, I was wondering if anybody out there has a scanned image 
of the wolf howling at the moon from the T4E album/tour book.
It's a beautiful piece of art that I wanna add to my website.
As with Rush, I love dogs and wolves just about as much as they do.
(Limelight video/"Dog Years"/T4E "Limbo" dog which might be 
Neil's/T4E wolf)
The Hell with cats! hehe just kidding.
Well if you got it, send it my way.   Thanks
