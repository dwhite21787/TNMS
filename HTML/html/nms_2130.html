Hope everyone caught the album premiere last night! I, like many of you,
resorted to listening to it through the internet (I was listening to Rock 103
in Tenessee!) If you also used RealAudio or Netshow to hear the broadcast,
take the time to send a quick email to the radio station you listened to
and thank them! Tell them how great it is they have an internet feed, how
your local station plays crap, and you got their station info from the NMS
page :-)

I got the whole show (minus 2 min or so when my computer crashed), and am
transcribing it. I could also record it, but the main reason you listen to
these album premieres is to hear the music, and the music is not very good
quality. I *will* be recording the interview once I get my radio copy (on
Sunday) though.

More news... the DS ads will begin running on VH-1 starting tomorrow, so get
those vcr's ready! I've heard that it's a neat ad, and features the 3
live versions of CTTH! Geddy & Alex were also interviewed for CNN's "Showbiz
Today", which should be running next week. This show airs Monday - Friday from
2:30pm - 3 Eastern time, 11:30am - noon Pacific. Their website is at:

http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/showbiz.today/index.html

but unfortunately they update it every day with the show that's running
THAT DAY (so we'll have no advance warning). They also will be transcribing 
the segment on their website (no pictures though). You can also order VIDEOS
of this show, so everyone should be able to see it (info is also on their
website). I'll put it into RealVideo when I get it taped.

And there will be DS reviews in both Entertainment Weekly and People coming
soon, so be on the lookout!

Some more info on the fancast, taken from the Atlantic website:

       RUSH MEMBERS TO DO EXCLUSIVE FANCAST ON NOVEMBER 15
       Nov 4, 1998

       On November 15th, in conjunction with the release of their
       multi-disc live set,"DIFFERENT STAGES," Rush members
       Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson will visit New York City and
       the newly opened Atlantic DigitalArena Studio for an online
       fan text chat and a special, direct-to-web online
       "FANCAST" -- moderated by renowned music journalist
       Lisa Robinson. The event kicks off at 7 p.m. (EST) with the
       half-hour Lee/Lifeson text chat, available via SonicNet's
       Yahoo! Auditorium (www.yahoo.com). The "FANCAST"
       forum, which begins at 7:30 p.m., will feature a
       question-and-answer session with Robinson and a look
       back at the band's extensive video archive. "FANCAST"
       events are available via the Atlantic web site at
       www.atlantic-records.com. 

I'm assuming here that the actual fancast part will be in Atlantic's "Digital
Arena" studio, on their website. I believe that Rush is the first artist
in their DigitalArena! For international readers, EST is 5 hours behind GMT.

*whew* I think that about covers it. I only transcribed about 40% of the 
interview last night before I got too tired, but I'll be sending out a
special edition after this with what I have. I'll try to get the rest of it
done tonight. The actual show was over 2 hours, so if your radio station is
going to be playing it this weekend and you have your tapes ready, make sure
to pause it during a few of their LENGTHY commercials so it'll all fit!
(I'm thinking it was ~2 hours 10 min)

Heard 4 songs on the four-play (4 songs at 4:00) on WRBR (South Bend).
Wow! Best live Rush recordings I've heard! Limelight is, well, fatter.
Roll The Bones ^%$%ing GROOVES! Working Man is its typical wonderful
self, and TS is beefier. Definately a must-buy.
Also, in response to all this "How good ARE Geddy and Alex?" Alex is a
genius. If there's a cliche in the world of guitar, he does NOT use
it. I wonder where he comes up with half of what he writes (Show Don't
Tell, Jacob's Ladder (That weird Cdim), etc.). Geddy is easily the
best bassist out there. He has probably influenced more bassists then
anyone else out there. One of the most common things I've heard said
about him is, "How can he sing and Play bass like that at the same
time?" Add to that the fact that he's a keyboardist...

We all know Neil is the best.... Geddy is the best rock bass player.....and
Alex was named to the 100 Greatest Guitar Players of All-time in Guitar World.
For me, Alex is very underrated because he was one of the first to use volume
swells (way before Eddie Van Halen) also his feel and sound is very unique.
Alex for his time is probably the best not only because Hendrix and Page are
OVERrated as hell, but also that Lerxst was doing stuff never heard at the
time (La Villa Strangiato). But you also have to think of it this way....HE IS
GROUPED WITH THE BEST "RHYTHM" SECTION OF ALL-TIME!!! (Lee and Peart of
course). If Alex was in lesser great band, his talent would show alot more.
Anyhow, just thought I'd get my opinion in.....

<A NAME="2130004">Subject: Live version(s) of Spirit of Radio</A>

With the release of DS upon us, we now have two official live album versions of
SOR (personally, this is one Rush song that cannot be overplayed).  I'm sure by
now, that most of us have heard the DS version somewhere (radio, 'net, etc).
After hearing it myself, it occurred to me that the cheering crowd after the
"...concert hall..." line might not be a stock sound as used on the studio
version.  Is the crowd in Chicago actually cheering at the right moment in the
song to match the studio version?  How about back on E...SL?  Anybody know?

I'm sorry this is not rush-related, but music related...
I just bought the new Monster Magnet album Powertrip. It's pretty good.
All the bad words are censored out of the record. Does anyone else have
this album? Is your copy censored, too. I'm not talking about "Tractor"
with all those bleeps. "Bummer" has all the f -words taken out, for
example. I bought this at Wal*Mart, and I know they pressure record
companies to edit 'innapropriate' lyrics and artwork from albums.
To add some rush content to this post-  Do we have anything to worry
about with Different Stages? Would there be anything that Wal*Mart would
want to censor? Maybe tinker toys are too suggestive or something.

<A NAME="2130006">Subject: Music of the Spheres</A>

The guy who introduced me to Rush, always claimed not to like the Analog
Kid because he didn't know what Neil meant by "The music of the spheres".
It always seemed silly to me to hate a song just because you don't know
what the writer meant.  To me it's what the song means to you, not the author.

But anyway, yesterday I was reading a book and the author gave a quote that
might help (this is about the Pythagorean view of how the cosmos worked):

 "The Pythagoreans said that the bodies which revolve around the center
have their distances in proportion, and some revolve more quickly, others
more slowly, the sound which they make during themotion being deep in the
case of the slower, and high in the case of the quicker; these sounds, then
depending on the ration of the distances, are such that their combined
effect is harmonious."
 Alexander of Aphrodisias - lived in Alexandria, Egypt 3rd century BC

Sounds like a "music of the spheres" to me:)

I'm listening to the Different Stages album premier as I type and am
noticing some strange things from the surround channels. Some of the music
is back there at low levels, but once and a while something gets louder
(like the guitar solo in Driven), and there's just tonnes of crowd sounds
back there when a cheer comes out of the crowd.

Does anyone know if this CD was actually surrounded encoded, or is my
decoder pulling out surround information that actually doesn't really exist?

Please, if someone still has a chance to record the broadcast:
Yes, HiFi VHS tape gives you an exceptional quality audio track;
But, PLEASE, record it in SP (2 hour) mode--and then share!  ;-)

I read in a HiFi mag a few years ago that the signal-to-noise
ratio of 2-hour mode HiFi approaches that of CD (90-something dB).
BUT the 6 hour mode is a completely different story.  It *may*
be better than Casette, but not by much (from memory).

For 2-hour shows like this, just use one of those new T-160
tapes, they will record 2 hours and 40 minutes in SP mode.
You wont miss a thing!

If anyone gets a VHS recording, PLEASE drop me a line and I'll send you
a blank!  San Francisco Bay Area radio SUCKS!

Thanks!

Toronto.  The interview will run for about an hour and is to be aired on
Monday evening, Nov. 9, 1998 at 9:00 p.m. Central on the Loop, 97.9 FM.  Those
are all the details I could get.  I tried to ask if they were at least going
to play the new cd or parts thereof that night as well.  The response I got
was that the details haven't been finalized and that was all they were allowed

yet, so just tune in to the Loop and listen for more details.  I sound like a

Time for chart updates again:

Nearly 19 years later, The Spirit of Radio returns to the charts.  TSOR
debuted in this week's Mainstream Rock chart at #36.  The chart is based on
radio airplay and singles sales.

Chart History:

5 years ago, this week, the #2 album in the U.S. was Counterparts.  This
was Rush's highest album chart position ever!

Hey!

Grand KickAss Kudos to the rush-mgr and all those who made the
NMS msg board on the website possible.  It was so great sharing
our feelings as we were listening to the netcast.  HI! to all who
were there--Dogbert, Scoots, Xhamlin, Slowdog.  We managed almost
60 messages in 2 hours.  Not bad!

Special thanks to Brian Andonian for posting that WRIF was
playing the premiere.  Since it is an Eastern time station, I
didn't have to stay up til midnight to hear the broadcast (I'm in
Central Time).  "It's on Central Time!"

Bonjour Rush mates! Been checking out TNMS for a bit now and I figured I
throw my 2 cents in about the talent of Geddy(Gary) Alex and Neil. As for
Neil, it's pretty much a gimme that he's a drumming god. What I like
about his playing now is he seems to be playing WITH Geddy and Alex. Not
over them. Probably has a lot to do with his simplified drum kit. I do
somewhat miss his incredible business from the early releases, like on
Tom Sawyer for example where he was EVERYWHERE, but I like how he's
locked in with the others now. It doesn't seem like Geddy and Alex are
having to try to "keep up" so much anymore. Maybe I was just hearing
things before but as a musician I think I have pretty good ears.

Alex I think is one of the most underated guitar players out there. I
think a lot of that is because he's TOO GOOD! A lot of mediocer players
compensate by show boating the few things they can do well. Like some
players can't play rythym for crap but can rip on a certain pentatonic or
ionian scale solo and so they do it every song. After awhile of hearing
it over and over people will say, "wow! he sure can shred!" and say he's
awesome. But what else can he do? The same goes for great rythym players
who can't solo worth damn. ie James Hetfield from Metallica. Those
players can create awesome rythyms but stand them alone and that's all
you've got. Which is fine as long as they hook up with other band mates
to make up for their lapses. But Alex now! Years of being the only guitar
player has really rounded him out as a player! He does so many things
well that no one thing stands out and so his true talent may not get
recognized because of it. Just listen to his soloing on Working Man. Or
Analog Kid. Or La villa Strangiato. AMAZING! And then listen to his
rythem playing on songs like Xanadu, or Lime Light! My God! And his use
of effects in near legendary. I truly believe that Alex, although he gets
plenty of respect, deserves so much more from us in the guitar playing
world. My hat's off to ya Alex!

Last but not least is Geddy. It's hard to describe his playing. He amazes
me! Even more lately. He too seems to have settled back and is playing
more with the band instead of on top of them. Earlier on it seemed he
played bass more or less like a second lead guitar and left it for Neil
to hold the beat on his own. I play guitar and bass and when I switch to
bass it's hard for me to sit back and groove sometimes because the guitar
instincs try to take over. I read in the rush history by the B-man that
Geddy started on guitar so that might be where that came from. But I
loved it anyway! He's so fluid and accomplished you would just listen in
awe. But now I listen to the whole songs in awe because the bands more in
sync than ever before. And the Gedster still RAWKS! Just listen to Driven
for proof of that.

I saw some posts wondering if Geddy ever used a pick. I remeber reading
in a guitar mag (a long time ago, can't remember which one) that he said
he never really has. But he said he got his right thumbnail ripped out
once and when it grew back it came in really tough. So he can use is
thumbnail as a pick when he wants. I don't know if that qualifies as
using a pick or not. I guess technically it does because it's the same
motion and you'd hear the attack of his nail just like a pick. It's
interesting to note that he doesn't play bass with his fingers the way
most bass players do anyway. If you watch most players, (me included)
they'll rest their thumb on either the bridge or a pick-up and use the
index and middle finger pretty much exclusively to play the strings.
Geddy uses the "classical guitar" technique where he'll play the lowest
sounding string with his thumb and the other three strings with his
index, middle and ring fingers. Watch any classical guitarist and then
watch Geddy and you'll see what I mean.

Anyway, I'm done rambling! Remember to have fun and to hold the red star
proudly high in hand!

Peace!

Its kinda amazing.  I have been getting (nad have been meaning to

at work.  I also have tried to access the web site from the old 
syrinx.umd addresss..to no avail (the search engines still lists the 
url at syrinx).  So I finally found out the new URL, and wouldnt u know 
its the nite of the album premiere..thanx for the info!  Since I am in 
chicago, I just *knew* it was gonna come on here!  So I ran thru the 
house looking 4 a blank tape...couldnt find one (I wanted to encode the 
program in Real audio)....so I gave up.  The program was coming on at 
11pm chicago time, I scanned the dials for the next 15mins...no luck!  
Needless to say I was pissed!!  So I went back to TNMS web site and it 
also contained linx of radio stations streaming the program over the net 
via Real player!  I listened to it from a station in atlanta, then later
from a station in seattle-this was in stereo.  Long 
live the net!  BTW, I am also gonna send this email to the Real guys, 
the atlanta radio station, in addition to TNMS (http://syrinx.yyz.com/)
The ironic thing is that from the interview geddy said that about 75% of
the Test For Echo songs were recorded in chicago, since chicago had
the loudest crowdz.  I was at both shows in chi ofcourse

I rang Vivante, an audiophile record mail order company that I have used in
the past and they have a good knowledge of the record industry.  They 
investigated and a couple of days later when I called back, they said that 
there was no trace of this. It would probably have to be around six LPs 
(wonderful!), and this would therefore be quite a thing (especially compared 
to a crummy paper CD effort). Since Atlantic/Warners have even stopped making 
the Led Zepplin LPs, Vivante reckon that it is improbable that they would 
make this for Rush.

I also rang Atlantic records marketing department (0171 938 2181) and the
lady there said that on her system, only a CD version was scheduled for 
release (3 CDs - no mention of multimedia stuff). That also meant that there 
was no cassette version.

I hope this is eventually proved wrong, but I'm not holding my breath.

Hi,
A few comments on recent posts:

1. The King Biscuit show-
I'm pretty sure this recording is an edited version of the GUP video
soundtrack. I used to own this CD and I thought this was the case.  I later
read the same thing on some website dedicated to Rush bootlegs.  There are at
least 3 King Biscuit CDs around.  They have different broadcast dates on them
but are all the same recording.  I also own some of the recently released full
length KB CDs and they're good.  KB usually made very good recordings of
complete shows and distributed edited version (with commercials inserted, etc)
to the radio stations.  I suspect there will be no KB release of the Rush
show, perhaps because KB didn't record it in their normal fashion (i.e. it's
the GUP video soundtrack).

2. At the top of the Syrinx website there are two rectangular pieces of
artwork.  I was wondering if they have some official source or are Rush-Mgr
originals?

   [ These are originals done by a friend of mine, Leigh-Ann. She's been 
     helping out with the graphics... she also did the Horizons logo, the
     "in loving memory" and a new graphic that I'm putting up on the "preview"
     page.                                                     : rush-mgr ]

3. Alex's SG - I remember a picture in the AFTK tourbook of Alex sitting in
the middle of about 8 guitars.  I *think* there is no SG guitar in that group.
Of course, that's about 20 years ago.  I don't think I've ever seen a picture
of him playing one.  Check Alex's equipment list in the later tourbooks.

WOW!!  DS is going to be a seriously kickin' article of music!!
I told myself (and the NMS) that I would not listen to any premieres
or audio clips of DS.....but I did anyway.  It was nice to hear Alex
and Ged speak about Rush and the live stuff.  It was disheartening
when Geddy was asked about Rush's prospects of continuing.  I don't
think they'll go back to recording anytime soon but it didn't sound
too bad..... "extended hiatus" translates to "we'll be out for a while."
It'll be 2000 at least, IMHO.

On to DS, 2112 sounded so very, very classic and special, to bad
Geddy can't scream like in old days, but it'll be okay.  The Hammersmith
stuff seems extremely fresh and of high quality sound-wise.

<A NAME="2130026">Subject: Different Stages Review in a Brazilian Newspaper</A>

I've found this today; it's a review of DS that appeared in a brazilian
newspaper called O Estado de Sao Paulo. I'm giving you a (rough)
translate of this; sorry for my english. The URL is listed at the end of
the post. By the way, O Estado sucks!!! What a stupid reviewer guy!!!
Well, see by yourself!

Begin of Translate:

Rush remembers progressive rock in triple CD

'Different Stages' register last year's tour in USA and rescues a 1978
London show

Canadian trio Rush releases, at 17,  the fourth live album of its
career. The triple CD Different Stages brings performances from the
American Tour last year and a 1978 show from London. Formed 29 years
ago, Rush has established a reputation of antological performances, but
has never played in Brazil, Nor has plans to do so. Bassist and singer
Geddy Lee explains, by phone, that the band is waiting for drummer Neil
Peart, who has lost his 19 years old daughter in a car crash, to
recuperate [I couldn't find a better aproximation here; sorry]. For
instance, live performances only at the CD.

Geddy Lee researched more than 100 hours of live recorded performances
at the group archives to get the repertoire of Different Stages. "It was
like a retrospect of our career", says, nostalgically. "We have the bad
habit of recording our shows, it's not a creative process, but a painful
one; to hear these performances is to pass by a evaluation test - to
know if we've got better or worse".

When dedicating a entire CD to the 1978 show, Rush invites the listener
to evaluate its evolution. The bassist admits that he hated that
recording, made for BBC, and forgot even the existence of the tape, left
somewhere in his home. Time has not made the [recorded] show get better,
but has valorized the repertoire of that time, superior of Rush's last
efforts.

In the 70s, the trio still have not fell into synthesizers and eletronic
effects, that have remarked their 80s albums. "We've started this band
when we were 15", notes Lee. They have become respected musicians,
playing progressive rock during the punk era. The bassist remembers
London, in 1978, as a city full of 'mohicans'. "Punk has legitimated
us", he says. "[Heavy] Metal has become sophisticated compared to that
rustic music".

Against the [Music] Encyclopaedias, Lee does not believe that the punk
movement killed the progressive [rock]. But Different Stages is
nostalgic. There are the classics of an era - Closer to the Heart,  Tom
Sawyer and Fly by Night, and the seven parts of 2112 suite. The live
retrospective shows that neither Rush does progressive rock the way it
used to be.

End of Translate.

The URL (it's in Portuguese):
http://www.estado.com.br/edicao/pano/98/11/04/ca2930.html

I'm only sending this as a curiosity, and my personal opinion is:
there's a lot of stupid critics anywhere, and here in Brazil is not
different. But, anyway, O Estado is one of the 2 top newspapers here,
and is interesting to see that Rush is there, even in a not-so-good
review, to say the least. If there are some Brazilian fan out there that
saw the review, too, please drop me a line if the translation has
problems; if you say: don't you know what dictionary means, I'll answer
you: don´t you know what 'the boss is coming' means?

Sorry for the lenght of the post. Rush-mgr, keep your great job!

That's all, folks.

Hi folks,
SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER
<pg dn if you don't want to read this>
;
I was up at 3 am to listen to the DS Premiere on RA (WRIF in Detroit, thanks
rush-mgr for the Different Signals page. Had to type in the URL tho'
couldn't find a link, stoopid me) and I have a few observations.

Being from the UK I found this intriguing. I only got into the Net about a
month after T4e was released, so I missed that one. Lots of commercials
(adverts) mostly for local gigs in Detroit area. Ged and Al must have
recorded their interview in about 10 minutes. Nice to hear them though. A
bit grim on the next album front, I guess Neil still needs some time. 

Real Audio quality was mono but you could still hear how good the songs are
going to sound. 2112 is intense. I have never heard it so good. I have had
the luxury of hearing it on 2 T4e boots but the second-leg tour version
played at the Premiere was unbelievable. Other highlights were Ged's
'unique' phrasing on the '78 stuff. Wait till you hear Working Man. "Take
myself out a Watney's Red barrel" indeed. Heh heh. A couple of years ago
someone made a connection between us Rush Fans and Monty Python. I kind of
got a kick out of the "bleedin' Watney's red bleedin' barrel" connection. 

Cool as you guys say. Can't wait -  the album is gonna be so frikkin'
loud.......

I'm sure that 90% of the posts in this issue will have this subject, but I
just want to share some of my initial thoughts of the new live album*3. 
First, I think that all of the songs will sound much better when listened
to with the whole album than individually.  The Spirit of radio has been
playing for the past few weeks, but that was it.  It's good to hear some
of the other material.  Its a truly great live sound, the audience is not
to obnoxious, but they do show their appreciation and devotion to Rush.  I
think that geddy's voice was great on all of the songs from the recent
tours and shows that he still has his classic high pitched voice.  What
was all that about geddy not being able to hit high notes anymore?  I
would have to disagree with that.  The temples of syrinx was great and I
loved the new way it was sung with a different melody.  A couple of those
"shivering moments": In the overture and temples, the audience responding
with a "hey" after certain chords.  Amazing!  Someone was asking why this
was not done on ATWAS, and I think that it was primarily because it was
the tour in support of 2112 and the trend had not caught on yet.  Another
great moment was at the end of Test for echo as geddy closes with
EEEEEEEEcho!  With regards to the third live cd, It sound like ATWAS from
the songs they played.  I'm sure the rest of it will be great but I was
kind of hoping that working man would be in its entirety.  They did a
medley sort of thing and switched to fbn somewhere in the middle if the
instrumental section of the song.  Oh well.  Overall, I was impressed and
cant wait to get this album.  A local radio station is giving away copies
this weekend.  One thing about the premire is that there seemed to be
something missing with out neil there.  I remember listening to part of
the TFE premere and it seemed like a bigger event.  I am looking forward
to bravado, animate, Natural science, and everything else on this album
when it comes out.  Take care all.

I suppose this will have been reported to death by now, but I just thought
I'd throw this in.

The album premiere was great fun.  Can't wait to have my copy.  Of course,
the tracks they played were wonderful--Driven may have been my favorite
(Geddy's solo blows me away), but all of 2112 live was pretty nice too.

Something I found noteable was that the interviewer (Jo Robinson? or
something like that) asked Geddy about the future of Rush.  He said (I'm
paraphrasing here) they don't have any plans at all, they haven't talked
about the next album, and they are on an extended hiatus.  I didn't tape
the premiere, but that's about what he said in a nutshell, if memory serves
correctly (it WAS late...)

I take this to mean that the reports of their plans to hit the studio this
spring "have been greatly exaggerated," to steal a line from Mark Twain.

Silver lining to every cloud... maybe an extended hiatus will prompt Geddy
to do a solo project, e.g. a jazz funk album.  I've long imagined him doing
something along those lines.  Maybe even a straight ahead, Coltrane-on-bass
thing...  I'd love to hear him play an upright electric.  Maybe DONNA
HALPER could put a bug in someone's ear :)
