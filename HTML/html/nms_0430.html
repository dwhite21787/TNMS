Just a couple of nits to pick here...

First of all, please remember (or 'attention' for you newer members), if you
post a review of a show, PLEASE put "SPOILER" in the subject of your post -
there are people that haven't seen the shows yet, and would rather be sur-
prised by it.

Secondly, (remember or keep in mind, depending on how long you've been around)
please don't post "Unsubscribe me" messages to the list.  They will be ignored
and sent out as part of the NMS.  The correct addresses are posted in the
introductory file you are all sent, as well as at the beginning and end of
each digest!

Oh, I still have about 50 subscriptions to plow through - they dropped down
to only about 20 today.  Sheesh!  I've put the new names list out in the
ftp site (rush/names/names), so feel free to ftp it and see who else is out
there on the list.  Once I get through about 30 more subscriptions, we'll
be over the 1200 mark!

That be it for now,

I have decided that I am not going to continue maintaining this list
of boots owned by members of the RUSH digest.  There are a lot of
reasons for that, primarily winding down to the facts that I have
little time for things other than school work, and that I am
graduating in May anyway, so I might as well get someone else started
on it now.

Just thought I'd pass along a note of interest.  I was watching a movie
I had taped off of television a few weeks ago (being relatively mad that
I hadn't edited the commercials), when all of a sudden I heard the
Mystic Rhythms theme...it was a commercil for the television show 1984!
What are the odds?!  Needless to say, I am no longer mad that the
commercials are still on tape with the movie...

	An unknown(?) observation about the studio version of Xanadu:
	When listening very closely to Xanadu through headphones you
	can pick up a slight creak of a door closing and then the
	sounds of footsteps crossing a wooden floor.  The creak of
	the door begins at the last church bell with the footsteps
	following immediately afterwards.  I guess one of the boyz
	were late for the recording or something like that.

For those of you who may not have heard or seen the article in Spin Magazine,
let me say that this is a great article which discusses a few of the very
basic things that I and would guess most Rush fans love about the band.

Finally, a good, honest (maybe a little biased) piece of journalism about
the band:  more, more, more!!!

Just wanted to throw my support behind an NMS t-shirt.  I'll buy at
least two myself, assuming they're $15 or below.  I do think they
should be NMS t-shirts, as opposed to Rush bootleg t-shirts.  That way
we can have our fun without infringing on corporate rights, but still,
there's no way most of the references will get by your average Rush
fan.  It also has the added appeal of an "in-club."

The tabloid idea is fine by me (I like the "What you believe is what
you are" blurb best).  For the back, it'd be nice to have a list of
all the members, but it's really unrealistic (if not impossible) --
after all, NMS membership changes each day; such a list would be
outdated almost immediately.  I'd favor a pretty spare reverse side
myself, but I'd like to see a little tribute to David A. there (i.e.
"Prime Mover: rush-mgr@syrinx.umd.edu").

God, that was a fantastic show. First time I've ever seen them in concert
(please don't shoot me, I just bought my first Rush album only about a
year ago, 2112), and I was completely blown away. Best part of the entire
show:

GEDDY LOST THE STUPID PONYTAIL HE'S HAD SINCE PRESTO!!!!!!! YIPEEEE!!!!

[ Depends upon which show you see.  In Philly, he had the ponytail; in Largo,
  MD he had a "modified" ponytail; in San Diego and LA he had his hair down.
                                                                   :rush-mgr ]
Other highlights:

Limelight (EXTREMELY well done)
Tom Sawyer
Spirit Of Radio
Dreamline
Roll The Bones
2112:Overture
>...ah, hell, the entire concert was excellent. The Coliseum was
jam-packed, and were more responsive than any other show I've been to.
(Which, admittedly, isn't much - Sheena Easton, Beach Boys, Joe Satriani,
Cocteau Twins, Hammerbox, and now Rush) The biggest crowd-responses were
probably... let's see, 2112 had the entire audience going insane
(da-da-da-da-da-da-da - "YEAH!" - da-da-da-da-da-da-da - "YEAH!" etc.),
Tom Sawyer also had 'em going wild, Closer To The Heart had the entire
audience flicking their Bics, Spirit Of Radio... etc. Although the
biggest response was probably when they segued from 2112 into Finding My
Way - that surprised the hell out of everybody. Same with Anthem.

Geddy and Alex were both pretty friendly with the audience - at one point
in the concert, there was this giant balloon which was making it's way to
the stage, and when it got there, Alex and Geddy took turns with it -
Geddy headed it, Alex kicked it out. Extremely cool. :) And Alex has got
to be one of the most goofy performers I've ever seen - you could tell he
was having some serious fun.

Primus was good, too - Les Claypool paid a lot of attention to the side
of the Coliseum we were on, so that was neat. The best parts of Primus:
they broke into a cover of Ministry's "Thieves," which was pretty
interesting, and then Claypool brought out this standup electric bass,
had a bow, and started playing "Kashmir" with it. A few bars into that,
he says "I bought this thing in a junk shop for $150, and I've been
holding the bow like a baseball bat. Tonight, Alex showed me the correct
way to hold the bow." Also said: "WHO ARE THESE BASTARDS???! I paid GOOD
MONEY te see this show, and I'm sitting here watching THESE BASTARDS???"

Excellent concert. Glad I went. Hope it wasn't the last. :)

Hi, everyone!

It is so incredible that this list exists.  Rush is the first group I
ever got into, and is far and beyond my favorite.  I've seen every
tour since Power Windows, but ESL was my first album.  The only real
special thing I can claim about Rush is that they played St. Louis
(my hometown) on my 21st birthday.  What a birthday present!  (no, I
didn't get toasted, either)

Re: Shirts

I know everyone (including myself) would love to include every inside
joke there is, but I think the result would be cluttered, and would
end up being an expensive keepsake.  Some newspaper idea is obviously
the way to go, but the tabloid idea may not be the best, 'cause GnR
has already used it.  I think we should keep the first shirt simple,
and then we could do more (Part 4 of a trilogy? *grin*).  There's a
lot to be coordinated, especially for the first time.  Maybe if someone
were to accept ideas, see what themes are recurring, and then come
up with some concrete suggestions to be chosen?  I would be happy
to volunteer for this.

I was wondering how many of you Rushians have parents who are
also fans.  My parents are both in there 50's and were raised in
very conservative families (in Colorado, no less).  They aren't
real musical people but when they hear me playing Rush they always
like to listen along.  I've even made tapes for them to play in
their cars.

One of my mom's favorite pastimes is going to her local Tower Records
and blowing the young clerks' minds by asking about the latest
Rush album.  She really gets a kick out of the looks on their faces
when they say, "YOU like RUSH????"

Anyway,  I've got some extra tickets to the Feb 18 show in Houston
if anyone is interested.  (I was first in line)  Good seats and $$.

It makes it sound from that review on Compuserve that was posted that Rush
did not play that medley at the end at every show.  Is this true?
Did they play Strangiato/2112 and stuff like that at all of the other shows?
I haven't been reading the reviews from other shows so that I wouldn't know
what to expect when I saw them.  They were great!
FUNNY - During 'Closer To The HEart', Alex and Geddy were singing on the same
mike when Alex fell out of key for a second - Alex made some unintelligible
comment, and then on the last verse, Alex dropped way down...both of them
started laughing and fell away from the mic.  That was pretty cool.
It looked like they were having *way* more fun this time compared to when I
saw them for the Power Windows tour (the last time I saw em).
It was definitely worth the 450 mile roundtrip car drive and missing a  couple
of classes at school.

This is in response to the question about our first Rush concert...
Well, my first time was in Phoenix on the Presto tour (the very same time
that I got hooked on this phenomenal band).  What I'd like to know (since
I can't seem to access usenet), is tour dates for the rest of the tour.
I'd like to see them again if they get anywhere near Montana (couldn't
make it out to Seattle for the show there, I'm bummed).  If anyone has
tour dates, please let me know...!

Greetings, fellow Rush fans, from the dark interior of
the W.P.I. materials science department....

	I love the tabloid idea! I have a Jefferson Airplane
tour shirt from 1990 (yes, Airplane, the original members came
back for the tour), and it is in the tabloid format. It's very
funny, and gets no end of comments.
	My headline idea is "Force 10 Hurricane Sweeps INTERNET!"
and on the second line "At least 1100 Casualties!". This and some
other headlines like "Everyone Elevates From Norm - Norm pleased",
"Wasted Years found in Shroud of Turin", etc. would all be great.
How about if the price says "10 buck is 10 bucks"?

Well, enough rambling. Kudos to the band for donating to AmFar, too.

IMHO, I like the Hold Your Fire cover best.  Although it is simple, it seems to
say a lot.  Anyone could read all kinds of meaning into it.

Also, has anyone heard of the band Animator?  They released their own CD a
couple years ago and I had to buy it directly from the band.  They are very
Rush sounding, even the singer's voice.

Three miscellaneous thoughts for the day:

-The Hold Your Fire album cover:
My roommate has speculated that the 3 balls actually stand for oxygen, and
together, make ozone, which hold back the sun's fire from the earth...

-The Shirt:
I think this is a good idea. I am interested in what fonts will be used (I just
graduated as a graphic design major, you never would've guessed :^)  ) Always
in my head, when I picture the back of the shirt, I think of a large red star,
and black text in a circle around it, and I always picture it in all caps
Futura regular, with Futura Xtra Bold for the N, M, & S... For those of you who
are familiar with fonts... I don't think there is any way I can create a GIF of
this, or I would...

-The Big Wheel:
Every time I hear this song, I can't help but think of that classic kid's
plastic trike called what else but a "Big Wheel" :^)  I'm not talking about
that ripoff poser clone known as the "Hot Cycle" That is Sacrilege!! I mean,
the _real_ Big Wheel, by Marx, with the removeable 3 position backrest...
After all the song keeps saying "when I was only a kid..." :^) and "the way the
big wheel spins..." which of course was a well known phenomenon with the Big
Wheel, in that the front wheel had very little weight on it, and on smooth
concrete would "spin out" when trying to start out from a still position.
:^) :^) :^) :^) :^) :^)

Good day eh?

	   Just checking to see if anyone has noticed the video backdrop
for the RTB tour.  In particular, one die in the wall of dice is
oriented in the -x (up and to the left) direction whereas all of
the rest are oriented in the +x (up and to the right) direction.
At least that was the way it was for the Dec. 10 Worcester, MA
show.  Anyone who is going to the upcoming shows;  Try to confirm
this and assign some meaning to it.

Hello again-
   I wanted to share some further thoughts on the T-Shirt design:
1)  We could work the pentagram graphic into the tabloid idea:  ie. have a
   pentagram behind the National Midnight Star header centered on the "N"

        Greetings!

        Favourite bass lines?
        Lessee, that would be the slap solo in ``One Slip'' on the
        video for _Delicate Sound.....wait a minute, that's Floyd. =)

        I like ``The Big Money''(when the bass is actaully used), ``Red
        Barchetta'', ``Cygnus X1'', ``Digital Man'', and the solo section
        of ``Freewill'' in particular.

        Someone asked a while back: what relevance is the name _National
        Midnight Star_, besides the lyrics to Red Lenses?

        The National Midnight Star is a creation of Canada's SCTV. It's
        kind of a tabloid news show ( I want to say that it parodys tv
        shows like Hard Copy and A Current Affair, but it predates them
        by several years).

        All the times I have seen it, it's been hosted by Rick Moranis.
        Their catch phrase is ``IT'S TRUE!!'' Sound familiar?

The show went excellent last night at the 10,000 seat Portland Memorial 
Colisium.
The crowd was very enthusiastic and the band was definitely enjoying
themselves.  I had an interesting vantagepoint close in on the side and 
slightly
behind Geddy.  At first, I thought the seats sucked, but because the
stage setup is so open, I could really focus in on all their pedals
and "behind the scenes" workings of the projector, lasers, rabbits, stage,
and multiple backdrops.  The side view of Neil's drumset was fantastic!
I can recommend trying this perspective at least once for a different
experience.

Particular standouts were "Bravado", "Roll the Bones", and "Where's My Thing".
Bravado totally blew me and everyone else away and received about the most
enthusiastic response afterward.  "Roll the Bones" was amazing because it's
such a complicated song, with many style changes in coordination with
the light show and video.  Primus was also very good, but only played
for about 25 minutes.  Definitely a great time!

Wow, am I glad I went to the Rush concert last night, even though
I had nosebleed seats.
After seeing the Presto tour, I was disappointed.  It was like a bunch
of robots came out, played through the songs as fast as they could, and
got the heck out.
This time it was a blast!  The three of them looked like they were having
a fun time, the didn't rush (ironically) through the show, and they
jammed on the songs like there was no tomorrow.  The extended guitar
solos were a nice surprise, and overall they were awesome, of course.

    Is it me, or are there two people out there doing NMS shirts? Did
    you guys get together or something? Inquiring minds want to know!

    Obviously I vote for the Enquire type t-shirt. Later......
