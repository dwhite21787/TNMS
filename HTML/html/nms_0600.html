Folks have mentioned that the band is in Seattle to record.  S'pose they'll
start cranking out some grunge-sound and start wearing flannel shirts?  :-)
But really, I hope they do incorporate some of the 'Seattle-sound' a-la
Queensryche, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam etc.  We'll have to wait and find out.

Hey everyone,
I noticed Chad Hutchinson talking about the RTB program. Although  I
myself don't know what the GFOS is either, there is another very
interesting thing about that program I thought I'd bring up. I'm a fairly
new member of the NMS, so I don't know if this has been brought up yet,
but has anyone noticed that on the inside front cover at the bottom there
is a series of skulls and bones. I thought this looked rather suspicious,
so I thought I'd check this out. Sure enough, the boys were up to
something. Turns out that those skulls and bones are dots and dashes, so I
pulled the dictionary and looked up Morse and deciphered the code. I don't
know what this means, but it read: REMEMBER DEATH. I found this quite
interesting considering the openness and upbeat fashion of the album. If
anyone has any insight into what they could be talking about I'd love to
hear it.

It even got sent out as a special edition.

   At least you HAVE DJ's that care about Rush. My bass player called the
popular station in town and asked them to play Rush (which they have in
the past). The DJ said to call the college station because Rush is
alternative. Right. So he called the college station. They said Rush was
mainstream rock music. $@&%!!

   Felicitations: (bet you won't forget THIS opening!)

   Being REAL new to all this, I've no doubt missed a substantial amount
of info regarding that real "inside"-type Rush trivia.

   However, I have a question: "We've got Mars on the horizon, says
the National Midnight Star..."  Red Lenses.  So, like, what's the deal,
here?  Did TNMS get its name from the song, or did Neil use TNMS as an
"inside" scoop?

  [ The title did indeed from from "Red Lenses" -- the name of the digest was
    voted on, and that name came out the winner!		   : rush-mgr ]

   No doubt a question asked many times, but one I don't personally know
the answer to.

   Thanx!

That was me! My id is now cyber_surfer@cix.compulink.co.uk.
Zoom out again...before I add that a good pair of headphones
will cost less than a typical graphic EQ...continue by mail
if need be, but not here please!

As for info on Richard Feynman, BBC2's Horizon prog (in the
UK) will be featuring this man for the next two weeks! Perfect
timing! I just hope they're not repeats of the two programmes
I've already seen, from about 1988. The same producer made some
others back in 1981, so it could be those, or (even better),
something new.

Grand Designs? Is this synchronicity? Watch Horizon and then
make up your own mind, but I can see almost every line in GD
making a ref to RF, Fynman diagrams, the Manhattan Project,
his dislike of pseudp-science, and particle physics in general.

Coincidence? Hmm. How many people like Feynman were there? Damn
few I'd say, esp after reading Gleick's bio of the man.

This week's Horizon on TB *was* coicidence tho, as I doubt the
fact that RF's 1st wife died of this could be significant, and
has more to do with AIDS than physics.

Nanobots? Another Feynman idea! But an old one. :-)

My song suggestion would be another fantasy effort - with the
theme of a changing politcal scene, the end of an empire and
the new challenges that creates. The Trees strike back!

Have Rush ever appeared on British TV? I can't imagine them ever
being on The Tube, but you never know. The Old Grey, possibly,
in which case I must have missed them. These days, no chance!
Even Genesis have a hard time getting on the music progs of today,
so an "obscure Canadian rock group" like Rush is only likely to
get onto my TV via cable or sat (and video, of course). I can
blame a certain producer for this sad state, but she gets a bad
press already...

Hi All!

I have just been going through the back issues of "A Show of Fans" and
with the discussion lately of a collage for the CD cover, I would like
to suggest the painting done by Mandy Streeter (nee Riffle).  It is in
issue Number 2, Fall 1991.  There is a story associated with the
painting and ends with Alex, Geddy and Neil signing the painting.  The
reproduction in the issue shows the signatures and I think would make
a very interesting cover.  Check it out.

Thanks!

This is my first time writing to TNMS.  I've been on the mailing list for
about a month.  Let me begin by saying thanks to all the people out there who
hold the network together, and all the people who write in.  I have been out
of the country for a few years, and had lost touch with RUSH.  Thanks for
helping me catch up on what's going on.

Also, a debt of thanks goes out to Meg for the great T-shirt.  If you haven't
ordered on yet, I highly recommend it.  It is truly super!

Lastly, thanks to whomever placed the post-script lyrics to the first four
RUSH albums on the ftp server.  They are a perfect fit in the CD case.

Until later....."Begin the day with a friendly voice..."

Date: Wed, 20 Jan 93 8:22:54 EST

Following the recent thread regarding the slightly higher pitch of Xanadu
on AFTK...

I had a weird thought.  I remember something about 440 Hz versus 444 Hz for
the A pitch, where 444 Hz was an orchestral pitch or something.  It might
be that those big orchestral tubular bells that he hits in the intro are
tuned to 444 Hz.  I haven't actually checked this tuning, and I could be
completely off base on this.  Then again, as people have mentioned, the
live tunes are not at the same higher pitch; also, similar bells are used
in Jacob's Ladder, which is not at a higher pitch either. :-?

Just though I'd offer a (possible) (off-the-wall) (probably not right)
thought on the matter.  (Not to mention a first post to TNMS. :-)

Hi there...

	I saw this posted to NMS today:

  "I think the idea of giving credit in the NMS CD to the
contributors is a good idea."

	While I appreciate your intentions and ordinarily would agree
with the "give credit where credit is due" axiom, in this case I
don't think it's a good idea!  We are talking about an ILLEGAL
cd...those involved would be placed in an unfair and uncomfortable
position with their NAMES attached to this article!  I realize that
the chance of anyone finding out about our little cd, much less
bothering to take action against us, is very minimal...however, why
take an UNESSESARY chance of harming those who CONTRIBUTED?!  If you
really want to have a credits section...why not use aliases or cute
acronyms?...I have a boot Sting cd that contains thanks to "Al and
Bud Bundy for the pictures"!!  I'll get down off the soapbox
now...I'm sorry if this viewpoint upsets anyone, but I wouldn't want
to take a chance on HURTING the ones who are kind enough to
contribute their time/effort for US to have this cd...

Regarding Joseph T. Kung's observation on the static pop in The Enemy Within,
I've never noticed it, but I _have_ noticed a good deal of static on Distant
Early Warning, right after the beginning of the song (probably about 10
seconds in, right before the keyboard riff).  I first noticed it about 2
years ago on the CD, and I checked my vinyl copy just to see if it wasn't my
CD.  That had the static as well.  Anyone else notice this?

<A NAME="600016">Subject: Risky Business</A>

Hi gang\

	I personally think that it is a really exceptionally BAD idea to
put any people's names on our rather illegal NMS CD.  I suggest that "NMS"
not even be written anywhere on it!  Just make up some name like they do on
other boots.  There could be a separate piece of paper included with each
CD(I don't mean the actual insert that makes up the cover) that maybe lists
the names of those responsible as long as it didn't mention the CD itself
and people kept it separate once they got the CD.  While it would be nice
for the people who do the work to get credit on the CD, I'm sure they would
rather not risk the legal ramifications of the project.  I know this all
sounds a bit paranoid, but better safe than sorry!  You never know where
these things might end up. . .
	On a lighter note, while I was home for break I stopped by a new
used CD & Video store that just opened up.  For some reason, as I was
leaving, I glanced over the tape section(which I never do; to this day I'm
not quite sure why I did then).  Lo and behold, there was Max Webster's
Universal Juveniles. . .for $1.50!  Unfortunately, I was in a tape-deckless
car so I had to wait a while before hearing it, but when I did I was not
disappointed!  The sound quality is actually very good for a 12-year old
tape.  There wasn't anything much written on it, just the Anthem records logo
and the song titles.  The style of the album is what was known at the time as
Heavy Metal.  You former teenage metalheads will know what I mean!  Back in
'81 Heavy Metal referred to a much narrower range of stuff than it does now.
Ah, those were the days!  Battlescar is an excellent tune and the rest of the
album is cool too, by the way.
	As long as I'm mentioning my break, I saw Dream Theater again.  Great,
as usual.  For those of you who don't get the DT/Rush connection, here's my
thoughts on the matter.  We have here two hard rock bands which display a
penchant for interesting songwriting and instrumental aptitude, producing
music which is simply more interesting and complex than most of the hard
rock (or other non-jazz popular music) that's out there.  I agree that DT
and Rush do not necessarily have a similar sound(I think DT's is closer to
Faith No More in that all five instruments play prominent roles), but the
genre of progressive hard rock encompasses them both.
