I can't believe it... the Valley has a classic rock station -- finally!
And they're playing Tom Sawyer!!  This is a dream come true, as most of
you Rush fans in defunct, Rush-phobic radio markets can understand...
maybe I can start listening to the radio on a regular basis now.

Dear NMS,
	I always thought that the "Signal" on the cover was not referring to
his semse of smell, but instead his action on the cover is a signal about what

Hi all,

          After lurking for about 2 months, I finally decided to come out of
the woodwork and join in the fun.  Meghan Middleton's post in TNMS 1054 made me
say "That's it, I gotta say something!"

   Meghan, your co-worker is more than slightly misinformed  about Rush being
previously known as Mahogany Rush.   They were (still are?) officially known as
Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush.  These guy's never had anything to do with OUR
Rush (Ged, Alex, Neil), nor do they sound anything like them.  Mahogany Rush is
a good band if you like blues based guitar stuff.

   Since everyone else gives a little bio in their first post, here's mine:
Way back in early 1980, a friend of mine lent me this album called
"Hemispheres" from some band called Rush. I listened to it, said to myself
"What the hell is this? It don't sound like Van Halen!" and kept listening to
it 'cause I couln't stop.  Anyway, I've seen every tour since "Signals" and
have found them to be the ONLY band I've been able to remain fanatical about
for 15 years.  Finding TNMS has boosted my enthusiasim even more, and provided
me with hours delight.  Thank you all!

<A NAME="1056004">Subject:  bunch o' stuff</A>

Good day all,

I would, at this time like to address several minor subjects. First, not
to be picky or anything, but Lynn mentioned in her "setlist" post that
RUSH was on Rockline on Jan. 28, 1994.  That's not correct.  They
appeared on Rockline on Jan. 24, 1994.  I know, I listened to it, I
taped it, and it was my birthday so it kind of stands out.  In fact,
when I first heard the commercials that they going to be on, I thought
"...whoa, what a great birthday present!..."

Anyway, second, as for the post on the "Band's name" and Mahogony Rush.
Mahogany Rush was a completely different animal.  In fact, RUSH played a
bill with Mahogony Rush and another "rush" band (I forget the name) in
the early days. (for exact dates and bands see VISIONS).  I also have
some old CIRCUS magazines with articles on Mahogony Rush.  there's no
relation.  I'm sure many others will agree.

Third, how can anyone(Blackbird) say Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater is
not a good drummer.  I haven't seen them live yet, but I will.  If
anything the Images & Words video validates his ability.  Granted, he's
young, he's energetic, he's fast, he overplays at times (sound familiar?
maybe a young Canadian drummer) but he's good.  And he can only get
better.

Finally, a question to Rick about his "Visions" post.  Simply, what
edition of the book is it.  I have (I think) the third edition - 1988.
It goes up until the end of the Hold Your Fire Tour.  Does this one go
any further?

Thanks all.

Hi, everyone!

     This isn't my first post, but it will probably look like it, since I
didn't really introduce myself the last time.  I just have an interesting
story to tell, but you have to know a little bit about me first (if only
so I can explain why I was listening to a pop station!)
     My name is Kelly.  I'm a 19 year-old college student, and female,
for those of you who care.  I started listening to Rush just in time for
the CP tour (excellent show in Madison!).  Before that, I mainly listened
to pop station.  Now I've changed completely.
     Around New Year's Eve '93, I listened to both Rush and that radio
station, and one day I heard something that just shocked me.  The station
had this contest for New Year's Eve where they were giving away tickets
to many different shows.  Some of the choices were Aerosmith, Michael
Bolton (eeeewwww!), and Barbara Streisand.  They were also offering as a
choice tickets to see Rush open their new tour down in Pensacola.  What's
really funny about this is that they never have, and probably never will,
played any Rush.  I was surprised that they even knew who they were. (I
was also surprised that they were still touring, since, in my innocence
and naivete, thought they had broken up long ago.  After all, my dad
listened to them.  Why should they be aorund now?  My, did I have a lot
to learn!)
     If I would have liked Rush as much as I do now, I would have called
up that radio station and told them that, since they never play the band
and half of their listeners probably weren't sure who Rush were, that
they should just give me the tickets because I'd probably be the only one
who wanted them.  Instead, I had to listen to one of the DJ's joke about
them when somebody picked Streisand.  "What, you don't wanna go see Rush?"
"No. (Idiotic giggle.)"
     To this day, I still can
     (whoops!)  To this day, I still can't believe that they were offering
tickets to see Rush, and that I never tried to win them.  Oh, well.  At
least now I listen to stations that play them (even if it is usually Tom
Sawyer, CTTH, and TSOR).  And at least I didn't miss them on this last
tour (I even dreamed I was running all over a town trying to find the
coliseum).  I guess I'll shut up now since I've already rambled on this
long.  Just thought somebody might get a kick out of this story.

I think I speak for many of us sincere Rush fans that the NMS is
getting, well, a little SILLY. I'm sick of reading things like"Oh,
Neil's English Grammer is off" or "I heard Geddy Lee gets sick
from grape skittles". People dont care about that stuff. I find
myself not even looking at the NMS new issues because there is so
much irrelevant and trivial refuse. I think it's fine when someone
voices thier opinion on the band, or tell of a show, etc. but come
on, this is getting ridiculous. I read of a few people who are sick
of this too. Rush is something we can believe in and I hate the way
people turn it into a tabloid like gossip paper. Personal info is
fine to some degrees, but remember, as great as they are, Geddy, Alex
and Neil are all humans and deserve a certain amount of respect for they
have done for us.

Hello,
I'm a new NMS subscriber so I thought I'd try a post.  I've been a RUSH
fan since 1977.  My claim to fame is that I have all the tour books which
I collected at the actual concert.  Since I've bought everything of theirs
under the sun at this point (almost twice now since the advent of CD's),
I've decided to turn to a life of crime and get some bootlegs.

I emailed the "Meg" address in the FAQ twice in the last month but there's
been no response.  Is there another address or a list of good boots anywhere?
I'd appreciate knowing.

I agree with the person who recently mentioned Run From The Fans as being
good.  I guess this is what they call a soundboard recording.  It seems
unbeleivably good to me.  I also recently bought a 1979 Oslo, Norway tape
which contains the complete (I think, only listened to it once, so far)
live version of Hemisheres.  It also has AFTK with slightly different
rythym guitar.  It is also very clear sounding.  Unfortunately, the tape
"flips" right in the middle of Hemispheres.  I'm not sure, but I think
this may be the Pink Pop festival concert I've seen advertised so I guess
I'll try to get it on CD to get a continuous Hemispheres.

The Motoring Music catalog has about 10 bootlegs (CD, I think).  Motoring
advertises in Goldmine.

I remember once seeing the 1982 biography of RUSH by B. Patterson for sale
in a used record store near Ohio State.  I went back the next day and it was
gone, sad.  Is there anyway to "rent" this book so I could make a color copy?

Finally, an item to prove I'm anal enough to be in the NMS "club": It bothers
me when people say The Spirit of THE Radio.

If you like RUSH, you may want to try Psychodots.  Their first, self-titled
CD is very good. The second one is called On the Grid, it's good but not as
great as the first one.  The unisex vocals aren't there but the guitar
is great.  They're also a 3-piece band.
They are supposed to have a new CD in mid 1995.  I've seen them live and the
new CD should be great. I think they're on some sort of independent label
so you may have to search for it.

Probably no other reason than Geddy and Alex have "finally gone completely
mental."  I think, just in an effort to keep the song fresh and to have
some fun, they just stick in any ole word when it strikes their fancy.

>"Finding My Way" on the p/g video, Geddy sings
>(or appears to sing) "I drank 12 beers" instead of "I've cried some bad

Yup!  Actually, for the longest time, I thought that was the correct line!

I'm sure others will have more info. than I do -- but that is COMPLETELY
wrong.  Tell your co-worker he's way out in left field.  There was a
band called _Mahogany Rush_, yes.  But it was a totally different band.
I believe Rush even opened up for them way back when.  They have since
disbanded.  It is, however, a common misconception that _Mahogany Rush_
was an earlier _Rush_.  But that is entirely untrue.  The lead singers name
was Frank....something.  totally blanked....   I'm sure there's more info.
on this in "Visions" (so much for my "information contribution"...).

Greetings.

About that best seats thing -- impossible for me to say, 'cause I've
never had front row, or anything.  I've seen Rush from almost every
possible viewpoint *except* front row... (as I turn this into an excuse
to twist the topic around...)

But all the seats have had their charm.

My "best" seats will always be at my 1st Rush concert.  Nov. 25, 1984.
The last show of the GUP tour.  Easily one of the band's worst (to them)
shows -- but I sat in the balcony exactly opposite the stage.  Bad seats?
Well, maybe.  But the arena here seats only 7,000 so it was more like
being in the risers.  It was the first time I ever saw them live -- and
I got to see everything!  YES!!

So far, tho, I think my fave seats were balcony, directly opposite the
stage (again), 2nd row from the top at the Fresno show this past tour.
Wow!!  Couldn't see the band worth diddly -- but the *show* was awesome!!
As a whole, it looked incredible.  The lights -- everything was just
amazing!  It was fun to see it as one event.  The next night, I had
floor seats (27th row) in Sacramento.  Still couldn't see the band worth
diddly.  But the contrast was absolutely faaaaaaaaantastic!!!  Yeah!!
Whereas before, I simply watched the show as a detached observer -- now
I was *part* it!  Lights flying all around me -- oy!!!

Hopefully, one of these days, I'll make it to first row...

Dear Cyber-Compatriots:

A friend (also a Rush fan) and I are organizing a Student Safari to Kenya
this Summer.  The barest details are as follows:

Dates:  23 July - 24 August 1995

Ages:  15-20 years old

Highlights include:

Masai Mara Game Reserve during the annual Wildebeast and Zebra migration

Great Rift Valley

Lake Nakuru

and the piece de resistance;

2+ weeks at the Laikipia (Kenyan Highlands) Wilderness Centre and Ol Ari
Nyiro Ranch, home of the Gallman Memorial Foundation.  The educational
portion of the trip will be designed by me in co-ordination with the
resident educator employed by the foundation and will stress (for my
part) exercises in human-environmental problem solving (e.g., resource
utilization, conflict use resolution and modernization).

Kenyan students of similar age will join us for most activities at the Widerness
Centre; providing what will inevitably be a unique cross-cultural experience.

Price:  $1590  includes meals, lodging, programs, park fees, ground
transportation, and the services of credentialed chaperones and guides
but does NOT include airfare.

All that said, I want to assure interested parties that you will visit
places that not even Hemingway and Karen Blixen could do justice.  The
author Kuki Gallman, who owns the 100,000 acre ranch and has provided the
passion (and capital) for building the education centre, has created the
most remarkable place I've ever been.

Please e-mail me directly for further information or call me at (919)
688-4064 or David Miller at (510) 528-2780.

Apologies to any and all offended by this non-Rush content.

I thought I'd start a new thread:   (hi Puanani!)

You Know You're A Rush Fan When:
YKYARFW:

* you pick up all the dirty YYZ tags at the airport, and people
  think you're the janitor;

* and in fact the only Morse code you know are the letters "Y" and "Zed";

* you spend an hour trying to get the perfect shot of the intersection
  of Danforth and Pape;

* you and most of your friends have gotten a ticket while listening
  to "Red Barchetta," and discussed possible kick-backs from the
  police to the radio station;

* you or someone you know has used the lyrics to "Passage to
  Bangkok" as a shopping list;

* and you laughed uncontrollably when CD finally allowed you to clearly
  hear the "hit" in "Passage to Bangkok";

Oh, I could go on for hours, but I bet you folks some really funny ones!

And about bumper stickers:  I would *love* to have a "Rush is a band"

offer it up for approval!  If everyone sent a dollar and a SASE,
(500 folks) it would be an additional $300!  Or hey, if someone

    Just a quick note here.   I was watching Disney's Beauty and the
Beast the other day and something struck me.  Not literally.  There is
a part in the movie where Gaston rouses the villagers to go in search
of the Beast and kill him.  The villagers are singing a song called
"Kill the Beast"  They all go marching through the woods and over hill
and stream.   This is exactly the picture I get when listening to the
beginning of Witch Hunt.   I can just see the villagers, torches raised
high, marching through the forrest insearch of that which they fear,
but do not understand.   There is even a line in the song, Disney's
song not Rush's, that says something about fearing what you don't
understand and so in turn wanting to abbolish it.   Check it out.  It's
a good movie over all, the animation is wonderful and the songs aren't
too bad.  Most Disney movies are heavy on songs and that discourages
some adults form viewing them.  But these songs are real fun songs.
Besides you can turn down the volume and crank up Which hunt when you
get to the part I mention.

Good day...

1:30 pm, and I have to wait 2 hours for a meeting that will last an hour
and a half.  And then I get to catch the bus home during Friday evening
rush hour... (!!)  [but at least it'll be "rush" hour  :-)]

I was talking to a friend of mine the other day about CD's and time
length, etc.  Rush was somehow intertwined in this...  Anyway, we were
conversing away, and I suddenly started feeling really gipped.

lengths have increased, while still retaining "one disk".  CD lengths
are, what? 75 min.?  Can you imagine how much more music Rush could've
made if CD technology existed back in '75????  _2112_ is only about 40

much more music Rush could've made on those albums!!!  I mean, _MP_ is
one of their best albums -- and yet there's only 7 songs on it. 7!!
That's it!!  We'll never get any more!!  We're stuck with a lousy *7*

Of course, the vinyl could probably have held a bit more songs, too.

<A NAME="1056019">Subject: Random Thoughts</A>

Greetings nms'ers!  Here are some random thoughts that have
been bouncing around in my head for a while:

   1) There is no better 4 song sequence to begin an album
      with than Tom Sawyer, Red B, Yyz and Limelight from MP.
      (Although I don't think this is the best Rush album)
      PeW and Hemi are close seconds, but Hemi can't really
      count 'cuz it only has 4 songs on the whole album!

   2) Doesn't it suck that when you here or see the word RUSH
      these days it most likely means a fat conservative than the
      best band in rock and roll.  BTW, could you believe that
      dork that sent in a post the other day thinking this was
      a Rush Limbaugh mailing list?

   3) I think it is pretty cool that Geddy likes Metallica.
      A lot of people can't seem to listen through the metal
      thunder to hear the quality musicianship.

   4) Lars Ulrich is probably the best living rock drummer
      today behind the Professor of course.  The drummer from
      Queensryche is close behind though.  Seeing Lars play
      "Battery" live was one of the most intense concert
      experiences I have ever had.

   5) Chris Cornell of Soundgarden is the best VOCALIST in
      rock and roll.

   6) I totally agree with the person that thinks the band
      "Hole" is some of the worst crap ever to recorded.

   7) Dream Theater is way overrated.

   8) I thought that Alex giving his doubleneck (white one
      I think) to Eric Johnson was pretty neat.  Too bad
      it got stolen though.  Eric needs a dog or something
      since I have heard he has had a lot of stuff stolen
      over the years.  I remember hearing that Billy Gibbons
      gave him a guitar that Billy got from Jimi Hendrix that
      got ripped off.  I wonder if the person who has it
      knows it is worth over $300,000 which is about what
      another of Jimi's guitars went for recently.

   9) A lot of newer Rush songs sound a lot better on ASOH
      than the studio versions.  This is the album that
      got me back into the band after a period of disdain
      from about 1985 to 1988.  If you're thinking of
      giving someone Chronicles to introduce them to the
      band, consider ASOH.  I think it will work just as
      well.

  10) There are very few bands that have songs that you
      never get tired of.  I can listen to songs like
      Freewill, Subdivisions and Limelight over and over
      again continuously and never get sick of them.
      (especially the solo part of Limelight where all the
      boyz play some of the coolest stuff they have ever done.)

Hey all,

This is my second posting although I don't think the first ever got through...
it was pretty sappy anyway.

A couple of things...first, someone mentioned Rush on BMG. BMG just started
some heavy marketing in Canada (10 CD's for price of one) and I was wondering
what the catch was. There's nothing in the fine print...then a friend told
me that he asked some clerk at a record store about it and the guy said that
BMG and Columbia House cut corners by purchasing copies of a master tape and
a licence to make x number of copies. Thus, the CD's are made from second-
generation master tapes. Anyone know if this is true?

Secondly, I think I've checked out all of the FAQ and most of the recent
mail, but never have seen anyone mention Neil's drum work on a release
by a great Canadian band called the Rheostatics. He plays on several tracks
including a pretty incredible drum solo / spoken word song about guns (I'll
refrain from making any jabs here about Americans and guns...) The album is
called Whale Music and is from 1992 (getting kinda old now). I'm pretty
sure it was re-released in Canada and the States last year under the Sire/
Warner Bros. label. Though Neil's stuff is great, I must also say that
the Rheo's themselves are pretty awesome. When I saw them at a club on
their Whale Music tour, Dave Bidini, a guitarist and singer, shouted
'Hey, I smoked a joint with Neil Peart!' much to the audiences content.

Anyhow, sorry about the length etc. See ya!

they also go nuts for the following:  Tori Amos, Sarah McClauclin (crap I

I was listening to my copy of p/g and I've always thought that at the
end of the song when Geddy is mumbling stuff he says" Everybody can
suck my head." Anybody know about this? Sorry if this has been asked before.
 Also, During the early to mid eighties I remember going into drum/music
stores and seeing thes beautiful Tama tapestries with Neil playing his
drums on a dock in the middle of a lake. I think the only way one could
get these was to purchase a Tama kit. Unfortunately I was only 13 when
these were around and had saved all of my cash to but a used 4 piece
Maxwin kit. I was always disapointed when i would see one because I
wanted one so badly and there was no way I could afford a Tama kit at
the time. If anyone has one and would like to part with it(fat chance!)
or knows where I can get one, please email me direct and let me know.

Hi there. I was browsing through a small used CD Music Store the other day whil
e waiting on dinner reservations, and I came across two Rush albums in the
Import section, one of them RUN FROM THE FANS, which I have come across once
before, and RED BARCHETTA, which I have never seen, or even heard about,
even on TNMS. Well, The RED BARCHETTA album had a little note saying "Limited
Edition: 1000 copies" on the front cover. So it presumably being the rarer of
the two, I picked it up. I also only had 30 bucks on me and still had to pay
for dinner...

Anyway, It was recorded in May 1981 at the Montreal Forum, and the songs on the
album are: LimeLight, Tom Sayer, The Trees, Xanadu, Red Barchetta, Free Will,
Closer to the Heart, By-tor and the Snow Dog, In the End, and In the Mood.

I was just wondering if this is a really valuable find, or if it is just
another, run of the mill bootleg. Thanks for any advice or information anyone
has on this. Email please, cuz i usually just skim through TNMS. Thanks again!

I think the interview you asked about was actually done just prior to the P/G
tour.  It's called "Rush:  Total Access", and it was done by the B-Man (the
same guy who wrote the "Visions" biography).  I've got a copy of it on tape,
and I've been meaning to transcribe it for the NMS, but haven't gotten around
to it.  It also has a chunk of the first Rush single , "Not Fade Away"
("whee-oh, Ged sounds just like Buddy Holly" <<G>>).  Just thought you'd like

Hi all!
Since there has been some talk about Barenaked Ladies on the list
recently, I can't resist talking about their concert, which I was at
Friday night in Boston.  First off, though the music is nothing like
Rush, if you have any sense of humor you ought to give these guys a
shot.  And, though they did not play Grade 9(the song in which they do a
snippet of Tom Sawyer and SoRadio), they were absolutely amazing!!!  I
can't go into detail, it would take pages, but they were all over the stage!

And just to make the weekend perfect, we caught a Rush block on the radio
on the way home, and were able to listen to Fly By Night, New World Man,
Freewill, and Cold Fire.  That was on 94.1 out of Boston(I think) in case
anyone's interested.
I'd also love to tell about being pulled over by the Rhode Island State
Police, but that would also take many pages.  In brief, we were searched,
car was searched, and we got off without any tickets or warnings(which
was good because are only crime was too many people in the car).
So be careful on 95 in Rhode Island!  They aren't easy guys to deal
with(though they had great boots which had to have cost at least $600!)!

Hey there, fellow Rush'n Rollers!

I'm a real newbie here on TNMS; this is my first posting.  Actually, I
literally stumbled upon TNMS via some Internet documentation my local BBS
has available.  Scanning the various "groups" and "lists", TNMS just jumped
out at me!  Couldn't resist the urge to try and find out a bunch of stuff I
never knew about the best band in both *Hemispheres*!

Sad to admit, I've been out of the concert scene since <gasp> 1983, when I
last saw the Boys in Indy (great show, as expected!).  My dumb question is,
what's a click track?  I *assume* it's some sort of electronic metronome,
but I could be wrong.

Here's some more questions, which I did not see covered in the FAQ:

 1)  I pretty-well know what's being said at the end of Countdown.  What's
being said at the beginning and at the middle?
 2)  Who does the "One, two..." count at the beginning of the Counterparts CD?

Sorry if these were covered before; appreciate your input!

Rushing right along...

Greetings fellow Rush fans,

I was browsing through a local record shop today and came across a copy of
COS - still in the shrink wrap.  I purchased it and was disappointed to
find no liner notes, pictures, or anything.  The record was in a clear
plastic sleeve.

My question is, were some pressings packaged without liner notes?  I know
that there were liner notes to this record.  There is mention of them in
the FAQ.  The record I bought is on the Mercury label, number 822 543-1.  I
thought I had found a real treasure, and I did - I just wish I would have
gotten the WHOLE album.

Hey there.
I just went to a cd show here in Claremont, CA. I got a great Rush Bootleg that
has 5 unrealesed Tracks! It's called Superconductor. the first 12 tracks are
off the RtB tour.  The last five tracks are: "Not Fade Away", "You can't fight
it", "Bad Boy", An acoustic guitar solo from the '81 tour (not Broon's Bane!)
and lastly "Take Off" with Doug and Bob Mckenzie.  The quality is really good.
if anybody wants more info or copies, e-mail me at Mslayen@cmcvax.mckenna.edu.
see ya

Buenos Nochas, Mein Froinds!

As this is my first posting to TNMS, I'd like to get some thank you's out of
the way:

Thanks to Rush-Mgr for providing us with this great service.  I've only had
access to cyber-space for a short time, and this makes it all worth while.

Thanks to dan@pdh.com for the Rush FAQ.  What an UNBELIEVABLE source of info
this is!  Based on some of the questions asked in TNMS #1055, I think more
people need to make use of all your hard work.

Thanks to alex.mustard@forsythe.stanford.edu and crenshaw@paloalto.epri.com
for organizing the Rush Gift Fund.  What a great idea!  My check is on the
way.

Now on to me . . . My name is Norman Birtley.  I'm a 30 year old architect
living just outside of St. Louis.  I've been a Rush fan for...I guess about
17 years.  I've seen every show in St. Louis since the MP Tour (that makes 9
times), and I must say that I liked the outdoor shed tour for RTB the best.
 The sound quality and large video screens were great.

It's great to see all you college people who are into Rush.  I have a friend
whose 13 year old son is also a die hard Rush fan.  Hopefully this continuing
growth of Rushies will ensure that the greatest band in the history of rock
will continue to be around for a long time to come.

I hope you will all pardon me, but I have to Rip on someone now:
Hey jambrose@eden.rutgers.edu (TNMS #1055), I think you have the meaning of
Rush lyrics confused with the spewings of Mr. Limbaugh.  While I think we
would all agree that it is important for universities (as well as the rest of
the world) to keep high standards of excellence, I think you are missing the
point.  If you will get your mind out of the right wing for a while, you will
learn that standardized tests like the SAT are very culturally biased.  Yes,
we need to maintain high standards, but we need to ensure that everyone
starts out on a level playing field.  If you don't like the way Rutgers is
handling your education, THEN LEAVE!  Enough said.

Oh, buy the way.  Some of you have asked where this March 28 release date
came from.  I saw it in the Spin Magazine forum on America Online.  But I
guess just because Spin says it's so doesn't make it true.  But we can still
dream....

'lo all...

just wanted to comment about something Scott Bissett said in his last
post... about a 2112 sticker.. when i was a wee lad in Jr. High, i
managed to find such a sticker at a local club/record store.. its got
2112 (*as it appears on the album*) written on the top with a pool of
water reflecting the red star-in-a-circle (*i don't think it technically
a pentagram*) below that.... i had originally intended to use the sticer
on my walkman which was physically marred in a bike wreck (*as was i.. :)
*)...
anyway, just thought i'd let you know that they existed, don't know if
they have any more at that particular store, but they did also have some
stuff with the RUSH logo from hemispheres..

take it easy!
