While I was re-listening to Presto, I kept coming to the conclusion that this
album dwelt heavily on alienation. This is a theme that seems rather common
to a lot of The Who albums. Has anyone come to the same conclusion? Has Pete
Townsend ever been mentioned as an influence?

Thanks Meg for bringing the NMS back, now I have a
reason to come to work in the morning!

We were able to catch rush 4 times this tour - Las
Cruces NM (Jan 18), Denver CO (May 27), Las Vegas NV
(June 6), and Albuturkey NM (Jun 9).  What a tour. Each
show we were able to see them from different locations.

The crew and the band seemed much more relaxed this leg
of the tour, they were joking and playing around during
the whole show.  Alex did the whole bit with the nerf
arrows, playing his keyboard with his nose, and lying
on his back on the ramp to play.

In Denver,  Alex brought a putter on stage and played
golf for awhile instead of the nerf arrow thing.  It
was really cold and raining that evening and the band
didn't sound quite as good and the audience wasn't near
as responsive as the other shows.

In Vegas, we initially thought we had bad seats as we
were on the stage right side, even with the stage.  But
we managed to move up to the railing and we were able
to watch the stage crew, see the bands expressions to
each other and the crew, and see the audiences
reactions to the show.  It was a great way to watch the
show (after we had already seen it from the front in
Las Cruces and Denver).  We were actually behind the
band, even with and about 15 yards from Neil, and were
able to look out over the stage into the audience.
After Alex got the nerf bow and arrow, a crew member
dressed in a red cape and devil's hat ran on stage and
Alex "shot" him and the guy played dead for a bit.  At
one point during the show, the crew was square dancing
back behind the stage.

In Albuquerque, our seats were row 12, but we managed
to move up to row 1, center stage, where the stage
protrudes into the audience.  That was definately the
experience of a lifetime, having Alex and Geddy look
straight at you and play to you.  During the Spirit of
Radio, my friend sang really loud "One likes to believe
in the spirit of baseball", and Geddy looked at him and
gave him a thumbs up!

We've got complete set lists from each show, and at
Albuquerque (our last show) they played Vital Signs
instead of the Trees!  If there is an interest in a
detailed, multi-venue comparitive review, we'll post
it.

I listened to part of this today at a used/import CD place.  It sounded
like the interviewee was Alex.  I didn't listen to very much of it.  The
CD is 16 minutes long, the asking price was $15.75 or something.  The first
question was about Alex's family, "I've got two sons, the oldest will be
17 soon...".  The sound quality was not very good, but in a quiet room you
might be able to hear everything.

Last week I was out in California, and I went to the Santa Clara County
Fair near San Jose.  We passed up the Y&T concert that was in progress,
and wondered around the fair instead.  We came upon a three piece band
playing on a small stage- their sound immediately caught my attention.
They played only instrumentals, and the tunes were very Rush influenced-
great stuff!  They said that they were opening for Steve Morse at a show
in the area, and they played "Where's My Thing" and "La Villa Strangiato"
for their encores.  They have a very high-tech setup for a small-time
band: Midi pedals, samplers, sequencers, synths, and many effects.  I picked
up a demo tape for $5.  Anyone in the area should try to check them out!
They're called "Maximum Indifference", and can be reached at (408)248-4374

Hello All... a guy I know who works at a used record store in

started the sod-fight mentioned in B-MAN's "Visions" book. He hadn't
read the book until last week! Interesting, eh? He says he picked up
a piece, threw it, and then WHAMMO! EVRYBODY was doing it! A few even
landed on stage, Apparently Alex picked up a piece a shook it around
silly-like and then threw it back!

	I had always caught the obvious reference to Ernest Hemmingway in
the song "Losing It", the (semi-cliche) line "..the bell tolls for
thee". But last week I was listening to Signals at work and for the
first time noticed another less abvious reference to him, "...where
the sun will rise no more". I knew he wrote _The Sun Also Rises_
but had just never made the connection. Another pleasant suprise
from a cool Rush song.

Hi,

  Since my review of the Dream Theater albums last week, I've had a
number of people email me for details of how to get these albums. The
only info I can give is the catalogue numbers for the CDs, which are
the European versions. The US numbers might be different.
   Anyway the 2 albums are:

      When Dream & Day Unite, MCA label, no. DMCF 3445, 1989
      Images & Words, Atco label, no. 7567-92148-2, 1992.

  Hope this is of use to people that want to order them.

I have to agree; Alex was quite the wild man during the concert.  I also
sat up front (started in the 5th row after paying a local scalper a
small fortune) and was quite entertained by the Alex's hijinks.  Here
are some other things I remember.

During the instrumental between the two rap sections, the stage lights
come back up.  During the first half of the rap, Alex snuck behind one
of his stacks and propped his chin on the top cabinet so that when the
lights came up, it gave the impression of a disembodied head bobbing to
the music.

Alex was also practicing his puts behind Ged during a couple of songs.

A girl took her seat in the second row during Limelight just before the
guitar solo and Alex made it a point to walk over in front of her, tap
his watch and mouth, "You're late."

Although this was the 10th time I have seen Rush, it was the first time
up this close.  Two words of wisdom:  (1) Don't tell your husband/wife
or significant other how much you paid for the tickets, and (2) Pay the
price but don't count the cost.

ORQ:  Different hearts beat on different strings.

Hello all,

 I saw the Star Lake show.  My first concert ever, and man was it killer!!

 I raise another cheer for getting to hear Analog Kid.  Just plain awesome.
Also I was thoroughly pleased to hear a sizable chunk of Xanadu, including the
long beginning part of harmonics and wood blocks.  Too cool.  And the way the
lights kicked in on the mellow sections of Ghost of a Chance was just too much.

 Here is my advice to all neophyte concert goers:  Pack lots of food for
_after_ the concert!!!! I found out the hard way that there is no food to be
found in the middle of the night, at least in the area I was driving through.

I recently downloaded the new releases from Noteworthy's ROEG service and
sometime in September, Skid Row has a 5 song EP coming out with all cover
songs.  And one of them is Rush!  It's pretty hard for me to imagine Skid Row
doing a Rush song.  Anybody heard which song it'll be?  I couldn't begin to
guess.

Also, I bought Dream Theater "Images & Words" last week, and IMHO this is THE
BEST album I have ever heard!  Their music is so intricately fashioned, they
could be considered even better than Rush!  (hold my tongue!)  I definitely
recommed this album to all Rush fans.

Hey, all.  I'm finally back at school and able to pick up the Midnight
star again...what a relief!  Anyway, I picked up "The Story of Kings"
at my local record store and listened to it...it is about 31 minutes
(there's nothing "about" about it!) and an interview with Alex from
either during or after the Hold Your Fire tour.  Kind of interesting,
but nothing to spend tons of money on.
    Also, about this UK broadcast...I had heard that it was taped, but
not yet broadcast.  I suppose all is speculation at this point, but I
thought I'd throw my 2 or 3 cents worth of rumor in.  I can't imagine
that it has already been broadcast and NO ONE on this list has it
yet...it just doesn't make a lot of sense.  Anyway, here's just hoping
it really was taped.  Later...

I don't know if it's still available, but in their previous catalog, Retro

As stated earlier, not a rumor, Geddy oversaw a production whereby one
of Rush's UK shows (Wembley?) was broadcasted over Radio 1, from what
I've heard of the broadcast this is an excellent tape.

But you missed the big party we had!!  Homebrew, food, and music, what
more could you ask for.  We'll have to do it again next tour.  Thanks to
all those who showed up.   Speaking of good RTB experiences, aside from
meeting the band, mine was probably seeing them front row at Alpine
Valley (Thanks Ken!), and winning could you believe the raffle for front
row at Irvine Meadows when they did the food drive.  And of course
meeting all the NMS'ers.

			=====================
Great story by Matt Wilkinson on the Irvine show.  Exactly how I felt
when I hear AK played.  Having been at both of the shows you were at (SD
back in Jan. and Irvine in June), I must say the Irvine show kicked some
butt.  Did you go there the first night? or the 2nd night?  During the
first night, someone had threw a baseball cap on stage and Geddy picked
it up and wore it during AK, while he sang. "..and the boy pulls down
his Angels cap.."  or was I hallucinating?  I would love to get a
picture of Geddy playing with the baseball cap.

Hello Rush fans,

I read something a while back either here or in a.m.rush newsgroup that
said something about Rush going back into the studio next month for a new
album due out before the end of the year.  This sounds fantastic, but I was
wondering if anyone's heard anything more on it.  Also, I've got several
friends (non-netters) who absolutely DO NOT believe that Neil revealed a
mohawk at the last show!  I would love to get a picture of that if someone
managed to get it.  Unless, of course, it might just have been a joke :)

Hello.

In regards to the GET A LIFE! comment:

  I would like to say that on that matter I agree with Ben.  He's right in
saying that Neil shouldn't have made the remark.  I know Neil does whatever
the f@#k he wants to but, I think a little consideration for the fans wouldn't
be too much to ask from an individualist egoist.  It won't go off the track
too much.  I'm not saying that the ideals of individualism are bad, in fact
I also believe in the right of individuality.  But I guess I CHOOSE to go
about it differently.
  Well with all that said, I think that it's fine for a fan to have fun with
the Rush related trivia and such things as "changes in lyrics" or "album
covers" as Ben said in issue 493.
  Also I think the bit on The Prisoner is interesting.  I do not know of the
Television series, but I'm willing to know more about its relation with Neil's
philosophy.

In regards to Dream Theatre:

  I'm willing to give it a try and listen to Dream Theatre.  The only problem
is that where I am, there's little to be found musically other than the latest
releases of major bands and/or Greatful dead related material, two different
extremes.  Nothing much in the middle.
