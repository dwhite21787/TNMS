For starters today, Syrinx was supposed to go down for a while beginning
at 14:55 EST on Thursday, 3/21/91 for a replacement of the hard disk.  Due
to problems with the new hard disk (operating system wouldn't re-load),
Syrinx was down from about 15:00 EST Thursday until about 13:00 EST Friday.
If mail bounced, or you got strange (duplicate) mail from Syrinx, please
ignore or resend (whichever is apropriate) and hopefully things will be
back to normal now.  

The upshot of this is that this is the NMS for Thursday, 3/21/91, even
though it won't get to you until sometime Friday.  The regular Friday
mailing should go out normally, or possibly a little later than normal.
Also, since some mail arrived between the time the system was backed up
and when it was actually taken down, some mail may have been lost.  If
you sent mail between 10:00 EST Thursday, check this issue to see if
your mail made it here.

I noticed there is a personal message in todays NMS.  While this is
not a horribly bad thing because of the situation, if you have problems
getting in touch with somebody on the list, drop me a line and I'll try
to see what the problem is.  I have everybody's official (for mailing
purposes) address; if mail is or isn't getting to them, I'll know.  I
may also be able to offer alternative paths to them.  On one occasion,
I was asked if I was having problems with a particular address, and I
was.  This indicated a problem at the receiving site, not the senders'.

I've always thought the last two "lines" of Didacts and Narpets were
"Left!  Right!"  "Who's right?!"  But I don't think anyone'll ever know
for sure... certainly the intention was to illustrate some form of conflict.

Continuing the lyrical nitpicking, Second Nature is definitely an example
of the stuff that grates:  the "folks have got to make choices" verse is
very contrived.  It's not helped by the fact that the music isn't too
interesting.  On the other hand, "Prime Mover" also has uninspired lyrics,
but the music is great, especially the synth backing.  Most of HYF has
very layered, "rich" music -- Time Stand Still, Tai Shan, Prime Mover,
Turn the Page, etc...

On a meta-level, I think discussing what we DON'T like about Rush is just
as fun, and definitely more interesting, than just re-hashing old questions
and debating ambiguities -- at least until the album and tour are announced!
We're all fans, and we have a lot in common, but that doesn't mean we should
always agree.   I can't think of much that bugs me about the boyz, but if
anything comes up I'll be sure to let y'all know.  :-)

(Oh, and Randall, I picked up the Elvis Costello "Girls"*3 double-CD the
 other day and I've been playing it incessantly...)

Hi folks,
        Over the yesrs I have seen pictures of Geddy plying a Double
neck Guitar/Bass ( I believe the necks are strung with a bass on the
upper neck and a standard guitar neck on the lower ).
        Could anybody tell me which songs he used it on.

[ From memory, they used it on the Hemispheres tour for "Xanadu", and 
  maybe "In The End".  It was interesting seeing Geddy and Alex both
  with double-necked guitar/bass.  Neither has used it for the past
  several tours.  :-(                                        :rush-mgr ]

I think I can hear a second guitar during Alex's solo in "Passage to
Bangkok" on ESL.

        Does anybody know anyting about the guitars that Alex has used
on recent tours.( I think they are made by a company called Signature?
)

        Also while I'm here.

Does anybody know of a Queensryche music board/digest?

Well, yesterday I wrote about the transition from Broone's Bane
to the Trees [I see a lot of people agreed with me] and today I
thought I share a bit about lyrics.  Many of my poem have been
compared to those of RUSH [some say that Neil would be envious]
and I must say that I've never done drugs nor do I have any
association with the devil [I don't really believe in one, but
that's a bigger theological argument (I'm a Philosophy of Religion
major at Case Western Reserve University)].  Anyhow, the other
thoughts that we [I] call altered states of consciousness can be
experienced by a form of meditation [as you all know Neil is in to
the Far East and its culture], which being natural is far more
enlightening than anything else [I have friend who use anything you
can think of] and they are not as bizarre and insightful in their
thought as I am.  Someday I'll post an argument on how there are things
today if at one time nothing existed [nothing at all, no god, no
darkness, no empty void, just nothing; try to comprehend that] if there's
any interest [please reply] I will post it, its really quite fascinating.
Well, anyway the point is, that these thoughts are not influenced by
anything other than my own abstract [sub] consciousness which I often come in
touch with [even during class, which is really cool, it only takes me
about a minute of meditation, so I do it often, classes tend to get dull!!]
Well, I have to go, have two exams to type up [1 Buddhism exam and 1
Japanese Religions] so pity me, I pity thee.  Catch ya all tomorrow.

I don't remember the origin of this idea, but in literary and social
discussion, it is common to contrast "Appolonian" and "Dionysian" mentalities.
Specifically, Appolonian refers to logic, (for obvious reasons) while
Dionysius, as the God of Wine, (and by extension the God of emotion,
frenzy, etc(read the Bacchai)) represents emotionality. Hence, the
battle of heart and mind. I think that this theme is in either Nietszche(
Geneology of Morals) or Rand(Atlas Shrugged) though I think Nietszche.
This would be consistent with what we know of Neil's reading list.
In any case, this is the idea.
Aphrodite is SOLELY the Goddess of Love....Dionysius took on the more
general emotional idea.

Ah, I see I got the theorists and players out of their seats.  Why
didn't you speak up before and save me from the blowtorches? :-)
I have only played a relatively short time, so I can't quite
bring all of the musical elements together yet.  Thanks for all
of the educated opinions.

It sounds to me like you think that in the verse:

Well I guess we all have these feelings
We can't leave unreconciled
Some of them burned on our ceilings
Some of them learned as a child

the "ceilings" line was invented to rhyme with "feelings".  I had
a hard time understanding this line until Christine Blasko (Hi Christine)
told me what she thought of it.  The real meaning of the verse is
revealed in the last two lines.  I interpret them as "some of the
feelings are in our genes and some are from our environment."  The
"burned on our ceilings" part I now think refers to cave paintings of our
far ancestors.  Which line came first is a little irrelevent to me once
I see that the first line is needed for context, but the third has
such an imaginative interpretation.  Your argument would be valid if
the third line had little or no meaning.

Standard discaimer about my humble opinions apply.

Hmmmm....how about

Well I guess we all have these feelings
We can't leave unreconciled
Some learned while we popped our wheelies
Some of them learned when we were wild

<A NAME="197009">Subject: Broon's Bane</A>

   I've been playing guitar for almost two years now, and one of the first
pieces I wanted my teacher to teach me was Broon's Bane. Being a classical/
folk guitarist, he wasn't terribly familiar with Rush, but figured the whole
song out in a few minutes. [I brought my ESL tape with me] He said something
to the effect that the guitarist was probably making it up as he went along,
as the song has a weak structure. I disagree on both counts, and BB is one
of my current "showpieces" to show people I can play guitar.
   Anyhow, the way I play it, the last chord is a Gm. [Fingered similar
to a folk G chord, but with the lowered 3rd and a D added on the second
string.  Since I never thought of the piece as "complete" I figured out
the intro to the Trees, which is easier to play. I still gotta figure out
the awesome classical into for A Farewell to Kings, which a friend of mine
knows how to play...

   Any other guitarists out there who like doing original composition?
If so, let me know!

<A NAME="197010">Subject:      Marillion, Anthem (Rand), etc.</A>

    I realize this is a Rush base but I'd like to say some things about
 and ask some things about one of their greatest opening acts (whom I
 never got to see live.) Marillion, if you haven't already heard them,
 is IMO a great, great band. I've noticed the subject on here is about
 passion in writing. I think Marillion wrote some of the most passionate
 music this planet has ever and will ever see(n). I strongly recommend
 picking up their live CD "The Thieving Magpie", it's a good sampler of
 all their best work. If you can sit and listen to all of Misplaced
 Childhood or "Sugar Mice" and not bat an eye then I would be amazed.

     Question: Call me uninformed, but what does Slainte Mhath mean? Aside
               from being a very good Marillion Song?

    2nd: Anthem, the song, may be based on Anthem, the Ayn Rand novella.
         I've not started reading it yet (still working on her first book
         We the Living (<---  great so far)) but it seems to be about a
         person caught in a conforming society who dares to be an
         individual. Thus, "Live for yourself, there's no one else more
         worth living for" might start to sound like an ok concept.

                  Now Go and buy some Marillion tapes....NOW!!  :)

                                   Al

OMQ (Obligatory Marillion Quote. Sorry Rush mgr     :))
       "But when it comes right down to it there's no use trying to pretend.
        For when it gets right down to it there's no one really left to blame
        Blame it on me.
        We're just sugar mice in the rain."

                                          "Sugar Mice" == Marillion

No, you're not the only one.  I understood it the first time I heard it.
But I don't care about it.  Drugs aren't evil, just some of the people
taking them are.  Rush apparently don't fall into that category, so what
they do/did is their own business.

I was wondering what that was too when I saw the video.  I remember

Actually I heard this last one a few years before I ever had a decent

Moro Rush-heads !!!

	Yesterday I saw Queens video "Innuendo", and  noticed one funny
co-incidence.  In  that  video  there is  guitar-playing  figure, which
remind me 'bout Rush's  Great  live-double's "A show  of hands's" cover
figures.
	 Any other Opinions due this ???

     Of course I'll pay  well for The shirt and  Postage ( in US $$$$ )
     It would be great to have such a  T-shirt to have here in Funland.
     You see, Finland Ain't any Albany, and I can Easily get Metallica,

  Assuming I remember correctly, in the Greek mythos, Dionysis and Apollo
represent two complimentary (opposing?) facets of humanity.  Dionysis, god
of wine and fertility, represents the 'party-oriented' urge for fun and frolic,
the physical nature of man.  Apollo, on the other hand, represents the more
cerebral nature of man; intelligence, reason, diligence.

  In Hemispheres, Neil draws a parallel between this element of Greek
mythology and left/right brain differentiation in the human mind.

[ If you'd like help with his address, feel free to send me mail at
  the administrative address.                               :rush-mgr ]

my first attempt failed so here is a copy of the letter I wrote.
I was unable to reply directly, I don't know why, so if you do and you
know how to reply directly, please let me know.

Adam,
	I'm a little confused, I only wrote about my lyrics a few hours ago
to the National Midnight Star [I'm assuming that's where you heard about
them].  How did you get the message and reply so quickly?  If you did not
hear about it from the NMS than how did you?  I'm glad to read of your
interest in my lyrics and music.  The music is generally heavy metal oriented
[not that thrash stuff though, my music is written to be sung to, I take pride
in my abilities to write with a classical flair [tight, yet loose and flowing
with changes in mood] and was invited to attent the Juliard School of Music].
And the lyrics show an insight into the nature in us all [that's my are of
special interest--there is something in us all [humans, animals, plants,
everything] that is the same [yet unique to each] and I'm trying to find out
what it is and also to find the truth of existence whether or not there is a
god and how things came to be if not.  I use my meditational skills to probe
into my transcendent concsious and search for the the truth, I've almost
completed the quest but I'm almost afraid to, what would I search for next??
Anyhow, I'm tying it all into my music and and a book that I am writing which
is called TOMORROW'S DREAM.  I'll send you a copy when I'm done which may not
be for a while but hopefully by the end of this summer [winter for you!  hey
wow, I actually knew something!] I'm not sure what it costs to mail stuff to
Australia [someday I hope to visit the island]  perhaps you could give me an
address to which I can mail the stuff to and I can figure the cost.  Of course
lyrics and that stuff can be sent via this connection setup [which I really
don't fully understand, so you'll have to tell me how to mail directly to you,
I tried just replying to your letter but it said 'failed mail', beats the hell
out of me what that means!], well let me know.  I have to go now and write two
essay exams [Japanese Religion (religion and state interaction throughout
history) and Buddhism (the bodhisattva of universal wisdom)] fun eh???
Well, take care and keep the faith.

transcendentally [and hopefully successful this time!]

Jon

I noticed in the credits of the "Master of Puppets", Metallica thanks R
Rush.  Does anybody know what involvment Rush had?

[ Geddy likes the music that Metallica makes; he's said that in 
  interviews.                                           :rush-mgr ]

One thing I do remember reading somewhere is an interview with Geddy
saying that Metallica on "Master Of Puppets" reminded him of old Rush!

<A NAME="197020">Subject: Neil speaks out</A>

	In case any of you wondered how Neil feels about his
lyrics in general or their interpretation, I remember an interview
with him in which he said (rough translation) :

	The words I choose are basically for the sound they make,
I intend them to sound good with the music.  If someone enjoys
Rush because of the sound then I have done my job.  If people also
are stirred emotionally by what I'm saying, GREAT, but thats
a secondary consideration.

	I'll try to find the exact reference in my collection, but
that was the jist of it.  I personally find great satisfaction in
his lyrics, but if you don't, then that doesn't mean your any less
of a fan.

	also, one possible interpretation of the nsf instead of the
FREE space on the board in the Big Money vid could be "NOT SO FREE".
just a thought.

Pete

p.s. keep those concert lists coming in, I'm getting great response
     and will keep the poll open as long as there is interest.
     for any of you who are not aware, I am conducting a poll of
     what you the rush fan on the street wants to hear at your next
     concert, send as many or as few songs as you want(within reason).

<A NAME="197021">Subject: ddd vs. aad</A>

Hi,

Just a few notes on cd labeling (aad, add, ddd).

First, the best advice I can give you is to IGNORE those three letters.
They tell you very little about how the cd was made, and they tell you
nothing about how the cd will sound.  Most people don't realize what
each letter actually means, so here it is:

First letter: what kind of tape recorder was used during recording
Second:	      what kind of tape recorder was used during mixing/editing
third:        what kind of tape recorder was used during mastering

The key words are "tape recorder".  Just because a cd is marked as add
does not mean that it was digitally mixed.  It only means that after
the mixing was done, the resulting music was recorded digitally.  The
fact is that it was probably mixed in analog.  Though digital mixers
are becomming more commonplace, most studios still don't have them.
A cd marked as ddd probably went though several a2d and d2a converters
before it finally made it to the digital form you listen to off of the cd.

So, should a ddd cd sound any better than an aad one?  The answer is no.
There should be no difference in tape hiss as well.  High quality studios
have very good analog tape players that utilize Dolby A noise reduction.
You've never heard of Dolby A?  That's because it is not commercially
available except in a select few high end reel-to-reel tape players.
The thing that matters most is the technical competance of
the people doing the mixing/editing/mastering.  That is why the
people who are expert in that area are in such high demand.

I myself have many aad cd's which sound much, much better than some of
my ddd ones (the reverse is true as well).  Just check out Dark Side of
the Moon, or any classical cd.  Most classical cds that are ddd sound
horrible.
