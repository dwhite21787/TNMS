As some of you may have noticed, Digest 495 had accidentally included
part of an old digest in someone's post. If this confused anyone then I
apologize; the correct edition is at syrinx for anonymous ftp. Please when
you post, make SURE that you're not including old digests in your mail!

Also, the second part of the Rush Frequently Asked Questions list will come
out as a special edition later this evening.

And please, take the Dream Theater discussion to e-mail... this is a Rush
newsletter after all!

<A NAME="497001">Subject: Latin in CoS liner notes</A>

I checked for this in the FAQ and didn't see it....

What does the line of latin in the CoS record (not CD) mean? This
is found only in the original record (with the lyrics)...I can'r
remember the entire passage, only that it was something like "Terminat
(something) diem, (something) diem" This isn't much to go on, so
if anybody out there has the orignial liner, and knows latin, could
they translate the saying.

If you are looking for it, it is on the left side of the liner when
it is opened as if you wanted to read the lytrics.

(PS - sorry for the misspellings. I am telnetting, and can't use
my backspace key without aborting this message!)

I have Rush through Time, but not the one with the picture of the cover
on the vinyl. I did happen to see that last year though at Record
and Tape Traders in Towson, Md. I think $95 is what they wanted!!!

Also, back to Robert about the Merriweather ramblings:

I remember when that girl came back in. She sat directly in front of
me... I think she and Alex had a good laugh!! Also, how could I forget
the disembodiment of Alex during the rap! Man I was laughing the whole
concert. One of the best times I had both musically and comically!

One more thing to ponder- geddy being the baseball fan that he is-
I wonder if he has been to O-park @ Camden Yards yet? Maybe when
they were here @ Merriweather.

Cheers-

Well...I went out and bought Dream Theatre's "Images and Words" the other day.
I have only this to say: THANK YOU PAUL MAY!!!!!  I won't say that I like DT
more than I like Rush, because I don't, but their music is EXCELLENT!  Each
member of the band is an incredible musician and their song have very well
crafted melodies.  I recommend them to anyone, Rush fan or not, who likes good
rock and roll...

Hmm...

My friend would be creaming his pants if he heard Dream Theater being
mentioned on a rush mail list.

Dream Theater is a fairly good band that is out of the Queensryche genre.
Their new album is called "Images and Words".  It is, I believe on Warner
Brothers records.  Their first album was released on an independent label, and
it was called "When Dream and Day Collide".  Kinda pretentious, but very
tight and definitely worth a listen.

Im very surprised that Fates Warning isnt mentioned here that often.  Fates
Warning combines the best parts of Queensryche and Rush (well, as is pertinent
for their style.)  Their lead vocalist, Ray Alder, can make Geoff Tate turn
red with envy at his raw vocal power.  Their new album was even produced by
T.C. Broonsie, or Terry Brown, who is branching off and producing a lot of
metal stuff these days.  Voivod is another band he produces.

Another band sort of in the Rush vein is a band called Zebra.  They are very
well-constructed musicians (Three of them, one on Guitar, one on bass, and
one on drums. The bassist plays all keyboards.  Sound familiar guys?). Their
songs tend to be a bit more masturbatory than Rush, but they are another
band that is definitely worth your dollar.  Check out "Zebra Live" on the
Atlantic Label.

Well, thought i'd throw my 2 cents in.

    I was at the World Music Theater for the last show and Neil
positively DID have a mohawk!  I don't think it was REAL, but he was
wearing something that covered his real head of hair and looked like a
mohawk. It shouldn't be that difficult to believe now that everyone
knows he was doing windmills and other strange things during the shows.
 In fact at that same show, when Alex shot the arrow at him during
Closer to the Heart, Neil retrieved it and played the remainder of the
song with it in his mouth.  (The man is incredible...didn't even miss a
beat.)  (I also apoligize if that story has been told thirty times
already...I plead ignorance.)  I'm simply saying that stage antics
aren't neccessarily reserved for Alex and occasionally Geddy.  Later...

The original version of this line (which Hemmingway was alluding to) is
from John Donne's Meditation 17. This also includes the familiar line:
"No man is an island.".

My friend has a copy of the bootleg _The Fly_ for sale.  It is from
there RTB tour.  He is asking for $25 (the same he paid for it), which
includes shipping and handling.

----------------------------Original message----------------------------
I have put the ROCKER01 ZIP file on the LISTSERV.  To get the file, you
can issue the command:

TELL LISTSERV AT KENTVM GET ROCKER ZIP

or send a message to LISTSERV@KENTVM with the following line in the
mail body (not in the subject line):

GET ROCKER ZIP

For the internet people, it is not certain whether they will get a good
copy or not.  It depends on the gateways that the file passes through
whether it gets translated or not.  It is a binary file, so it shouldn't
be translated or messed with in any way.

For people to get automatic distribution when the file is updated,
they need to send the command:

TELL LISTSERV@KENTVM AFD ADD ROCKER ZIP

or put

AFD ADD ROCKER ZIP

in the body of a mail message.  The file name needs to stay the same
for this purpose, that's why I didn't put in the version number 01
at the end of the filename.

Let me know if you have any question.

Well, here's my first post to the NMS, a very good source
of Rush stuff, in my opinion!

re: Get a life!

Come on guys!  Don't take it personally, I'm sure he said
it with a smile on his face and a laugh.  Neil, I'm sure,
does not always have to be taken completely seriously!

Get a life!   [ha ha, and all that!]    ;-)

re: Dream Theater

I picked up Images and Words at Sam the Record Scam here in Ottawa
(they had it at HMV, too) and like it very much.  To say that
they sound like Rush, though; is misleading (other Rush
fans agree).  Sounds quite good, kinda metal-like, too.
Some songs seem to sound alike, though.  In either case, it
is still worth getting.  Just don't expect Rush-like music and
lyrics.  They're certainly not well-known, fer sure!

re: Freewill (this was a while ago, I think)

Geddy sings 'If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice',
but Neil's lyrics are 'If you choose not to decide, you cannot have
made a choice', which, according to the FAQ, he assures us, are correct.
Or am I flogging a dead horse?

Take care,
Eric
