Well it seems that something messed up and the last digest of old articles has
vanished. So in its place are relatively "new" postings. Sorry about the 
screw-up, I'm still figuring out how to run everything!

This is an appeal to all those Rush fans in the UK who taped the concert
off radio 1 a couple of weeks ago. If you are willing to do me a copy
then could you email me with your address, so I know where to send the
blank tapes, and I will be forever in your debt.

Thanx in advance.

Hello there.

	Has anyone heard anything more about the rumors of a new Rush
book by the B-Man?  Is this true...and, if so, when will it be out?

Hello.

	Can someone comment on whether or not it is worth it to join
either the Backstage Club or subscribe to "The Spirit Of RUSH"?

	I'm thinking about it, but I'd really like more info from
someone who knows 1st!

				Thanks,

Glad to see the NMS back up!!!!!!

As to the Freewill lyric question, I think it is:

	"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice."
		^^^^^^
The line clearly states that the person ("you") has made the choice to
let whatever happen happen, without any of the person's influences.
Or in other words the person chose inaction, not that the person
hasn't made a choice (the second option for what the line actually is).

Anyway, just my two cents.......

Hello dere!

	Can someone send me email commenting on the following  
clubs/publications:

	I'm contemplating joining/subscribing, but I'd like to hear

		Is it worth it?!...


					Thanks ALOT!

This is just a weird observation...but I was watching the video for  
"Show Don't Tell" the other day, and I could've SWORN that Tony  
Geranios (a.k.a. "Jack Secret") is in the video!  It's at the very  
end of the video, when the boy is walking down the street "waking up  
the neighborhood"...and a guy that looks a little bit like Tony  
Geranios sticks his head out of a window...

	I know this doesn't matter or anything...but I was just  
wondering.

		Maybe Pat can tell us?...
