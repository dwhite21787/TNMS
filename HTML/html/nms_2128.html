Now that we're on the home stretch, and everyone's getting worked up about
the album premiere, here's some new information for ya about Different Stages!

The first CD *is* enhanced, as the Atlantic web site stated. It's a 
collection of images done by a Japanese artist, but they have nothing to do
with Rush, they just look cool. The cds are in a cardboard cd case (which we
already heard).

And finally, what you've all been waiting for, the listing of dates & cities
each of the songs came from!

Disc 1
======
Dreamline..................June 14, 1997 (World Music Theater. Chicago, IL)
Limelight..................June 14, 1997 (World Music Theater. Chicago, IL)

Disc 3
======
Was recorded on February 20, 1978 at London's Hammersmith Odeon

I've also updated the radio stations page, including links for those that 
broadcast via RealAudio (a few use the windows media player, whatever that
is). There is no guarantee that they'll actually be able to CARRY the 
premiere, but if you can't get it in your area try one of these stations.

<A NAME="2128002">Subject: Vital Signs lyrics/Geddy's pick/Northern Lights for Africa</A>

Hola everyone. A few answers to posts:

1) Vital Signs "Evelate" Slim seems to think Geddy didn't mean to say this.
Geddy seems to think he did. I, as usual, forget exactly which interview I
read, but when doing vocal tracks, he mistakenly said "evelate", which the
other guys just loved, and it became a a little joke on the album (he also
does this in concert). He did a similar thing in Digital Man (though this
made it on the album sleeve) Ring a bell ---> Need a bed. This one,
however, is just my opinion on the lyrics. Can't confirm it.

2) Geddy and pick. Geddy has NEVER, I repeat, NEVER used a pick when
playing bass. He's said many times he just doesn't feel comfortable doing
it. The pick-like sound you hear is his fingernail(s) on a very hard string
(Rotosound Superwounds). It (his fingernail) was almost chopped off as a
kid, and is extremely hard. On a side note, there are some things that he
does that are, while not impossible, way too hard when using a pick.

HOWEVER, when playing a guitar on-stage (Xanadu, Passage to Bangkok), he
DOES use a pick. Watch the ESL video carefully right at the end of Xanadu,
you can see him finish his keyboard part, then grab his pick that was
laying on the keyboard, then go into the second guitar part to finish the
song.

So, that pick MAY have been Geddy's. Who knows?

3) Northern Lights for Africa. Not a band, really. It was a song on the We
Are the World album. I've got a copy, but my turntable's on the fritz, so I
can't help right now. Check the local used record stores. I'm SURE there's
a copy somewhere (I've seen 4 in the last week at the used stores out
here).

Anxiously awaiting Nov. 10th

	You can answer for drums, I can answer for Bass.  
  It always seemed to me that neil was the superstar of the group.  He is
regarded by most people, fans and other, to be the most capable drummer in
music today.  Geddy, in the same light, is favoured by many as a fav.
bassist.  He is sighted as a main influence by such bass masters as Les
Claypool, for instance.  Alex, on the other hand, is rarely thought of as
a guitar great, ranking with the best of the best.  

	Geddy's basslines are always busy and creative, and challenging to
learn.  Highlites (IMHO), include: 

Turn the Page - the intro is quite intricate and difficult to grasp,
technically, if you don't play chords on the bass often.  The rest of the
song is quite amazing, too.  

Digital Man: The fills are nothing short of wild.  Listen to the bass all
the way through that song, you won't be dissappointed.  

Live YYZ: Just so jazzy! The whole song, save for the beginning, is quite
fantastic.

Segments which are incredibly cool: The jazz solo in La Villa / (TFE TOUR)
  the 3 chord bass solo in the beginning of the outtro jam of CTTH -
AMAZING bass solo (and bass line) in driven.

I'm sure there are many more that people will point many more, but thats
all for now..

  In regards to the radio premiere...and I'm sure many other people who
are planning to tape it are wondering the same thing..

  How long do we expect it to be, and in what format?  I'm sure a 2x45 min
tape will do, but I won't be home..should I ask someone to switch the tape
after half of an hour?

Well my opinion is that Alex is a virtuoso, and Geddy is a very 
good player.  BUT - you shouldn't have to play an instrument to 
appreciate it - that's not the point.  If you like Alex's playing, 
then he's by definition a good player.  That's the whole point, 
whether you play guitar yourself or not, IMO.   The opinion of a 
non-musician should be as valid as anyone else's, I think, because 
the stuff Alex plays is intended to be appreciated by everyone, not
just guitar players.

Of course, there are those who would measure a player's worth by 
how difficult their parts are to play, but that's not what music 
is about, for me.

Hey man, what have you been smoking? Besides, in the future, people won't
care about Rush. In the year 2112 Hanson will be revered as gods! "Mmmbop"
will the national anthem of the ISA (Incestuous States of America).

Uh oh, I already see some lawsuits heading my way from emotionally damaged
Rush fans and the Hanson sisters.

Greeting fellow rushians,

First, I would like to thanks all contributor who have tried to respond to
my request.  In this way of thinking, Jack Mevorah, James Smith, Chris
Polo, Micheal Gross, St2112, James Robinson and Linda Brown, thanks all 
you for your time.

But my problem is still there.  My question : Did Geddy EVER played with a
pick ? gave me 5 negative answers and 2 positives ones.  What am I
supposed to think ?  I know Geddy has not played with a pick on the last
few tours.  Before that, I was to young to even think about Rush.

So, I will continue to pretend that the pick I have framed on my wall is
really from Geddy as the girl who gave me the pick said 7 years ago.
Maybe someday, I will have another explanation.

Tears are not Enough, on which Geddy did a bang up job.

I remember reading somewhere that one of the song's producers, upon hearing
Geddy's first take performance, uttered, "Wow, now that's a professional."

	I just recently bought the new Dream Theater live CD-set, "Once
in a Live Time".  While listening to it, on CD-2 at the beginning of
"Trail of Tears", I noticed a few "Rush-things" in the intro.  They did a
Xanadu-ish beginning.  John Petrucci does a near copy of the guitar
swells that Alex does in the beginning of "Xanadu" and if you listen
closely to the drums, Mike Portnoy plays the temple blocks exactly like
the way they are played in "The Trees".  Check it out and you'll notice
that i'm right!  I thought it was pretty cool!

Where to start....

1) Somebody a ways back made a comment related to the track listing of =
DS.  They seemed to feel that because Rush's 80's period was =
underrepresented, it was an indication that the band is "embarrassed" by =
that material.  I think there's a better explanation.  Take a look at =
the tracks of ALL Rush's live albums.  The band has been quoted as =
calling live albums "photographs" or "pictures" of the band at a moment =
in time.  E...ST focused mostly on MP and PW, with a little H and AFTK =
and very little from before that.  Only APTB represented 2112...I don't =
think they we embarrassed by 2112.  ASOH focused mostly on material from =
PW and p/g and had little or no material from PW and MP.  DS will focus =
on CP and TFE (rightly so) and shy away from the material covered on =
ASOH.  Seems logical enough.

2) As for Geddy playing with a pick...I believe that on some of the =
older albums (I refuse to get up and check to confirm), Geddy is =
credited with playing some guitars, which, I would guess, means its =
quite possible that he would also play them live.  With that in mind, I =
think it's safe to say he DID play with a pick.  Well...I don't think I =
remember anyone asking if he ever played BASS with a pick.
While I'm on the subject, I am also a drummer (liberal use of the term), =
but I DO know that Geddy and Alex are excellent players.  Geddy is =
recognized by every bassist I know.  Alex had not always had equal =
recognition, but he has improved tremenously in the last 15 years.  =
Listen to "Presto" (song, not album).  At any point, do you hear his =
fingers scraping against the strings and he shifts between chords?  =
Smooth!

3) Larry in Phila...I haven't heard a word, but that may have something =
to do with Phila radio being probably the most conservative and stale in =

This morning I was awoken by the familiar opening to Circumstances coming
from my alarm clock, which was odd because the station I listen to in the
morning would never play Circumstances. Although, they do play the
occasional TS, FW, or TSOR. I soon realised it was bumper music for the
morning team of Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw on 101KGB here is San Diego. I
then began to notice that every commercial break began and ended with a
Rush tune! They even pulled out some odd choices like What You're Doing,
The Big Wheel, and Afterimage. All Rush bumper music!! I hope they keep it
up. Hey Rush Mgr, did you happen to hear it?

   [ Hehe, nope. I usually don't listen to their show, I think they think

As a bass player, and former band member, I'd have to say that, yes,
Geddy is probably in the top 5 of bass players. I can't say he's the
best of all time because "Joe Shmoe" down the block from me might be a
better bass player... only _he_ hasn't gotten a break with a record
deal... etc... etc...

IMHO:

Neil is the best, in his genre, ever, so far.

Alex has great "style and feel". He's in the top 20 for sure.

Geddy is in the top 5 bass players of all time.

But what makes Rush so special is what you get when you put them all
together.

It's the sum of the parts.

Hello out there,
     I just got my copy of DS.- -  A few notes:  The tri fold cardboard
packiging is a suprise.  Although I like the artwork the cardboard thing has
to go.
     
    Inside the tri fold there is an envelope that contains the '78 show (disc
#3).  On the cover of this envelope there is a b&w scene that is very much
like the cover of PW.                 It is a scene outside the Odeon
presumibly before the show.  If you look close you see people milling about.
Geddy looks to be scalping tix to the show.(he has the tinker toys on his t-
shirt)  Alex is being caried out by two men in white clothing and Neil is
somwhere in there I know it but,  I just haven't found him yet.

     On the back of the tri fold there is a sort of blue print of the tinker
toy scetch with all sorts of numbers and formulas.  Although I did see the
#;'s 2112 I don't know what the others mean or are.  There also is a note that
says "see attached data / H.S July 10  '98" whatever that means.

     I have only listened to Disc 3 and disc 1 so far (in that order) but they
were increadible.  Cinderella man is so good I can't beleive it and when Geddy
introduces a songs of our album"farewell" it makes me shiver.   Boy I hope
they keep releasing theese lost shows forever.

      Disk one was so unbeleivably good.  Each song sounded  right on note it
was unbeleivable.   All the people that are complaining about CTTH will be
surprised.  It is awesome.  I particularly liked Nobody's hero alot.   Also
2112 is listed as track 10 but it actually goes up to 16 I think.

     If anyone knows of anywhere that I can get Hugh's artwork suitable for
framing,  please let me know.   The Hammersmith scene enclosed  on the
envelope is really teriific.

Hello all!

Just saw the Hip on Halloween in Atlanta! It was a great show. I have a
great friend that I work with who is a Cannuck, and he loved it! It was like
he was back home. He kept saying how he couldn't believe we were that close
to the band. We saw them at the Roxy, a small venue here in Atlanta. We were
about 30 feet from the band. Overall, I am guessing that there was about 300
people in attendance. Mostly Canadian, the flags were waving and the crowd
was jumping! Just plain cool! I assume that the Hip is so huge in Canada
that they don't play the smaller venues? Oh, and by the way, I did not see a
single RUSH shirt. 

Well if anyone can tell me about the Hip in Canada it would be great. How
big are they up there? Why haven't they made a bigger impact in the states?

   [ Let's put it this way.. The Hip has sold out 3 consecutive nights at
     the Maple Leaf Gardens (which can hold ~15,000?). Why they haven't been
     bigger in the states, it's probably because they don't have a song with
     "mmmm bop" in it yet.                                     : rush-mgr ]

     Live Rush album stuff....... To tide me over until DS, I was listening 
     to ATWAS last night in the car. Here are some simple observations:
     
     1. The songs on it are not from my fave Rush "era", but they 
     absolutely rip! They are raw & breathe fire at times.
     2. Geddy is early or late on a lot of vocals. I hope that there are 
     some of those "new parts" on DS.
     3. Alex rakes the strings a lot. 
     4. There are people timing their hoots & whistles to happen during the 
     breaks in "Overture". It's actually pretty funny.
     
     That's it on ATWAS. If this post makes the NMS on Wed., 11/3, remember 
     that Rock 100.3 in Mpls/SP USA is airing the DS radio premier tonight 
     @ 9PM (that's what I heard from a DJ).

     P.S. Is it me or does Rush like autumn? It seems all their stuff is 
     released right around my birthday, 11/9. I've seen 3 Rush concerts & 
     each of them has been on or near my birthday. Thank you, Rush. Thank 
     you for thinking of me!

Hi all,

as said earlier, word had it that DS would be released today, at least in
Holland. Called 2 record stores just now, they had some nice stories as to
why the release won't be until friday the 13th..
1: The CDs are coming from Germany, since there are major floods going on
it'll take a bit longer. This from the record company.
2: Everybody should call Warner Atlantic since they're lying scumbags. They
keep yanking our chain and won't ever tell the truth. The 13th it is, any
day sooner is  a Godsend.

Well, so much for  sanding my  staircase with the Analog Kid live tonight...

     To Phantom et al -> The song is entitled "Tears are Not Enough", and 
     the group was indeed called 'Northern Lights', in reference to the 
     fact that the artists all hailed from the Great White North.  The 
     single was produced by Bryan Adams and/or David Foster (?) circa 1985. 
      Of course, many Rush fans are aware that our own Geddy Lee 
     contributed with a signature wail to the tune (his one solo line: "Oh 
     you know that we'll be there...").  Other Canuck notables to 
     contribute included Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Corey Hart, Dan Hill, 
     Carol Pope, Anne Murray, Ronnie Hawkins, the guy from Platinum Blonde 
     (where is he now? Mark-something?), etc.  I have a 45 copy of the

Sat Oct 31.....WOW....These guys are very very good.
The lead guitar and bass/keyboard player are very capable musicians.  The
drummer is amazing. This was apparently their first gig with a new lead
singer (Limelight is a 4 piece band). It's hard to believe someone can
actually sing like Ged but this guy did a super job. Among the tunes covered
were Dreamline, Limelight, Red Barchetta, Xanadu, CttH, Tom Sawyer, Freewill

Billy Joel's VH-1 "Storytellers" special is on as I write this and it

said it himself on the show:

"There's something going on with record companies now... it's like: You
can't sing, you can't play and you can't write?

"Hey, you're our guy!"

I guess this one of the reasons some of us cling to Rush so much. I know

I think the deal with Geddy and the pick is that he used the pick when he
played the _guitar_ on his double Rick.  I don't think he ever used when
playing _bass_.

And, yes, he is one of the top-echelon rock bass players of all time.
(Never heard him play jazz, so I don't want to make a categorical
statement, although I bet he'd tear on that too.)  Technically flawless,
musically inventive, and able to do all this sh*t while singing and playing
pedals.  Even more impressive considering that he can't see jack 'cuz his

Hello all:

A few digests back, someone posted re: obtaining DS from Music Blvd. for 
$11.82, including postage, when one signs up for a free e-mail address 
at iname.com, upon which the customer receives $10.00 off any order from 
Music Blvd.

OK, most of this is true. Upon my coversation with Music Blvd., however, 
the $11.82 price is for "3rd day" shipping on Friday the 6th, and the 
set may not arrive until Wednesday.

For about $2.00 more, they will ship "2nd day" on the 6th, and the set 
will get to you on Tuesday, but it could be as late as to 7:00 PM, 
depending on your local Fed Ex routes, etc. Not good.

But, for another 2 bucks or so, they'll ship "priority overnight" on 
Mon. the 9th, with guaranteed delivery by 10:30 AM Tuesday. Total cost 
(including the $10.00 discount) - $15.10 (plus state sales tax, if 
applicable). This is the route I took.

Therefore, if any of you have ordered and your price was under $15.00, 
call Music Blvd. and ask them to either re-write your order or upgrade 
the shipping to priority overnight, as this seems to be the only way to 
get the set on Tuesday morning, which is of course, essential. Hope this 
helps...
