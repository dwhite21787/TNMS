Gruess aus Deutschland,

This is somewhat of an old thread from tnms and a.m.r.  However, for those
of you who are still interested in getting a copy of the limited edition
version of CP on cd (it has the middle symbol done in gold overlay on the
cover of the jewel box) let me know.  There are only a few left here in
Tuebingen, a fairly small university town, but I am sure I can find more
in Stuttgart.  They are not going to be around long.  They CD's cost $20
and postage (airmail) will be, I beleive, around $10.  This means the
total cost would be $30 plus whatever customs decides to tack on, which
should be nothing.

Apologies to RUSH-mgr if this conflicts with the no boots in tmns rule,
but these are not boots (that should stay on e-mail, or not done at all,
eh?), only legitimate editions that are not available in the US, so I
don't think it is a prob (please correct me if I am wrong).  I also found
out I can order CD singles (Bones and Sawyer are on the way).  You might
be able to get those in the US too.  So far no luck finding Cd singles off
CP, same with CP vinyl, but I have yet to hit the big town.  There are all
kinds of things here that I can't find in the US, and boots are not, yet,
verboten (illegal).  It is sort of a shame that Metallica and GnR are huge
instead of RUSH because I could find RUSH stuff really easy adn they might
even tour here, but then again, it is nice to intro people to RUSH.

If I get many responses I will fill on a one per person basis, and then
fill in the rest of multi-orders if I can find ienough copies.  If I get no
responses none of them will be filled.

Enjoy the tour, I look forward to reading about it since I will be missing
the entire thing.  For those who can, please try to get me tix stubs.  I
want a momento from the tour even if I can't have a memory of it.

items on information technology...

Made me think of the distribution of the Counterparts .au files back
before the release.  Do they really think that this costs them sales?
To me, people who like a song/album and get a chance to hear it ahead of
time in digitized form, they (like I'm sure we all did) are still going
to buy it.  Lets face it, listening to this stuff on the computer just
isn't satisfying.  However, if you hear it on the computer, and think it
sucks, you won't buy it.  So are they afraid that they're sucky music
won't ever get bought because people will realize it sucks BEFORE they
buy it?

So what does this have to do with Rush?  Well, basically, the
distribution of Counterparts in its digitized entirety closely resembles
this case.  So what if the N.M.P.A. had brought charges against NMS?
Would the evidence that EVERY SINGLE PERSON who downloaded those files
eventually bought the CD anyway be enough to get the case dismissed?

<A NAME="841004">Subject:      Why we like Rush at all</A>

NMS'ers,

This is a longer post than I originally intended.  Sorry.

     There's a lot of talk around the list nowadays about
how this or that song "sucks".  IMHO Rush-mgr said it best
in issue 838 when he said "it would be interesting to hear
more about *why* you hate a song. . ."  I agree
wholeheartedly with that, but maybe we should take it a
little bit further.  Let's stop ragging on the band for
writing songs we don't necessarily like. Sure criticism is
valid, but is it necessary?  Rush songs are vehicles of
artistic expression, both in the lyrics and in the music.
Let's treat them as such.  You may not agree particularly
with a song, or with the attempt the song makes, but is it
the best you can do to say that it's wholly without merit?
(That it sucks?!)  How about not trashing the ones you don't
like, and instead talking about the good parts of various
songs you do like.  Enough on the soapbox already!  I simply
think that we're better off with the band than without it.
You know, mistakes and failed (or less than perfect anyway)
attempts at things make the band more real.  The guys really
are human and they have emotions (which they're exploring
more and more these days).  I like that.

     On to another topic, briefly.  I just got my Feb 94
issue of Modern Drummer the other day with Neil on the
cover.  Cool.  As opposed to past issues featuring Neil,
this one seemed to concentrate a little more on the drums
and playing them, instead of just the new album.  It's a
must have issue, that's for sure!

     Sorry about the long post, and I really hope we hear
Alien Shore live, 'cause it GROOVES!   (Waiting patiently
for dates close to Cincinnati. . .)

<A NAME="841005">Subject: Another Review</A>

Lately, some of the only worthwhile reading material in the NMS
have been the reviews of Counterparts from around the country.
Yesterday I actually saw a review in a Cincinnati paper (believe
me, it is a miracle).  This is from the December 17-30 issue of
Everybody's News ("Greater Cincinnati's Free News, Arts &
Entertainment Paper").  This is, of course, reprinted without
permission, while at work and very twilight zonish as Cold Fire
has just come on the radio as I am typing this sentence.

"Rush marks the beginning of a new stage in its music with this
album.  Starting as basically a blues/rock band in 1974, Rush
moved through 14 prior studio albums in constant change,
switching from simple songs to rock opera and concept albums and
back to simplicity.  Along the way their sound changed from
heavy, guitar-driven rock to more complex,
synthesizer-incorporating art.

Guitar dominates the music in Counterparts in a way it has not
since before Exit Stage Left and, consequently, becomes the
band's driving force again.  Rush  nonetheless continues to move
forward, maintaining the unique and complex style found on their
middle and later albums.  In this sense, Counterparts, true to
its name, is a mix of old and new.

In almost 20 years of songwriting, Neil Peart has hardly ever
penned lyrics about love.  But here he uses his intellectually
removed and analytical style to look at love from a philosophical
sense, as well as to examine such counterpart relationships as
exist between sexes, races and parents and children.

In their last few albums, Rush sampled bits of whatever was
popular at the time (the title song from Rush's last album, Roll
the Bones, incorporated a rap sequence that was almost
tongue-in-cheek).  Counterparts also does this, but in a more
obviously stated way.  Peart has recently talked about the talent
of bands such as Pearl Jam in comparison to the virtual void of
talent from the '80s and Rush makes a point of complimenting
grunge on this album-especially evident on the songs, "Animate"
and "Stick it Out".

The combination of a "grungy" guitar tone and the reborn
prominence of guitar creates a more "organic" Rush on
Counterparts.  This new sound, along with complex writing and
poetic lyrics, makes for an album that's upbeat, powerful and
freshly new."

by Wayne Miller

note: This publication does not give any type of numerical or
star rating system.  Also the title part of the review is listed
as Counterparts, RUSH, Label.  I have no idea why Atlantic is not
mentioned, must be a typo.

Later,

Steve

I had to read _Nova_ for Academic Decathlon. I too noticed the allusions
to the Syrinx. Actually, I noticed MANY allusions to many Rush songs
(actually and probably the other way around).  I can't think of them
specifically right now, but I'll reread the book and see what I can remember.

Shirts
======
I sent out two large batches of shirts before I left, but didn't get to
mail all them out. I have a helper who hopefully will be mailing them
out on Monday (the last ones I got checks for before I left). Glad to
know that some of you have already received them, I know it's kind of
tricky with the holiday mail clogging up the system!

Anyone mailing me checks AFTER I left will have to wait until I can get back
home on Dec. 31 before I can mail them out to you.

Phosphorescence
===============
As for the phosphorescence, I know I'm a bit behind (whaddaya want from some
old clunker 2400 modems that don't connect half the time? :) but here's the
story:

Dinoflagellates are the one-celled organisms that cause bioluminescence in the
open ocean (bacteria also do this, but are mainly found inside other animals
such as fish). They do this by using a protein called "luciferin", but other
than that the true mechanism remains unknown (it took 3500 liters of luciferin
just to find out what its amino acid composition was!)

The reason it's called a 'cold fire' is as Melissa said, because it generates
no heat, only light. The light is 90% efficient, compared to 5-10% in normal
light bulbs. As to "tropical sea", bioluminescence is more common in warm seas
than in cold ones. And yes, you can even find it in freshwater, but it comes
from bacteria and not dinoflagellates. Since it is so efficient, much research
is being done into producing lights with this. If they do though, my iguana
won't be as happy as she is under my 'inefficient' and heat-generating
light... ;)

Etc.
====
Since I did put 'etc.' in the subject, thought I would update everyone on the
new and improved bootleg (CD) list I intend to work on. I have an idea that I
will create a page for each title (I brought with me La Villa boot to work
on), complete with ratings for the sound, packaging, songs, and overall, and
also with a picture of the cover of the boot, and hopefully the disc itself
(if the disc is unusual-looking, that is). Then I'll create a postscript file
for each page, compress it, and upload it to syrinx in a special directory so
anyone with access to a postscript printer can get whichever title they're
interested in (or don't have the listing for yet), and print it out. I'll also
be able to make hard copies for those without psprinter access. Any comments
on this? I'll need help and reviews for those boots that I don't have, and
also some kind people to mail me either just the cover of the boot so I can
scan it in, or the whole thing so I can get the disc (and any pictures that
might be inside that are interesting) in the file.

Also, has anyone seen the 12 inch remix of In the Mood yet?  I just got it

were pressed on cd (in Japan).  Rush fans, go out and get your copy before
they sell out!  The Wicked Bass dub of the song rules.  Of course, I love
the song, so I like all of the mixes (except the one where they slur

Just a quick addendum to however posted in the last NMS about hearing Rush in un
expected places.

When I was watching the 1990 (91?) U.S. Open, on several occassions they cut to
commercial and used the lead in for "Grand Designs."  How 'bout that!!

Someone posted this poem elsewhere and there's a line further down
that you folks may find interesting. I wouldn't go as far as to say
it HAD to be the inspiration behind track 10 on _Counterparts_, but
as there's been some NMS discussion about the song, I thought I'd
through this into the ring:

(Howard Stern was on when the DJ, Steve whatshisface, announced it,
and he exclaimed, "Rush!? They're still around? I thought they'd
dropped off the face of the earth! I thought they were lying in the
street in front of the Viper Room! Rush!?" Steve calmly replied that
yes, they still existed, and had a great new album out. Stern continued
to go "Rush!" and almost audibly shake his head in wonder. Just a bit
of trivia for ya.)

<A NAME="841013">Subject: Red Sector A & E...SL</A>

Hello!
	First of all, this is my first post.  I've been reading for a
couple of months now, and finally I have found some questions that I think
I can answer.
	In the last issue, someone asked about Neil wearing headphones in
Red Sector A.  This is because of the background sound in the song.  I
don't really know how to describe it.  It's a repetitive sound that goes
throughout the song.  On ASOH, it's the first thing you hear before the
bass drum starts.  The headphones allow Neil to stay in tempo with the
sound, so that the song sounds right.  There are some other songs that he
does this for, but I can't think of any off the top of my head.
	The other question was why "A Passage to Bangkok" wasn't on the
E...SL CD.  If you read the cover, just above Geddy's picture, it says "'A
Passage to Bangkok' has been omitted in order to release 'Exit...Stage
Left' as a single compact disc."  If you really want the song on CD.  It's
on Chronicles, along with "What You're Doing", which was omitted from the
ATWAS CD for the same reason.

<A NAME="841015">Subject: The Illustrious Metronome</A>

Hi all,
I probably won't be the only one to respond to this (Terry's question about
the headphones Neil uses, in TNMS #839), but my understanding has always been
that Neil uses a Metronome  ---a time keeping device--- for "Red Sector A",
as well as other songs, during concerts; in order to maintain a constant
tempo in such a complicated song, and especially to keep the music going with
the adjoining videos, when applicable.  This is most notable during the last
tour for "Roll the Bones", whose video part must be matched by the music, or
the skull during the 'chat' part would be off (as it was the first time I saw
them at Pittsburgh).  Another song it would be used in is "Time Stand Still",
where the music must match Aimee Mann's recorded voice.  If you notice at the
beginning of these songs (in concert), Neil will either: 1.) click off 4
stick clicks to set the tempo, or 2.) begin the song with the drums, setting
the tempo.  What you hear inside the headphones is none other than a beep, or
click that runs at a steady tempo.  If you hear the beep, you're off tempo.
If not, you're right on.  As I am a drummer myself, I have had the
opportunity to use the metronome while playing, and it's interesting how well
it works.  Neil first used the metronome, if i'm not mistaken, for "Vital
Signs", in the studio.  I think he writes in the __Moving Pictures__ tourbook
that he was always striving for an even more perfect tempo, and decided to
try using a metronome.  Check out the video for the song (on "Through the
Camera Eye"),
and you'll see that he's wearing the headphones.  It's interesting for
someone who already keeps near perfect time to use a metronome, in striving
for the ultimate in perfection.

Not that there hasn't been enough said on the 1812/2112 thing...

I was familiar with the 1812 Overture long before I ever heard a single note
of our favorite Canadian trio.

And the very FIRST time I heard 2112, I heard the 1812 theme plain as day.
(even though, admittedly, much faster and in a different key) I thought it
was really cool.  But I thought it was such an obvious musical "tip of the
hat", that I am surprised its even a topic of discussion.

And on that, that's it.

One of are old friends (and Rush's) Terry Brown, will be producing Dream
Theater next album.  Yep thats right, our good friend Broon!

I haven't heard a a release date or anything but I think that Dec - Jan is the
time that the where supposed to start working on it.  I know its gonna
include the 20 minute epic, "A Change of Seasons".

Sorry for the DT news but I thought people would like to know what Broon is
up to, and it may also get some more people to look into Dream Theater!

See ya!

Hey all. I am officially unsubscribed now, but I'm using my last moments
on-line (until the end of vacation that is) to beg for assistance.
I don't actually have tickets to the San Antonio concert, but I'd really
love to go to Melma's party (we have been talking on email), and anyway
SOMEONE might have to back out. What I need from some kind soul is a
ride there. I am in Lafayette, Indiana and could easily get to Indianapolis
if necessary. Please, if anyone can help, please email me. Thank you
SOOOOOOOO much!!! I will write back to everyone when I get back.

If you read the liner notes from the CD in question, you will note:
" 'A Passage to Bangkok' has been omitted to release 'Exit...Stage Left'
as a single CD."

<A NAME="841023">Subject: Available Light, Vital Signs</A>

I was reading the last issue of the NMS and the discussion about titles in
song lyrics...

I've noticed several *possible* references to other songs in Available Light.
     1.  "Witch Hunt" - rising with the full moon/to go howling through the
         night
     2.  "The Camera Eye" - in the canyons of the city
     3.  "Limelight" - play of light/a photograph [among other]
     4.  _Moving Pictures_ - trick of light/moving picture [noted before]
I guess that's it.  I'm probably stretching this a bit.

This goes back a while, and I don't remember if I've posted it before...  In
Vital Signs, towards the end where people think they hear Geddy say "evelate",
I would swear he is saying "revelate".  To "revelate above the norm" - to gain
a new awareness of reality.  Kinda makes sense to the theme of the song.  Just 
my 2 Pfennig worth.

Last but not least...  A friend of mine came over to help call Ticketmaster in
New Orleans for tix to the Pensacola show (they didn't sell them in much of 
Florida, it seems) and after (re)dialing for a half-hour on two phone lines,
we finally broke through to buy 3 11th row on the floor seats!  See y'all there!

I hope I didn't get your hopes up.  I had a dream that Kate Bush opened
for the Boyz at the Pensacola show, and Rush had a movable stage with pools
of water.  Kinda cool!  Between Kate's and Rush's sets, Geddy came out and
sat in front of me for a few minutes.

To be serious, though.  I was wondering if anyone out there knows who indeed
will be opening for Rush at the Pensacola show?

Yeah, "The Greats".  While I will acknowldge L.Z.'s popularity, I refuse to
acknowledge their greatness.  Jimmy Page was the master of riff-rip-off, and
this band had perhaps the most aptly named album when they released
"The Song Remains The Same" (I think that was it wasn't it).  And the Police,
while perhaps musically gifted, never seemed to vary their songs much either.

I never understand reviews like this.  Are they saying Rush are obviously
ripping people off, but changing it slightly to appear original?  Or are they
saying that their original stuff is boring and they might as well just go
ahead and rip off from the "greats" because their stuff sucks?

I noticed one of those reviews was by Kurt Loder, that paragon of PC
profundities on MTV News.  Not surprising that a puppet like Loder doesn't
even have enough spine to give credit where credit is due, just because it
doesn't fit with the script.

Hey, has anyone out there read Mona Simpson's excellent first novel,
"Anywhere but Here"?  Although I'm not sure if Neil's reference is to the
entire book itself, there is a quote in the introduction of the book that
goes something like:  The sick always think of health, the poor think of
wealth, and the traveller thinks, "Anywhere but here."

I think it's a poem by somebody, and most likely Neil has read that poem.
Unless, of course he turns out to be a Mona Simpson fan.  The book came
out around 1989, and she published her second book, the sequel to her
first, about two years ago.

Just another obscure Rush possibility,

Last weekend I was introducing a new female friend of mine to Rush.  She
noticed my Permanent Waves poster, and questioned the presence of the cover
girl with her skirt blown up and panties exposed.  She didn't quite say that
she found it degrading but she hinted at that sort of thing.

I don't find the PW cover girl to be slutty or degrading (of course, I'm male
and heterosexual so maybe I'm biased).  I had always thought that the
condition of the girl was merely an extension of the rest of the carelessness
of her surroundings.

Anybody out there experienced anything similar or have any thoughts about
this?
