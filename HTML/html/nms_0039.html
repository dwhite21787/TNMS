Actually, Ged's last name is Weinrib. Alex's last name is the eastern european
one... Zinovinojivic I think (or something along those lines). They were posted
a while back, a few months ago. As it turns out, Alex's last name means "Lifeson".

If I can get my friend to let me borrow it, I would be happy to do the 2112
tourbook, which consists of a neat story set after the song.....

 I'm a new subscriber to the Rush-list, and I am curious about the
 "Chronicles" album that people on the list are discussing.  Is this
 a new studio album, another live album (unlikely), or a compilation
 of old stuff?  I remember hearing a rumor somewhere that PRESTO was
 going to be their last studio album, but the gist of what was in
 the PRESTO tour-book seemed hopeful for more new stuff!

 Also, I would look forward to seeing a few pre-SIGNALS tour books
 transcribed and posted to the digest.  I'd happily volunteer to do
 POWER WINDOWS, HOLD YOUR FIRE, or PRESTO.

Back a few years ago when I was in high school we watched a video tape
called 48 Hours On Crack Street.  In the tape they played The Camera Eye.

	I am surprised no one got this one...
    On St. Elsewhere in one of the episodes where the rapist, Peter White,
comes back in a Drs' dream, the music that is played in the background is
the beginning of Between, Beside, Behind.
