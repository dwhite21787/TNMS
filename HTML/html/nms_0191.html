In the last issue of the NMS, I misspoke myself.  It may have been
apparent from the context, but when I said:

    "Have you checked out the Floyd mailing list/newsletter?"

and went on to praise it's quality, I was really referring to the
Yes mailing list/newsletter.  It is much more than a digest; it has
articles, letters, etc., just like a magazine.  Amazing.

In addition, the latest list of mailing lists is included later in
this digest, thanks to Steve Owen (one of them).  :-)

Also, in the FAQL it was erroneously reported that Neil's editorial on
Satanism was in issue #28, when it is actually in issue #22.  This has
been corrected in the FAQL in Digest #184 (latest FAQL).

Sorry for any confusion!

<A NAME="191003">Subject: I drank 12 beers</A>

Is definately sung on one of the videos (the only one with "Finding My Way,
which I guess would be Exit...Stage Left).  My girlfriend noticed this
before I did, quite recently actually.

My guess, dear Mr. Rush Manager, is that you already have it!

[ Umm, I may be slipping, but is "Finding My Way" on ESL?  I thought it
  was on ATWAS only.  As far as I know the only vid of FMW is from an
  ooolllldd Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, circa 1975.            :rush-mgr ]

While I'm posting...

As for bad lyrics, I agree with those who mentioned
"tension so thick you could cut it with a knife".    Others
that make me cringe:
"Like the fool on television, getting paid to play the fool"
ALL of the "fanning the fires while feeding the flame" song on HOF
(I always skip this one...I really can't bear it)

Actually, (and I have been holding back on saying this because
I have no desire to start a flame war), I think, on the whole,
Rush's lyrics are basically quite poor.  Now I say this as a massive
fan, seen them every tour since 1979, listen five hours a day, etc. etc.,
but I listen for the *music* and have developed the fine art of ignoring the
often atrocious lyrics.

My basic complaint can be summed up using one of their songs.  Neil
tends to *tell* not *show* things.  He tends to write very rational,
"left brain" stuff, while the music is so intensly emotional.  He
often deals with emotions as a theme, but writes *about* them rationally.
A good example of this is "Emotion Detector" on PoW.  "When we lift
the covers from our feelings, we expose the insecure spots."  The entire
song writes about emotions without itself being emotional!  The *music*,
on the other hand, is quite good.

I guess I find Neil's writing style a bit immature.  It is sort of
overly sincere, and often pretentious.   My girlfriend was commenting
on this a couple of days ago, how her favorite Rush songs (Bastille Day,
The Trees, and Natural Science) have very very pretentious lyrics,
but she thinks this is funny (*not* what Neil intended).

Now, every once in a while, there are some appropriately emotional lyrics,
that match the music (personal fave: "When I leave I don't know what I'm
hoping to find..." indeed, my favorite lyrics are on Signals for the most
part, also "Available Light").

Admittedly, I have a bias: I think that song lyrics should be emotional.  But
one can still be clever, and make a point nimbly (eg Elvis Costello), while
Rush lyrics are often ponderous.  But hey, my favorite songwrite is Rickie
Lee Jones, who probably no one else on this list listens to.

I am risking flames here to find out if there are any other people on this list
who also are a bit embarassed sometimes at Rush lyrics, while being completely
devoted to the music!

flames to a minimum, please-

hey there from buffalo, new york, the home of the 1 point losers. i
have a stupid little rush-related story to tell. i live about 80 miles
from toronto, rush's home town. last year, i was looking around a
record store in toronto when a man and his wife came up to me. this
happened on the day when a show of hands came out. anyway, the guy
asked me, "can you help help me? my son wants the new rush album. can
you tell me which one it is. i pointed the album out to him, and he
proceded to tell me that he was geddy and alex's english teacher in
highschool. i dont remember the rest of the conversation exactly,
but the jist of it went along the lines that he was suprised they
were so famous. well, i told you it was stupid, but then again im
a new member, so what do you expect.
 to rob harris at u mich. , who loves you baby? (telly)
p.s. new york giants go to hell!!!!!!!!!

<A NAME="191006">Subject: Dangerous Dave explains his humor / YES tour info</A>

ok, ok, for eveveryone (and their brother) who doesn't have a sense
of humor, here is a brief explanation:
     i heard this great joke from a Rabbi i know.  yes, i'm actually
quite Jewish.  i thought the joke was so funny that i stuck it in my
sig file.  of course, 10,000 non-humor-containing letters promptly
arrived shortly after telling me that i was anti-semitic.  i thought
that was funny (has anyone ever checked my name?), but decided to
change it anyway, if only to limit the number of mail messages i
receive daily to 100 or so.  i have now make the joke generic, and i
expect no more flames, please.

point 2: everyone keeps asking about YES' tour
some dope:
Yessongs '91 (Around the World in 80 Dates) seems to be a concert-in-
the-round, featuring Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe, Squire, Kaye,
White, and Rabin.  how did they arrange this?  beats the shit out of me,
but i'm camping out anyway the second i hear a date for tickets in my
area.  so far they have planned dates for 3 months or so in Europe
and the north part of this country.

point 3: Max Webster.
i have a factory-sealed copy of the "Universal Juveniles" album.
i'm looking to trade for something equally rare.  i want a 45 RPM
single for countdown (you know, the space shuttle one).  if someone
really drives a hard bargain, i can throw in a rare tape or 2.

point 4: Trivia question from Hell!
can anyone out there name Neil's first band and its members?
(Hint: it's from '68 or so)

[ Ooh, I do, I do!!  :-)                                      :rush-mgr ]

point 5: interesting percussion:
what about the use of light bulbs in YYZ?

Okay, sorry for misunderstanding your comment, rush-mgr.  I thought you were
knocking the Floyd for letting thier lasers, equipment, etc. take over the show
and not being more 'human' in concert.

As for the PF list you mentioned, are you subscribing to the same one I do?
The one I get I would not call professional, as the same messages get posted
every issue.  It is also available in a real-time format, and my friend is
having a hell of a time cancelling his subscription.  He had over 200 messages
just from them over spring break!  And of the 200, there were about 35 messages
that kept repeating over and over and over and over....

<A NAME="191308">From: kmarino@Bonnie.ICS.UCI.EDU</A>

Okay, okay, so this is my first post.  Well the OB statement goes something
like this, "Please excuse (forgive) me for this is my first..."

Now that that's out of the way...

Some talk about AFTK and especially Xanadu.  These topics are very near
and dear to me as this is probably my favorite album. (Not that any others
fail by comparison.)

Xanadu (IMHO) is about a man that longs for companionship but is destined
to be alone for eternity.  He admittedly has what he needs to survive, but
something is missing.  That something is why he longs to "escape these caves
of ice".  What a metaphor :-), he is implying that it is cold (ice, huh)
w/o what he longs for.  Too short a summary for such a great song, I know.

IMO though, why aren't there any discussions about one of Geddy's greats?
I mean Cinderella Man.  I love this song.  It has a complex meaning of
being cynical.  In some aspects he has a cynical view, while he condems
those views at the same time [what irony ;-)].  This is impressive for a
non Neil lyric.  I'd love to hear what y'all think on this issue.

Clapping hands to:
	Marshall for a good OBBQ joke  (see NMS #187)
	Geddy, Alex, Neil for finding each other, and for finding me.
	All of you for talking about one of my favorite subjects.
	My mother for, uh, well I'm taking this far too seriously

To Mike Goodwin
	(Please be kind y'all)  I have liked RUSH since FBN sorta...
	I knew of a song called Fly by Night and liked it, but I never
	got around to investigating the source of this song.  It wasn't
	until PoW that I became a hardcore fanatic.  I fell in love with
	Manhatten Project.  What words... what music...

Feat of the 90's:
	I now own every RUSH cd in american release.  (I'm always on
	the hunt for those special imports on cd, but no luck yet. Any
	suggestions?)  I also have a live BL (oops, did I say a nasty?) of
	the trio in St. Louis in 1980.  Great sound quality but it is vinyl
	and I don't like vinyl much anymore (lets not discuss vinyl vs.
	cd on the NMS, email me directly if you have a problem w/this
	attitude).

I always imagined that the immortality he received went hand in hand with
loss of freedom. I imagined that he was actually physically restrained, so
"Held within the pleasure dome..." meant that he was actually held, rather
than just held trapped in immortality as something horrible once you have
it (endless boredom?) as corrie@fiu.edu (Corrie) mentions - although that
is also interesting.

But I saw it as immortality as in turned to a living statue. There was
a Dr Who episode, and I can't remember much about it now, which had
immortality granted to someone, but only as an immortal face on the
side of a marble slab. You could only move your eyes about, and even
that was limited to about 5 seconds worth, when someone else was made
immortal to share your slab with you.

Gives "To taste my bitter triumph" a rather darker tone, doesn't it!

Hello fellow Rush-Dudes:

	I have not posted for a while, so I figured that I should
probably say something.  I have an answer to one person, and a few more
questions:

	First, to the person who asked about Rush sheet music
anthologies:  I know of many.  Rush Complete (2 Vols) is a collection of
all of the music from RUSH - PoW.  I have Vol II.  It has a black cover
with the man/star logo in blue.  It has all of the music & lyrics from PeW to
PoW.  I assume that Vol I has the lyrics from RUSH to PeW.  I have also
seen many books that contain the music from one album, like HYF, SIG,
PoW, etc.  I also saw the Music for  Presto last September in a store by
me.

	Now the questions:  Who is the girl on the cover of PeW and ESL?

	To the person who saw Freewill play in Youngstown:   When did
they last play there?  When are they going to play there again?  I would
like to go see them, so if you could Email me (address below)  I would
appreciate it.

	Is there anyone on this list that is at the University of
Arizona?  I don't have the time to go through the entire list of names,
so I would appreciate it if you could Email me (see address below)-  I
have a few questions about the U of A.  Thanks.

	"Thank you for your support"

OTHER INFO:
As you can see, there seems to be TWO Peter Gabriel lists.  Someone had told me
that the old one had died, but alas it's still here.  Someone let me know what
happens with that, OK?

Also, I personally would like to see a _U2_ list, but don't have the system
resources... would anyone like to start one up... please?

DISCLAIMER:
I take no responsibility for incorrect addresses or dead lists.  I'm only
telling you what I've been told.  Please don't ask me for further information
about these lists, as I know as much as you do at this point.  I don't know if
all of these are still in existance or if they will accept any new members.
Some of these lists are set up for automatic addition to the lists (listserv
etc.), but I didn't have enough room for all the instructions, so I put the
list managers address down.
'nuff said.
