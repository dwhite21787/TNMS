To date I have Rush Fans Digest numbers 26-36.  Is there a way I can
get to older issues?  I also have all the album lyrics and Neil's
editorial on "satanism".  Is there more info, in computer file/program
format, that is available concerning Rush.  I'm wanting to start a
Rush section on my BBS.  Perhaps this should go into the Digest?

[ HELP!!!  If somebody out there can get in touch with this person, 
  please contact him and let them know that I cannot get mail to him
  via his old address or his new one (below).  I keep getting the message
  "Node 'infonode' unknown" messages from 'ingr'.               :rush-mgr ]

I'm not sure if I am supposed to respond to the post or the individual. Oh well
what the hell..

I would like a copy of ANY of the tourbooks. I have been to a few shows, but I
was always too broke to buy any of the books. I have no tour t-shirts either
for the same reason. Thanks..

<A NAME="41003">Subject: "If there's a rock-n-roll heaven..."</A>

I can't let this day go by without posting a quick note regarding
the tragic loss of Stevie Ray Vaughn. I am reminded of a song from
the '70's, i think it was by the Righteous Brothers:

     " if there's a rock-n-roll heaven,
          well you know they have a hell of a band "

Ain't that the truth.... Stevie and Duane Allman jamming, what a thought!

Back on the Rush track... does anyone know if the guys are all from the
same town.... I recall the part from The Necromancer... "The 3 travelers,
men of Willowdale".. I know Alex and Geddy went to school together
(check out the photo in Visions..hee-hee), but did Neil grow up in
Willowdale? Just curious.

Sentimentally,

Dave

<A NAME="41004">Subject: Objectivism vs. Whatever in Rush lyrics</A>

  I think it would be safe to say that Peart (at least in many Rush
lyrics) tends to feel favorable towards Objectivism.  I've also noticed
that many contributors to the list interpret some Peart lyrics as being
primarily concerned about rapacious corporations or environmental issues.

For example (Del Gordon writes...):

	So my guess, and that's all it is, is that the above lines
from "Red Tide" suggest that the smokestack industries that currently
are polluting our water, land, and air, are going to have to be
transformed into something different, hopefully better, by force if
necessary.  The "quiet rebellion leads to open war" line reminds me of
the change in attitude from the gentle "Green Revolution" and "Earth
Day" type of ecological movement we've seen in the last couple of
decades to the more militant and violent "eco-guerillas" we've been
seeing more recently, like some of the Greenpeace folks who ram
whaling ships and others who spike trees to destroy saw blades.

  Given Ayn Rand's public opinion concerning pollution and rapacious
corporations, and given that she defined Objectivism, I was wondering
how other Rush fans resolved this seeming inconsistency.  I have my
own ideas about this, but I would like to see what you all think.

  I don't qualify as a spokesperson for Objectivism, but in a nutshell,
Rand feels that the American businessman (rapacious corporation?) is
the most persecuted minority in America today.  As for pollution, well,
let's just say she considers it a necessary evil.

  (Del Gordon writes again...)
 They (and the rest of us) will (and can) force industry to change their
polluting ways if industry doesn't do it voluntarily.

  Well, Del, I don't know exactly what you're talking about, but the best
way to "force industry to change their polluting ways" is to do it in the
marketplace.  Change yourself first, and don't do business with polluting
firms.  That spiking trees bull$h!+ only results in seriously hurt lumber
workers and a pissed off American public.

  And I just wanted to add a couple of notes about Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I
am really REALLY saddened by his death.  I was surprised at just how shocked
and affected I am by the horrible news.  I'm just glad I was able to see him
live a few times, and that he will never really die as long as we can still
hear his recordings.  This is a black, black day for the blues.  I'm really
going to miss you a lot, SRV...

This is so funny because I've always thought the exact same thing!
Perhaps this was done intentionally by Neil.  I can't offhand think of
any instances where Neil uses language stronger than "hell" or perhaps
"damn", are there any?  He may believe that strong language is almost
never needed to fully express one's thoughts.  This may be an instance
where that is ironically so, in that the sentiments (and even the
words!) are implied but not used.  Yet another example where we can
read incredible genius, foresight, innovation, creativity, blah, blah,
blah into Neil's lyrics when he'd probably say he never meant anything
that deep at all, and get a real life :-}.

Anyway, I too always sing the alternative set of lyrics when I'm alone
in my van with the windows cranked down and the boyz cranked up.

      If you can find a BIG dictionary (talk about mud flaps, my dictionary's
      got 'em) there will be a definition for sea-change agreeing with the
      one given above.  I agree with Del, the line means to me "Taking
      into account the environment (symbolized by the sea), as we need
      to at this point, we must make changes in our industries and
      manufacturing. or: "For the sea's sake, let's make changes"

     How about:

     We've got our big gas guzzling cars, our screaming-penis boats, our
     Rush collections on cd's, tapes, _and_ albums to play on turntables,
     cd players, and tape decks (both car and home), and any manner of
     toys available through the exploitation of cheap resources.
     Garbage?  Let's just dig another hole.  They're all full?  Dig more!
     What's this Earth Day crap?  Don't rain on my pleasure parade.
     The 80's were such gratuitous fun.  Get this boorish guest out of
     my celebration of the Good Life.

     Not preaching, just interpreting.

I'm kinda excited cause I just heard 2 2-fers on the radio from The Boyz.
They were 2-fers cause it's a 2-fer Tuesday.  One on WONE Akron, OH and
one on WMMS Cleveland, OH.  WONE played the usual Rush tunes: New World Man
and Working Man.  WMMS played New World Man and (get this) The Trees from
_Exit... Stage Left_.  Hard to believe.  I don't know about the rest of the
country but Rush *STILL* doesn't get a whole lot of air play.  And this
is Cleveland, where they got their big break!  They did get a little more
when they came to town but the other bands (Heart, Stones, etc) blew them
away in number of songs aired.  I don't know about the rest of the country
but this area plays the sh%t out of Zepplin and Robert Plant too.  Almost
seems a little unfair.  Does Rush gets lots of air play anywhere else in the
U.S. or is it like here, next to none.  Just thought I'd bring up this since
we were on the subject of Rush on TV.  Why not go to Rush on the radio next,
right?

Well, I too agree that the world of music lost one the greatest and
influencial guitarist of all time.  Musicians and fans alike will miss the
talent and music of Stevie Ray Vaughn.  He definately is one of the best.

Well, I can't help it, I have to gloat.  I finally picked up my new
personalized plates for my car:

So, if you see a maroon Honda Accord in the Washinton DC/Baltimore MD
area with those plates, you'll know who it is!

It'll also be sitting out front of my house this Saturday, so you'll
know where the party is!  :-)
