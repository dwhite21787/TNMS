Howdy...

Plenty of other people have already said what I feel about the post on Neil's
alledged sojourn to a gay bar, so I will no bother to repeat it...

Having said that...ENOUGH XANADU!!  Take it to private email...Please!

Where was I??  Oh yeah...People have been talking Dream Theater around her as
of late, so I thought that I'd mention that I posted the lyrics to their latest
album _Images and Words_ to the lyrics FTP server at ftp.uwp.edu.  If I am not
mistaken, the path is pub/music/lyrics/d/dream.theater/images.and.words, though
I am not positive.  If you don't know much about the band, grab these lyrics,
they're pretty cool.

Hey...To you IRC people:  I'm an old timer from back when there was still a
channel called +Rush (now there's a blast from the past, eh?).  Anyways, I
don't hang around on #p/g! for my own reasons, but look me up sometime...The

   I'm new on this system so please forgive me if these topics have
already been discussed.  I have a few questions.  Anyone who saw
the closing show of RTB tour(what a show!) saw Neil throw off his
bandana in the finale to reveal a mohawk shaved in his head.  Well,
I've heard rumors that he might have Leukemia and seeing his shaved
head supported those rumors.  Has anyone heard anything similar?
 Maybe he lost a bet or something, I don't know.  Anyway, a few other
questions:  Who's the voice heard in Subdivisions?  How about on
Superconductor?  Does anyone have any info or even heard of the album
'Stellar Dynamics'?  I haven't seen anything written about it, and
I was wondering if it actually existed or if it's just another rumor.
Well, that's it.  Thanks.

Sorry I haven't posted in quite some time, but this "Neil Peart is
Gay" thread is unneccesary, not worth a squirrel pellet in a
box of Whitman Chocolates, and is *none* of anyone's business.

And to those people who like to take unsubstantiated rumors as
hardcore fact, think about this: why cause a stir that would cause
chaos?  If someone is rumored to be (fill in the blank), then you
got to get the facts (no Rush quote
intended.), and not try to fiddle around with other's minds.

Other than that, sorry for the misc. 1/4 non-Rush rambling.

I've never felt the need to submit an article to the NMS before now, as most
of the threads seem to be about interpreting lyrics and so forth. I really
like Rush for their music, and enjoy this newsletter as it expands my
understanding of their (or Neil's) lyrics and beliefs.

But this business about Neil "possibly" being gay has really started to annoy
me. Especially as, being part of the REM mail group, I've been putting up
with insinuations of Michael Stipe's "alleged" homosexuality also.

Personally, I couldn't care less if they are gay. It doesn't change them or
their music in any way. If it changes your feelings, then it is YOUR problem,
not Neil's or Michael's. Someone said something about being "gay" and being
"normal". What is normal? And also, why do people feel the need to say "I'm
straight, but......." to defend the possibly of Neil being gay. Everyone
knows what you are really saying!

Anyhow, enough! I am not getting my point across too well, so I'll refrain.
Until Neil and Neil himself says "yay" or "nay", you can only speculate, and
speculation is but hot air.

First of all--
  I'd love to have a Boot RUSH CD of _rare_ songs.  Live songs are OK if
they aren't heard live often (ie: Natural Science).  Personally, I'd
like to hear stuff that you can't find easy, like; Neil's NEW drum solo
from RTB, sound check stuff, Take Off, etc.  You know, the stuff you
can't find on albums.  I would definitely buy a CD like that--maybe
several (great Christmas gifts!)

  Second, the shirt sounds good too.  I vote for the aqua blue color or
perhaps grey.  Plus, a great quote or pic would make the shirt that much
better.

Keep us posted on Footware CD and shirts--I'll take 'em both!

BTW, my friend DJs at a nearby radio station.  He let me guest host a RUSH
block.  Three hours _stright_ of RUSH, RUSH, and more RUSH!!  Why can't
all radio stations do that!

P.S.  Did someone say something about a Genesis digest??

Rushians,

Listening to RTB earlier this evening, I noticed something *very* peculiar in
the graphics on the back cover of the booklet (you know, the cool wishbone-over
water thing)...

If you rotate the booklet's picture such that the bottom of the picture is now
on the right (counterclockwise), and look at the clouds at the (now side) (but
the former) top of the picture, there is a mass of darker clouds that can be
percieved (sp?) as a hand and thumb hitching a ride/ thumbing a ride...

Let me know what you think...

Also, to clarify something about Dream Theater's show's, they will be in DC
again on the 10th of December (at the Bayou) and in Baltimore on the 19th (at
Hammerjacks).. Check 'em out!

Slainte mhath,

Mike

p.s. I don't care if Neil is gay or not, neither should you.

About Dream Theatre: does ANYBODY out there have the first album?? I know it's
out of print, so it is rare, but I would love a copy if someone has it.
Please email me at nam2@po.CWRU.Edu if you have it. Thanks...

Also back to Rush....someone posted that there is a face hidden in the nude
guy's right shoulder on the cover of Hemispheres and the inside of E..SL. Well
obviously I grabbed my CDs to look for this mystery. Sorry, _I_ don't see any-
thing....perhaps you could enlighten us with a few more details?.....

One thing I DID notice, the guy looks a lot like Neil, although I'm sure this
was unintentional. (HEY!! ITS PROOF HE'S GAY!!! HAHAHA!!! Just kidding people

Really hoping that there will be an NMS convention....

THANK YOU to all of the people who defended the nature of this newsletter.

I'm sure many of us (myself incl.) posted our specific & personal views
over quality & trust ON OUR OWN. Our individual opinions merged in issue
#560, and there's a real concern in there; a community of (mostly) sen-
sible people.

Without e-mailing all of the people with commendable pride who have posted
their good-willed beliefs, I'll herein thank a few who have helped to restore
my faith in this newsletter:

Luis Arturo Loyo Delgado
	I almost misread your ORQ as "If I could wave my magic wand, I'd

AND... the perseverant couple of people who continue those enormous threads
on the meaning of Xanadu as if all of this negatively toned bickering were
so much spam.

It's good to sense that I'm not the only one with the solid integrity and
common good-sense to speak up over the recent perversity. Now let's continue
this newsletter thing as planned, eh?

<A NAME="561010">Subject: tickets, other stuff</A>

    How's it going everyone. I just wanted to contribute to the ticket thread
and basically emphasize the points made by other people here. My experience
is probably less than that of older Rush fans, but what I can tell you is:
    1) Camping out is probably the best way to get _a chance_ for good seats,
that is, if you don't know anyone at the arena, have no connections, or what
ever. Here in Maryland, there are quite a few Ticketbastard outlets. The
lines at each vary from concert to concert. However, a good idea is to get
there early and run a list, if you have the time, energy, and willingness to
do it. I was fortunate in having a friend who had an Aerostar, so, the night
before, we packed that thing full of sleeping bags, chips, soda (and other
beverages), a football, a frisbee, those stupid velcro-ball things, a box
and all our Rush CDs. It was a fun night. However, the ticket sale date was
the same as the Dead, so there were some problems as the Dead tickets went on
Rush tickets at 10. So, around 10, we were getting worried that all the Dead
heads would not be done buying. As a matter of fact, we got into somewhat
of a dispute with the guy who was runnning the Dead list. MORAL: if you are
camping out, get there early as you can, cause it fills up fast. If you are
running a list, make sure you let people know that you are, have check-ins,
or whatever.
    Also, I have heard that it is best to camp out at arenas, rather than
ticket outlets. This makes sense, but not always possible. Who wants to
spend a night in SE D.C., for example?
    Also, buying tickets in smaller numbers gets you closer. I was in line, and
the people in front of me (I was #3 on this occasion) got a block of 8, and
the seats turned out to be mediocre, so, instead of buying 4 like I planned, I
only got 2, and my seats were good. The reason is, that larger blocks are less
available in the front obviously because more people get seats there and they
fill up fast. So deep-six that scalping idea and go for the good seats.
    If you're camping out at a mall, watch out for mall security. They can be
annoying. I have met the most lenient and the strictest. You just have to
know how to deal with them.
    Lastly, if a local radio station is giving away tickets, GO FOR IT!!!!
I have won quite a few pairs to various concerts, and the seats are excellent
(seeing as how the station probably reserves them before they go on sale) and
they are FREE!!!! Makes you feel a lot better about buying that $29 T-shirt!
   2) What was #1???

    Happy ticket hunting!!!!

<A NAME="561011">Subject: Missed the point on the rumors</A>

Some of you missed the point on the Neil rumors. The person who posted
the rumors said that he saw polaroids of a naked Neil with his bike
standing next to another man. Now, isn't this out of character for
Neil to do this? Why would he jeopardize his career, and more importantly,
his private life by doing this? I don't think many women would be secure
in their husband's bisexuality. Plus, the poster said he drove out of
his way to confirm these rumors. Why did he do this? Would a Rush fan
do this and then report back to other Rush fans on his findings? I don't
think so, a Rush fan wouldn't care, and anyway, he wouldn't want to
cause trouble on this list. Therefore, I must conclude that he is a Rush
hater, and wanted to stir things up on this list with false rumors. One
could make another conclusion about this poster, but I don't want to
get/cause any trouble. Draw your own conclusions.

So, if this rumor is false, there is no need to discuss the right or wrong
of homosexuality because whatever your belief, you will offend some
subscribers.

    A few days ago I was looking at the old music mags that were forgotten
in a closet.  While staring at the "Musician" mag (Printed in USA, July 1984)
I found a page of album reviews named as "ROCK Short Takes" and the author
was named J.D. Considine.  The reason I'm writing all this is Rush's Grace
Under Pressure was one of the albums that was reviewed by this gentleman!
His review on GUP was the shortest of the thirteen albums.  For those who
didn't read the infamous review, I will type it down, I guess he was in a
bad mood that day, or maybe it was ten minutes before he commited suicide
when he wrote the review for GUP.  And he goes like that:

   "In a dozen albums, Rush has gone from mindlessly imitating Led Zeppelin
    to carefully copying The Police.  That's progress for you."

Yes, which was my point. I've been arguing that this is the case, while
Tadd has been arguing that this `concept' was added by Neil. It's clear
to me that Neil's interpretation is the correct (i.e. _intended_)
interpretation (at the literal level) of Coleridge's poem.

The word `entrapped' is not used if that's what you mean. But one can do
some straightforward `deduction' (in the sense of Sherlock Holmes rather
than in the sense of applying _modus ponens_ (a=>b) ). Which is what I
did in my original post: if one is to circle Khan he must be fixed in
place; if he's powerful and fixed he must be trapped.

Quite.

Really? Do you have an _argument_ for this belief? It is silly to say
that poets and lyricists intend to say only what is literally obvious
to the average first-grader. They may not discourage people from
searching for interpretations (as that is essential to the way poetry
functions), but there are clearly intendend interpretations beyond such
simplistic "objective facts."

Holmes-style deduction is quite straightforward and not particularly
unique to my psychology. In this sense there _is_ a correct interpretation
despite despite the need for a little common sense input. Of course one
should always be looking for better interpretations which might defy

over interpretations so as to find the intended (aka correct) interpretation.

One of my friends said that the song is a confession of homosexuality :)
Neil must be gay, etc. It's just that Coleridge didn't know it was a
poem about Neil. Lack of sensible background assumptions is just what
makes alot of poetic interpretation 'a load of dingo's kidneys' to coin
a phrase (not). Some poets may write without intending to transmit any
particular meaning, but these are definitely in the minority and Coleridge
is not one of them.

It's nice for everyone to give his own interpretation but that doesn't
mean that all are correct or intended by the author. Unless of course
you don't mind my (male, and hypothetical) friend's interpretation that
the my friend is Khan and that the woman is Neil, etc.

Especially during the 1960s. John Cage's 4'33'' springs to mind.

It has been said so it must be true, eh? This is true only if it is
the author's intention to make the work ambiguous in this way. I see
no reason to believe Coleridge adopted this approach to his work.
"Kubla Khan" was composed in semi-consciousness and truncated because
its writing down was destructively disrupted. Some vaguaries can be
attributed to this fact, but not to any attempt at ambiguity. The
only clear ambiguity is that there are both literal and figurative
levels to the poem.

This is an interpretation best suited to Van Halen's ``Pleasure Dome''.
It's quite obvious to anyone with common sense that this interpretation
applies in the VH case. (The opening chords to VH's "PD" are quite
reminiscent of Rush's "Xanadu"). Also Eddie's father died of alcholism
and Eddie has been to rehab. In the Van Halen case this allegorical
interpretation is correct.

	I thought I'd discuss the legalities of making this TNMS CD people
want to do.  As producer of the Yes rarities collection, I think I'm qualified
to point out a few things... (also, my girlfriend's father is a lawyer with
fraud)

	IF we put this CD together, and distribute it for basically the price
of making the CD, lesser legal charges will be brought down upon the person
distributing it.  IF you put this together to make a profit, you're treading
on real thin ice there.

	This, of course, depends on the possibility that Rush finds out what
we're doing, and if they want to press charges.  To tell you the truth, the
band probably will do very little.  They know this list exists (I believe),
and they've done little to check up on us anyway.

	Basically, if we make this CD, distribute it ONLY to members not for
profit, but only for the cost of making it, we won't get into legal trouble
(odds are).  One thing I want to mention is that I had thought of doing the
Yes rarities on CD, but it only holds 80 min. max, but a chrome tape holds
90 min, adding an extra 10 minutes.  Of course, I live in the stone age
anyway, since I own no CD's....

GREAT STORY!  this one, however, was a bit too plausible....  :-)

seriously, I do have one comment (that I haven't seen mentioned yet)
that I'd like to direct at everyone who's even marginally believed this
Neil at gay bar cr*p --- don't assume that just because you see it in a
photo that it's real....it's easier than you think to be, uhhh, creative.

I do some photography, and one thing I can certainly tell you is that
once you leave the ``point and shoot'' game (most people with a camera)
and get into serious photography, you find that reality is more what you
*DECIDE TO MAKE IT* than what really exists.  I've got some shots of a
sunset where the sky and sun are green.  I've got some shots of this
really incredibly foggy day...except there was no fog that day....  I
could go on with lots more examples (but I won't).  we won't even begin
to go into things like multiple-image filters, motion filters,
double-exposure filters, mirage filters, and so on.....

now, that's all done with simple filters --- once you get into the
darkroom (I've never done darkroom work, but my dad has for years), you
can pretty much do whatever the h*ll you want to.  you want to splice
Neil's face onto the body of, say, a monkey?  you can do it.  you might
need to diffuse the image a bit (perhaps use a heavy diffusion filter
for both originals), do a little alteration on the colors, etc., to
blend the images, but it can be done.

in other words, just because someone says they saw it in a photograph
(I'll be nice and give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that
they really believe they saw this) doesn't mean that the image shown in
the photo ever *REALLY* happened.  just because these people who had
this photo also claim he really was there, doesn't mean it's true.

the sky and sun are green.  I say it's true (well, for the moment let's
just pretend that I say it's true), and I've got a photograph to prove
it.  anyone care to disagree with me?  remember, I have proof....  :-)

actually, I just got another neat idea --- how does this sound:  the
sky and the SUNS (both of them) are purple....  not too complex to do,
but should look neat!

ok, on to another topic.....  TNMS t-shirts!

I particularly like this one, since I'm about to move back down South
(Florida, to be exact), and my dad's already told me that one of the
very first things I'm going to be responsible for when I get there is
make a new net (the net my dad had made for me got trashed a few weeks
ago by someone who'd never thrown from this bridge before) and then
spend a rather large amount of time down at the bridge to stock up on
mullet for the winter, when they're not running.  ah, the hardships of
life, I tell ya....  going fishing every morning and every evening....
I wonder how I'll manage...to hold out till I get there. :-)

seriously, though, I like that one (but then, Destin is basically a
fishing village, so I'm biased).

yet another topic.....this is the last one, I promise!

actually, I also hear a *LOT* of old (well, fairly old) Styx in there,
as well as more than a little bit of jazz influence (on some charts, at
least).  there's one on IaW that, for a while, always reminded me of an
old Spyro Gyra chart.  of course, once I started trying to determine
which DT chart it was (I never hear this anymore now that I'm listening
for it), and which SG chart it reminded me of, I can't seem to work it
out.  :-(  it's something off of SG's ``Access All Areas'' though, that
much I do know.

oh well, this post is long enough, and I've got things to do to get
ready to move....

Well, the main reason I complained was that there were four of us waiting,
and ONE of us did get two (of four) tickets on the floor (about 1/2-way back).
Unfortunately, our group wanted to sit together, so we, or he, gave the two
floor tickets to a couple of ppl we were buying tickets for (pretty damned
generous, eh?)....  I also tried going to an obscure ticket outlet (well, it
was in Wilmington, DE.. I consider that obscure, anyway)... I was something
like 10th in line there.. however, they didn't even HAVE any floor tickets...
Actually, I think my problem is where I'm going... the Spectrum (Philly) must
have some weird system for distributing tickets :)
     Oh yeah... another problem was that this was the 1st night for Vinnie
Moore, who is from Philly, and therefore bought out a section of the floor...

One more thing... if people don't want to hear about Neil going or not going
to a gay bar, don't complain about it on here!  You're just adding to the
problem, not solving it... you wanna do something about it, complain to the
poster in email....  Spend your NMS space on something more valuable... like
a response to my question a few digests ago about The Big Money which either
EVERYONE ignored, or NO ONE has an answer... or, of course, no one cares :)

I heard this on the radio on the way home from work last night...

I'm doing this from memory so this is just a paraphrase.  The DJ said that
Alex recently was given a ride in a fighter jet (sorry, can't remember which
type of fighter jet).  The Canadian military wanted to use "Where's My Thing?"
sound track for a promotional video and the band said yes with the condition
that Alex gets a ride.  The ride lasted about a half hour and they went through
several manuevers and battle simulations (sounds like fun to me!).  There were
more details of the flight but I can't remember the specifics.

The DJ also mentioned that this information was "released" in Seattle and
that the band had recently spent some time there.  Anyone know what they
were doing in Seattle?  Was Neil with them or was it just Geddy and Alex (like
usual)?

First, a question to those who have the ASoH video:
	I used to be a percussionist, and after listening to Neil's solo on
ASoH I am absolutely amazed.  Would someone out there who has seen the video
version of this (obstarving-college-studentq) please tell me what all he's
playing?  I'm pretty sure Geddy is probably hitting the horn kicks towards
the end, but the parts with what sound like timpani and wooden bells (don't
remember the name) are really cool and would seem a little tough to play 
while from a set....

Regarding the T-shirt quote, I personally like

Geeez!  I never thought I'd have to rehash 9th grade English to make this
point.  When I posted this, I figured all the following went without saying:
(1st of all, Gregg, consult your dictionary on the meanings of metaphor and
 simile.  For the rest of you folks, if you know this, please ignore.)

_Webster's New World_ defines SIMILE as
   "A figure of speech in which one thing is likened to another, dissimilar
    thing by the use of *like*, *as*, etc. (e.g., a heart as big as a whale...)"

_Thorndike-Barhhart_ concurs, adds examples:
   "as brave as a lion,  as hard as nails"
    ^^       ^^          ^^      ^^
(Everyone knows that when using such similies, like saying, "his head is as
 hard as a rock," there's no implication that an actual *rock* is involved!)

It seemed to me that
   "A savage place! as holy and enchanted As ever beneath ... demon-lover!"
                    ^^                    ^^
was a simile.  (Note the telltale placement of subject, adjective(s), etc.)

I admit that this is hard to see because of the complex run-on clause that
Coleridge likens the "savage place" to.  However, (similar to the above
stated "rock,") just because the "waning moon," "woman," or "demon-lover"
are *mentioned* DOES NOT necessarily mean they existed, IMO.

Also note that Coleridge says "By woman wailing," NOT "By A woman wailing,"
which appears to me to further imply a general statement, not one that applies
to a *specific* woman.

You certainly put a lot of stock in Beer.  (But wouldn't we all like to keep
a large stock of beer :-)
Reasons provided. --> but hey, I'm not saying you are *wrong*; just that all
this is open, and will ALWAYS be open, to artistic interpretation.

It all makes me think:  if we can't even agree on something as apparently
*objective* as what a simile and metaphor are, then it seems pointless that
we are even arguing.  I'd really like to get out of all this bickering.

As far as I'm aware, the signal deterioration is insignificant for
digital copies, unless the tape is very bad and the error correction
can't cope, or a *very* large number of copies are made. By that, I
mean far more copies than even professionals realistically need to

Some of this will be out of date...

A small tip to those new to ftp: remember to use the binary command
before getting the files. I forgot, and so only one of them was
readable by WinGif. A second attempt was more successful.

I liked the star better as a logo. You can put anything you like
on the back tho. "Born to Rush" sounds good!

Is there any chance of getting them by mail order? I'm in the UK,
and unless a meeting can be arrange over here, a few Brits are
going to miss out.

Why not make special NMS stickers? When you make them yourselves,
you can put whatever you like on them, tho I like the idea of using
other people's stickers! I'm an old Blue Peter victim (for those
who know the show - was that the BP elephant in RTB? (-: ).

T-shirts and stickers can help to identify people at concerts, so
I say: don't restrict them to a select few. I was recently at a
books signing that I *know* was attended by many people I've met
electronically, but I couldn't identify them. This would be tragic
at a Rush concert, tho the number of people would be a couple of
magnitudes larger...at least.

Just catching up...I see that you *will* be using the star.
Excellent! Same for the mail order. Use any colour, as I don't
mind. Usually, I either go for an all black or an all white
background. Thanks.

Oh, and thanks to rush-mgr for resending #556. I must've been one

it sounded like a real treat, and well deserved too.
