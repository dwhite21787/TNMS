IMPORTANT PLEASE READ!!!

Well, I come back to find that syrinx's mail server is down for repair.
So if you've been sending anything into the digest, it's probably bounced
by now (if not, it will in a few days).

I've decided to finally move the digest over to its permanent home at 
tnms.com. So please pay attention to the posting and admin addresses
(the same, just to tnms.com instead of syrinx.umd.edu) and start using 'em!
This will probably be the only digest for a few days, until people start
using the new address.

Here they are, just to repeat:

<A NAME="2075002">Subject: Rush dreams</A>

In hopes of lightening up the mood around here, I thought I'd pick up on 
someone's recent thread about weird Rush dreams.  Since 1981, I was hot into 
Rush.  My first concert had been when I was fifteen, after the release of MP, 
and although I didn't know who they were when I went to the concert (can you 
believe this?) after it I ran out and bought all their albums.  That's a story 
for another time.  

So I'm immersing myself in Rush, learning to play their songs on guitar, 
eating and sleeping Rush, getting more turned on by Geddy's bass lines and 
Neil's drumming than by Alex's playing (o well).  This was a few months 
before the release of Signals.  One night I dreamt about a song, and I 
actually remembered the tune and the words of the refrain.  I woke up singing, 
"....but I worry about you..."  No idea what the hell it was, of course.  A 
few months later, driving around with my boyfriend, I hear this song on the 
radio with "my" refrain in it, and they back-announce, "....that was the new 
release from RUSH!"

WHOAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Pretty cool, huh?  Anyone else?

<A NAME="2075003">Subject: My favorite albums</A>

Hi Rushians,
	I'd just thought I'd give you my idea of the best rush albums from best
to worst.

1. 2112(of course) 2. A Farewell To Kings(Cygnus X-1 rocks) 3.
Hemispheres(so does Hemispheres) 4. All The World's A Stage 5. Exit...
Stage Left 6. A Show Of Hands 7. Moving Pictures 8. Fly By Night 9.
Permanent Waves 10. Caress Of Steel 11. Rush(including Not Fade Away/
You Can't Fight It) 12. Test For Echo 13. Counterparts 14. Signals
15. Roll The Bones 16. Grace Under Pressure 17. Power Windows 18. Hold
Your Fire

	You probably noticed that I didn't include Presto. That's because it's
the only album I don't have. In case of those of you who are wondering
why I put the albums from the 80's last, it's because that since I'm 14,
I'm not too crazy about that 80's style (synthesizer age) kind of music.
I like their stuff from 73-81 the most (even though I'm a 90's teenager)
because I like music from the Hard Rock Era of the late 60's to early
80's. 
	By the way, I don't think that Rush will break up anymore. I figured,
why should Neil quit the band and give up drumming. Then he'll think
"We'll I quit my career and I gave up drumming. Now what am I supposed
to do." He'll probably get over it (just like after his daughter died.)
We all get over things like this. We have to learn to accept it. He has
no reason to end it all.

I just finished writing some new music, and went to QFC (Quality Food
Centers) here in Seattle.  I was just about the only one in there, it was 
late at night (but before midnight) and the guys were all stocking the 
shelves, where I purchased some tasty Raisin-Bran (ON SALE!) and some oh so
rewarding Grape-Nutz. As I enter the store, I hear none other than 'In The
Mood'... I thought it appropriate as I was truly very hungry, and could not 
wait to consume the said food products.

I hummed and even sang just a little, but only to the ice cream.

I am sure that this was discussed and maybe grew tired by the NMSers, but
what does everyone think occurs in the song "The Camera Eye"  after
"unique to every city's streets....(drum roll)..."  I think Ged burps and
says "oh boy."  Actually I don't think that, but I use to.  Let's start a
thread, what did people think it was?  Be credible, don't say "Paddy
cake, paddy cake" or anything.

My friend thinks he burps and says "god d**n!"

Serious note:  In the faq it says that there is a soundbyte of Clark Kent
from Superman, where is it?  Is that what the blurb is?

On WHME Fort Wayne Indiana, on Bob Enyart Live ( A christian talk show),
Rush was played before and after going to commercials breaks.  He has also
played Pink Floyd during his show.  Songs he played were Subdivisions,
Anthem, Roll The Bones, Closer To The Heart, and Big Money.  There were
more but I missed some of the show.  These were just samples of the songs too.

I for one would prefer to see the live performances of the music.

For Neil Peart, obviously a pretty introverted personality, losing loved ones
like that must be next to impossible to deal with.
I'm a pretty introverted personality myself and if I lost my wife and
daughter, I'd call it quits.

In fact, if Rush calls it quits, I'll be happy for them.  I love the band SO
much, they have changed my life in ways I can't begin to describe...
and if they say enough is enough, I support them.  Honestly, I wish they don't
but I think it's a great possibility right now.

Thanks, that's all

<A NAME="2075009">Subject: Tom Sawyer on Toy Soldiers</A>

Hello All,

I just picked up the soundtrack cd for Toy Soldiers (haven't seen the movie
yet).  There is a re-mixed Tom Sawyer as the second to last song.

After listening to it twice, this song is starting to grow on me.  I don't
dislike the original version, but I've heard it so many times, it's certainly
not my first choice.  I don't think the remix will be everyone's cup of tea,
but at least it's better than a bunch of 'hair' musicians butchering up Rush's
work.  It isn't a 'dance' remix, although the beat has certainly changed to a
more mortal one.  The remixer has also done some interesting things with
Geddy's voice.

As for the rest of the soundtrack, I've listened to it once and don't remember
anything in particular standing out except for the original version of War
after Tom Sawyer.

In other semi-Rush related news, I tried to buy 'Stunt' the latest from
Barenaked Ladies, not to be found-sold out at two circuit cities and a best
buy.  I think they'll be high up on Entertainment Weekly's chart next week.

Something I have been waiting for, to happen this century: Seeing Geddy, 
Alex and Neil's names in the credits of a movie. "Tom Sawyer" is played 
very briefly in "Small Soldiers" but hey --they finally were included in 
a major motion picture soundtrack. :-)

I work at a discount bookstore and a shipment of "Shock Rock II" books
came in.  This book  has the stroy "Drumbeats" by Neil Peart and Kevin
Anderson.

If you want a copy, I'll send it to you for at cost (I'll make no money
on it--I respect RUSH fans that much) which would be $2.75 + tax
(total=$2.92) and whatever the S&H charges will be on it.  Just e-mail me
and I'll give you details.  I got five copies only--first come, first
serve. 

I'm still hoping for "The Masked Rider" to come in;  we get a lot of
Canadian publisher's books.

Paul,
Nice job on the Rush covers list.  There's one more, as of about 1 month ago.
It's an EP by Liquid Gang.  They're sort of Guns'n'Roses-ish.  They covered
Working Man.  Pretty straightforward version.  The verses insturmentation is
slightly acoustic-electric, but still pretty hard rock sounding.  I think they
deviated from the lead guitar just a bit also.  If you want this CD, you can
have it for what I paid + postage = $15.  I forget the title of the CD at the
moment.

I went to see the BSO at the Minnesota Zoo in Apple Valley last Friday.  The 
show was incredible.  If you like Big Band, Swing, SKA, or Rockabilly, don't 
miss out when they come to your town.  They were selling the new CD "Dirty 
Boogie" at the show, and I was surprised to see it was produced by Peter 
Collins, "G/P" Producer.  They even included a new studio version of the Stray 
Cats "Rock This Town" on the new CD.

Opening act "Big Rude Jake" was also good.  Jake is from Canada, and the 
other four members were from Manhattan (according to their T-shirt Sales 
Girl.)

I listened to a rush bootleg the other day called "Freefall" and it had a
song I've never heard about.  It was called "Badboy." Can somebody confirm
that this is just a cover song or something else.

   [ Cover of a Beatles song, which I was told a while ago was yet ANOTHER
     cover, but of course I don't remember the original artist.   
     Oh well, one of these days I'll actually write these things down!

Also, for those who might know the answer, I have noticed that their has
been alot of reference to the color RED over the years by Rush.  For
instance The Red Star in 2112/Red Barchetta/Red Sector A/ Red Tide/ Color
Red/Hold Your Fire Album Cover/ and possibly more.  My theory ties it into
the 2112 concept, but I'm just not sure.  Please make some feedback.
Here's another question I have.  Does anybody know Ged/Alex/Neil's beer of
choice?  I know Bob & Doug McKenzie's is Elzinor. (By the way, has anybody
heard if they're ever going to come out with another movie?)

First of all, I don't know what motivates people under this digest to
flame rush mgr. It seems to me that she has done  much for the cause than
anyone else and this work is tiresome. For whatever reasons there are, I
think as  mature adults and great "Rush Fans", we can find much better
ways to express  own's opinions. Make opinions constructive. Would you
talk to your boss the same way? Anyway, if you agree with this why don't
you send her a cyber dozen of roses?

If I had asked this question about "Limelight", over 99% of you will
respond with correct interpretation about the song. For those who wants
dig really deep into Jackie Taylor's death, maybe Neil had foreseen this
when he wrote the lyrics???? 

Peace for JT and Neil's familes.

I know that someone mentioned that TS is played in Small Solders.  Well,
guess what...I saw a preview for the new Adam Sandler movie, "Waterboy"
and they played Tom Sawyer!  I could hardly believe it.  At first I
thought, "Well the person was wrong, s/he thought that it was in Small
Solders but it's really in Waterboy."  To my surprise, It was/is in both!
Is there some big thing going on with Tom lately?  Why did two movies both
use the same song?
In the 'I wonder' category, I wonder what Rush feels about it.

In what seems to be a common practice these days, there is another movie
trailer featuring Tom Sawyer.  It is for the new Adam Sandler flick, "The
Waterboy" and features about a minute of the song, including vocals.  Has
Hollywood embraced Rush as the voice of a new generation?

   [ Good question. I saw the same trailer (before "Lethal Weapon 4")
     Two movies in two months, both using Rush, BOTH using the same song,

As I listen through my RUSH CD collection these past few days a few things
come to mind relating to Neil's most recent loss:  I tune into certain
songs I have played when tragedy has struck in my life and reflect on how a
dealt with those times.  Afterimage gets alot of play when any death
occurs.  Marathon was in heavy rotation when my 2 month old niece died in
Sept. '86.  Available Light and Presto were constantly being played when my
Dad got sick in '94 and when he finally succumbed to heart and lung disease
in Feb. '97.  The point being, if there is one, I am grateful the band
created music that has moved me enough to be part of my own grieving
process.

My hope for Neil and his family is simple; that they find strength to go on
with their own lives as best they can.

I feel bad for Neil's loss. What else can I say? To dwell on it and
snowball it into threads and flamefests is something that needs to be
avoided at all costs, PLEASE :-) I see it brewing already. Hoping not to
sound rude: Let's give it a rest, out of respect for those whose concern
it really is.

In non-Rush related news, I got two Catherine Wheel CD's last week _Adam
and Eve_ and _Happy Days_. I haven't had much time to listen to them
yet. "Judy Staring at the Sun" was a song that caught my ear a couple
years ago. BTW, I'm sure most of you know that Catherine Wheel injects a
little tribute to Rush of their own at the end of the _Like Cats and
Dogs_ CD. Not bad.

I haven't kept up with much of the newer "progressive" type music coming
out. I think some songs I've heard on the radio by I Mother Earth and
Third Eye Blind have been OK. Any suggestions for a fellow Rushian
looking to buy a couple new CD's? Someone should have a "Rush fan's
guide to non-Rush music", keeping it up to date with reviews and latest
releases.

Courage Classic. It is a bicycle tour that covers 150 miles over 
three days over the weekend of July 17-19, up in the mountains around 
Leadville and Dillon.  Participants collect pledges, which are then 
donated to Children's Hospital.

You can gather more info by contacting the Tour itself at (303)-456-
9704 or email at cclassic@aol.com.

I am still collecting pledges. If anyone who recieves this is 
interested, please email me at kdaf39b@prodigy.com. 

As we all know, Neil is an avid cyclist. It was his enthusiasm that 
inspired me to take it up. Think of it--Mountain air, ESL in your 
Discman and a way to channel your thoughts and energy in a way that 
will benefit you (your body will love you and vice versa) and people 
who you don't even know. Way cool.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to meet all of you there!!

Hey... yo... whats up...

I work in a video store here in Michigan, and I found a movie called "Incident
at Channel Q".  It's an early 80's B flick that has numerous rock bands'
videos included in the film, and Body Electric is one such vid.  Look it up if
you can, but don't order it, because then you're just much better off getting
that video compilation  (The Camera Eye?  I think its called)

Hi folks,

Long time no write.

Before a matinee screening of Lethal Weapon 4 at my local theater
yesterday, there was a preview for an upcoming Adam Sandler flick called
"The Water Boy".  Background music for this preview included Instrumental
parts of "Tom Sawyer", with two lines of Ged's vocals during the credits.

I'm not sure, but I think this is the only time I've ever heard Rush
during a movie trailer.  Anyone else?

Hi Rushians,
         Rush has released all of their albums on vinyl. I would love to
get my hands on Rush's '73 single "Not Fade Away/You Can't Fight It."
They only made it on vinyl, but I wish that they would re-release it on
cd. It would save us a lot of time looking for it on vinyl, and it would
save us a lot of money. I'm not too crazy about plunking down $300 for a
7" vinyl with only 2 songs on it (unless of course I bought it from an
idiot who doesn't know how much it's worth.)
         By the way, I heard somewhere that Rush has a rareties record.
Has anybody else heard of this?

they've had their second Rush reference in as many episodes.

<A NAME="2075027">Subject: Rush is selection of the month</A>

 I belong to the BMG music club and thiws months selection is "Rush 
retrospective I and II". There is a short write up on the band and what's 
on the two CD's which is transposed below.

Selected by Senior Music Editor Bruce Imber

  "Progressive Rock" had it's share of milestone bands, but among the prime 
innovators- ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, Genesis- only Canada's Rush has kept it's 
core lineup intact for over two decades. Bassist/Vocalist Geddy Lee, 
Guitarist Alex Lifeson and Drummer Neil Peart form one of the tightest 
units in Rock, a crack outfit that has it's chops down cold. When a band 
has this kind of staying power, it's well worth a look back to hear why 
they've remained on top for so long.
   Compiled from all 12 of Rush's 1974-1987 studio releases, the 
"Retrospective" albums are valuable for two reasons: 1)They're the first 
Rush compilations to be supervised by the band members themselves; 2)Each 
track has been selected from the recently remastered versions of the 
original releases, ensuring premium sound quality. And with over 75 minutes 
of music per disc, together they make up one of the strongest "Best of" 
sets available from any band.
    Each individual disc represents a distinctive era in Rush's career, the 
first volume covering the years 1974-1980, the second taking us from 1981 
through 1987. While the earlier tracks take their cue from the Cream- 
Zeppelin camp, Rush soon found it's own voice, which fully crystallized 
with the one-two punch of 1976's landmark concept album "2112", and on the 
lyrical depth of expansive hits like Closer to the Heart, The Spirit of 
Radio and Freewill. Moving from hit tracks lie Limelight and Tom Sawyer 
(from the quadruple-platinum "Moving Pictures") through the 
synthesizer-driven Subdivisions and The Big Money, "Retrospective II" 
brings the 80's era to a close with more personal new ventures like Time 
Stand Still and Mission.
    Beyond the mind-boggling instrumental prowess, tricky time signatures 
and larger-than-life lyrical themes, "Retrospective II & II" witness Rush 
moving beyond Progressive Rock flag-bearers into the role of a time-tested 
Rock legend.

Rush creates music that is bigger than life, dazzling in it's technological 
feats... It's like a sonic video game.- The New York Times

I think I'm getting to write again to the NMS for a while...

Anyway, last Friday afternoon, the rock radio station here in Albany
played the new version of Tom Sawyer, from the "Small Soldiers"
soundtrack.  It is cool, even though is kinda mainstream.  Well, what
do you expect, Tom Sawyer is Rush's biggest hit song (I think), and
the song is perfect for the movie.  It's about time movie producers
use Rush songs for their movies!!!

This will make me go to the theaters and watch Small Soldiers... It's
not like Armageddon, where Aerosmith probably had an exclusivity
contract in the soundtrack.

Greetings fellow Rush freaks,

     This may actually be on par to tasting forbidden fruit or
something like that, but I'm damn curious.  I mean, we're all big time
Rush fans here.  That much is pretty evident.  We all have our
favorite songs, mine being greats such as "Red Barchetta", "The Camera
Eye", "Natural Science", "The Trees",etc., I could go on all day.  How
about those Rush songs which simply don't cut the mustard?  My
personal choice for least favorite song would have to be "The Speed of
Love" from CP.  This is Rush at their weakest.  A pretty bland all
around effort from the boys.  Any other opinions, people?

Hi!
I loved Al Willig's post, "Debatable Topics".  He brought up questions
that we all should be asking ourselves.

Al said:

I've been reading for a couple of years, and you're right.  There's good
issues and bad issues, and they seem to be cyclical, as so much of life
is.  Frankly, the positive posts are usually around the time of a new
release or tour.  Once the excitement wears off, we go back to
bickering.  :(

I know this will sound stupid, but I hadn't thought of it in that way.
It's almost a freeing thought, knowing you can say whatever, without
worrying about being callous or insensitive (not that Neil would care
what any of us have to say anyway).  I'm not saying we should go in for
a free-for-all gossipfest, but this is a digest for the discussion of
the band, whatever that may entail.  For me, I like to keep it
work-oriented, with occasional dips into their personal lives when it
will affect their work.

Exactly.  I really, really, want another album by them, but if they
don't put one out, well, I have all of their other stuff to listen to.
And like you said, we did get An Evening with Rush, which would be one
helluva swan song.

> Is it ok to say that one song or another is not enjoyed, skippable, what
> have you?

Yes!!!  The debate of best/worst or must hear/skippable has really
helped me "hear" the music or lyrics on certain songs.  Someone will
post their opinion, and then I'll go back and listen for what they were
talking about.  I appreciate Rush's songs even more because of these
debates.

> ...I don’t necessarily want to debate this

Yeah.  It makes differing opinions more palatable if there is some
backup to what one says.  We don't need dissertations, just a sentence
or two explaining why.

> Anyway, I think it’s possible to discuss/debate without the bickering.

Yeah!

<A NAME="2075036">Subject: Review of "Small Soldiers"</A>

I just wrote this review for my Rush website and thought I would share it with
y'all:

REVIEW OF "SMALL SOLDIERS" From a Rush Fan's Perspective.

The past year has shown us a growing trend of remixing the rock songs that
appear in a movie for just a few seconds and then putting them on a soundtrack
in their remixed form. Since I've already been exposed to this current
phenomenon, I was not suprised when I went to see "Small Soldiers". Granted,
to hear "Tom Sawyer" on the silver screen was not the only reason why I went
to see this film. From the promotions, "Small Soldiers" looked like a neat
little movie to go see. But the reason why I went to the movie on opening day
was to satisfy my curiosity as to how the film would handle the song.

As I had suspected, there was only a small snippet of Sawyer in this film. If
you end up having a sneezing fit for a few seconds you can easily miss it.
"Tom Sawyer" only appears via the heroin's headphones as she talks on the
phone. So all you really get is a muffled Sawyer...but it least it is the
studio version (I think). I stayed through the credits and they never did play
Sawyer again. Oh well...it was still a fun movie to see and I recommend it.

Later that day, I went by a local CD store that allows people to listen to
CDs. I listened to this remix of "Tom Sawyer" because I needed that fix. I was
honestly not that impressed with it, or I would have bought the soundtrack (I
ended up purchasing the "Burning for Buddy" CD that Neil produced as a tribute
to drummer Buddy Rich. WOW! Great CD!). All that these remixers did was remove
the drum track <insert blood curdling scream here> and add some rap beats and
new sounds. I would have liked the remix a lot more if they had been more
creative with it. They basically just changed it enough to be annoying, not
interesting. I do declare that the remixed version of "Tom Sawyer" is a
wonderful example of how important Neil Peart is to Rush. You know the
saying..."if it ain't baroque, don't fix it". In this case..."if it is Rush,
then leave that thing alone".

Note: NOT A NOTE-FOR-NOTE COVER.  1) I don't believe in note-for-note

G'day all,

Well it took about 3 or 4 issues before the freaks started crawling out
from under their rocks.  I'm talking about those who cut and paste the
comments from the posts of others concerning Neil's wife and use them to
"score points".

It is a natural response by many to post their feelings about this tragic
event.  We should all be aware that this is part of a grieving process -
even if the grief that is felt is for Neil.  I think that this is as useful
a forum as any to do this, and we should all exercise the right to scroll
down or use the page down key if we don't want to read it. If you didn't
expect to see these messages appearing on the NMS, then I think you might
have been deceiving yourself. When you stop and think about the
implications for future Rush projects, talk about anything else seems
rather immaterial at the moment.

But if you want to use this material as a way to score points by belittling
others then read the title of my post!!  Just back off and give people time
to react - who cares whether you or I agree or disagree with what has been
said.  Form your own opinion and keep it to yourself rather than berating
others.

More importantly...

Having spent a few years working on cancer research, I can tell you that
there are plenty of worthwhile organisations that would be very thankful to
receive donations and/or help of any kind.  Different countries will have
different organisations, so it would be useless for me to list any of them
here. If you feel a genuine need to contribute or donate to these
organisations that help fund basic cancer research or the treatment of
cancer patients then take a minute to look in your yellow pages - they
should all be listed. Your time and money will not be wasted, and greatly
appreciated.

Billy Oz...out.

Rush mgr - Why don't you ban the freaks that hassled you about not
releasing this news from the NMS, you will be doing ALL of us a favour.

>...I am slashing the price of my band's CD
[Electrum - Frames of Mind] to $5 - this includes
first-class shipping in the US - to all NMS and
alt.music.rush readers.

We are an instrumental progressive rock trio, that
formed through NMS postings about 2.5 years ago,
and have since self-released our debut disc.
The 63-minute program features complex arrangements
in Classical forms, rhythmic ensemble playing, and
abundant time-signature changes. If you're a fan
of the boys' 2112-Signals period, I think you will
enjoy at least some of it.

To take advantage of this offer, please visit:
http://nh.ultranet.com/~tomservo/geddy.htm

This is an annex page to our site that contains
audio files in streaming Real Audio and .mp3 formats
for six of the nine tracks, as well as an order form.
For the obvious reason, this page will be deleted
after July 29.

Take care,

Gino

Fender is finally shipping the Geddy Lee basses.  I had mine on order since
I found out about it in late January/early February and I got it last week.
It sounds and plays great but I like Jazz basses any way.  Any other opinions?
