Hello all!
	I can't believe how awesome the new album is. I haven't listened all
the way through, but from what I have heard so far, this is the best live
album I have heard. When I purchased DS I saw my brother coming in to buy it
to so that was cool since my earliest memory of listening to Rush were with
him. Take care!

	Just thought this would be interesting.  Steely Dan was passed over for
induction into the Hall of Fame, and they have devoted a whole web-page to
mocking the hall.  It starts out with a letter stating thier wishes to
donate some old Digital recording equipment.  Then they went on to explain
the conditions for which they would be inducted.  The Dan states that they
will only perform at their own induction for a fee of no less than
$380,000. (Mocking Neil Young, who boycotted because the Hall doesn't
reimburse performers.)  they also said they wanted total control over what
members from Steely Dan (there are quite a few.) could be inducted.
(mocking the Eagles who only wanted certain people in.)  Then they
discovered a long lost "Love Child", which she wasn't sure if her father
was Donald Fagen or Walter Becker, or even possibly one of the Eagles.
(Mocking Joni Mithchell who missed her induction because she was re-united 
with a daughter that she gave up for adoption.  All in all, it is very funny.
They have on the site numerous letters  to the director of the hall and
other people outlining their goofy demands, and other stuff.

I think it's all under "The hall of fame fiasco"

Is a school that's known to all;
Its specialty is winning,
And those Spartans play good ball;
Spartan teams are never beaten,
All through the games they fight;
Fight for the only colors,
Green and White.
Go right thru' for MSU
Watch the points keep growing.
Spartan teams are bound to win,
They're fighting with a vim.
RAH! RAH! RAH!
See their team is weakening,
We're going to win this game.
Fight! Fight! Rah! Team, Fight!
Victory for MSU.

Like I always say, If you can't have a good season, no one else should either.

<A NAME="2136005">Subject: Chicago Audience</A>

Hi Everybody!

Just a quick note on the state of mind of the audience in Chicago for the
World show. That show was the NIGHT AFTER the bulls won the championship
(again), so folks were in high spirits anyway. At one point Ged said: "I
promised myself I wouldn't make any obligatory Bulls comments." and the
crowd went wild. Perhaps that's part of the reason for the energy of the
show? I'm proud to have been a part of that audience.

As for the disk itself, I love the mix, and the sound of the instruments
themselves. Alex's guitars once again sound monstrous, and the performances
shine. I don't think I've EVER heard Geddy's voice being so strong and any
live recording.

Comments about the package:
Love the overall look, HATE the Hammersmith package separate from the main
one. The front cover is BRILLIANT. .....ahhhh, white space......
Can anyone read the song listing on the back of the booklet? Bad design
choice of that low-contrasting color and the real fine type. I'm a Hugh fan
(and a graphic designer), but this was an unexpected faux-pas.

Clusterworks comments:
Cool program! It sounds, judging from the first few comments that I've read,
that you need a fairly decent machine to run it on. I guess I'm lucky enough
to have one, so no complaints here.

bye for now everybody,
timmy

The fold out section of DS has some great memories.  As a forty something, I
got a big kick out of seeing the 2112 album.  What is especially cool about
Rush's records back then was the Mercury label with the skyscrapers.   

Even more nostalgic is the 8 track!  I remember that the 2112 8-track used to
click over to the next track right as Grand Finale got going!!   For those of
you who don't know about those dinosaur days,  an 8 track was engineered so
that the music slowly faded out, the track clicked (there were actually 4
tracks), and the song faded back up.  They tried to arrange things so that a
track's end was a song's end but it was not always possible.  Torture it was
for 2112 and definitely a different stage!

I was first in the non-existant line for DS on Tuesday morning. Does it
bother anyone else slightly that people are not lined up around the block???
Anyhow, A&B Sound here in Edmonton had it for $17.79 CANADIAN DOLLARS. For
those of you south of the border that equates to $11.21 if you factor in an
exchange of 0.63 on the dollar.

$11.21US.  I shook my head. And bought two. Just 'cause.

PS: Hey Derek Watson, any chance of you EVER fulfilling your half of the
tape exchange?

Well, that was absolutely awesome, eh?  What a package!!!  Even with the third
cd falling out... (the cure is to never remove it from your cd holder!)  I
made the mistake of opening the cd in the car while driving home from Best
Buys (heheh, I was the first at my local Best Buys.  Sat in the car for 10
minutes waiting for the store to open while listening to Yes' Closer to the
Edge on the A-Z countdown on my local radio station... pretty appropriate!).
The dedication gave me goosebumps.  Thanks Geddy for voicing our feelings to
Neil.

The Tinker toy monolith is a brilliantly powerful picture!   The tinker toy
almost looks symbolic of the return of the Elders, with the powerful status of
Rush's accomplishments descending from the sky, gathering the masses into a
frenzied storm, all waiting and cheering for the boys to finally arrive from
their different stages... Wow, what a Rush!  I had to drive faster just to get
home!  

 I had to turn the cd off at 2 different points just to get a hold of myself.
The perfection, clarity, and overall performances are just awesome!  Driven is
absolutely anthem material, (to the dude yelling during Ged's solo-- Wow, have
you had to change your underpants yet??? What a lucky man!)  and thankfully
Xanadu and Cygnus are not back to back or I would have been absolutely
paralyzed with awe.  The crispness, the power, the stars twinkling in the sky
during 2112  (was that even an outside show?)....  I'm still recovering.  What
a treat from the boys, eh?   To all the Chicago  TFE fans, man,  wow, what a
show!!  

What an accomplishment to the music industry this whole digitally recorded cd
is.   Top this!!  This is the recording and packaging style of all time to
beat!  The sound is just incredible.  The picture in front of the Hammersmith
alone could spark volumes of discussion... and their sense of humor and
nostalgia is wonderful!   
This cd should be by prescription only to make sure you're fit enough to take
it!  Fucking awesome!   Rush has always blown my mind, and this cd just takes
that all another step higher.      :)

Rush on people, 
Laurie

Dear All,

Well, for you UK fans out there who are starting to develop nervous 
ticks whenever anyone mentions the phrase 'release date', there is at 
least some consolation that in this week's issues of Kerrang and Metal 
Hammer there are highly complimentary reviews of DS.  Kerrang gave it 4 
K's out of 5, and said it was a 'fine addition to the Rush legend' - 
Metal Hammer were even more enthusiastic, awarding DS 10/10 and stating 
that this album should be 'handed out in schools all over the country, 
it's that bloody good!'

Well, hope that helps count down the hours till Monday,

Greg Sanderson

P.S. Also a reference to Rush in this week's Melody Maker, where the 
lead singer from Silver Sun mentions them as one of his faves.

Yes, I still have the MD cd available for trade. Besides those on my ad in
the Rush Trader section I also have an original CYGNUS (Prism Records 1000
limited edition) for trade. I would like to remind you that at this moment
I'm only looking for those cd's on my ad. However, please, let me know what

Holy Fucking Shit! Seriously, Holy Fucking Shit! This is EASILY the
best live album I've heard in my LIFE!!! All the songs sound better
than the studio version, and I do mean all of them! I like the
packaging, not so much the cardboard thing (I don't like that) but
rather the photography (like that picture of the pyro) and especially
the cover art on the the bonus disc. Haven't tried the Clusterworks
program, Don't have enough RAM, but my I can convince my brother to
let me try it on his. This album rocks, though. I fyou don't have it,
GET IT!!!

I'm a lucky boy!

Got Different Stages today (Thursday 12th) from a chap who imports all his
CD's from the USA. I paid £18.00 for the three CD's which I thought was not
bad considering that it will probably be around £25.00 in the usual rip-off
shops.

Any UK Rush Fans who want to save on the full asking price can contact a
good mail order company called GFT which is owned and run by a guy called
Malcolm Parker. He offers a remarkably good service and said that he would
doing DS for around £20.00. Look for www.gft-cyclops.co.uk or see the
advert in the back of 'Q' or Mojo.

Anyway........ DS Majorly ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 I thought the Dream Theater
CD had balls but DS is just so down deep dirty. I expected Eddie Vedder to
come in on vocals from time to time! Way cool.

Bye from the UK or is it heaven?

Jon.

PS. What really rocks is that the 2112 is taken from Great Woods. I had
front row tickets and Alex played the soliloquy solo so close to me he
sweated on my arm! Needless to say I haven't washed it since!

  I think Ged & Al took it upon themselves to dedicate the album to their
  memory.
  
  Like the Hammersmith photo, Ged and Alex were involved, Neil was on his
  own taking time for himself (looking from the 2nd story window).

1.  What does the DYU 502V on the truck symbolize?

   Don't have an answer for this one..

2.  What are the words on the shirt of the guy hauling Alex off to the
    asylum?

   Here's what I can make out (it's the same as what's on the top of the
truck they're planning to take Alex into):  Jolly Teabag Rest Home
   (note: to get the Teabag i had to look right at the fold of the disc, and
kind of bend the seam on the right side...try it)

3.  What are the numbers/letters on the kid's shirt? (TFE maybe?)

   Looks like F**K to me!  Another of my pet theories is that it says F -
II - K , like Farewell to Kings.  Most of the AFTK merchandise used the
starman symbol anyways.

4.  Can the 2 posters on the 2 different posts in the middle be read and
    if so what do they say?

   I have tried my best to magnify and illuminate this, but to no
avail..anybody have a blowup of it?

5.  Alex is portrayed as crazy.  Geddy is a ticket scalper.  What role
    does Neil play?  Why is he in that window smiling?

   My guess is that he didn't participate in the photo shoot they used to
put Geddy and Alex into the picture, so they just used an old picture of him
holding onto a pole, and from how he's dressed, looks like one of his many
vacations.

   Feel free to debate!  (except for jolly teabag - i'm sure on that one  :)

My God, DS kicks all kinds of ass. Was that an Austin Powers
impersonation Geddy was doing after Limelight? I now have a new
appreciation for 2112. I was always a Hempishperes lover, but after
hearing 2112 live for the first time, it just blew me away. It has so
much power. Driven rocks...i liked that guy yelling in the BG :P CTTH
was awesome...i love the regae rendition at the end :) Leave That Thing
Alone was dam cool. Had a realy cool ambient feel to it. Rythm Method
made me wana go burn mr drums and wonder why i evene try to be that
good! And Xanadu is killer on the 3rd disc. The packaging is pretty
slick. I loved the tinker-toy-tower-in-the-crowd image so much, i made
it the start up image on my machine :) A few neat little things to point
out about that image actually. If you look at the guys with the buz cut
on the bottom of the picture, he's got the tinker toy symbol shaved in
to his head. And the guy imediatly to his righ in the white shirt has
the tinker toys tatooed on his arm. And the guy to the right of him in
the denim jacket has the tinker toys on the back of his jacket. Nifty
indeed :) They could of anchored in disc 3 a little better...but i
didn't drop it :) Too bad ClusterWorks doesn't work....on my machine at
least:( ...But all in all...a killer album well worth the $20

first, anyone notice the woman in the center of the Odeon picture with
the dress might be the same as the Permanent Waves woman? Kinda look

1. Front White Cover.
2. Back Gray Cover.
3. Tribute to Jackie/Selena Page(I'm sure that's what the toys stand
for.)
4-9 The Front Odeon Cover(GL's shirt, the 4 columns, and the back of the
leather jacket in center.)
10. The Gray group shot in the center of the open jacket.
11-15.The Rush PullOut Cover(The Tinkerlith. The shaved head. Back of
jacket. Back of Shirt. Tattoo)(oh yes.I'm getting that tattoo. anyone
hear of new Rush merchandise involving DS? Shirts/Hats/Whatnot?)
16. The Microphone Replaced with Tinkertoys in the montage.
17. The Left Side of the Greeting Page by Geddy.(What a nice man to give
us that little letter.)

Well that's all I found. feel free to add but take out the questions and
stuff I asked too, just for brevity's sake.

So.....I'm on my lunch break from work (Dallas, Tx area) and just sucked
down a chicken breast at Boston Market. I'm in my Trans Am heading back to
work and I stop at a red light (something I've been known to do
occasionally) and looking to my right I see this Rush logo.......painted
onto the cowl induction scoop of an old Camaro. It's the naked man/pentagram
logo from 2112. Looking at it I also notice a tinker toy on his antenna.
Well the car is several different colors of primer and looks like crap but I
think to myself...."Cool!". Well whaddaya know. The guy sees me looking at
his car and starts trying to get me to race. Don't get me wrong. I love fast
cars but I only race on the track - no street racing here. Well anyway, he
rolls up a little and I see the next Rush logo.....PAINTED ON HIS DOOR!!
It's the sketched "Rush" from the Hemispheres cover and its about 6" tall
and over a foot long! Kick ass! Somehow I now feel like me and this guy were
accidentally separated at birth. So.....the light turns green. I didn't want
to race but I accelerated somewhat quickly (with my drink spilling into my
lap) only to have this guy blow by me sideways with his engine screaming
like teenagers on a roller coaster and both rear tires bellowing smoke
(looked somewhat like a space shuttle launch).....at which time I saw the
next Rush display. It was somewhat hard to read because his car was all over
the road and the smoke made it somewhat illegible but he had the name
"Rocinante" written across the rear wing of his car. Does anyone know this
guy? I'm not mad.....I WANT SOME OF THOSE COOL STICKERS!!!!

DS is the reason that three disc CD players were invented!  It's a perfect,
practically unbroken, concert experience, with a temporal wormhole that pulls
you back to 1978 for the London show.  I was originally a little upset with the
packaging, but I don't think I'm going to be taking the CDs out of the player
anytime soon, so it all works out in the end.  I don't think I have to say,
"Different Stages ROCKS!" but I will.

nah...the boyz ain't old.  I just wanted to have a subject other than 
Different Stages.

Some comments.

1.  Someone mentioned (and I'm not sure if this has been 
addressed already) about "Where's Neil" on the Hammersmith 
Odeon liner.  He's on the second floor to the right of the sign, 
looking a bit loony.  I'm sure they had to make this photo while he 
wasn't around and had to do the cut-n-paste with something 
existing.  Great picture.

2.  Has anyone installed the enhanced CD software?  Any good?  
My CDROM at work doesn't play CD's well, only out one channel, 
so I will have to install at home for full effect.

3. The dedication.  Very classy.  I like the use of the tinkertoys 
there.  Hugh Syme is incredible.  While he claimed the design had 
no meaning, it clearly can be interpreted many different ways.  In 
this space, it seems to indicate Neil standing alone while the two 
who were close to him have slipped away.

4.  Artwork and pictures are great!  The montage of memorabilia I 
could just stare out for hours.  Very nice.  Inserting the tinkertoys 
into the old photo is cool too.

5.  Oh yeah.  The music's good too. :)  $16.99 at Best Debt in 
Atlanta.  Listening at work now, on the way home later, in the 
morning, noon, and night.

Here's my biggest impression:  ROCK!!!!!!!!!!

For all the reservations I had about this release, I simply love it.  I 
know I'm one of a million people posting with this same idea, but damn, 
I just can't help it.

Everything is so thick and raw and powerful!  And yes, 2112 sounds weird 
detuned, but it's growing on me in a big way.  I'd rather have it like 
that and have Geddy be able to sing expressively and properly, than for 
them to play it in the standard tuning and compromise some of the 
vocals.  I love it!  When Alex is doodling on the guitar and Geddy's 
singing real purdy, and then the whole band kicks in with 
Presentation... BOOM!  ROCK!

I just love the art work too.  Hugh Syme has outdone himself again.  
(PLUG:  Also check out his work on the latest Arena album, The 
Visitor... fantastic symphonic rock concept album).  I wish they hadn't 
cropped Neil off on the Hammersmith photo though (supposedly on the 
vinyl sleeve you can see him driving the truck).

And damn does Geddy sound weird on the Hammersmith show!  I love it!

I only have a few complaints, and those are minor.  I would have liked 
to see more "mid-period" songs with this heavy dirty sound.  And I still 
don't like their overuse of samplers.  Is that really sampled feedback 
in Stick It Out?  Ugh...  But dammit... ROCK!

 Hey, u r welcome...I was at both shows in chicago ;-)
The July 14th show was better, esp since it was outside and
a nice day out.  I am glad that they included most from
the chi show.  Believe it or not, I could barely hear the
show due to all of the singing and screaming!  Its amazing
that rush still has such a strong following in chi, esp since
the radio stations here dont play rush much...well maybe
lately they do now, since there are a couple of AOR stations
here.  I feel kinda bad about a buddy of mine who came to the 
show with me.  He doesnt listen to rush much, and with all the 
yelling, singing, cheering and screaming, fistpumping, air
drumming and guitaring, he prob could barely hear/see a thing 
from the band ;-)  My ears were ringing and voice hoarse for
a few days after the show ;-)  I kinda wished they had included all of 
chicago's show nonstop (like the recording from england).  
That way it would have really would be like a live show since 
there would not have been any quiet spots between songs.  Its 
amazing how the CD captured the sound of the crowd, as well as
the clarity of the instruments...this is truely a "live" CD.

<A NAME="2136033">Subject: CD Cover Decryption</A>

This is in response to Rob Godwin's last message regarding the album
artwork.  One of the best things about a new Rush release is trying to
understand all of the hidden meaning (if any) in the artwork of the cover. 
Here are a couple of my observations:

First, the Tinker Toy design on the front obviously represents the band
members. It's interesting to see that one of the round toys is separate
and above the other two.  I'm guessing that this was no mistake and it
serves to represent Neil who is often aloof from Geddy and Alex.  Neil is
the yellow toy, Alex and Geddy are the red and blue toys.  (or maybe
arranging the toys this way made for better placement for artistic value).

No hidden meaning in this one but in the picture of the endless crowd of
people "worshipping" the Tinker Toys, you see the Tinker Toy emblem
several places: on the back of the head, on the back of a jacket, a tatoo
on an arm.  

In regard to the Hammersmith Odeon picture--this one's really fun. I
haven't taken a good look at it yet but I hope to read about more
interesting discoveries on the CD covers.    Before I sign off--have you
seen on the back cover, the picture of the Tinker Toys with the math
equations?  Is there any meaning to this?  What does, "see attached data
/ K.S. July 10, '98" mean?  

See ya,
Brad

For those of you who haven't had the chance, do yourselves a favor and
listen to DS through a good set of headphones.  This is the best
sounding album I have ever heard and it really comes to life in a
quality set of headphones.  I love the sound of this CD, it's raw but so
clean and crisp.  The bass is awesome.  It also has great artwork and
the retrospective was a lot of fun to look through.  We're so lucky.  A
lot of bands would have taken that 1978 show and sold it as an
independent release for $15, Rush took the time and effort to produce
and package it then virtually gave it away with a 2 CD set.  The whole
package (CD and artwork) is awesome and I really enjoyed getting that
1978 show as a bonus.

Thank you Geddy, Alex and Neil!

The line  "It's okay Alex, shake it off!"  The guy may be referring to right
before Geddy's bass solo, Alex was having some guitar problems and their is
a really high pitch sound.  You can hear it if you are really listening for
it.  I was at the Chicago show and I think Alex then changed guitars during
Geddy's solo (anyone else remember?)  I also remember reading somewhere that
Alex had the same problem the night before in Milwaukee.

It's pretty cool to know that I was "at the show" where they took a lot of
the songs from.  Guess it made the drive from Minneapolis, MN worth it!!

Hey Everybody, 

It's been while since I last posted but I couldn't RESIST. I just Had to 
let everyone know where I was June, 23 1997. Along with my sister and 
her friend I was in Mansfield Mass. experiencing the greatest concert in 
my life. It's so cool to be on a Rush album even in such an abstract 
way. I don't know maybe you can even hear me screaming at the begining 
of 2112 or Leave That Thing Alone.

Anyway, I love the album, the artwork, and the song selections. The only 
thing I didn't like was that the drums on the Chicago tracks didn't 
sound as good as some of the other ones. But thats O.K., they don't 
sound bad.

I don't know, but is it just me, that a Rush fan is the most loyal 
bloodhound a band could own?  We sniff it out on the radio, search 
for secrets in the music and stand buy it more than anything in the 
world.  We all seem like pretty normal people and live normal lives, 
but when a Rush album comes out we dive right for it.  I left work 
early like the guy who posted yesterday just to buy it.  It isn't a 
lifestyle like a Marilyn Manson zombie.  We are individuals.  Not 
like all those so called individuals who look alike.  I strongly believe 
that a Rush fan is one of the most loyal and unique creatures on 
the planet.  It brings us joy.  Something you will never hear from 
any other fan of music.  I'm 20 years old and it still it feels like I've 
been in it since the beginning.  I even still feel bad for Neil.  He is 
basically nobody to me, but somehow I wish I could say my 
condolensence just because I feel like I owe him.  They have all 
done their best for us and for that I am grateful.  I only hope when 
their end comes,  I don't wind up crying in front of my friends and 
they beat the shit out of me.  *lol*  Thats my opinion, take care

deal better if the track listing included songs that have yet to appear 
on a live album that were played over the last four tours such as the 
pass, vital signs, prelude, double agent, war paint, scars, limbo, 
virtuality, time and motion, half the world, where's my thing, ghost of a 
chance, cold fire, show don't tell, analog kid, or 
super-fuckin'-conductor, instead of songs that have already appeared on a 
live album (or two) like tom sawyer, spirit of radio, freewill, the 
trees, or closer to the heart.  wait a second, i forgot that because of 
the people who were "bitching", rush decided to include show don't tell 
and analog kid on this live album.  so i guess you can take those two 
songs off of the list of songs i'd rather have on the live album, since 
they are already there.  i'd appreciate it if you just said thank you for 
the bitching that brought analog kid and show don't tell on to this 
album.  instead, you ask where the bitches are.  well, this bitch hasn't 
changed his mind, and i'm sure some of the other bitches are with me on 
this still.  so why don't you just say "thank you to all the bitches" and 
shut the fu*k up!  you got your third live version of closer to the heart 
(along with it already on AFTK, AFTK remaster, chronicles, and the 
compilation remaster volume 1.  that's seven times now that rush has 
released closer to the heart.  i wonder if there were another live album 
if you would want it on there again because they slightly altered the jam 
at the end.  of course you would.  i may be a bitch but i'd rather be a 
bitch than a sheep.
