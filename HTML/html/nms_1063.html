Jay Scott said that it was a piece of "Tom Sawyer,"
not "The Spirit of Radio," which was in the Barenaked
Ladies song "Grade 9."

Sorry, Jay, but as one who owns the album that song
is on and listens to it *a lot*, I can tell you that
*both* Rush songs are in it, as well as the Peanuts
theme and something that sounds like it's from Grease
but I'm not sure. (Also, elsewhere on the album, they
started half-singing "domo origato, Mr. Roboto.)

Giggle all you want about the "country" Rush tunes, but does anyone else
out there think that the solo in "Making Memories" sounds an awful lot
like Lynyrd Skynyrd or the Allman Brothers?

A lot of members of some really great bands have done "country" style
projects in the past: Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, Steve Howe of Yes
(check out "The Steve Howe Album" if you don't believe me), and a whole
host of others. Country music (although I am not personally a great fan
of it) is very challenging musically (I would personally challenge any
guitar heroes out there to tackle "Country Boy" by Ricky Skaggs), even
though the lyrics are sometimes a bit on the cheezy side.

I would like to hear some of Alex's solo work, i.e. the "Country Ditty"
and his guitar syphonies on a solo album. Who knows, it may happen. Won't
we be surprised when one side is filled with country tunes!

Salutations again,

My second post stems from a question I have been
asking myself for years.

Why have RUSH never produced a video for the complete
2112 side A ?

If we have indeed come to end of RUSH, and they are going
to call it a day after the next album/s, what better way
to end a career such as theirs with the album that propelled
them from the bad acceptance of Caress of Steel to the
tremendous sales of 2112.

To say that RUSH does not relate anymore to pre-1980 music
is not fair to RUSH fans like myself who still think that
pre-1980 albums are excellent expressions and just as
relevant today as the day when they were released.
These are the albums that have created a loyal following
dating back to the seventies.

Why don't RUSH perform a world-tour which INCLUDES the full 2112
side A (and B?), like Pink Floyd did a few months ago with a
Division Bell tour that contained the full "Dark Side of the moon"
album.

Let's be serious. The boys can't go on forever, as much as we would
like them to.If they are going to peform a final tour, whenever, why
not make it the best thing rock music has seen and heard in the last
decade. An investment in the making of a 2112 video, and a concert
that contains the highlights of their career and, at last, 2112.

Hi All,
	Just to follow up my own post about Rush doing a Classical
Album (THIS IS A JOKE FOR THE HUMOUR IMPARED);

The second album in this phase would be the Live album Different
Strings.

Finally before they move back onto more conventional lines, the
last album would be A Farewell to Strings, with a 22 minute
full orchestral version of Xanadu, and a new chapter to the
Cygnus saga.

Thanks

	Ok, I'm a new poster, so I'll do the intro thing befor eI get lynched 
(Hey, if you're gonna lynch me, play Witch Hunt, ok?)
Anyway, I've only been a Rush fan for about a year and a half, I went to the 
Counterparts concert (which was ok, except there were people smoking pot near 
me and I got sick.
	OK, I have been notcing common interests in Rush fans outside of music, 
and I was wondering how many of you out there also share these interests.
	The magority of the Rush fans I know are also into role-playing games
, modeming (a la internet, or a la BBS), Japanese animation, and science fiction
	Just wondering if any of you share these also, and have noticed the 
same thing. THANKS

Also

You know you're a Rush fan when:

	The Power Windows label on the switch on your car gets you to humming.

	You reguraly write to Limbaugh pleading with him to change his name to 
something else.

You know you're a female Rush fan when

	Men with long hair and high voices attract you

	You convince your boyfriend to cut his hair like Geddy (no, I didn't 
do this, really, I swear!)

	You're REALLY REALLY jealous of Amiee Mann

I have to agree with DragClaw@aol.com when he says:

>it is perfect that they aren't on eMpTyV 24 hours a day or on every radio
>station every 3 songs like some other bands because it means that much more
>when you find another rush fan, or see a rush poster or bumper sticker, or
>hear a rush song on the radio because it really makes -my- day when i find
>someone saying 'wow you like rush too?'

I know rush has a huge fan base, but they're obviously not top 40
material, i.e. except for perhaps "rush-philic" radio stations, they don't
get a hell of a lot of airplay, generally speaking.  How many posts have
you read on the NMS that began with "I was INTRODUCED to rush by my friend
Joe..." or had something like "I've been trying to get my little brother
to listen to such and such a rush tune...". You know a band is good when
they can achieve the number of fans they have, more by word of mouth than
by being overplayed on the radio to the point where you subconsciously
start to believe "this *must* be a good tune cuz they're ALWAYS playing it
on the radio".

	I was introduced to rush by by older brother in the early 80's.
First rush song I heard was "Freewill". I didn't quite get it the first
time, but after a few more listens I was floored, and to this day that
song amazes me, 'specially the guitar part before each verse and geddy's
climactic (sp?) screaming at the end of the last verse...

	DragClaw - I am a rush fan too! :)

Greetings.
Just a few things to mention here after perusing the last NMS (1063)...
I noticed a post about READING THE FAQ(!) and it was mentioned that the "star" 
on the cover of 2112 has to do with Witchcraft... I for one, do not believe 
this as I have heard Mr. Peart clearly state that it has to do with the pure 
man rejecting the "red star", which is symbolic of his society. (Thusly, we 
hear "Hold the red star proudly high in hand") Another thing Id like to 
mention is that in regards to what's to come in the future for recordings, I 
dont think we'll know until we get them. It sounds like from what I have been
reading on the NMS, we're all very anxious to get some new material. We all 
seem skeptical as to what exactly the boys might do next. Country? Re-doing 
the older stuff? A live album? A 20th anniversary album? I think the only 
clear answer right now is Who knows?! But I dont believe they would re-record 
the older material. This seems too redundant and I personally dont think that 
Geddy has the voice to scream with anymore. If you've heard their shows 
recently, you can hear that they've slowed down or half-stepped some of the
songs down, to accomodate his voice. Tom Sawyer is a good example. They play 
that much slower these days.

Any big Rush Fans in the Seattle area? Id like to hear from you...
And has anyone heard "Run From The Fans"? Its a nice quality boot but I dont 
like the fact that they cut off some classic songs by going into other songs... 
Freewill for example and actually cutting off Xanadu halfway through to jump 
into Superconductor?! Come on...  Xanadu rules, and when I hear it, I want to 
hear the whole thing... well, at least I have Exit...  Stage left!

        I've been stewing about some things lately relating to Rush, and I
just need to get my opinion heard.  I'm a die-hard fan, and Neil's lyrics
were very influential in my 'formative years'.  Unfortunately, I've seen a
recent trend in Neil's writings that is unnerving.  He seems to have lost
the ideal of 2112 and the concept of personal freedom a la Ayn Rand.  'The
Trees' is a top favorite of mine, as I see it as a slightly cynical comment
on laws.  The last lines "And the trees are all kept equal/By hatchet, axe
and saw" is a perfect metaphor for how we all are 'pruned' by laws that are
made necessary only by the actions of a few.

        I have a friend who is not a particular Rush fan, but her favorite
song is 'The Trees' simply because of that powerful meaning.

        Anyway, my personal beef is that Neil has drifted away from the
idealism of his youth and is slowly buying into the present media culture.
He (and you) may see it as just as powerful an ideal, but I certainly won't
put "Cold Fire" against '2112' or even later songs like 'Losing it', which,
although not directly related to the human rights/freedom concept, is still
a wonderful comment on what we are as humans.

        Now, please don't flame me, as I consider flaming an intellectual
equivalent of "oh yeah?  Well my dad can beat your dad with one foot cut off
and hanging upside down."  What I want here is an intelligent discussion,
and I know everybody here is capable of such.

Thanks,

Dave Brunberg

It actually sounded cool.  I think it was another version of Cold Fire,
but I can't remember.  Do remember hearing Geddy's voice, though not
with a lot of twang, but you could tell the song had a country western
beat.  I just remember standing in a bar-resturaunt like place, and when
the song came on, every one was getting into it.  I, of course, felt proud
to be a NMS reader, for I already knew about the song, and started telling
everyone that they they had a whole album coming out.  Now that I think
about it, it was pretty humorous to listen to.  I was laughing when I
heard it, but I'm sorry i can't fill you guys in on the details, because
they dream switched to another scene, and I woke up shortly afterwards.
Pretty sad, huh.  Me having a dream about the song... See what silly
things you guys have made me think of?  I guess I'm too fanatic.

Hey there fellow Rush fans-
I am new here, and SO happy to see and meet Rush fans (a rare breed in
central New York State).  I was just wondering if anyone had any more
information pertaining to the upcoming Rush album.  According to one post,
the tentative release date is this spring, according to another, it won't be
till fall.
Also just to add my $.02, I have noticed that 2112's other songs (Twilight
Zone, Tears (a personal favorite!) are getting almost no recognition.  Sure,
2112 itself is a great song which I love, but as I tell all my friends, the
other songs are what make this 2112 my favorite Rush CD.  Just curious to see
if anyone agrees with me (certainly not Alex Zivojinovic, who seemed to think
that 75% of all Rush songs are "fillers")

	Well, Rush lost for the 3rd time in their career at the Grammies
last night to Pink Floyd's "Marooned" from their Division Bell Album.

	They'll probably have another nomination for Best Rock Instrumental
in another couple of years for their next release.  (They seem to be on a
roll with instrumentals these days)  If Eric Johnson, Pink Floyd, or
perhaps a reunited Police are not also nominated, Rush stands a good chance
at a win.
	Who the hell does the voting for the awards anyway?

Hey fellow Rushonianites,

        This is my first posting but I must give you the inside scoop on
what I've just heard.  There has been a lot of talk on NMS lately about a
rumored new album coming out.  Heated debates over the contents, validity
of information, etc.  Well I can put all minds at ease.  I was speaking
with Geddy last night and he told me that the boyz were toying with a
couple ideas.  They will either release a Christmas album just in time for
the '95 holidays or compile an educational album for kids in association
with Hooked on Phonics.  Look for one or the other around early November.
Really.

        I know that there is a listing of all songs played live somewhere
in the depths of the internet, but I am not so good at finding stuff which
is buried deep down in the net so please humor me.  Maybe I am a
simpleton... well, I'm definitely a simpleton... but one of my favorite
rush tunes is Witch Hunt.  I wonder if the boyz have ever played it live.
I've only seen them once, Albany, New York 1990, Presto tour.  I was in
tenth grade.  I was screaming "Witch Hunt" at the top of my lungs.  "Play
Witch Hunt, Pleeeeeeease!!!"  But for some reason they just didn't listen.
It may have had something to do with the fact that I was in the nosebleeds
for most of the show or it may have been that they didn't hear me but I was
thoroughly disappointed it wasn't played.

        One thing I must say is that Neil Peart is a God.  When I saw that
concert I had snuck down to just above stage level near the back to Neil's
left.  I was no more than 20 yards away from him during his solo.  I still
get chills when I think of it.  NEIL ROCKS!  He gets my vote for Drummer of
the Universe.

        My new favorite track is Working Man.  Undoubtedly the coolest,
hardest opening to any song ever recorded by anyone.  I've played my
Chronicles CDs so many times I think they are going to wear right through.

saw the boys in Murfreesboro,TN which is just outside
Nashville (Music City, USA??).  Geddy introduced Cold Fire

okay, here's the scoop:

it is a fantasy trip to all the best pot fields in the world written by a
conoseur of THC (i think that is the right name for the drug).  Whatever Rush
may promote now about drugs, they were avid users in their past.

Bonus Nachos Mein Froinds,
    I was listening to BS&M the other day and couldn't help but notice the
edit that occurs in the chorus.  I'm referring to the line where Ged sings:

Aah yes to yes Aah-aah to yes   Why the sun  Why the sun
              ^
If you listen closely you can hear a very pronounced "t-" sound after
the second 'yes' as if Ged was going to sing 'to'. I think the initial
recorded lyrics may have been closer to Pye Dubois' poem: "Aah yes to
yes to self esteem...Waddaya think?  It took me a few listens to catch
the edit but it seems really obvious to me now. I was surprised that
something that blatant ( to me anyway ) would be allowed but I guess it
just coincides with the raw nature of CP.
    Also I have two really cool interviews from a 1980 Guitar Player mag
that I would be happy to transcribe for the NMS if anyone's interested.
They deal alot with equipment and technique but are pretty informative.

Hello all,

      Like many I read about, this is my first post. I am new at all of this,
so I would like some help. I would like to get my, shh be very, very quite,
bootleg collection started. If anyone out there could recommend any places or
catalogues companies that I could get some GOOD stuff from, please send a
message to me. I will put my address at the end so e-mail me. If anyone could
also recommend some good quality bootlegs to get I would greatly appreciate it.
      I would also like to add that all the talk about country Rush is great.
A little humor is always good. And the other thing that was great was the list
that someone posted with the Rush songs as food and such. Guys, lighten up. You
all need to laugh and I think more of this kind of fun stuff is needed. Rush is
a great band, there is no doubting that, but everyone has to have fun to be in
the business for this long. We need to have fun too, so lighten up. Sorry for
anyone who did not want to hear me preach.
      Does anyone know the favorite sports teams of Rush? Baseball, Football,
Hockey, and Basketball. Just wondering.

Well, another Rush fan from Jackson, MS. My hometown!!! YES! Actually, I'm
here at Sewanee now, but that's beside the point. I don't know where Chris
went, but at my school there were tons of Rush fans (30 in a school of 300+
counts, right?) around; hell, we played Tom Sawyer during basketball game
halftimes. Yes, it has been a while since Rush played our... uh.... oddly
colored Fairground Auditorium, and the reason they don't play anymore is
not only due to the lack of crowd response but also (not sure about this)
because the audience threw bottles at The Boys!!! Some people have no
taste. But hey, is having to go to New Orleans to see them so bad????
Just thought I'd share these thoughts. And Chris: I guess I'm the other

Yo Rushies, Dino here!

	I enjoyed reading the entries from Phil Schmidt and Chris Pardua in 
TNMSissue #1061. I totally agree with Phil that its piss-poor and downright
dangerous to throw anything up on the stage while a group or artist is
performing. Sad to say, this seems to happen alot. I remember seeing the Police
and Lynyrd Skynyrd (the original) several years ago when something similar
happened, although not out of disrespect. At the Police show, someone threw a
firecracker onstage. Sting stopped the show right in the middle of a song and
walked off for about 15 minutes. Most memorably, during the Skynyrd, someone
threw an empty beer can onstage. The band went ahead and finished the song they
were playing, but when they were done, Ronnie Van Zant picked the can up,
stomped up to the microphone, and said in his loud, intimidating voice, "I don't
know what ass threw this up here, but if I ever catch someone doing something
like this, I'll personally come off this stage and kick your stupid little ass!"
Needless to say, the crowd got a little more civil from that point on. There is
something else that bothers me just as much as throwing stuff onstage. For some
reason, some people nowadays have the idea that the concert is supposed to be
nothing more than the backdrop for their personal little party. My wife, best
friend and his wife just recently saw the Eagles in Memphis. There were four
young women behind us who spent half the evening whooping it up, yelling, and
carrying on like idiots. My wife (who's pretty tiny and usually very reserved)
finally had enough and tore into them. They got quiet for awhile, but eventually
returned to the same behavior. When the band stopped for a short intermission,
I felt compelled to give them a "your rights end where mine begin" lecture. THE
PURPOSE IN ATTENDING A ROCK CONCERT IS TO APPRECIATE THE BAND, NOT TO MAKE A
SPECTACLE OF ONESELF!!! I'm sorry if this sounds like a soapbox, but I just felf
(sorry- felt) like this had to be said. If you don't like a particular band,
either do something (like go to the concession stand) during their set, or don't
go to the show at all.

	I think it was Brian Preston who requested input from Southern Rush
fans, and Chris Pardua responded. I, too, am a southern Rush fan. Little Rock is
totally devoid of any decent rock stations (except maybe the station that plays
all 70s music), so Rush is hard to come by here over the airwaves. The last time
Rush played Little Rock was April, 1982. Actually, that show was part of a mini
"warm-up" tour before the actual Signals tour later that year. So.. I must also
travel quite abit to see them (Memphis, St. Louis, Dallas, Indianapolis usually)
I have no problem with that whatsoever! This area is chock full of C&W radio
stations, which for a hardcore rocker like me is a living hell. I personally
don't have any friends who are Rush fans (being 38, most people my age don't
listen to hard rock anymore), neither do I know too many people who are into the
older classic bands like Led Zep, Yes, the Who, ELP, Pink Floyd, etc. What a
shame!

	Hey Chris-- I, too, listen to Yes, although I much prefer their older
stuff from "The Yes Album," "Fragile," etc. Never heard of King Crimson? Are you
kidding? One of the all-time classic rock songs is "In the Court of the Crimson
King!" Another classic rock band is Mott the Hoople. IMHO, their album "All the
Young Dudes" is a masterpiece. David Bowie's old stuff (Ziggy Stardust days) is
also classic. By the way, does anyone remember a band called Bloodrock? If you
younger fans out there want a better understanding of our heroes and how they
fit into the larger rock'n'roll "picture," I'd strongly suggest you pick up on
some of these older bands and their music. There's a cornucopia of aural
treasures out there!

	Finally-- Chris, since I'm not a beer drinker (although I can be a hell-
raiser from time to time; I prefer bourbon) I can't enjoy doing what you
suggested at the end of your post. However, I do feel compelled to drink a
couple of shots, take a trip out back, and take a whiz off the back porch. God,
nature's wonderful down in Dixie! For those of you who were not blessed with
fine redneck genes, I offer you a parting comment:

			I'm southern born
			I'm southern bred
			And when I die
			I'll be southern dead, you all.

Later, beloved Rushies!

I was just taking note of the Tommy Shaw discussion.  I saw the tour
with him opening and all I can say is that he sucked a whole lot.
Thankfully he is now a part of one of the most AWFUL bands ever and can
be totally ignored.

I have to admit that I have been disappointed with most of the
openers for the last 7 tours. (from the first time I went to a Rush show)

Thw worst opener had to be Fastway!  AARRRGGHHHH!!!  I think that was on
GuP tour. They really really sucked.

Candlebox was O.K.

Gratefully though, the fellas always ease the pain and make it go away once
they take the stage.

Bonjour fellow Rushians!!
Just thought I'd put in my $.02 cents in and continue the You Know thread.

PLEASE!!! If you are a relatively new subscriber, read the FAQ before
asking questions that have already been asked a million times (i.e. "what
does the binary code in the Body Electric mean?") It's all there in the
FAQ. I know... I read it BEFORE I posted.

I also wanted to say LIGHTEN UP to all those who flamed the country album
post. Personally, I found it petty funny.

As far as fillers are concerned, I agree that there are fillers on some
albums, but that does not diminish Rush's music in any way. As a matter
of fact, the "fillers" are sometimes the best songs on an album (IMHO).
For instance I feel that "New World Man" (Project 3:57) and "Available
light are two of the best songs (along with "Everyday Glory", "LTTA", and
"Marathon") in thier post MP career, yet they would be considered fillers
to some. The fact that "YYZed" was considered a filler, IMHO, is just
simply ridiculous. What a masterpiece that is!!!

Greetings friends,

I was incredibly fortunate enough to catch Rush in KC in April of 94.
But the fact is that Primus opened and Rush preceded to play about 2
hours and 45 minutes after the encore was over.  I noticed something
about the concert.  I don't want to overstep my grounds as a fan, but I
could distinctly tell some of Les Claypool's (of Primus) influences on
Geddy's style.  I think Les is one of the best bassist out there but
Geddy is still the man!!!!

I've not heard 2112 on golddisc, but I am not all that disappointed with
the sound quality on the conventional version.  Although the packaging (or
the lack thereof) sucks, Mercury did a competent job with the mastering.
That won't stop me from buying the golddisc, however.  I do have Moving
Pictures on golddisc.  I got rid of the aluminum version before I could
compare, but the gold sounds great.  And, apart from the reduced cover
shot, the graphics are improved - i.e., Neil's photo is restored.  Yeah!

By the way, does anyone know if we can expect anything in the way of a

        I have been a Rush fan for the last four years starting with Roll

     songs.  You can e-mail a top 5, 10, 25 or 116 if you would like.  I

        I would also like to know if you have ideas as to what I can do in
     my show.  For example, last semester I played all of the instrumentals
     and the Fear trilogy, and the medleys they have done in their
     concerts.  Do you have any other ideas regarding how I could play
     their songs.

     Thank you,

Well, it's official.  Rush did NOT win the grammy for best rock instrumental.
 That honor was bestowed on Pink Floyd.  Oh well, we know who is really the
best!  Rush did win Album of the Year though (did anyone else see this?).

When are these rumors about the boyz dying going to end!  I first heard that
"Niel has cancer" about 6 months after the MP tour.  I didn't hear it again
until about 2 years ago.  I couldn't believe that rumor was still going
around.  Then I got on TMNS a few weeks ago and guess what someone asked.  We
are all dying! OK!

You know you're a Rush fan when:
You have all the issues of TNMS on your hard drive!
