Well, it looks like most of the posts today talk about Cygnus X-1! There was
NOT a part 2 of the faq mailed out yesterday (I ran out of time) so the second
part will go out later tonight, and the third part tomorrow. There may/may not
be a regular digest for tomorrow, depending on the amount of posts that come

I must say it is an interesting tidbit that I didn't notice years ago
when I saw it.  But I'm afraid there is little chance of there being a
connection in that respect because both Mr Peart and the makers of the
movie were drawing on a name previously given by astronomers.  Cygnus
X-1 (I'm not sure about the 'X-1' part) was the name given(by some
astronomers) to the first of what was believed to be a blackhole.  I'm
sorry for the lack of details but it was before either of these two
events.  I do know that it was only a theory since they had no way of
directly observing a black hole.  They postulated from the observation
of 'dust' being pulled from a star into some central location, which
could be a black hole.   So they named it Cygnus.  Sorry.   My
astronomical information might be off, but that's not entirely pertinent
here.  The main thing is that I've seen it printed in books before A
Farewell To Kings.

Hey all,
    Just thought I would add another voice on a few subjects.
1) Cygnus X-1 - I think that the ship Rocinante is a reference to Don
Qiuxote's horse Rozinante but I am not sure. Anyways knowing that Don
was crazy and what not,  this could add a twist to the whole story.
2) another vote for navy blue shirts
3) tapes or Cds..... its Rush so enjoy :)
4) There was a question in the last NMS about a RtB single with two
live tracks( Tom Sawyer and The Spirit of the Radio ? ).  well I just
ordered this too, so could someone E-mail me if they no anything
about this disk?  Thanks
                              Well later

Howdy,

	There will probably be quite a few replies to this, but
as an astronomer, I felt obligated to answer.

	There is a reason that both Disney and Rush made reference to
the name Cygnus.  Black holes entered the theoretical arena a long
time ago, not long after Einstein's theory of general relativity was
widely accepted, but by their very nature, they are tough to find.
You can't see them directly, so you have to look at the stuff around them
and see if you can infer their existence by the influence of their
gravitational field.  Anyway, without giving a lecture on the physics of
black holes, I'll just say that it turns out that you expect alot of x-rays
to be emitted when matter falls into one.  Cygnus X-1 is an x-ray source in
the constellation of Cygnus (go figure) which, in the 70's and early 80's
at least, was our best black hole candidate (actually, the object is thought
to be a black hole and another less exotic star orbiting around each other).
In fact, what stands out at present as our most unambiguous detection of a
black hole was a photo just released last week from the Hubble Space Telescope
(yep, that's right, it's not a complete flop despite all the bad press) of
a different object - what is thought to be a black hole in the middle of a
galaxy (with all this stuff falling into it) that is a million times more
massive than our sun!
Anyway, there is no mystery here, both the song and the movie spaceship were
named after everybody's favorite black hole candidate (everybody's favorite,
that is, until last week).
Just one more note so I don't get attacked by everyone out there who has read
Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time":  I wasn't entirely rigorous when
I said you can't see a black hole - it turns out that they can spit out gamma
rays because of pair production (or, if you want to be rigorous about it,
vacuum polarization) at their event horizon, but when you look for
them, you don't look for gamma emission.

Jeepers, my first post!

The `X-1' actually stands for `the first X-ray source discovered in (Cygnus)'.
It's a real, honest-to-goodness black hole candidate discovered in the
mid-70's. I think it got lots of press at the time (there are better candidates
known now, though). I guess Neil keeps up with the evening news, too! :)

was a constellation between Lyra and Pegasus etc. etc...
But 'X-1' was not tacked on by Neil.  Cygnus X-1 is actually the
name of a black hole believed to be located in the constellation.

<A NAME="567009">Subject: Cygnus X-1</A>

Howdy ya'll

Just some quick facts to further add awe to the intellectual aura of Mr Peart.
I yesterday's digest, Glen Reed speculated that Neil threw the X-1 on the
end of Cygnus because it sounds neat.  Actually, astrophysicist speculate that
a massive black hole does exist in the constallation of Cygnus (the swan for
those of a more poetic bend).  The X-1 designation is what is actually used
in the astronomy community.  What is means is the following - when one looks
at the stars which make up the constallation of Cygnus, one sees brighter and
dimmer stars based on the optical light we pick up.  One can also look at the
stars with radio telescopes, infrared telescopes, ultraviolet telescopes, and,
of course, x-ray telescopes.  When one looks in a different spectral region,
the stars will naturally appear different based on their physical properties.
When one ranks the stars from brightest to dimmest in the x-ray spectral region
the brightest is given the desgination X-1.  Hence, Cygnus X-1 is the brightest
star in the x-ray spectral region in the constallation of the swan.

The reason this is considered  evedence for a black hole is because it is
hypothesized that when gas and dust is sucked into a black hole, it will lose
a tremendous amount of energy (think of a rock rolling faster and faster down
a hill).  The lost energy is emitted as radiation.  The only way to get dust
or gas so hot as to emit x-rays is to "roll it down a really big hill", ie
something as massively powerful as a black hole.

Sorry, not much Rush content, but to think that a 70's rocker could be so sharp
as to pick up on the classification scheme for stars in different 
constallations, and turn it into a song really reminds me of why I've been a 
rush fanatic for years and years and years.  (Actually, the reasons change 
about every time I'm asked...)

<A NAME="567010">Subject: Cygnus X-1</A>

Someone said something about Cygnus X-1, and something about the "X-1"
being of Neil's creation. Wrong! Sorry.

( Now I finally get to spew some of my astrophysics ...)

Cygnus X-1 is a real celestial object. It's a region, in Cygnus of course,
that is a powerful transmitter in the radio region of the spectrum. Blah,
blah, and all the other technical stuff. The point is that Cygnus X-1 is
a strong candidate for being a massive black hole ( Yes, folks, they're
for real ). There are other radio sources in space that carry the "X-1"
designation ( I think ...) besides the Cygnus object.

The black hole theory for this radio source was proposed in the late 60's-
early 70's, just in time for Neil to write a the song, and for Geddy
to compose that wicked bass line { bummm dumm duh-dud dumm dumm bummm duhh
duh-duh dumm }. ( I think I left out a dum, or was it a bumm ?)

I think that song should be the theme song for all stellar astrophysicists.

I'll be a real party pooper: It's impossible to travel in a blackhole. So
there.

T-Shirts ---> Just how close are these to reality?  There is
endless talk, but nothing definate (except for some informat-
ion about shirt sizes).  Are we ever going to get a vote on
this or what?  Perhaps a list of all the ideas submitted so
far should be sent out to everyone on the mailing list and we
can vote on those...if we don't figure something out, we won't
have anything.

  [ Check Meg's post below.					: rush-mgr ]

Tape/CD ---> Has anyone thought about all of those people out
there with 8-tracks!?  When are we going to see a collection
of rare Rush put out on 8-Track!?  :)  Seriously, we need to
vote on this as well.  Anyone out there willing to conduct a
poll, where the readers send in, say, 10 or so songs that they
would like?  (song, whether it's live, etc.)  Same as the
shirts:  it would be cool if we could decide...

Dan Meyer ---> Do you know anyone who works for American
Airlines?  Bum off of their flight discounts and benefits!  I
was going to do that to get to the Lubbock concert, but I
didn't even have enough money for the concert ticket!

What does being Christian have to do to support Neil's
philosophy?  I don't see anything in his words that require
religion to take a stand on...unless mythology is it!  :)

As for Neil being gay, maybe we should get him to take the
Purity Test and tell us the score.  Then we'd know!

<A NAME="567014">Subject: Rush vs. Christian values</A>

Someone mentioned that they didn't agree with the philosophy purported
by the band because of their Christian beliefs.  This reminded me of how
a friend of mine, who had been a BIG BIG Rush fan for years (bought every
thing he could get his hands on that had to do with Rush), and then
after becoming a Christian, suddenly he didn't like them anymore and
got rid of his CD's because listening to Rush doesn't agree with his
beliefs.  (Now he listens to "Christian rock/metal".)

I realize that this is just one example and that this isn't necessarily
the view of Christians everywhere, but I'd like to know what exactly
it is about Rush that is non-christian, or better yet, what particular
parts of their music make them so horrible.

Right off most people point out things like the Red Star on 2112, which
is ridiculous!  But, people who would think that probably don't know
much about Rush.  Since most people on this list are well-educated
about Rush, I was thinking I'd get a lot better responses.

  [ Try reading Neil's response to being accused of satanism, on anonymous 
    ftp at syrinx.umd.edu, in the rush/special directory, called 
    "neil.satanism.ed.Z"					  : rush-mgr ]

For the record, I don't find Rush to be anti-Christian,
or anti-any-religious-belief.  That's why I'd appreciate some
other views on this.

Please don't turn this into a big religion bashing-fest!
I'm not interested in that, I already know places where I can
find those discussions, and I avoid them like the plague.

Kings X and Megadeth.  (I'm not kidding.)

I'm getting ONLY XL for now, ordering 100. I need to pay them, and total
it's like $630. I'm charging $15 per shirt, *including* postage. 
For overseas (i.e. anywhere but US) it'll be $18 including postage. The
profits will go into a "buy syrinx a new hard drive fund" if that's ok with
David. This would be for the NMS archives and the ftp area, and then maybe we 
could put cool gifs on there (I got lots, but they're all a meg or more each)!

So I'm taking orders now! Anyone who wants a shirt mail me a check (overseas
can use international money order), and PLEASE include an address on a
separate piece of paper so I won't lose the address once I deposit the check. 
The shirts will be ready next Friday (Dec. 4) providing I can get the star 
to them by this Friday; they may be ready sooner.

Hi!

Just wanted to clear up the Cygnus X-1 thing: Cygnus X-1 is the name of the
first black hole ever discovered.  It appears to be located in Cyngus as
we "see" it from Earth.  It is called "X-1" because it was the first X-ray
emitting source found there.  This is what originally called astronomers'
attention to it: later they realized that it was a black hole.  I think the
X-ray emission is associated with things getting sucked into it but I'm not
sure... anyone else a better astronomer than I am?  Anyway that's why the
black hole in the movie and Neil's black hole are both called Cygnus; it's
not linked, it's just that both Neil and the moviemakers chose to use the
most familiar black hole in their stories.

BTW, many many thanks to Meg for emailing the FAQ as a special NMS edition!
I had no idea what was in it (yeah, I know, but I'm new here) and this is
really cool!!

I seem to recall a discussion some time ago about the availability
of a wishbone poster (the picture from RTB).  From reading the FAQL
I see that at least one Rush fan club sells posters, but it seems
to me that I would have to join the club in order to purchase the
poster.  I was wondering if anyone knows how to obtain the poster
without having to join a club.  Please e-mail me with any information
you may have.  Thanks.

BTW, (I imagine I won't be the only one to post this, but...)  Someone
posted in yesterday's NMS about Cygnus X-1, with the conjecture that
the X-1 was added by Neil.  Allow me to quote from an astronomy
book to set the record straight.  "The x-ray source of Cygnus X-1 may
be a black hole in orbit around a blue super giant star ..."  Thus the
X-1 is an official designation for this astronomical body.

I always wondered if Neil actually added the wind chimes in seperate from
the plywood or if he just set them up close to the stool so the air
pressure from the plywood made them move. Hmm.

     Hello all,

        It has been a while so bear with me....

      First my favorite album cover has to be HYF!  It's so simple and has so
many meanings to it!  I have two different tour posters of the album.

      Which brings up the question...Did anyone go to the HYF tour and get the
shirt that was red with the album cover on the front??  Wasn't that the most
awesome shirt?!!  Mine is now is probably a dust rag from over-wearing!

        Just to include myself in useless rambles...my 2nd favorite group has
to be TESLA!

        Is there anyone else out there that feels _Signals_ is one hell of an
album.  I can actually say that there is not one song I don't like!  (Which is
hard to say about alot of there albums)  I still
get goose bumps in the beginning of _Digital Man_ and jsut love the sound of
_Countdown_ when it's cranked up in the car!

        I have a question about the _Vital Signs_ video...In some of the shots
of Neil playing, what is that taped to his chest??  My guess is some sort of
mic....anyone, anyone??  Which brings up yet another thing...a couple months
ago I went to a "closeout" of an Record Theater here in Buffalo.  Well after
about an hour of hunting I found the _Grace Under Pressure_ and _Thru the
Camera Eye_ videos...both for a grand total of $12.94!!!!  NA-NA-NA-NA-NA!

        As for the shirt/CD(tape)/convention --- I say COOL!

        And FINALLY...come on people, out of 1500+ (am I right rush_mgr) there
has to be at least *1* Mr Big fan!  Well I am standing up and taking count
(although I will get teased by all the bullies out there).  I thought they were
pretty cool at the Starlake Amp. show in Pgh.  I even have TWO of there CD's!!
And that was before I saw them live...SO THERE!  :^)

  [ There are *almost* 1500 people on the list, but not quite.	: rush-mgr ]

I notice someone mentioned that Cygnus was actually a constellation between
Pegasus and Lyra....True but they went on to say that they thought Peart had
just "tacked on the X-1 bit" Untrue. Cygnus X-1 does exist...it is an X-ray
source in the constellation and the reason it is designated X-1 is that  it
was the first source of it's kind descovered in Cygnus. If astronomers discover
a second source it would then have the designation X-2. Simple

Neil did not tack the "X-1" onto the end of "Cygnus" out of mere
caprice.  The story behind this is as follows:

Sometime in the sixties, if I am not mistaken, radio telescopes
detected a source of intense X-ray radiation in the constellation of
Cygnus, the Swan.  Scientists dubbed this X-ray source Cygnus X-1,
because it was the first such X-ray source they had yet discovered.
Subsequent studies showed that it was in fact a black hole that was in
binary orbit with a visible star.

Just thought you'd like to know. . .

Hi again! Here I am writing again for all of you, and I have some questions:

1) I don't unterstand completely how the TNMS shirt is going on:
   - how's it gonna be?
   - what sizes will be available?
   - how much will it cost?
   - what about non-us members? (I live in Chile)
   - can we have a bang path address instead of the arpaish? (just kidding)
   Can someone expllain these points to me? (I expect you to answer me,
   rush-mgr ;-) )

  [ Check Meg's post above.					: rush-mgr ]

2) I do not understand the connection between Fear I and Fear II (is there
   a Fear III ????). Someone care to tell me?

3) I don't understand the connection between Cygnus X-I and Cygnus X-I book II
   Frankly they seem independent from each other to me. Someone care to tell
   me?

4) Haven't you ever thought that _La Villa Strangiato_ is just too short?
   (one of you says that in your .sig). What about convincing Lifeson to
   get some more nightmares and putting them into something called
   _La Villa Strangiato II: the return_ ;-) ?

5) Where the hell are the old TNMS issues? (1..250) They just weren't
   where they were supposed to be (and I did look in the alternative address:
   that's why I'm asking).

Not quite.  The signature of a black hole is an X-ray source, caused by the
matter of a companion star entering it.  Cygnus X-1 is the first X-ray
source found in the constellation Cygnus, and it is real and assumed to
be a black hole.

My second-favorite-group is They Might Be Giants, if anyone cares.  Great
lyrics, making heavy use of symbolism and imagery.

hi everyone, to me now its clear that everyone wants to have an (semi)official,
CD (or possibly tape) or rare and unrelease material.  I'm still investigating
this question, and wrote e-mail to the guy in San Antonio to help me put
this project together.  Yesterday I looked at my '45 collection and found
many goddies that could be in one of these CDs.

Basically what I found is a set of 10 songs that are from a bit shorter version
to REALLY compress versions.....here is what I found.

Name of song           CD Time         Single Time
------------           -------         -----------
The Twilight Zone       3:17            2:41
Lessons                 3:51            2:58(!!!)
Closer To The Heart     2:53            3:06 (longer in the single version)
The Spirit of Radio     4:54            3:00(!!!!)
Tom Sawyer              4:33            4:07

Limelight               4:19            4:01
Subdivisions            5:34            4:23
The Big Money           5:35            4:32
Time Stand Still        5:07            4:42
The Pass                4:51            4:04

So how about that? I wonder how they made these songs shorter...I know
that they are many more singles witch I don't own (would like to though),
I seen singles from Permanent waves with shorter Freewill..

I think this stuff should also be included with a b-sides tape or cd.

Cygnus X-1 is a real X-ray source (hense X-1) found within the Cygnus star
group.  It was the first such object identified, and is believed by many
astronomers to be the best candidate for an actual black hole.  So, Peart
knew his stuff here.

Rob Halsey has been wondering just what Geddy's fascination is with beer. I
think it is perfectly obvious, although it may not be to someone who has never
partaken. Beer is a "Good Thing" and we should all drink some. It is one of
life's great pleasures to have a few quiet relaxing pints with friends, as of
course is swinging round a lamp post f**ked up out of your mind at three in
the morning after consuming copious amounts of strong ale. But that's another
story...

Nicholas Mascari, I find no harm in mentioning what other bands we like. What
is the rush-mgr for if not for acting as an EDITOR? After all, he/she has
nipped the Neil Peart rumour post in the bud quickly and effectively.

Personally speaking, Rush are only one of my favourite bands. The others would
include (in no particular order) KISS, the whole Seattle scene, the Beatles,
Cheap Trick, Yes, Black Sabbath (and related bands), B-52s, Metallica ad
infinitum! I think it is quite interesting to see what we haven't got in
common as well as what we DO have in common!

re: Glen Reids post about Cygnus/Black hole. You are right about the
plauasibility of a black hole being in the Cygnus constellation, but you
are probably unaware of how right you might be! The X-1 was not tacked on
by Peart, but it is an actual astronomical term. It is conventional to call
a major X-ray source by the constellation in which it appears, followed by
X-number. Indeed, there IS a Cygnus X-1, Cygnus X-2, and so on. BTW,
it is hypothesized that black holes would be extremely powerful X-ray
sources, and Cygnus X-1 was once considered a prime candidate for black
holiness ;). I havent followed the literature, so I am not sure if this is
still the case.

Hello, hello! I think this ought to go in the FAQL, but that's just IMHO.
The fact is, Cygnus X-1 was the only known stellar object for a while that
had a good chance of being a black hole. Yest, it's for real, no part of it
was made up by Neil. The Cygnus refers to the constellation it's in when 
viewed from earth. X-1 refer to the fact that it was the first X-ray source to 
be catalogued within Cygnus. Simple, huh? I think it may actually be some sort
of binary system, a light partner (normal star) whose gaseous body is slowly
being sucked into a dark hole partner, creating an enormous disk of inonized gas
around the event horizon of the black hole, in which ions go through enormous
accelerations and decelerations and release X-rays. I get the feeling that
Neil did a v oops a bit of reading on Black holed before coming up with the
song.
