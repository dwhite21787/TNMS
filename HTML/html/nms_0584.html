There were no digests for Thursday, Friday or Monday (12/17, 12/18, 12/21)
because of lack of posts -- everyone seems to be on vacation! Also, the first
part of the FAQ will go out later tonight and the other two parts will follow
on Wed and Thurs.

Considering that I have said I can play most of Neil's stuff, I suppose that
makes me either very talented or very egotistic (the later seems more probable
but who knows?)  So, I will give my own answer to Chris Schiller's question
about how well people seem to think they can immitate Neil.

When I play his songs, I really can't judge how much I sound just like Neil.
Some people seem to think a lot, and some think not so much.  I think there's
a resemblance, but I would never say it's the same (and I wouldn't want it to
be exactly the same--that would be fake.)  I am curious, though, as to the songs
you seem to pick as "easier" and "harder" from the various Rush songs.  I don't
want to start a string of responses as to "Which Rush song has the hardest
drumming in it"...However.
Tom Sawyer: Not that hard, not horribly *easy* to make it sound right, but not
that bad...I'll agree.
Limelight: Not quite as easy as some think.  I've seen lots of people try to
play it, and they usually are WAY off on the bridge and the ending.  Those
things are not always that easy get right...It's not a matter of playing, but
listening correctly many times.
Distant Early Warning: what makes you catagorize this as so difficult?  I think
it's no more complex than Tom Sawyer.
La Villa: Okay, good one there.  That's just requires a good bit of concentra-
tion to get the timing right, no two ways about it.
Digital Man: Huh?  Again, the bridge requires some listening and some mental
acuity while you play...But what else is so tough?

Neil has done an excellent job at making his fills flow in a very melodic way.
It sometimes sounds, until you listen closely, as though more is going on than
there really is.  Many of his fills sounded horribly complex to me until I
took some time to listen carefully.  Those parts are just well composed, and
fill in the space very effectively.  Sometimes they're tough to get the coor-
dination to, but once you do it really sticks in your brain.  Moreover, a lot
of what Neil does involves the same sticking patterns onto different drums or
cymbals.

Lots of people play Neil, some people play it right, and among those that play
it right a decent percent can probably make it sound fairly like Neil himself.
The thing very very very few of us could do, really, would be to come *up* with
such beats and fills that control the music so well.

Hey all you Rushians,
I just read the story about the video of Geddy mowing his lawn.
Hilarious!  Almost as good as the story about the Japan shows.
Can you make a copy for me? :)
Anyway, what is the progress on the tape/CD?  does anyone know?
And finally...
Many people have been discussing Neil's drumming and the difficulty
of it, etc. (by the way, Rush-mgr, could you put these at the end?)
It reminds me of today while I was eating lunch, and people were
watching MTV (another of my pet peeves) on a big-screen TV.  The
two guys I was sitting with began discussing who was a good guitar
player, etc.  The concensus seemed to be that the person who could
play the fastest was the best.  I beg to differ, as the fastest
guitar player I've heard is Yngwie Malmsteen, yet I don't consider him
to be a great musical powerhouse like Rush.  People don't seem to
consider that the playing talent and the songwriting talent don't
always go hand in hand.  Many of the bands I listen to aren't the
MOST talented, yet I like their music because, well, I just like it.
I'd have to say that's how most people pick their music.  Oh well,
my $.02.

   I know this is turning into a ego-or-reality type of discussion. But I
feel the need to reply to at least inform all the non-drummers how many
excellent drummers there are out there without recording contracts.
   First, Chris, you think Digital Man is a more complex/challenging drum
tune than LVS? I practiced along with Signals (and all earlier albums) in my
senior year of high school, 1982, note-for-note, nuance-for-nuance. On the
other hand, I still can't smoothly play some of the middle of LVS. The
guitarist in my band can throw in an Alex riff in the middle of some
completely unrelated song and have it come off. Sadly, our bassist doesn't
have Geddy's finesse.
   To get to the point, yes, there are MANY drummers around who can
effortlessly play most of Neil's work. That doesn't mean they have the
creativity to come up with it. As I've said before, no one else can be
Neil. Same with the rest of Rush and every other truly talented band in
the world.

<A NAME="584005">Subject: Geddy's best bass lines</A>

Greetings fellow Rush fans!
    I thought an interesting topic to discuss would be Geddy's best bass
lines.

    I am a bass player and I have been playing for 10 years now.
Rush has been my main musical influence, obviously.
   Over the years I have learned to play Geddy's bass lines,
some of them were difficult, some were not so difficult.
Here is my list of the most difficult in order of decreasing difficulty
(1 being the most difficult):

1.) The analog kid (those amazin' triplets)
2.) FreeWill (during solo)
3.) La Villa Strangiato (bass riff,VI - The Ghost of the Aragon)
4.) YYZ (some of the bass riffs)
5.) The Big Money (some of the riffs)
6.) Marathon
7.) Show Don't Tell (during solo)
8.) Where's My Thing? (some of the riffs)

    I think it would be interesting to hear from other bass players
or Rush fans what they feel are Geddy'd most difficult.

Well, that is all for now gotta gooooooooooooooooooooo!

                                     All the sacrifice in vain" - N.P.

About two months ago, during an episode of "mtv sports," about 15 seconds of
the begining of "Distant early warning" was played as background to some
mountain bike racing.  I was so happy that I decided to slam a few beers
(actually, come to think of it, it WAS at a party)

Just a bit of trivial information......(for those who care).

I saw the latest (gulp) Rolling Stone and in their listing of the
TOP 10 albums from 10 years ago, they have none other than SIGNALS
coming in at #10.

Hi there!

	A lot of people have been writing to me asking for the
address to write to Neil.  I sent it c/o Modern Drummer magazine. I
don't remember the address, but I got it from somebody on this list
(can someone repost it?).

	There is another address listed in the FAQ...but I haven't
tried it...

	Happy writing!

The first round of shirts (12) were mailed out yesterday, so some of
you should be getting them before Christmas! Sorry about all the delays,
but being away from all the action doesn't help. We're including a
special "bonus" in each package, free with every purchase! :) And
those of you patiently waiting for a reply on your checks, I should have them
by tomorrow and will mail you that I have gotten them.

Hope you like the shirts!
