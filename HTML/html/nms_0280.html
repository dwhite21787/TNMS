Due possibly to power fluctuations during the heavy storms here last
night, the regular edition of the NMS didn't get mailed on time.  It
went out a short while ago today.

Hello out there in computerland. I was reading through a back issue of
Modern Drummer magazine(Aug. 89) And there is an interview with the drummer
for QueensRyche. I knew when I heard him play that he had to have been
influenced by the Prattster, Barron Von Peart-ness. Neil. And when I read
this article, I finally got proof:

MD: I guess Neil Peart made an impression?
SR: Yeah, he was a big influence. Not that I could play Neil Peart licks
right off the bat. But it wasn't just Peart who influenced me, it was the
whole band-Rush as a unit. If one person can play a certain way, the whole
band has got to be able to follow the music and everybody has got to
understand different tome signatures an things like that. I was really
intrigued by Rush's music when they first started. Pearts playing was so
precise yet so radical at the same time.

That's it for the good stuff. I mean the stuff where he talks about Rush. He
sounds like a really nice guy. He's a good drummer, there's no doubt about
that. It's just really good to hear about contemporary hardrock drummers who
don't get fooled by their record deals and sign a contract stating that they
must wear makeup, make videos with slick cars and chix shoving their
Cleveland into the camera. I have yet to see SR point his stick at the
camera and make a really stupid face, thinking he's really cool for ding
DOING that. Unlike some loser bands drummers(Tommy Lee, Rikki Rocket-what a
joke!)he seems to have respect for himself. I'm not totally into Queensryche
or anything(yet), I'm just saying that it's nice to see music being made
without all the B.S. that has become commonplace in it. AND, I give Rush
Full credit in helping to keep the example of what REAL musicians are.
One last note: I think Rolling Stone magazine is the paper equivelant to
MTV. Is it me or do they just plain suck? Rolling Stone AND The Rolling
Stones Can just eat what's under my throne!!!

That's it for me, goodnite.

Paul May:
>Has anyone else out there include ORQs in similar 'official'
>documents?

Okay, okay, this has led me to my first NMS submission...
Herein are various and sundry notes on things I've been seeing
since I joined up several weeks ago.

As Paul's question, when I was a senior in high school, I quoted
the first several lines of "Freewill" on the cover of an English
paper on Moby Dick, which discussed the theme of predestination
in that book.  Several other Rushians in the class (it was a
small class where we all read everyone else's papers) really
appreciated it, at least!

Here's a question about the song Paul quoted, though.  In light
of the modern environmental movement, is the concept of needing
to "tame" nature outmoded?  Although I definately agree science
must be...  All in all, "Natural Science" is still one of my
absolutely favorite songs.

Whoever said a few weeks ago that they find themselves humming
"The clouds prepare for battle..." when a thunderstorm
approaches - me too!

As to the Ayn Rand influence on Neil, I took the opportunity to
read "Anthem" a few years ago, and I have to admit that I was
somewhat dissapointed to find out how much of the plot details
and ideas in 2112 seem to be directly out of that book.  I'm not
accusing him of direct plagiarism, but I got the feeling that
maybe he was too into the book at the time that he wrote the
album to be able to step back and see how many of the overall
themes he was simply paraphrasing from Rand, with some of his
own minor contributions thrown in as plot details (substituting
a guitar for the electrical paraphanelia the book's character
finds, having the "old ones" come back at the end [kind of
corny, IMHO], etc).  I also have to say that from reading a
smidgen of Rand's non-fiction philosophy, I don't agree with her
very much.  I think she carries her individualism to the extreme
of selfishness, but that's my opinion, and I'm not really very
well-versed in her thought.

Now I've probably got y'all mad at me.  Oh well.  I do like the
band quite a bit, although I have to confess that I'm less fond
of their later style (from Signals onwards) than of the earlier
stuff (what I call their "middle period", from about 2112 to
Moving Pictures), although I can appreciate that the quality is
good within that style.

In the "for what it's worth" department, I was perusing my new NeXT's
quotation database, and came across "Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme
chose" (the more things change, the more they stay the same).  It is
attributed to Alphonse Karr, 1808-1819.  Stupid question: who is A.K.?

	if lord byron was alive today he would most certainly be a rush
	fan.  i mentioned last week that lord byron mentioned 'the
	music of the spheres' in his epic _Don_Juan_.  well once again
	i've found some rush trivia in byron's _Don_Juan_.

		Never could she survive that common loss.
		 But just suppose that moment should betide,
		I only say suppose it 'inter nos.'
		 (This should be *'entre nous'*, for Julia thought
		In French, but then the rhyme would go for nought.)

	just some useless trivia.

<A NAME="280006">Subject: Pgh Rush party in August?</A>

Hey youns partying Pittsburgh Rush fans!

	Chuck Nichols has posted recently about having a Rush party here
in our beautiful city of Pittsburgh.  I have agreed to help him organize
it.  Rather than mail directly to all the Pitt, CMU, and other Pgh readers
of the NMS, I've decided to simply post here first (so as not to slight
any interested out-of-towners :-).

	We're trying to set a target date of Saturday, August 3.  That's
all we've settled on so far.  (And even that's not yet in concrete.)  An
idea I'd like to push strongly is having live Rush music, provided by us!
I'm a keyboard player myself, and Chuck plays bass, and I'm sure there are
enough of us musicians out there up for a huge Rush jam session, right?

	What we need *DESPERATELY* is someone in the Pittsburgh area to
volunteer a place to host a potentially large gathering of Rush fans, a
place where live music would not be a problem, if possible.  (Beer etc.
would be a collective effort, of course; we just need a *place*!)  Space
and noise are the only factors, really.  Please reply to an email address
at the end of this post.  Let me know:

	(a) if you want to attend such a party in Pittsburgh on August 3;
	(b) if you'd be up for a Rush jam, and what instrument you play;
	(c) any other suggestions for stuff to do (e.g. Laser Rush?); and
	(d) if it's *at all* possible you could host the party.

LET'S PARTY!

--JC

P.S:  If you know any interested Rush fans who don't use email, have them
      call me (John) at 687-3177 or Chuck at 683-1139 and leave a message.

P.P.S:  The area code here is 412.
