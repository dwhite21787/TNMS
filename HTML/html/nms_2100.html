This is the 100% truth, I swear!

Yesterday afternoon I picked up my new vehicle from the dealer.  After signing
the paperwork, he gives me the keys, I get in and fire up the willing engine,
and what should be on the radio but Tom Sawyer.  Now, what are the chances of
that, eh?

I don't know if anyone mentioned this before...

The preview of Adam Sandler's new movie, The Waterboy, features two songs.
One is Lonely Boy by Andrew Gold the other is the re-mix of Tom Sawyer by
Rush.

That is all.

"It's pretty futile to say who is better than who at that level of

After many years of Rush listening, and listening to the likes of 
Bruford, Smith, Thompson, Bozzio, Vinnie-what's-his-name....and the 
rest, I would just like to agree that at these extremes of ability 
and talent the comparisons are pretty redundent, but yes - fun.

One thing I would add, IMO, only Bruford can approach Peart in terms 
of drum part composition, as opposed to technical brilliance, 
especially on Earthworks and Dig.  

For those who like to cling to the Peart-is-The-Best-at-everything 
axiom, may I suggest a listen to Jeff Berlin's solo projects, Vox 
Humana, and compare Peart playing jazz-rock versus Steve Smith 
playing jazz-rock.  Any comments?

Onward and upward!

ALEX: COOL!!! Man, were gonna get loadsa new fans with this one.
     They're gonna LOVE IT!
JANITOR (sweeping up bits of pizza from the floor): Yeah, I never
     realised Tom Sawyer could sound so different from show to show...
ALEX: But don't you think we should've included Tom Sawyer from the

GED: Well...I suppose we could replace it with Tom Sawyer from Toronto?
JANITOR (scraping bits of pizza back onto plate): WHAT? That was the
     BEST, man!
ALEX (eating bits of pizza): Mmf. Tell ya what. Let's take out Closer to

GED: OK, that makes it a nice rounded group of songs from each era, eh?
Enter the Man from Atlantic: Guys, m'kay. Like wow, man. M'kay. We know

For those Pat Matheny Fans, is not Metheny, it's Matheny.  But I have
to agree, he and his group are the best jazz group right now.  I've
been listening to them since I got into college, in 1985. That Lyle
Mays is one good SOB on the keyboards.  If you have listened to
Travels, their first live album/CD, "Song for Bilbao" is one of their
bests.  I miss them when they were touring early this year.  They
stopped in Atlanta and Melbourne, FL.  But I still have the chance to
see them.

     This pearl was printed recently:
     
     "Neil never has put himself in the position of the all knowing (fans 
     have), but rather, the all wondering."
     
     I couldn't agree more! Once I heard (from who, I do not know), that 
     there is more value in posing difficult questions than in offering 
     easy answers. I agree.
     
     And this:
     
     "If the voices of the fans really helped shape the upcoming live CD
     offering, then let me voice my opinion loud and clear.  Yes, PLEASE, I
     would LOVE a new official video offering."
     
     It's a long shot, but just in case..... YES, I, TOO, AGREE! PLEASE 
     RELEASE A VID!
     
     And this:
     
     "Madge, if you are reading this, as much as it pains me to say, I 
     actually am impressed with the latest work from the Beastie Boys."
     
     Glad to hear it! And, thanks for addressing me as Madge. It may not be 
     my real name, but, don't ask me why, I just love it. Call me a sucker 
     for late 70s/early 80s commercials, I guess.
     
     This is one of the most positive posts I've ever submitted. I agree! I 
     agree! I agree! Let me add this last bit on a personal note. Last 
     weekend I purchased some new CDs, and, dammit, I love 'em! Radiohead's 
     "OK Computer" has been talked about at some length here, but quickly, 
     it is a fantastic, freaky, work. Sleater-Kinney's "Dig Me Out" is fun, 
     fast female punky rock. And, last but certainly NOT least, Alex 
     Chilton's "1970" is genius garage rock. Get all of these if you don't 
     have them. Or, don't get them if you don't think you'll like them (I 
     don't want to sound self-important & ruin my positive vibe!).
     
     I love you all,
     Madge

bootleg. here's what the seller said. what's wrong with this picture?

HERE IS A MARVELOUS DIRECT FROM THE SOUNDBOARD LIVE RUSH SHOW FROM LATE '95
THAT DISPLAYS THE BANDS TREMENDOUS LIVE POWER AND ABILITY ON THE FOLLOWING
TRACKS ALL LIVE: LIMELIGHT, TOM SAWYER, THE TREES, XANADU, RED BARCHETTA,
FREE WILL, CLOSER TO THE HEART, BY-TOR AND THE SNOW DOG, IN THE END, IN THE
MOOD, THE SPIRIT OF RADIO, THE ENEMY WITHIN, NEW WORLD MAN, DISTANT EARLY
WARNING! A TRUE RUSH MASTERPIECE AND A MUST OWN FOR ALL RUSH FANS OUT THERE!
SOUNDS KILLER! IN MINT CONDITION AND STILL SEALED IN PLASTIC AND UNOPENED!

first of all, they didn't play anywhere in late 1995. secondly, when was the
last time they played bytor or in the end.

what is this thing? what am i missing? the price was reasonable, too.

Chris,
I don't think Neil says that his unspoken holy vows *are necessarily*
thoughts to keep well hidden.  When I hear the line, I think Neil is listing
those things as separate.  This is how I interpret it:

"I've got: 1)Idols and Icons
           2)Unspoken holy vows (and)
           3)Thoughts to keep well hidden--the sacred and forbidden..."

The only thing he keeps well hidden are his "thoughts"--some of which are
sacred and some of which are forbidden--but for all we know, those thoughts
may encompass all, some, or none of his "holy vows".  Even if there is a
connection between his holy vows and the thoughts he keeps well hidden, he
never says (or implies) that ALL of his thoughts and/or holy vows are well
hidden.

Jason

PS And another forbidden thought just occured to me:  IMHO, the songs you
mentioned (Ghost of a Chance, Freewill, Totem, etc. and "The Masked Rider")
aren't really that blatant in expressing Neil's beliefs anyway.  That's one
of the reasons for a lot of the bickering on TNMS I think.  Neil is the
master of subtlety (not to say that he's not extremely *un*subtle
sometimes....) and although he does offer his opinions on religious
ideology, very rarely does he actually say anything concrete about his own
beliefs.  And it's clear to me that he does keep a lot hidden.  Geez, just
think if he didn't--what would *we* do?  There'd be no mystery, no
confusion, no reason to really insult each other....

Howdy all.

I didn't write any Rush stuff in the yearbook, but I do have a short
reference to tell about my good ol' high school days.

I was hopelessy lost in my expository writing class when I was a Sophomore
back in '86. We were taking a pop quiz "poetry test" that I was completely
unprepared for. My mind was drawing a blank for any kind of poetry to write
on the spot. Since I was listening to Manhattan Project over lunch,
naturally, I quoted one verse and chorus from that song and turned it in.
(Can you say plagiarism?) Anyways, I got a decent grade on it. No biggie.
Lo and behold, the 1986 BHS writing review came out near the end of the
year and guess what! My teacher had submitted that piece to the review team
and they printed it! argh!

The following year I asked the teacher about why she didn't ask me for
permission to print that article. She simply said "My daughter is a big
Rush fan."  =)

Good day.  Last Sunday (9/6), I decided to avoid the 90-plus degree heat
and forego attending the Columbus Crew/NY-NJ MetroStars game in favor of
watching it on television (Univision Game of the Week).  As much as I enjoy
hearing the now famous Andres Cantor GOOOOOOOOOAL!, I turned the sound down
on the television and tuned the game in on the radio.

After an almost costly Crew turnover, the color man said that a Crew
defender had to make A decision before he could make a QUICKER decision.
The play-by-play man answered, "Hey!  Even if one decides not to make a
decision, one has still decided to make a decision!"

"What?" the color man asked.

"Well, you know, whatever Geddy Lee said."

By the way, it was a good sports weekend.  Crew wins 4-2, Buckeyes win
34-17, Maize and Blow loses to the Irish!

That is all,

This is Eve Plumb, and I'm here to say that it was a vicious

In fact...I love it! Especially Tom Sawyer and CTTH!

It may be that way on the lyrics sheet, but it sure sounds that way on the

If anyone's interested...there is a feature article (with pictures!) in the 
current issue of Country Living on eskimo carvings and sculptures from the 
canadian arctic.  

One sculpture shown is that of the Inukshuk.  For those of you who don't 
know what Inukshuk is, it's the "stone man" on the Test For Echo cover.

It's a very interesting article.

Yo RUSH mates....

Yes please pass on my personal cheers to Eve Plum, tell her I spoke
to Adam.....he says it's still HER fault.....

Whatever....

But seriously folks....I gotta tell ya....I'm usually a pretty stone-cold
sleeper, but
on my recent expedition to Lake Powell, I had a dream that was wild and
encouraging,
and yes it is RUSH related....

However, before I share the good news, the bad news was, the very next night
I had a dream,
a VERY BAD DREAM....seriously....there was an accident and I lost someone
very close to
me and my life, I can't express the anguish and pain I felt.  That person is
OK though, but pray
about the ones you love in your life....it gets you through the tough
times...

Anyway, I don't know specifically how this came to pass, but long story
short my first dream, I had heard
on some radio station that some other station out of San Antonio (like I've
never been there but have
heard they got  a really cool rock radio station), anyway, it was being
announced that there was going to
be a special concert in Montreal featuring RUSH.  It was a celebration of
sorts, celebrating the opening of
a new venue in Montreal, it looked like one of those Canadian Football
Stadiums, but it was a lot more intimate,
at least that's the way it appeared.

I wanted to make the show, but thought I'd never be able to go, well I won
some sort of contest to go back stage
with my wife and meet Neil Peart in sort of a Q/A session with about five
other people.  It was real informal, infact we
were all eating dinner together, and just enjoying the atmosphere....or was
that hemisphere????

We were all there for about 15 -20 minutes before Neil showed up, and it was
sort of odd, he was dressed in
all black garb and almost looked like a shadow of his old self in the pre -
MP days....you know older, but he had the
mustache (I think) and the flowing long hair, though slightly greyed a
bit....

It was a bit uncomfortable at first for everyone, since Neil was there for
us, and we had no idea what to ask him....I mean
obviously we all wanted to know how he was coping with life, but how do you
ask someone you don't really know????
He was very open and honest, but more interesting to talk to than anything,
and yes, he had a great sense of humor.

RUSH was actually midway through completing their next studio disk, so I got
the feeling this was probably between
two to five years down the road...so I guess I still have hope for this
coming true in some way....but RUSH was there, to just
tryout some new songs and get back on stage since they hadn't been there in
awhile.

I asked Neil specifically how the new disc was coming along, and everyone
perked right up, including Neil, that was refreshing.
I asked him if he could release the title of any of the new tracks, and he
told me two of them, one of which I actually remember,
but no I will not share it since I'm currently writing the lyrics for
it...at least part of it....are you listening Neil?????  What I can tell
you is that the titles of the songs, and the shape and form to approaching
this disc was a whole lot like Power Windows...and
Neil confessed to as much, that, for some reason, he wanted to approach a
90's feeling of his most recent impressions on
what the Power Windows of the 90's were....it was fascinating talking with
him, very cool.  It was a feeling of predestination,
like there was a feeling like I had sent some lyrics to Neil, he really
thought long and hard about them, and just generated this song
that he felt was a gem, one of his favorite works...he was quite proud.

Shortly after all of that pre-show stuff, Geddy and King Lerxst came to get
Neil out on stage, and they just kicked into a rip-roaring
show, typical RUSH take off....I never did hear any of the new music
however....long about that time, while sleeping in my boat,
I was nailed in the face with droplets of rain water, as it started to rain
outside.... so I awoke...

I was blown away, literally, I mean like I HARDLY EVER DREAM AT NIGHT, I
just pass out cold....it was extremely refreshing in a
certain kind of way, even though it was just a dream...

I got the sense that the next album was taking so long because Neil was a
perfectionist, and believe me, I'm pretty certain it was
going to be well worth the wait...in fact, it may be the best one yet....

So it was refreshing, especially since, as I mentioned previously, I had a
horrible dream the next night.  Moreover, two days later,
we had an incredible thunderstorm on the Lake, it closely resembled a
Hurricane, no joke, it was very intense for about an hour or so,
totally amazing...there were waterfalls cascading over the plateaus, where
there were no streams previously...some looking harmless,
others looking like they might devaste anything in its way.

That's all for now, keep your dreams alive!!!!

Greetings fellow Rush fans! Long time listener, first time
caller. OK, on to the matter at hand. (Ahem) I recently purchased ASOH
on video (it was great, I loved it, etc.) and when they played La Villa
Strangiato, Alex was singing, but a warning was flashed on the screen
that read something like: "Producer's apology: due to the sensitive and
inexplicable nature of the vocals, they have been deleted from this
segment.". Now my first instinct is that this has got to be a joke. Alex
was pretending to sing, but just mouthing the words. But then I thought
that there was a ghost of a chance that he actually was saying something
and that it was vulgar or obscene. Now if you folks have already gone
over this one, I apologize if I have resurrected a dead horse. But I
would appreciate any help you may have to offer. Are either of my
instincts correct, or am I way off the mark? Thank you for your time, I
now return you to your regularly scheduled listserve, already in

A few things...
1. Best non-rush Live albums thread: Let's not forgot Metallica's
"Live Sh*t: Binge and Purge", with 9 hours of pure, unadulturated
Metallica, or Pink Floyd's "Pulse" with the immortal live version of
"Dark Side of The Moon".
2. I can't believe it. I have actually managed to get someone (a
fellow 16-year old, nonetheless) really into Rush. I guess I'm not
surprised, because he does listen to everything from Primus to Zep to
Jazz to Classical etc. Of course, now whenever I see him in the halls
(we go to the same High School), he sings, "concert HALLS!"
3. DS is coming out a week early? Cool! I won't be going broke on
11/17. Metallica's rereleasing "Garage days" on that day.
4. Totally Non-Rush Related: I've noticed that when people mention U2
on this list, it's always negatively (i.e. "They sold out with Achtung
Baby".) Before anyone else decides to start ripping on one of my other
favorite bands, could you please take the 5 minutes to read this page:

I have never understood the tendency among NMS contributors 
to attack John Rutsey.  It's almost as if people think that 
slagging off his predecessor is a clever way to worship Neil 
Peart.  John Rutsey left Rush because he didn't like the
direction G&A wanted to go in.  What's your problem with
that?  He was a member of a band which released a successful
album, which is more than you can say for yourself, I 
expect.  Leave the guy alone.

Hi Rush-Addicts!

  Here in Brazil, in the 80's, "Tom Sawyer" was the TV show "McGyver"
teaser song. We could hear TS every week playing on TV (just
instrumental parts). 

  And that was how a lot of us, brazilian Rush fans, were introduced to
Rush. One day a friend of mine ask me if I knew Rush, I replied "Rush
what?" and he said "the band which plays the McGyver song"... Some years
after I bought ASOH (aha, casual fans DO buy live albuns), and now I
have all the albuns and consider myself a great fan... :-))))

  Till now when I want to introduce someone to Rush I say "remember the
music that used to play just before McGyver? That's Rush..."

  In the mid-80's the same TV network made a contest and used
instrumental parts of "Red Sector A" as the theme... Really cool! 

May the force be with you!

On the bootleg page of the NMS site, it say's it was unknown exactly where the

I was reminded of this today when listening to the song "Dreamline" (note,
from Roll the Bones), when I heard the lyric "we're only at home when we're on
the fly, on the fly."  Of course, the image of "riding" around on a fly is not
all that appealing, is it?

Thank you Dan! I'm glad to have something meaningful to read! :) Seriously,
though, it's a very good point(s) you were making in the whole message
regarding Freewill, Entre Nous, and Ayn Rand. And as a little side opinion,
I'm quite sure Ayn had MANY emotions she THOUGHT she could explain, but was
wrong about them :)

>From what I can tell, very often Neil will have differing points of view on
the same topic/subject. This isn't to say he's inconsistant (though
sometimes he IS. People do grow and change.), but rather things aren't
always black and white, right and wrong. Hell, he even wrote a song about
it (Color of Right, anyone?) It's something I rather like about his lyric
writing, in that there can sometimes be another point of view on a subject,
and it makes you think.

>.....well, for me it was anyway......

Recently I took a trip to visit my dear friend Trent in his lovely home 
of Edmonton, Alberta.  Our visits with each other are indeed precious 
and few since we are separated by many states and one big black 
international border line, but as is with true and lasting friendships 
we share many things that miles will never divide.  One of which, and as 
fate would have it the very thing that brought us together, is our love 
for RUSH (much to the dismay and misunderstanding of some of our family 
members....alas).

The city of Edmonton has a great custom of fund raising that I was 
totally unfamiliar with since it has never been done here in the south:  
they have lottery homes.  Buy a ticket or two or three, help a charity, 
win a home!  Sounds like a winner to me.  So.....on a beautiful sunny 
Saturday in Edmonton we made a pilgrimage to visit three of these 
beautifully decorated, well appointed dream homes.  As we wandered 
through the second of the three, I look up and see Trent flashing me a 
smile that immediately told me something was up.  Leading me to the 
sofa, still smiling, he tells me that he has found something that I just 
won't believe!  Well, he was right!

Remember I said these homes were 'well' decorated, right?  On one end of 
the sofa has been placed a guitar, with three LPs casually placed around 
it.  On top of the LPs.......I look down and see.......Permanent Waves!  
We laughed!  No one else in that house could possibly understand what 
was going through our minds!  And.....we didn't care!  It was one of 
many moments, it was a sign, it was, for US, something we'll smile about 
for years to come.   

So what did we do?  Well, of course we sat right down and inspected it.  
Every one else is oohing and ahhhing over the house, he and I are sittng 
there reverently looking at RUSH.  Unfortunately it was only the cover, 
or maybe someone had enough sense not to put the LP out, I dunno.   But 
I do know that there she was, just waiting for he and I!  

This happened the Saturday afternoon before I left, and it was the 
perfect end to a wonderful week that I was able to spend with him.  It's 
true, people, the simple things in life mean the most!

Or, maybe I just don't require alot.......I dunno.....

<A NAME="2100037">Subject: Sequencing?!?</A>

Question for all you technological musicians out there.  (I'm a drummer, so
that really doesn't count! :) )  How does Geddy sequence background vocals
live?  I'm specifically referring to parts where he harmonizes with himself in
perfect pitch and perfect time with the song.  I know the boys all have
triggers linked to pedals, keyboards and percussion pads, but I don't
understand how Ged can sing a lead vocal while a prerecorded vocal sings right
along with him at the same time!  If you listen to Mirrors version of Show
Don't Tell, you know what I'm talking about.  Mystic Rhythms is another good
example.....Ged sings the line "Capture my thoughts, carry them away" while a
prerecorded vocal harmonizes over the top, then in the last chorus, he sings
the higher harmony himself.

I know Neil doesn't wear headphones (except during Red Sector A), so they
can't be played on a click track.  As far as I can tell, they are triggered
live, but seem to fall right in with the song's tempo/timing.

I don't think he uses a harmonizer or any similar effect to accomplish this,
but I really don't know what technology can pull off live!  Please enlighten
me, thanks!
