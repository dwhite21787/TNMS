Two points here, Michael.

Second, flaming obscenity such as that only serves to indicate your lack

It is true that Alex created his acoustic stand for playing live, or at least
his version.  However, being a guitar player myself, I'm aware that the
concept was created before Alex created his version.

P.S.  Is there any information about how tall each of the guys are.  I've
always wondered, but have never seen any information about the subject as long
as I've been a fan (at least 15 years).

 - I just found this web site with a Ged interview in Real Audio. No
date given and it's obviously a telephone interview, but the page refers
to the "new" live album. No big news here, just a pretty cool interview
with Ged, although he does sound melancholy at times (or tired, bored. .

Not that I'm any authority, but yes, he did invent the guitar stand. You know 
where they thank "The Omega Concern" in liner notes? That is Alex's 
"manufacturing concern". Cool, huh?

My brother plays the Chapman Stick and is currently working on developing a 
stand for it for when he has to play another instrument during the same piece 
live (as if playing the Stick wasn't enough of a challenge!). If anyone knows 
of such a stand, please let me know.

On another subject, who cares about the fastest or best guitar player? There 
is no such thing as the "best", and unless the fastest guitarist makes you 
feel something through his playing, what good is it? It's about favorites and 
what moves you. If anyone out there gets a chance to see someone play the 
Stick in an intimate setting (or video), DO IT. (It's kind of hard to 
appreciate the talent it takes to play the Stick watching Tony Levin from the 
second level of an arena while the rest of Peter Gabriel's band jams away.) 
Emmet Chapman has a video out from his own performances in 1985 and he is 
phenomenal.

There's a connection, alright. Metallica was just saying thanks to Rush for 
writing great music, being such a big inspiration, and influencing them. Yeah 
they might sound different from Rush, but these guys grew up listening to 
70's music. In the "Cliff 'em All" video, Cliff Burton and Dave Mustaine are 
blurting out names of bands that have influenced them and one of Cliff's 
blurts was "Rush". Hence the red Rickenbacker, I guess. I bet Metallica 
would still get my blood flowing if Cliff was still around. Just my 2 cents.

My brother and I have maintained for years that Michael Giles and Bill Bruford 
are the same person. I'm assuming you meant to pose the same question. You, 
my friend, have very good ears. I'm glad there is someone else in the world 
who has picked up on this.

Rush content: I heard Geddy Lee doing a "guest DJ" show on 98Rock in Baltimore 
back in like 1984 and he played "Frame by Frame" from King Crimson. At age 
13 or 14, it was the first I had ever heard of Crimson and it blew me away. 
Thanks Geddy!

Hi everyone,

I just got round to listening to the NMS mpeg3 and all I have to say is
WOW.  Even though it's not really useful to me until I work at a company
with a fast net connection and good speakers at my desk!  :-)  Who
chooses the playlist?  And when can we expect to hear some bootleg
tracks???

   [ The playlist is chosen at random by the computer, based on the songs
     we input into it. We might at some time put "live & rare" tracks on
     the server; in the meantime, we've put Rush-related tracks as well,
     including stuff from Victor, Neil's solo stuff, Battlescar... more
     to come! We are also considering an "all-request" hour via irc or
     icq...                                                    : rush-mgr ]

Anyway, even over my 56k modem connection, the sound is really good.  In
fact, I think it sounds a lot better than most RealAudio files I hear.
Am I right here, or is it just that I am influenced by quality of the
material?  ;-)

Cheers,

To fans of "Prime Mover"

Has anyone ever noticed that in ASOH, Geddy's bass notes is
different during the second half of the chorus.
I like it a lot during ASOH.  I kinda wished it was like that
on the album.  If you don't know what I mean, listen
to the third and fourth "From the ..." in each chorus.
The bass is playing different notes. 

To fans of "Manhattan Project"

On "Power Windows" during the solo, where the symphony
kicks in, you can hear Geddy.  It's pretty neat, it's like a chorus
of people in pain as bombs are going off.  Now, I know that
may not be the intention, but that is what I perceive it to be.  He
seems to do a lot of separate choral chants and moans during the
solo, and as the song goes into the last verses, he still is doing it a
bit.

Any comments, please e-mail me...

Disclaimer on above information:  Then again, I wouldn't know how
to pour water out of a boot, if the directions were written on the

show in the DS package, I was SO hoping it would be a Hemispheres tour show. 
I would love to hear that live (a Rush release, not a crappy bootleg). I like 
having the early versions of Xanadu and CttH live, but Hemispheres side one 
is the bastard child of live Rush releases. Come to think of it, so is Grace 
Under Pressure, with Signals a close third. Just 2 more cents from me.

Good day, everyone.

I think this will make for some good reading in future issues. (Pardon me if 
this has been done before, I've only received TNMS for a few months now.)

What was YOUR introduction to Rush? Who, what, where, when, and how?

Have fun,

<A NAME="2178029">Subject: RE: Rush covers your favorite songs</A>

The 3 songs I would like to hear Rush cover are:

1. "I am a Tree" by Guided By Voices, from "Mag Earwig"

2. "Cuts You Up" by Peter Murphy, from "Deep"

3. "Rearviewmirror" by Pearl Jam, from "VS."

I picked these probably because they sound a bit Rush-like to begin with. 
Hell, "Rearviewmirror" sounds like Pearl Jam covering a Rush song! Maybe we 
should list out-of genre songs instead.

took a few weeks but he eventually got back to me and what he had to say  was 
rather interesting....  here it is

"I will be setting up a website for Neil sometime in the future.  Right now I
just have the domain pointing to my Helmet website.  Yes, I know Neil is the
drummer for Rush.  He's the reason I have played drums for the last 15 years
and I think he is one of the best.

Pretty neato huh?  Well I wrote him asking about the page in specific but 
haven't gotten anything yet.  I'll let you guys know if he gets back to me

I realize everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I had to
respond to the post about Geddy Lee vs Chris Squire. First of all, I
agree that Chris Squire is a great bassist. But he doesn't have anything
on Geddy in my opinion! And to say that you think Chris Squire is a
better bassist than Geddy Lee hands down makes me wonder, are we talking
about the same Geddy here or what?

No Rush content!!!  This had to be corrected!!

Here is the list of drummers for each live Genesis CD:

1.  Genesis Live:  (1972) Phil Collins on drums.  Peter Gabriel on Bass
Drum.

2.  Second's Out:  (1977)  Chester Thompson on drums, except for "The
Cinema Show."  This is the only track to feature Bill Bruford.  Phil
Collins plays with Chester on other songs (Suppper's Ready, Los
Endos...)  One more thing, "Watcher of the Skies" is not on this one!

3.  Three Sides LIve:  Chester Thompson.  Phil plays drums with him on
various songs (Abacab, The Medley...)  The new remastered CD contains
the original English fourth side live. This has Chester again, except
for the Watcher of the Skies/IT medley.  Bruford plays on that one (Phil
joins in on the fun at the end of "Watcher.")

4.  The Way We Walk:
The Longs:
The Shorts:
Made up of mostly Chester Thompson.  Phil does play alone and with
Chester on a couple of tunes!!  

There is your Genesis lessson for the day.  See ya!!!

"Bad Boy was originally by Larry Williams.  It was a cover that the Beatles

<A NAME="2178038">Subject: Dream Theater - Rush Comparison</A>

To he whom spoke of the Rush - Dream Theater comparison...

Yes, Dream Theater is still a band that tends to overplay (especially
Mike Portnoy, he uses that double bass pedal distastefully very often).
Although, I think the ironic fact is that so many of us Rush fans point
out their chops as a flaw and a lack of emotion, while a lot of people
are saying the same thing about Rush!

Also, in an interview with Guitar World prior to the release of their
last album, Falling Into Infinity, Petrucci stated that he felt like
that band was "growing up", and trying to write songs one at a time with
feeling and groves, and I think the last album reflects that. He said
his ultimate goal is to write an album like Dark Side of the Moon that
reaches people of all ages for years to come.

Now that they've got five albums under their belt, perhaps they are
ready to take the step into becoming more song oriented. While I would
never bash any of the first Rush albums, I'd say they did take their
time experimenting and showing off their chops before they really got
down to some great song writing.

Happy listening, and check out Falling Into Infinity, particularly the
song "Lines in the Sand", awesome guitar solo.

<A NAME="2178039">Subject: Squire Vs. Lee</A>

With these two, I'd give the title to Geddy. Squire is good, but Geddy
is a bit more imaginative I feel. In Geddy vs. John Myung (of DT) I give
it to Geddy hands down. He isn't the technically better of the two, but
his bass lines are a bit more creative, and his tone is far superior.

In the world of Rock n Roll, Geddy is probably the king of bass, but if
you want to hear the bass used in some very expressive ways: Abraham
Laborial writes some very beautiful pieces of music with a lot of
chordal passages. Louis Johnson II, a hell of a funk bass player. Jeff
Berlin, a man with amazing timing, and outstanding compositional skills.

Of course, they aren't _singing_ while they play! Ged is still the man
for that, and for fitting such creativity into more "song based" songs
such as The Trees, Limelight, CTTH, etc, etc...

It will be cool when the dvd comes out, eh?

How 'bout this. I don't disagree with the Sholz pedal info, but I think =
were both right here. My mistake came about when I said he didn't use =
the pedal. My thinking was for CTTH, when the original question was =
regarding Driven (I think). So I'll buy what you say about the Sholz=20
pedal, let me say it sounds sweet in the intro to NH. Al DOES however, =
play his PRS for CTTH, and (I think) the acoustic "pickup" can be heard =
from 3:38 thru 4:29 on DS (possibly my favorite little jam on DS). So =
maybe we're both right.

Again, it will be cool when the dvd comes out.

    Don't you guys ever read the tourbooks, or liner notes? (or for that
mater, previous Backstage Club newsletters?)  I'll have to double-check
to verify, but Mr. NP wrote in his usual "State of Uur Band on Tour
Address", somewhere around PW or p/g, he wrote that AL did indeed design
and build his own stand that he uses f/ his 'spanish' in all of the
acoustic phrases of their numerous songs that include such strains.  As
I recall, AL even tried to make a go of it as a manufacturing business,
i.e for other guitarists--NP referred to it as "The Omega Concern"
which I believe you'll find amongst the credits in the liner notes for
PW.  As I recall, it was originally because they were having difficulty
in not only timing of the "stage swaps" from acoustic to electric
quickly enough ("The Trees" & "CTTH"), but also protecting the somewhat
delicate hollow-body of the spanish from impacts from the heavier
solid-bodied electrics when the latter would swing about at the end of
the straps, (&c.).  And, yes, I also recall reading somewhere amongst
their voluminous stories (@ yyz.com?) about the reading lamp for
GL...Also, if you read the transcript from the "Rockline" radio
interview for the Counterparts' tour, I believe there's an anecdote
about an "egg cup holder" AL made for NP.  AL has the reputation within
the "inner circle" of being not only the inventor of the bunch, but also
as quite the gourmet cook, "zoomie pilot", and all-around prankster,
(e.g., HRH Lerxst, &c.), and those are just but a FEW of his many (some
obvious) talents...
    Somebody double-check me on this and hold me accountable for
accuracy, please?

But I heard something about Rush coming up in the end of the year.

Does anyone knows where I can get the dates for 1999 tours, shows and

I really need to know that, because I am going to be in Toronto in the

Hey Terri,  My four year old son knows most all of  CTTH.  I was
listening to DS one day and he commented on the "captain song".  I
played it for him and he has since learned it almost verbatim.  He has
also progressed to "Driven" and "Test for Echo".  What a kid!!

Other drummers I think are amazing:

William Calhoun of Living Colour (R.I.P.) - amazing guy with a
relatively small kit

Scott Rockenfeild (sp?) from Queensryche - just an all-around good
player

Tim "Herb" Alexander from Primus (formerly) - this guy is just amazing -
period. I am not a Primus fan, but...

Danny Carey from Tool - just a damn good player

What doya think???

The Judge<

Dude, I agree all the way. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Seriously, I saw Will Calhoun at Musicians Friend in Eugene, Oregon when
he was doing a workshop tour. OH MY GOD. He played a little exercise by
playing his bass drum with one foot at a speed of about 4 beats per
second for -get this- 10 minutes solid and he did not lose tempo. It was
tiring just watching him do it. He had a hi-hat that was modified to be
two china-boy style hi-hat cymbals. He played them by pressing on the
pedal and releasing quickly. I also have photos. And an autograph on my
ticket from 1990 in Portland, Oregon on the Time's Up tour. Look for a
link later to the best of my photos of Will. I also have an autograph
from Herb. 1991 in Salem, Oregon. Anthrax, Public Enemy with Primus
opening. He signed my ticket; Yo Herb. How cute!!! I'll put up a jpg of
that too. Soon I'll have jpgs of the Rush show in 1997 in Portland.
Danny Carey is unreal. I've seen him 3 times and I can barely do
anything else but watch him. Amazing fills and poly-rhythms and all that
other percussion stuff. He rocks. I don't care about Queensryche. HA!
