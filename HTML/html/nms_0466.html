Well, since it's been forever since I put together an issue of the NMS
(since what, Monday?), a lot of mail has piled up here.  There will be
two issues today, and probably two tomorrow to beat down the queue.  After
that I should be caught up, but will probably be behind Monday due to the
weekend traffic.

The big news off the top of my head:  A Rush Newsgroup is now out there.
After the vote for rec.music.rush got shot down, someone out there created
the group 'alt.music.rush'.  It's been online since about Wed. morning,
and has seen a bit of traffic already (many from me, too).  It's as I
expected, even less S/N ratio than here, but hey, check it out if you have
readnews.  The NMS FAQL was already posted by some member whose name escapes
me now - that was probably a good idea.  It may keep down the stupid posts,
but we'll see.  Already Neil is dying of cancer and lukemia over there... :-)

I'm still catching up on the administriva mail, but I've processed all the
unsubscriptions and address changes I saw.  I still have about 80 subscriptions
to wade through!!!

First about the bandana... Who started that???  Second  The Fly Boot, Who can

anyone have a copy of Primus dooing YYZ?  I just got Miscellaneous Debris by 
them and its real good stuff, but no YYZ :(  Last but not least I just wanted
 to say that im intereste
d in facts about the musical life of RUSH and how, where to get more music, 
but the box set argument is slightyly confused.  I dont want a best of RUSH 
box set.  I want hard to find live/old/unreleased songs/versions and maybe 
some background info on the m

No, you're not the only one.  Mozart is my favorite classical
composer.  Actually, I think anyone with the intelligence to
listen to Rush should really give some classical music a try
as a worthy supplement to their already excellent musical diet.

A related question - are there any other Rush fans out there
who also happen to be into Todd Rundgren?  His music is quite
different from that of Rush, but he is just as extraordinary of
a composer in his element as Rush is in theirs, and much of his
music also has challenging chords and changing time signatures.

And finally, concerning suggestions of ways to bring Rush to
the attention of the mainstream... Why?!?  What positive effect
would it have?  The band is successful enough so they can do
exactly what they want without worrying about the mass market.
Becoming massively popular would almost certainly bring more
pressure on Rush from record company executives to do commercial
rock, since they would be seen as a possible route to a record
company goldmine.  I'd much rather see the band stay just as
they are.

Well, I don't know where all of you have been living the past few years,
but here in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio, (insert sarcasm), our boys get
more than enough of their fair share of radio airtime! The best by far
is WMMS 100.7 who happens to be the first American radio station to
play Rush, look inside your RUSH debut album!!). Other stations where
I have heard significant Rush play are 98.5 WNCX and 97.5 WONE. Will you
people quit whining??? I don't think Cleveland is much different than
any other big American city in this country. I mean, just because you
don't hear "Tom Sawyer" or "Limelight" the instant you flip on the radio
doesn't mean you just turn it off, assume they never play Rush, and
cry to this mailing list about the American listening public. Give me
a break!! 99% of their concerts sell out!!! There is a huge Rush following
in this country. It just seems that it's more "underground" than say some
cheesy sleazy glamour band like GNR.

Now I hear this crap about "making people listen to them" or "re-intro-
ducing them." To me, it sounds like you want "to make them popular."
F**k that!!! Who the hell cares if they're popular or not!?!? Who the
hell cares whether they win a grammy?!?!? Obviously, Ged, Alex, and Neil
don't, so WHY SHOULD YOU?!?!? Don't get me wrong, I'd LOVE to see them
win a grammy, but I honestly don't take it personally. It's apparent that
they get get satisfaction not from a gold phonograph sitting on their
mantle, but from the personal enjoyment they get from producing MUSIC.

My God!! Can't you just pop in 2112, Moving Pictures, or whatever and
play some air guitar or pretend you are Neil with the old air drums and
enjoy it for yourself with your fellow Rush fans!?!?! Why do you think
it's your duty to make other people like the same music you do????

Believe me, I could go on forever, but in a nutshell, I am saying what Neil
would say, "GET A LIFE!!!" I have better things to spend my time on
than trying to make Suzy Fluffchick like Rush instead of Boyz 2 Men. Like
getting good grades and drinking beer.

I think I've said enough for one issue. I realize this and my previous
post are serious flames and I invite any rebuttal (or support) posted
to the list. It's certainly a better thing to argue about than whether
Neil has cancer or is a gypsy!!!!

<A NAME="466006">Subject: Re: Peart and women; GOAC</A>

I don't agree with Brian Colby as far as Peart writing songs about the
advancement of women.  While it is certainly a worthwhile thing to be aware of,
I think Rush has more class than ot bow down to the "politically correct"
movement as bands like REM and Jane's Addiction have.  Rush's lyrics may
not center around women, but if that's what someone wants to hear, he or she
can listen to Warrant.  Their lyrics are not offensive to women, so they
shouldn't change them unless the band has a sudden change of heart.

On another note, what do you all think about Rush releasing Ghost of a Chance
as their latest single?  Its a decent song, but I think others (e.g. Face Up)
are better.  It also bothers me that the song is so obviously meant for the Top
40.  Well, at least Rush released three songs from RTB before this one.  Its
better than the typical glam routine of releasing one hard-core song to
get all the old fans to buy the album before they sell out and release a
cheesy lovesong for the pre-teen audience.  Anyone else feel this way?

(I welcome your opinions..)

    Hello, it has been a while since I posted....here goes nothing.

     About the concern about the picture on the cover of Cos; I have no doubt
in my mind that it is indeed the Necromancer that is depicted. For those of
you CD owners out there it might be a little bit difficult to see exactly what
is on the cover, but upon gazing at my LP record I can see the Necromancer
standing atop the crest of a mountain with a snake at his feet and a prism
floating in front of the Necromancer at about waist high. This must be the
"Magic Prism Eye(s)" that are discussed in the song. --Probably my favorite
album cover(I have it on my door; It keeps hooligans away).

     Oh yeah, before I forget, (I know that this list has many ELP and Yes 
fans)Yes and ELP are scheduled to appear on IN CONCERT next Friday night 
(april 17).
If I`m not mistaken theses are #2 and #3 favorite bands of the NMS reader!

Hope everybody has fun at Deer Creek....I wish I was going!

Ah, Danforth and Pape. Yes, this is indeed an intersection in
Toronto - it's in a middle-class ethnic Greek area, oddly enough, in the
east-central part of the city. A friend also noticed the
intersection on the map, and when we did our Rush Pilgrimage to
Toronto, I discovered that there's a subway stop right at the
intersection (I forget the name of the station). So of course I
immediately hopped the turbine freight and rode right out there.

There didn't appear to be anything extraordinary about the place,
excepting of course that all the signs were in Greek. For you
true trivia freaks out there, The Intersection Itself was
occupied (as of May 1989, anyway) by three banks and a Baskin-
Robbins that posted flavors in Greek as well as English.

As for how all this fits into the "La Villa Strangiato" scheme of
things - or what Danforth and Pape signified to Torontoids in
1978, when the song was composed - I know not. I leave such
weighty matters to our Canadian froinds and/or other experts to
cogitate upon.

<A NAME="466015">Subject: Suggestion on tour dates</A>

Just a suggestion (and forgive me if this has been brought up and
rejected in the past): Why not post the latest tour dates at the
top of every edition of TNMS? Three strong arguments in favor:
Even though they're available at the ftp site, it would be a lot
easier for everyone to see 'em this way. Second, judging from the
tremendous and constant demand for tour info, it would be a
greatly appreciated public service. Third, and perhaps most
importantly, it would surely cut down on, or eliminate entirely,
the dozens (hundreds?) of "When-are-they-gonna-play-in-xxxxx?"
posts that seem to be filed repeatedly.

Of course, such an every-issue List of Dates would have to be
accompanied by the standard disclaimers: These are not official;
TNMS has no connection with Rush; dates can change or disappear
at any time without notice; if your city isn't listed here, we
don't have any information on it; and if you have any info for
us, please post it. Even including the disclaimers, I daresay
we'd end up saving bandwidth in the long run by eliminating all
or most of the posted tour-date questions in return.

I know that with this tour perhaps past halfway, now may not be
the best time to suggest this. But it's just a suggestion.

<A NAME="466018">Subject: no popularity</A>

For all of you who seem to want to make RUSH the most popular band in the
free world, I can sympathize, they being the best.  However, consider this:
 if RUSH comes out with a #1 album and a few #1 songs, esp. ballads, and
every 15 girl develops a crush on Geddy's nose, then all us real RUSH
fans well never be able to get good seats at the conserts, they'll be
taken by a bunch of made-up dolls with big hair and their smooth-dancing
boyfriends. Comrades, that is NOT a RUSH crowd, and we shouldn't want it
to be. RUSH needs no more recognition than they already get, they'll still
make the best music regardless.

PS- Neil wears a bandanna cuz he's really a pirate. He doesn't wera
wear (sorry) his large golden earring because it gets caught on his
drumstick during Tom Sawyer.  He changed his family name from Blackbeard
to Peart for fear of persecution from the British government.

ALso, to the guy who was curious about the significance of the 24th of may,
I believe its some sort of Canadian Independence Day, or maybe it's
Bastille Day, borrowed from the French.

so long and thanks for all the fish

A couple of thoughts I thought I would share in my first TNMS post:

1) In respose to Glen Reed's post asking which instrumental people like best,
my vote goes to La Villa Strangiato.  I tend to like the longer songs, and I
think that La Villa is filled with beautiful melodies, complex structures, and
everything else that I could want.

2) In response to the post asking what significance the 24th of May has, it is
Canadian independance day, which accounts for the fireworks display.  And, yes,
Lakeside Park is a real place, not to far from Toronto, I believe.

I am looking for something other than a .VOC that was just digitized input

Hello,

a month ago I posted a request for questions for an interview with
Alex. Thanks to all who sent me questions, but you may remember that
I was asked with whom I wanted to do an interview, and asked for Neil,
but got Alex. Well, now I've been told it's going to be Neil!

So if anyone has questions or even just a message for Neil, mail it
to me before April 23rd! If anyone has a good idea of how to present the
NMS to Neil, tell me! Perhaps we could make a special edition.

The interview is going to be face to face and about 30 minutes long.
It'll be in Koeln, Germany at noon before the concert on the 23rd.

Hello.

  I received your message Nicholas and would like to thank you for your
oppinion.  That's all it is, your oppinion.  I still think that I'm not the
only one that thinks Rush should be recognized more.

  In regards to a different note.  When do the tickets go on sale for the
Merriweather Post Pavillion show on June 16th.  I might wanna go to see them
again.  If anyone knows, please post it here so everyone can see.

  And finally, has anyone here been to the old Rush concerts.  Such as 2112.
A guy on my local BBS was supposed to tell me how the 2112 concert was, but
he hasn't returned a reply yet.  Just curious as to how fascinating that
concert was.  I think out of all the legal live albums (I have none of the
bootlegs) All the World's a Stage, is my favorite.  But they are all good.
In fact there isn't a Rush album that I don't like.  What the heck am I
talking about. :)

That's it for now.

<A NAME="466028">Subject: Why they don't write 'em like that anymore</A>

  A while back, several people remarked that the subject matter
of many of Rush's songs have changed over the years.  (big
surprise there!)  Think about it: when you're young, doing
what you love to do (ie make music), wildly successful, it's
easy--even invigorating--to embrace such a "me-first" mentality
such as objectivism.  As you grow older, despite past successes,
it seems to me that it would be more clear that while a self-
serving attitude does after all serve oneself, society on the
whole tends to suffer.
  Certainly we can argue the merits and faults of objectivism
(yes, it has both) until we are blue in the face.  (In other
words, flames/responses via private email, please.)  But simply
thinking about the mentality of:
"Begging hands and bleeding hearts"
versus
"I feel my heart resist/But I open up my fist..."
should make it clear that Neil's views have matured to a
degree.
  Or maybe I'm just confused.  I doubt it.

PS I read that Extreme's Gary Cherone will be filling in for
Freddie Mercury with Queen at that memorial concert/fund-
raiser in England on the 20th.  I'm sure he'll be just as
good as Freddie........NOT!

<A NAME="466029">Subject: songlist generator / Neil is U2 fan</A>

I saw in the last NMS where someone was trying to calculate the average
length of a Rush tune. I expect I should say "Get a Life!", but instead,
I'll offer anyone who wants it a piece of code I've been thrashing out
for the past few months. It's supposed to read a list of songs from a
text file and figure out a good fit on to a minimum number of tapes.
(I dumped every Rush tune I own onto tapes for the car - 13 tapes)

You can specify different tape lengths, from 15 min to 6 hours (VHS),
ask for efficiency displays, and choose a maximum load for a tape -
i.e. instead of cramming it 100% full leaving no lead-in/lead-out time,
 only use 98% of the capacity. The output shows how to split the list
of songs up to reasonably fill tape sides, plus gives a few statistics,
such as the running time of the top 10% longest songs, a course breakdown
of all running lengths, and a rough median time.

There are two versions of this: a fully automatic version, and a
"hand iterated" version. The "hand" version will not perturb the original
order of the songlist while distributing the songs across tapes.
(like if you want Fear I, Fear II and Fear III together...)

If anyone's interested, I'll wing you an example of input & output, and the
C source. Maybe this can get posted to syrinx, if there's enough interest.

Hi,

Just a few things that occurred to me while reading the last couple of
issues...

1. Heard on KOME last night about 11:30 that Rush is coming to the Bay Area on
May 31.  Tickets go on sale next week (they didn't say which day).  Probably
the Shoreline Amphitheatre, but they weren't sure.

2. For the guy whose wife was looking for Rush tunes for aerobics, I thought
"Force Ten" sounded pretty fast and kicky... :-)

3. For Aaron Silverman, who gave us more info on the movie "Xanadu": Ol' Blue
Eyes was  nowhere near that movie.  That was Gene Kelly, and he put in a rather
nice performance, I thought.  But yes, the movie was pretty cheesy nonetheless.

If anyone finds out the exact date when tickets go on sale for the Bay Area,
let me know, eh?

<A NAME="466031">Subject: A Piece of Rush Trivia, Laser Show Update, A Confession, and Politics</A>

    Well, this is probably too ridiculus to mention but here goes...

    I recorded the soundtrack to the upcoming Rush Laser Show at a
local radio station back in January.  They of course had one of those
CD players that will advance frame by frame (1/47 sec, I think).
I recorded Didacts and Narpets as an intro to Tom Sawyer (try it, it's
great!).  Anyway, I advanced to the first frame of TS and played just
that frame.  What I heard was a big BOOM!  Just the bass drum!  I guess
Neil was so anxious to record Tom Sawyer that he started a fraction of
a second early.  Show some control next time Neil :)

    BTW, I finished the first two songs to the laser show (Broon's Bane/
Trees live, and The Spirit of Radio).  I played it for an audience after
one of our traditional planetarium shows and they loved it (Whew!).
Right now I'm closing with Working Man and Roll the Bones, but I'm
considering dropping those two in favor of Cygnus X-1.  Any opinions on
which way to go?  E-mail any opinions, please.

    Oh, yeah.  Can you believe I have never been to a Rush concert?
I don't expect to make it to one this tour either.  Makes me feel like
a virgin at the Rocky Horror Picture Show ("Virgin.  Virgin.  Peel his
bandana, Roll his Bones...").
