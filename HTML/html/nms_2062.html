Sorry for the lack of digests recently, I just went through a job change
and it's thrown me a bit out of whack (hey Todd, I still live! :-)
So I'll be trying to get caught up all this week.

In other news, I have had a second confirmation that "Animate" is
going to be the first single. I have also heard the new album's release
date is September 29th. So now I've heard the 22nd, 29th, and October 6th.
It's a good bet that it'll be released within those three weeks!

Hi All,

I don't know about you guys, but the 3rd "special thank you to the fans" CD 
entitled "A Farewell To Kings" sounds kind of like "see you later'ish" to 
me, for awhile anyway ... in a nice way.  Then there's "Dimlit Stages for 
All Ages" .... hmmm, now that's interesting. I wonder it means?

I have all kinds of ideas going right now and not enough time to type, what 
do you guys think?

    You know, I saw Neil Peart one time at a drum clinic (this was
back about two years ago) I never got to meet him, but I know for sure
he's the best multi-percussionist in the whole world as we know it.
Now!!!! all of the sudden, alex van-halen comes out here acting like a
dumbass bringing bongo and conga drums out on the stage acting like
he's cool and bad, and he never uses them once!!!

<A NAME="2062007">Subject: An idea for the Upcoming Live Set</A>

I have a suggestion for something that could prepare the public for the
upcoming Rush Live triple-CD.  Not that Rush would do such a thing, but it
might be a worthwhile effort. Here goes:
	Rush should release an EP of songs from the live set as advance
promotion.  My understanding of an EP is that it is a record release
usually containing between 4 and 7 songs- it's longer than a single, but
not really a full-fledged album.  In this case, why not make it a four
track CD with the live version of "Animate" (which is expected to be the
first track released to radio, and a damn good song nonetheless), a track
from the CP tour, a track from the T4E tour, and something from the
Hammersmith Odeon show (which will make up the 3rd CD)?  Add a tour
picture or two and some version of the Cover Art for the Live Set, and
*boom* there's a sampler of the Live Set.   
	The EP format is just a starting idea.  It could contain
different things like that remix of "Tom Sawyer,"  that extended jam
version of "Bravado" from the RTB tour (did Rush perform that again on
some shows on the Cp tour? Didn't see it in the Worcester (MA) Centrum
show), or something that just missed inclusion in the boxed set.  The EP
doesn't even have to be a CD- it can be available as a tape or a 7-inch
record (doing the indie/punk thing, eh?).
	This EP could be just the thing to satisfy both old and new Rush
fans.  It gives the old fans something new to add to their collection.
The new fans can get a better idea of what Rush is all about; this could
be the result after hearing that live version of "Animate" on the radio.
Depending on how many copies are printed, it might very well become a
collector's item for whoever chooses to make the purchase.
	I readily admit- this whole post is my gut feeling.  Accordingly,
it might very well be hot air with an unpleasant odor attached to it.
However, I wanted to share this idea with you and see what you make of it.  
Any and all responses would be appreciated.

<A NAME="2062008">Subject: Long time, no post</A>

Dear fellow Rushians,

Hey, hey!  IT's been a long time since I posted anything so I thought I 
would chime in on the latest trends.  Favorite Lerxt Solo:  Where do I 
begin?  I would have to say 2112 is my obvious favorite, but I really 
like the solo in Double Agent, my favorite song of CP, the solo after 
Part II of Cygnus X-1 and Working Man.  The three solos show Alex moving 
from a hard metal Zeppelin/Cream guitar to one which demonstrates his 
greater attention to contextual qualities in music.  There's no doubt in 
my mind that he is rock's greates contextualist.

Ok, as far as drummers go, Alex Van Halen is not a favorite of mine.  
That's all I will say.

And I will end with a question.  Been listening to 2112 a lot lately 
(mainly because of rather frequent radio play recently) and in "Temples 
of Syrinx" does Ged sing "It's all for one and one for all" or "it's all 
for one and none for all?"  I have the liner notes of the LP and they 
say "one", but every time I listen I seem to hear "none"? Can someone 
please clarify this for me? Thanks.

Palo

Above all else, let it be known that I love all the Lerxst solos! Being a guitar
player myself, its always a challenge to play anything he writes. Nothing is
ever "ordinary". My #1 favorite is the solo to "Red Barchetta". It took a
couple of times of watching him up close to play it like he does but I can.
(if I do say so myself) I read an article where Alex said the solo he's most
proud of was the solo to Limelight. I think that's his best that "flows" with
the song. Of course, let us not leave out both solo sections to La Villa 
Strangiato! Those are hall of famers for sure. I think his solo playing has
taken a back seat to the actual song writing lately. Not that I think the new
solos aren't great. One of the best things I enjoy about Rush is that musically,
you never get tired of listening, or playing their music! Its an enjoyable 
day if you can listen from RUSH all the way through TFE and hear their changing
styles. My two cents worth.

<A NAME="2062010">Subject: Live Track Listing Guess</A>

Looking like we may see a full track listing anytime now...

Thought I'd post my guess first in hopes having the actual one announced
and then being awarded a SYRINX for my outstanding and completely accurate 
guess.  :^ )

Here's my latest live tracklisting guess ... a.k.a. "what I did at work today
when no one was watching").  It is based on the assumption that they are using
only CP and TFE shows. Also that they try and keep show splicing to a minimum.
I think they can spice out songs from one tour easily enough (ala no SoR between
Dreamline and Analog Kid) but I think they would try to eliminate too
many cross tour splices as fan noise would differ depending on the hall
etc. etc.... Okay, so I've spent way too much time thinking about this!

I'm betting the farm on as track listing like this for discs one and two
(times are estimates... though I did consult my bootlegs for guidance):

                                TOTAL TIME =  75.0

What else?
Roll the Bones                  6.0       TFE 
Resist                          4.5       TFE 
Limelight                       4.5       CP

tour
Show Don't Tell                 5.5       CP 
Leave that Thing Alone          6.0       TFE 
drum solo                       7.5       TFE 
Natural Science                 7.0       TFE  remember it was
abbreviated
Spirit of Radio                 5.0       TFE 
Intro/Tom Sawyer                6.0       TFE 
YYZ                             5.5       TFE 
                    
                                TOTAL TIME = 75.0      

Has anyone tried to do this? It's tough! Initially, I really didn't
think to include repeat stuff from other live albums like TomSaw, SoR,
CttH (especially CttH). But looking at the sets from the CP and TFE
tours, and assuming (HOPING!) they pretty much use up the disc time, you
get down to the bare bones. Which is more likely: Double Agent or a 97
rendition of Tom Sawyer? Cold Fire or yet another pass at SoR?  These
two classics haven't seen live album light since 1981. That's 17 years!
Wouldn't suprise me if they included them over the other obscurities, 
especially if this is a "thank you and goodbye" album (gasp!).

Regarding disc times...Can you think of anything more depressing than
finally getting disc one in your player for the first time and seeing:   
		Disc Time  58:25
			or
		Disc Time  61:03

Stuff those puppies full Ged !!!!! Make every minute count !!!!!!

Two last thoughts.... sounds like Alex and Neil were pretty much AWOL 
during this mixing. Might Geddy take sole title as Producer?

Also, on packaging, I agree now with the Rush-mgr, I expect two single
cases, one a doubleCD slim case and another separate single case for the
bonus disc. 

Starting to see mention of the 1978 Odeon date again.  Could the AftK
statements have come from a semi-fan who saw 1978 and said, "oh, yeah I
think that's about the time AftK came out."  

Seriously rooting for HEMISPHERES,
 SB

With all the new talks and anticipation directed towards the live release, has
anyone heard anything about an accompanying videotape to go with?  On TfE,
Geddy and Alex wore the same clothes for every outside date pretty
consistently which makes me believe they were pooling select video to
eventually compile.  The only chance I got to talk to stage management, they
said they were filming and I know everyone said during the tour similar
things.  So if anyone knows anything, please share.

It wasn't remastered and I don't even know if Hold Your Fire was
because they were recorded digitally to begin with.

You're way off there. The last album I can remember is for Power Windows.

<A NAME="2062014">Subject: Re: Rush light show</A>

Hey folks:

Just wanted to say, I thought the most boring light show (at least in Rush
terms..hehe) was the RtB tour. Now, I know Herns designed the show, but they had
some other guy behind the lighting board.  I remember being even slightly
disappointed. BUT...all was redeemed when Herns came back to do the CP show, 
which blew away any previous Rush show, IMHO. Especially the pyro stuff 
during Double Agent and end of Stick it Out. The GIANT fire cones that 
dropped during the bridge/chorus of Double Agent was so damn powerful, I 
could feel the heat, and thought the whole of Maple Leaf Gardens was gonna go 
up in flames...(teehehehe!:)

Then, I couldn't believe they topped it off with the T4E stuff. No pyro, but the
lasers bouncing off of the satellite dishes, and the way Herns beautifully 
carved such magic with the brilliant colours during Resist, plus the BIGGER 
THEN EVER back drop screen just really took me to another level.  The 
lighting effects were timed and patterned so well and beautiful, you almost 
felt as if you where in some alien world! After 20 years of experiencing Rush 
concerts, I didn't think they could out do themselves...but...even to this 
date....they STILL continue to amaze me..

Slim Jim,

I have never heard that red wings meant anything rude in the UK, 
though I don't need to be a rocket scientist to work out to what such 
an image might allude.  Rush content?  Get Alex van Halen off this 
list.  More Rush content?  Does anyone else out there wish Virtuality 
had better lyrics - the tune deserves better surely?

Hello all,
     I spoke to my friend who works with the band and he said that the live
album would be out in the fall probably not untill November.
     He is usually pretty accurate but told me information is hard to come by
when the boys are on a break because he dosen't see them unless they are
working.
     Take it for what it's worth but he has told me dates and info such as
album covers etc... way before anyone knows it.
     I told him I'd call him after the live cd comes out.  I don't like to pry
to much.....

My favorite and most memorable experience with Rush's lasers was when I =

Alex starts his solo and the green lasers shoot out from behind Neil and =
hit the ledge that seperates the upper and lower bowls of the arena.  =
They also shoot out smoke so the laser "hammock" can be seen clearly.  =
When you are up in the upper bowl it looks as if you can jump right down =
and lay in it.  It still gives me goosbumps when I see it!

<A NAME="2062021">Subject: Live Album Setlist</A>

Here's my predictions for the new live album setlist:

Dreamline (this one has already been confirmed)
The Analog Kid
Cold Fire
Nobody's Hero
Roll The Bones
Animate (first single)
Stick It Out
Limelight
Bravado
Show Don't Tell
Leave That Thing Alone
Driven
Half The World
Limbo
Virtuality
2112 (I really hope they put this on being that it is the complete
version and it sounded so cool tuned down)
Test For Echo (confirmed as first song on second disc)
Natural Science

As far as the bonus disc I think it's a mistake that they are using a
concert from the AFTK tour which means we are not going to get
Hemispheres live but I'll take any Rush live I guess.Later

P.S. I saw Cheap Trick last wenesday at Birch Hill nightclub in NJ.They
kicked major ass.I kept catching Rick Neilson's guitar picks all night(I
was pretty close to the stage).Rick reminds me of Alex as they are both
goofs on stage which is pretty funny.

Hey all...

*****I was wondering about this myself, but I'm quite certain that Presto is
not available as a remaster. As I understand it, the remastering process was
only applied to those albums which been originally intended for release
mainly on vinyl and cassette. When Presto was released, the mastering was
done with CDs in mind, so no remaster was/is necessary. Confirm/deny?*****

I would be surprised if any albums newer than "Hold Your Fire" are released as
remasters.  If I'm not mistaken, this is a Mercury Records thing. " Presto"
was the first album that Rush recorded for their current label, Atlantic
Records.  I'd like to hear a remastered "Presto" though.

Take care!

I was watching tv last night (Behind The Music specials on Ted Nugent
and Def Leppard)and all of a sudden a commercial for the movie Small
Soldiers came on and guess what song they used?Tom Sawyer and it sounded
really cool.I think it's cool that Rush is on the soundtrack because it
will probably appeal to young kids which in turn will discover the music
of Rush.Anyway that's my opinion.

I think Rush would make a great Behind The Music special.They have had
their ups and downs through their career.How about in the beginning when
not a lot of places wouldn't book them or the struggles they had getting
a record deal.And How about when Carress Of Steel flopped plus the tour
and then they got no support from the record company.And about the hard
times they had during the Grace Under Pressure period when they almost
thought of breaking up.The only problem with doing BTM is Rush
themselves need to be on the show as they always interview the artists
and I doubt Rush would do it.I think VH-1 Legends would be a better show
to do on them.

To all you who've been complaining about the sorry state of syndicated rock 
radio around the U.S., you should consider relocating to the Pensacola, FL 
area.  Our local radio station seems to have a favorable taste for Rush.  
Last week, they had a "name-these-tunes-and-win" contest, where they played 
"Distant Early Warning," "Xanadu" and "Show Don't Tell."  Not easily 
identifiable by the fickle "Tom Sawyer-esque" Rush fan.  I tried to call in 
to win without success.  Yesterday, while on my way to a business meeting, 
some songs from the first album popped into my head and I began singing them.  
On a whim I turned on the radio only to hear "Working Man."  This morning, 
while on the way to work, I tuned in and "Limelight" was being broadcast.  
So you guys (a.k.a., "y'all") need to move here to Pensacola.

By the way, I looked down at my odometer this morning and part of the 
mileage read "6-6-6" (yes, I'm poking fun at you "2112" people).  G'day.  MK

Just for a simple 2 weeks, but here are some questions :

  Any good FM radio stations there who are known to play
Rush ?

  Any NMS folk living out there ? (I'd like to spend an 
evening with a "soul-mate", going throu' a couple of 
six-packs !)

  Are there any shops around Casa Grande that sells Rush

  How hot will it be in Arizona in September ? 

Finaly, I'd like to thank all those NMS'rs who supported
me in hard times. I've had 25 heart-warming and comforting

<A NAME="2062027">Subject: Poll of fav. TV shows and other stuff</A>

I just want to say thanks to the responses of my poll, "What is your fav.
TV show?"
I posed this question, obviously unrelated to RUSH, but to gauge what are
the  other similarites that RUSH fans have with each other?  So far,
South Park is the front runner, a very adult cartoon about little kids
with profane, but heart-jerking comments on today's society.  Forgive the
broad, understated, and embellished nutshell of a synopsis.  I'm still
getting responses, so I'll hold off on final tally.  If anyone else wants
to contribute, then e-mail me at: c.w.lindsay@juno.com

I think that this newsletter is at its best when there are a variety of
topics being discussed.  When a dozen or more contributors talk about the
same topic (i.e. a certain drummer from VH, or response to B-Man) then it
can seem pretty bland.  I personally enjoy it when people talk about
certain songs and what visual images, or ideas that play in their heads. 
Or also, when people say why or why not a particular song is their
favorite or least favorite.  If someone says "Prime Mover" doesn't do
anything for me, I find it interesting, because the end of the song, as
it starts simple and layers of sounds get added to it just makes me wanT
tO GO!!!!

But, I digress.

The amount of variety adds flavor and life to a cold, electronic
newsletter.  The thread about fav. Lerxst solos is real good right now. 
My favs. are always changing, but "Virtuallity" is currently mine right
now.  QUESTION:  After the second-to-last chorus, the guitars goes into a
jam that reminds me of either 2112 or Hemispheres, or something like
that, does anyone else catch me or am I sewing with only one needle? 

Sorry about the lenghty post.  As Dr. Laura says, "Go take on the Day!!" 
SHUT UP, LAURA!!!!   WHY DON'T YOU GO TAKE A HIKE!!??!!??!!

Kenny Wayne Shepherd
Faith No More

Led Zepplin
Quicksand
Clapton Stuff (Derek and the Dominos, Cream, etc...)
Deep Purple

The Guess Who
Sly and the Family Stone

As far as Alex Van Halen, what he plays compliments the rest of the band 
and isn't that what's most important?  Everyone knows Eddie is the focus 
of the band anyway.  It's not AVH's role to be in the spotlight all the 
time and play crazy stuff.  He just has to be steady

You all can stop sending in your responses to this thread, for I have
DISCOVERED the EXACT NATURE of this ultimate band we are trying to create.
In FACT, I have created SEVERAL ultimate bands in SEVERAL genres of music!
That is why I am so AMAZING.  So HERE YOU GO:

Pop/Hard Rock:
Bass: Jack Bruce (Cream)
Guitar: Eric Clapton
Vocals: John Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival)
Drums: John Bonham (so what if he's dead)
Fusion Rock (jazzy/funky stuff):
Bass: Victor Wooton (Bela Fleck & the Flecktones -- amazing technically,
also a phenomenal willingness to play straight bass lines despite his
awe-inspiring talent)
Guitar: Trey Anastasio (Phish)
Vocals: whoever sings lead for Portishead (that girl with the chillingly
cold voice)
Drums: Jon Fishman (Phish) or Stewart Copland (The Police)

Ok.  So that didn't go as well as I thought it would.  I only got two
categories and I'm not satisfied with either.  The truth is, I just got
bored of doing this.  We need a new Rush album to tear apart here.  I'm
going to go and take a walk now because my job is driving me insane and
it's...well...it's just time to go and take a walk now.

Had to reply here... Spock's Beard is a wonderful breath of fresh air into
the world of progressive music.  An incredibly talented band, but they
have a sound that is very much their own... unlike Dream Theater, you
won't find people complaining that SB is a Rush clone!  They have a more
70s sound, owing largely to the use of the Mellotron (don't see that one
much anymore!).

They were just signed to Metal Blade, so their new release, "The Kindness
of Strangers," is available at record stores.

Also, best AL solo: YYZ or CttC

<A NAME="2062038">Subject: Six Degrees Of Rush</A>

Anybody here ever seen the great film "Six Degrees Of Separation"?  The
title comes from a "theory" of sorts that everybody in the world is only
separated from each other by six other people (i.e., I meet you, you've met
your brother, your brother has met his wife, his wife has met Larry King,
Larry King has met Ross Perot...something like that).  Anyway, I've never
met the guys in Rush but came within "one degree" a couple years ago in a
strange sort of way which I will now relate to you.

So I'm with my kids, riding on the St. Louis Metrolink train to downtown
one evening just to mess around, create a diversion to an otherwise ho hum,
boring night.  We're sitting there, waiting for the minutes to pass before
our stop when a lady of say about 60 years old asks me "Are you guys going
to the hockey game?"  Since that was not what we were doing (plus, hockey
season was over), I told her no.  She then told me she was from Toronto and
that the Leafs were her favourite team.  We talked hockey for a minute or
two, but of course, any time the city of Toronto is mentioned, I usually
find a way to bring the conversation around to Rush...this time was no
different.  I told her "One of my favourite bands is from Toronto."  She
said "Oh yeah, which one?"  "Rush," I replied.  Much to my surprise she
said "Oh sure, I know who they are.  I was Geddy Lee's music teacher in
high school."  Well of course, my jaw just about dropped off my face!  

Well, to shorten up the story a bit, she not only knew Geddy, but even
though she never had Alex in a clas, she knew who he was, too.  She said
that at some point after the band had become famous, Geddy and/or Alex had
come back to the school to visit.  Her reason for being in town was that
her husband's job had recently had him transferred to St. Louis, so she was
making a trip every weekend to St. Louis to be with him.  I don't recall
what her name was, but I assure you, this story is absolutely true.  

Now my life's complete...I've come within one degree of meeting Rush!!  ;-)

Just my random thinks...
