The boyz really rocked Pittsburgh on Monday night.  It was my first live Rush
show and they really kicked some major gluteus max.  They played 18 songs
on the regular program and sewed together another 6 for the encore; the
list is the same as those in other spoiler posts.  Just a few observations:

1. I was really suprised that they would play Limelight and Freewill as the 2nd
and 3rd songs of the show; I thought they would save them until later.  These
were some of the best songs they played all night.  The boyz were at their
peak for these two warhorses; they sounded like they recorded them just
yesterday.  I wasnt sure if this was 1991 or 1981.  Geddy and Alex looked like
they were really having fun jamming onstage.  I was ecsatic.

2. There is nothing like hearing Bravado and Time Stand Still live; they sound
so much better; full or more energy and passion.  It really changed the way
I looked at those two pieces, and I can appreciate them much better now.
The video for Time Stand Still was also great, a journey through the mountains
and forests of western Canada -- very panoramic.

3. I was hoping all along that La Villa and Xanadu would be in the program
and my dream came true.  The lasers were awesome during these two numbers,
the way they sliced through the fog like a razor blade; it was very similiar
to seeing a Laser Rush show at Laserium.  The effects were stunning and
Alex's solo in La Villa was brilliant.

4. Other comments: Geddy's bass was really kickin' ; I could feel not
only my body but also my clothing vibrate to the beat.  Neil was at top
form as usual, esp during Big Money and Show Dont Tell when he enters
his hyperactive mode.  Rabbits appeared during Superconductor and they danced
during Tom Sawyer, which was entertaining to watch.

All in all, it was an awesome show and I was really moved by it.  For those
of you with tickets to future shows, get ready for the time of your life!
The Power Trio will amaze you.

<A NAME="374003">Subject: Old tunes in old shows</A>

I couldn't resist my two bits worth regarding old songs played on old
tours... I saw many shows in the late 70's early '80's time frame
except for the AFTK tour (curses!!) Let's see if I can reminisce:

>Ceri Morgan wanted to know if certain songs had ever been played live.
>I've never HEARD them live, but I do have recordings of the following
>tunes:

 	>Natural Science
	Played on the PW tour, but I think that was it...can't remember
	it played since :-(

	>Jacob's Ladder
	Also played on the PW tour and I think again on the MP tour-
	appears on ESL of course!

	>Something for Nothing
	An old standard for many years, played on 2112 tour as you can guess
	since it appears on ATWAS, also played on subsequent tours such as
	Hemispheres and PW...disappeared around the time of MP.

	>The Trees
	Performed live lots o' times- on Hemispheres, PW and I think again
	on MP... popped up from time to time since? Can anyone confirm?

	>Working Man
	Ah yes.... A Rush standard for umpteen years....played on nearly every
	tour up until MP...faded out after then but bits and pieces appeared
	in encores from time to time.

>I have never heard at all, Cinderella Man, live.  I wouldn't mind it!   I
>don't know what will get played this time around .... I'm seeing them
>Thursday night, though.  I can't wait!

>     - Jeff

Right you are Jeff. To my knowledge this one has never been played live,
although I missed the AFTK show :-( I certainly wouldn't mind its
resurrection!

In the old days, it seemed that Rush played nearly every song from
whatever album they were promoting. I remember the MP show vividly...
all tunes except Witch Hunt....or was it no Vital Signs...maybe it
wasn't as vivid as I thought (deteriorating neurons!). I guess there
are just too many songs in their repertoire to allow all the new tunes
to be played. Too bad tho!

Who else is disappointed by the play list on the RTB tour?
My feeling is that it is time to can Force Ten and Tom Sawyer
(blasphemy you say!). Just a little taste of something off of
CoS please!!!

Cheers,
David

<A NAME="374005">Subject: Alternate Lyrics...</A>

I was listening to a bootleg from the "All the Worlds a Stage" tour,
and I noticed something interesting.  This bootleg (thanks Pete!) was
recorded on June 2, 1977, in Manchester England.  The album  "A Farewell
to Kings" was recorded in Wales in June, 1977, so this was prabably
Rush's last warm-up before recording.  After playing 2112, Geddy says:
"We'd like to do something new for you.  This is gonna be on our next
album, this is called "Xanadu."
The song is slightly different then the recorded version on AFTK, most
noteably in the following passage:

	I had heard the whispered tales
	Of immortality
	The deepest mystery
       *The miracle of the ages coming true*

  On the AFTK version, the last line is:
----------------------------------------------------------

<A NAME="374306">From: an!</A>

Maybe this could add some insight to the meaning of Xanadu.  By the way,
they also played "The Necromancer" at that concert!

On a more current topic, I haven't read the SPOILERS, but I think
someone said that they only played 3 songs from RTB?  I hope that's not
true!  Sure, I want them to surprise us with lots of old stuff,  but
I would really like to hear more live RTB!

Has the RTB video hit MTV yet?

Why do the Boyz open with Force Ten? It's the first song two studio albums

To Nicholas A Mascari, who asked the big question "who cares if they're
not FULL anagrams?";
I do. I wouldn't have cared if the song had been titled Partial anagram
(For Mongo). I like the lyric, though.

I also found it rather funny that people start realising that there are
anagrams in a song TITLED Anagram, now, only some two years after the
release of Presto.

Sad, isn't it; Rush play every bad tune they ever did (Time stand still,
Force ten, <everything from RTB>, Closer to the heart, The pass, The big
money) on the current tour. Anyway, I would LOVE to see them, just because
of Xanadu.

Great Show. 'nuf said. About an arms length from the stage on Geddy's side, so
it was spectacular.

Alex was so *clearly* absolutely enjoying himself! Laughing, sort of, as he
played... very nice!

Alex was on the keyboards, once or twice, he had one on his sie of the stage.

Geddy's voice is going, no surprise. He dropped down an octave a couple of 
times.

Here's the *really* bizzare thing I noticed. When the "rap" section of RTB came
on, the lights went *way* down on Neil, so I couldn't see his face at all.
Furthermore, just before the "rap", his sequencer (the guy who keeps
his drums going during the show) was 1st putting somethign on the end of a wire
into the kit, and after, he removed it. *and* as the lights came up, Neil was
*abosolutely* definitely seen to say/sing/mouth "Get Busy" as he turned back to
the front of his kit.

Wild outlandish hypothesis: Neil does the singing during the rap, no one can
tell because of the lights.

More likely hypthesis: Just him keeping time with the music, and the stuff
the sequencer was doing had to do with the different set of drums he appeared
to be using during that section...

Anyone else at the pittsburgh show notice that?

Anyway, best concert I've ever been to. Maybe the seats helped... also, mixing
was *much* better at the arena this time, than for Presto.

That's right folks, in cse you didn't see Rolling Stone's list of the "100
Greatest Album Covers of All-Time"(what a crock of sh*t), here is a list of
some that did and those that did not.

	Did:  Virtually every Rolling Stone album
	      Virtually every Beatles' album
	      A bunch of albums with nudes on the cover

    Did not:  All but 1 Yes album
              No, none, nada, zip, zilch, zero Rush albums

Now in all honesty, would you think that a picture of the Beatles is better
than the artwork on Grace Under Pressure, Caress of Steel, or any other Rush
album cover (excluding the first one).  Really, give me a break!!  If you want
some real evidence of Rolling Stone's non-interest in Rush, now you have it.
Anyone writing letters better include this little incident as well.  By the way
one of the judges was Kurt Loder from eMpTyV.

<A NAME="374011">Subject: Observations & whatnot... from the Cincinatti Show (10/29)</A>

Greeting, fellow Rush fans, and a special 'howdy' to my brethern who attended
the show in Cincy, home of the losing-ist football team yet this year. I just
had a few thoughts that struck me during the RTB show I saw and thought I
would just pass them along... I don't think I'll have any spoilers here, but
it's hard to determine just what someone will intrepret as one. Well, heeeere
goes...

1. Geddy Lee had his hair down instead of pulled back in a tail... for thse
of you who have seen him like this, doesn't he look like Joey Ramone? (of the
Ramones) Spooky thought...

2. Is it me, or has some of the keyboard padding been removed? I noticed some
of the arpeggiated runs in 'The Big Money' weren't there. It's not like they
didn't already have them saved somehwere from the last tour... are we
minimalizing the k-boards? (no complaint... just curiosity)

3. $23 for t-shirts?!? OUCH! Me thinks that doth suck royal eggs... even
though I gave it up for them...

4. Am I wrong to wish for a longer show? Sure, 2 hours is great, but with so
much material AND tix costing $23 and up, I don't think 2 1/2 - 3 hours is
unreasonable. If Floyd can do it, why can't Rush?

5. Xanadu- They STILL have to work on it. The lasers aren't changing at the
precise time, and Ged even played a foul chord at the end of the change from
7/4 to 4/4. It just still looked rough.

6. I heard the 'Dreamline 3 Pings (tm),' and they sound like sonar. Or more
precisely, k-board-emulated sonar... or a bass note detuned +5 octaves,
reversed, truncated, and mixed with a belch.

I'll stop here, as to not overflow the rush-mgr's 80 line limit (though I
probablly did). I have some other ones, but they elude me at the moment, so
this is 'to be continued...'

Row The Boats.

Actually it isn't so much a spoiler as much of confirming what everyone's
said about the other shows.  Big disappointment on not hearing YYZ and
In The Mood, big surprise on hearing Limelight and Anthem and Xanadu (again).
They did seem to be a lot less keyboard intensive - they did mostly bass
oriented stuff instead of Ged spending lotsa time on the keys.  It
did seem that they were doing a lot of untriggered sequencing/sampling,
but that could be either a) Neil doing more of it b) my terrible nosebleed
section 215 row K seats (Riverfront Coliseum) blocking my view of Geddy's
midi pedals...  Oh, and whoever mentioned the start of "Subdivisions" being
different at the show they saw - same here.  At first I thought it
was Ged/Alex forgetting to come in for their first measure, which is
what it sounded like, but since it happened at more than one show, maybe
it was intentional.  I dunno.  Sounds kinda strange to me...

Anyway, Bill and Ted would have said the show was most excellent.  Rush
is far from dead...

On another subject - any Rickenbacker bass owners have any tips on dragging
some good Rush-ish or Yes-ish sounds out of the thing?  I just got a hold
of a 4003 in good shape and put Rotosounds on it...  Sounds great, plays
great...  (What all is the difference between a 4001 and a 4003 anyway?)

Has anyone noticed the little morse code message on the inside cover of
the Roll the Bones tourbook?  On the bottom of the inside cover, you
will see a series of skulls and bones.  Using the skulls as dots and the
bones as dashes, you will plainly see a message.  Any thoughts on what
this means?

Also, the Cincinnati show was last night(October 29th) and it was great!
They have renewed my faith in them as primarily a rock band!

Hey youns guys,

Great show last night!  Since the playlist was the same as the first two
shows, I won't repeat it here.  I'll just repeat that Neil's solo is indeed
new, and I'm glad someone pointed out he had only one bass drum, cuz I thought
I was losing my mind.  The encore was incredible, and a pleasant surprise.

In a nutshell:
HOW MUCH OF THE NEW ALBUM DID THEY PLAY?
	4 songs, and all from Side 1 (i.e. no "Ghost" :(

HOW WAS ERIC JOHNSON?
	Great!  Couldn't figure out what he was saying between songs.  He hit
the stage ON TIME, and played for, oh, 40 minutes or so.

WHO WAS THE MYSTERY RAPPER?
	To those who thought the mystery rapper was Leonard Nimoy/Spock,
you're wrong:  It was BONES...  ;-)

Finally, I don't know if Pgh Rush Party #2a ever happened on Saturday night
(Doug, you still out there?), but #2b went down as scheduled.  Glacier Bay
(and it's new incarnation, Arctic Bay) and Rush CDs were the late-afternoon,
pre-concert fare.  The distance-travelled award goes to Chris and Bryan from

    After nine loooooonnnnnnggggg years of enjoying the boys' music, I finally
had the (ghost of a) chance to see them in concert.  I left the civec arena
smelling of smoke (cigs and a touch of Columbian Camels), no hearing in my
right ear, and my head pounding like there was no tomorrow.  But you should
have seen the size of my smile!  I think it's still stuck!  My best friend
bought eight tickets and was gracious enough to offer me one (I'll be kissing
her boots in eternal gratitude).

    As for the show, I'll limit my comments to the following:

    Eric Johnson is a damn good guitar player.  His voice is lacking (to
say the least).  He tries to sing with power, but his cords just can't
cut the mustard.  He ought to approach his vocals with the same intricate
finesse that he uses in his playing (Geddy has been using more finesse in
his singing these days.  Face it after all these years, his voice is bound
to loose the old time power.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking Ged.
I think that his singing is actually at a higher level now than it was in
the past).  If Eric ever starts using his voice like the instrument that
it could be, we'll have quite an act on our hands.

    I was pleasantly surprised at the range of songs that the boys did.
I felt that they covered quite a broad spectrum.  Some of the bits used
in the mondo-jam at the end I couldn't place a name on and one I not even
sure that I heard before.  I haven't yet developed a deeper knowledge of
their older work (after all, I've only been a fan for nine years and the
do have quite a few albums that aren't exactly free.  Give me a little
more time).

    Even though they didn't play the songs that have the most meaning
to me (Lock And Key, Kid Gloves, War Paint, I Think I'm Going Bald,
and Red Barchetta (they played part of it)) I have only one complaint.
TIME did not STAND STILL.

    Other than that I have nothing else to say.  For me it was beyond
words.  Honest!  I guess the wait made it all the more sweeter.  I can
almost die in peace now.

                                    That is all,

IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!

Ticketbastard and the Spectrum just (7:30 am) announced that the Philadelphia
Rush show has *NOT* been postponed to the 14th of December.

The show will be on the originally announced date - Tuesday, December 3 - and
tickets will go on sale THIS WEEKEND.

Prices are $29.50 for "Gold Circle" (Don't ask me, I just live here!) and
$19.50 for usual seating.

This was confirmed through a call to the Spectrum, so it's not just heresy!
;-) ;-) (Or should I say hearsay?)

Anyone planning to come into Philly to wait in line, please E-mail me and
perhaps we can get together, eh?  (Also - I know of some other *good* places
to wait in line...)

Frantically digging for money,

Well, not quite.
 I just happened to watch the beginning of Geraldo tues. afternoon.  The
subject of the day was satanism.  Now, I know Rush is in no way satanic,
but they showed a picture of this satanic graffiti covered wall and right
there in the middle was a large red upside-down star with a circle around
it and the number 2112 below it.  I chuckled and changed the channel.  Just

Hi all.  I've been totally read-only until now, but this info is too important
to go unsaid.  I just got off the phone with a lady at the Hartford CC, and she
said tix go on sale for the 12/1 show *tomorrow* (that's Friday) morning at
Ticketmaster (and the box office, too, I assume, although I didn't ask).

As for Worcester and Providence, the Centrum's recording makes no mention of
the boys, and someone at Providence said there was no definite date yet, but
that something should be ironed out soon and that I should call back.

Numbers you can call to talk to a human:

Hartford: 203-249-6333
Providence: 401-331-0700
Worcester: 508-755-6800

The Worcester Centrum box office recording is 508-798-8888

I'm assuming that there is no show at the Boston Garden.  The original posting
of the venues/dates indicated 12/10 as 'Boston', but, since the tour shirt says
Worcester, I'm assuming 12/10 will be a Worcester show.

If someone hears about the Centrum or Providence, please post the info, and
send me mail, too :-) since the NMS doesn't go out immediately.

        Greetings And Salutatitons!!

        This is my first post to the NMS, although I've been
        subscribing for nearly a year.(blah blah)

        Someone a while back mentioned harmony...one that I don't
        think has been brought up is the low fourth in the chorus
        of ``New World Man''. It's a quiet one, but it's in there.

        Speaking of vocals, does anyone know if the boyz use tape
        machines or harmonizers in concert? On the Presto Tour I
        was very impressed with Alex's assistance in the harmony
        department, but there were songs that I'm sure had more than
        two vocals going on (``Scars'' and ``War Paint'' for example).
        No flames please--I'm not accusing them of lip-synching or
        anything...

        And now that we're on the subject of touring, I saw the
        ``projected'' dates for the RTB Tour up thru April, and I
        was distressed to find out that they are not (as of current
        info) going to play Salt Lake City!  Hey, we even have a big
        new arena, dammit! If anyone has any contrary info on this, it
        would be greatly appreciated. They skipped us over on the HYF
        tour too, and I can't jump state whenever I feel like it...

Saturday, Nov. 2, at Ticketmaster and the Centrum box office.

So there you have it.  To re-cap:

Yes, I too have noticed the voice in Camera Eye! It happens in

But if any of you guys out there who ran Dreamline through your

Also, to Matt, no problem! We dumb, ignorant Americans gotta

WHEN????

If you haven't seen it, it has the kid from the RTB cover, in boney
appearance, kicking a skull w/sunglasses, standing on top of (suprise) a pile
of bones. Really neat. Yet another link between Metalica and Rush.

(the first was in a SPIN interview with Metallica, who said they were

Glad to see Dos' name is spelled properly this time. The book is
called ``The Tidewater Tales.''

First, let me say that I take offense at this sarcasm. Gonzalo was
apparently more interested at finding something to _flame_ me about
for being critical of the submitted post, rather than _understanding_
the criticism itself. Gonzalo's response is ludicrous, and about as
sensible as the following: person A says ``My dog is a black version
of your dog; it's a black bulldog'' (when person B's dog is really a
golden retriever), and person B says ``My dog is _not_ a bulldog! It
is a golden retriever and yours is a black bulldog! Comparing them is
ludicrous,'' to which person A (someone with a Gonzaloid sense of logic)
rejoinds ``See, I _said_ my dog is black, smarty!'' The point is that
B's dog is a _retriever_, not that A's dog is _black_! The relevant
point is that retrievers are _not_ the same or even _like_ bulldogs.

What Gonzalo originally said about _TTT_ and _U.S.A._ was:
>>		About the Tide-Water Tales: It's a book by John Barth, one of
>>these blow-out novels that middle aged dudes can't seem to have enough self
>>restraint to not write, a sort of poor man's Ulysses. I paged through it, and
>>it seemed rather boring, although it might be interesting from a technical
>>point of view. In a way, it seemed a small, personal version of John Dos
>>Pasos' U.S.A.

Being smart-arsed seems to be the mode. Forming opinions by
``paging through,'' eh?

I responded to this silly, see-all-I-read(-but-didn't-understand)
posting as follows:

:I think it is ridiculous to see _TTT_ as like Dos Passos' (the correct
:spelling) _U.S.A._ in any significant way. _U.S.A._ is fundamentally
:sociopolitical, while _TTT_ is fundamentally personal. (Gee, sounds like
:the difference between Grace/Pow and Presto/RTB.) One work (_USA_) is
:modern, the other (_TTT_) is post-modern, and the styles of the two
:have little or nothing in common.

It seems that the _meaning_ of my response was utterly ignored.
The nature of Gonzalo's comeback clearly illustrates this fact.
My point was is that there is very very very little similarity
between the two books, so there is no sense is saying one is an
_anything_ version of the other.

I said _U.S.A._ is fundamentally sociopolitical and modern,
while _TTT_ is personal and post-modern and the styles have
very little or nothing in common; and the response was
`See, I said _TTT_ is personal!' This is just not the point!

The only similarity between these two books other than the fact that
they were both written by Americans during our century is the fact that
Neil read both. Let's not get smart-arsed about things; let's deal with
them. Face Up! _TTT_ is _not_ like _U.S.A._; it is senseless
to say that _TTT_ is a small personal version of _U.S.A._.

``A fact's a fact''.

It makes sense to say that a black retriever is a black version of a
golden retriever, but it does _not_ make sense to say that the black
_bulldog_ is black version of the golden retriever. Get the drift?

``You can twist perceptions/ Reality won't budge''.
