Howdy folks...

I know someone posted in the Dec. 1st digest about Rush references in the
Metallica booklet included with Metallica's latest release, "Garage Inc."
I'll post them here for any interested parties.

	The first one comes from Brian Tatler, who was the guitarist for a band
called Diamond Head (one of Metallica's early influences).  Tatler says of
Diamond Head's music, "Lars [Ulrich, Metallica's drummer] would be there,
hanging out while we were laboring over arrangements.  We'd spend all day
writing songs, arranging sections, and [Lars] probably thought that was
the way bands write.  We didn't worry about how long a song had to be.  It
came out however it felt right, whether it was three minutes or ten.  We
probably got the idea from things like 'Xanadu' by Rush, and Led
Zeppelin's 'Kashmir'.  We liked epicness; we wanted things to be grand."

The other one I found comes from Jason Newsted, Metallica's bassist since
1986.  Jason is quoted as saying he "...had a 'big hero-worship thing' for
Rush's Geddy Lee and was dead into Lemmy from Motorhead because 'he was
playing distorted bass, fast, with a pick.'"

	As Metallica albums go, it's not my favorite, but it definitely displays
Metallica's talent for covering other bands' songs while giving them a
slant of their own (some of you may have heard a Metallica cover of Bob
Seger's "Turn the Page" recently).

	All for now...

<A NAME="2153002">Subject: My two cents (6 times)</A>

Being a subscriber of TMNS I clearly don't agree with the review of DS
given by Entertainment Weekly.  However, I was thinking about it
recently and had a thought I'd like to share.

Imagine you just don't care for Rush.  Never have.  You like music of
all kinds, but Rush never appealed to you.  You never discovered their
magic like the rest of us did.  Then you're given the task of reviewing
their latest album which contains THREE AND A HALF HOURS of unusual
arrangements, in your face guitar, hyperactive bass and drums, vocal
stylings that you don't appreciate and a 20+ minute science fiction
story.  By the end of it you'd probably HATE Rush for making you waste a
fair piece of your life listening to this bombastic, self indulgent
recording.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I'm surprised it even
got a C+ under the circumstances.

Other thoughts...

Has anyone been stuck by the massive growth that took place between 1978
and 1997?  The contrast between the playing styles, the songwriting, the
maturity in Geddy's vocals, the leads, everything is just so mature in
the newer material.  I really like the contrast.  I find it a lot of fun
to listen to two pieces of the album and try to connect them.  It's the
same three people in the same group playing practically the same songs
but the sound and the feel is just so different between the two.

In the DS retrospective booklet there is a setlist from T4E.  It's too
short to be from the regular show.  Was that from the Blind Date gig
they did for Molson?

Favorite moments:
Intro and outro of LTTA
"Miles of yellow tape"
Opening verse of Natural Science
A Farewell to Kings

Lastly, the finale to RTB is great, however the version I've hear from
bootlegs during the RTB tour is even better.  It has even more energy
and stops instantly for "...because we're here".  Check it out if you
can.

And for whoever asked if 2112 is actually 21:12, it's not.  It's a few
seconds longer.  If I recall correctly it's 21:35.

Inspired by >>Bill Mayes  "That Rush teacher guy"<<

I did my part to bring Rush into the classroom back in 1986 while in 10th
grade. The teacher let us do our paper on just about anything we wanted, so
long as it pertained to literature. This was my opportunity. Finally an
assignment I could get into 100%. I could have taken the obvious course and
written about how Rush integrated Shakespeare into their music via
"Limelight", but I was aiming high. I bought a copy of Anthem by Ayn Rand
and read it, comparing it to Neil's tale in "2112". I pointed out
similarities and differences, literary elements, etc. I topped it off by
lending my "2112" album (yes, vinyl!) to my teacher and insisting she listen
to it (while reading the lyrics, of course) to get the full effect. I got an
A+, needless to say. I don't think anyone else in the class thought of doing
a multimedia "english paper", let alone one with such a kick-ass soundtrack.
I mean it. To this day I get real chills while singing along to,

"Just think of what my life might be
 in a world like I have seen!
 I don't think I can carry on,
 carry on this cold and empty life. (Ooohh No!)

 My spirits are low, in the depths of despair.
 My lifeblood spills over."

Bill, you're obviously a cool guy. I'm a big supporter of music in the
classroom. Keep up the good work.

I've harped on this before, but I'll say it one more time.  Would it be so
impossible for Rush to take one (at least) nice soundboard show from each
tour, press that sucker up on CD and issue it?  Is that too much to ask?
It would take no work at all.  Then all you non-bootleggers would have a
chance to hear the songs that didn't make the cut on the first live
offering in NINE years.  

Oh, I forgot.  If Rush did that, then the recordings wouldn't be
absolutely, positively perfect and free of errors.  Oh my god, wouldn't
that just be a tragedy!!!  I'll guess I'll just go on enjoying the bootlegs
which include all the songs that just "didn't fit".

   [ You have to remember that up until just a few years ago, making a 
     soundboard recording of EVERY show was a very laborious process. They
     might've been able to do all the CP & TFE shows, but before that...

<A NAME="2153005">Subject: Kansas City Radio interview w/Alex 12/1/98</A>

While driving to work Tuesday morning, KQRC-FM surprised me with a live phone 
interview with Alex.  The station consistantly plays the heck out of the boyz, 
yet they squandered a golden opportunity.  The jocks (read: DJ's) had 
absolutely no friggin' clue as to what relevant, important questions to ask. 
*sigh*  So much for good ole' show preparation.

I still can't believe what I heard yesterday morning.  Actually, I'm 
embarrassed for the station and Kansas City.  The majority of the conversation 
revolved around what Alex was doing with Kiss back in the mid-1970's or how 
good a golfer Alice Cooper is.  Seriously.  Sex, drugs and golf -- and it 
wasn't even close to becoming humorous or enlightening.

Here's what I found truly sad.  While still discussing why the band wasn't 
"backstage getting laid anymore," one of the jocks assumed this was due to 
the boyz having wives.  He then began probing Alex for the number of years 
each band member had been married.  As you can guess, he nonchalantly asked 
about Neil.

Alex hesitated for a second and replied in a bitter tone.  I can't recall the 
specific answer because I went nuts.  All I can remember was something like, 
"he was married XX years," and nothing else.  That was it.  I turned down the 
volume and began screaming at the damn radio.  I couldn't believe they were 
asking such idiotic, insensitive questions.

I then turned off the radio in shame.  Poor Alex....

If I would have known earlier, I would have taped it.  Anyone else here in 
KC/Topeka/St. Joe get a tape for transcription?  I know a few of you are 
still cringing as well.  I'd like to hear/read the rest to know if anything 
good came out of the miserable interview.  If I get a copy, I'll make the 
transcription myself if necessary.

OK, after getting this CD from my wife on my Nov. 11 b-day, it ( well, one
of three disks )
has been in my car CD player ( and home when I get the chance ) since then.
I have listened,
loved, and listened again.  It's live, it's not studio, but I think it's
about the best LIVE cd/album
I've ever owned. Really.  I've got a LOT.  Anyway so on and so forth... I've
just got to comment
on the ONE thing that just stands out about this CD.  Test for Echo.  First,
I'm a guitarist and
keyboardist.  But the T4E cut on this CD with the 2 sections of Neil's
double bass ( maybe more
with synth triggers, who knows ) is just the most awesome sounding thing
with more power and
emotion than I think I've ever heard!  I was not lucky enough to see them on
the T4E tour, but I did
see CP's..  It was awesome.  But the sound quality of this cut ( T4E) is
just too much !!
I would have loved to been about 25 rows back from the stage right under the
coverage of the
main PA.  Judging from the sound on the CD, I bet these two "riffs" on T4E
just about blew
people out of their seats!

<A NAME="2153007">Subject: Feverish reflections of Stages</A>

I couldn't buy DS when it came out because I had a kidney infection and a
103 degree (F) fever for seven days.  But oneday, near the end of my
illness, I dragged myself out of bed and got it on sale at my cool local
record store:)  I definitely needed a moral booster!

At the time of this writing I've only listened to the first disk and my
head is still spinning:)  Had trouble doing the CDRom part.

Anyway, the trip to the store tired me out, so I laid down in bed, put a
banana around my eyes to block out the daylight, and blasted it on my CD
player.  And Ohhh man, I was swept away.  It was truely a spiritual
experience!

Have you ever met someone and asked them if they like Rush and they say,
"Oh, yeah,"?  And you ask them what's their favorite song and they name the
few songs that get played on the radio?

It's like, no!  Do you LIKE Rush?  Do you live and breath each and every
paritcle of every song they play?  Do you know each song inside out, upside
down and every single facet, but are still finding new suprises every one
of the 1000+ listens to each song?  Does the music become a part of you and
do you become a part of the music?   Does the music make your spirit soar
and soul dance?  My body was too tired to dance, but my soul sure did!

And as "Closer to the Heart" came to a close, I relived the fist leg of the
TFE Tour which I caught in Sacremento, CA:  Before the show some guy who
had been in San Jose the night before, was walking around with a smug look
on his face and said, "You're really going to enjoy the show."  (I had
plans to go and find him and beat him senseless if I didn't - no chance of
that, though.  They could play Tom Sawyer for two hours and I'd be in heaven)

Anyway, they had been playing for a long time by the time they played
"Closer", so I assumed it was going to be the climax of the first set.  But
no - they went into 2112 Overature.  And I'd seen shows where they played
the Overature and the Temples of Syrinx.  So I assumed that Temples would
be the climax of the first set.

I didn't start listening to Rush until 1985 and was disappointed the first
time I heard ATWAS and realized that they didn'lt play the entire 2112 on
that tour. So I was startled when the lights didn't come up after Temples
and there was the soft tinkle of a waterfall.  I nearly dropped to my knees
in stunned amazement as The Discovery began...

*Note:  I wrote all the above week before last when I was still sick.  I've
been out of town since I got better and just got this chance to put it on
the computer.  I also haven't had time to read the back issues that have
collected in my mailbox, so has anyone else had problems with the CDrom?
Is there a solution or do I have a defective disc?  Please email me
directily, incase this is a dead issue.  Thanx

I was watching Conan on Wednesday night the 2nd, and I heard a

"Something For Nothing" Then the obligitory joke about the album title.
It was how Max had recorded an album in the 70's titled 2632. Lame.

"Canada's answer to R.E.M. only without an attitude."

"On the musical frontier, the Rheostatics are the giraffe, working on a level
that the rest of us can only dream of, and with a
clear view of what lies ahead."

NANCY LANTHIER-SOCAN

"My favorite band, period. If everyone knew of the Rheostatics, the world would
be a better place."

DAVID WISDOM-CBC NIGHTLINES VANCOUVER

"Canada's best band. They should be pictured on the $10 bill."

BRENT BRAMBURY-BRAVE NEW WAVES

"The best band in Canada"

KURT SWINGHAMMER

"This brilliant "Group of Seven" of rock create epic, resonant anthems of CAN
CONsciousness. A glorious noise informed by
the incredible scale of our landscape."

Michael Barclay-id Magazine

"...keep in mind that the Rheos on an off-day are ten times as interesting as
anything Spin or Rolling Stone canonizes."

LENNY STOUT-THE TORONTO STAR

"...the single most accomplished Canadian pop group of the decade. The closest
thing this generation has to the Beatles..."

MIKE BELL-THE CALGARY SUN

"Rheostatics are responsible for some of the most eclectic, intelligent and
truly Canadian music to come from this land in the last
five years."

*** If anyone is interested in checking out the Rheostatics I would recommend

"nickb" made some comments about Neil's beliefs, and in doing so made mention
of the fact that some people could not qualify their statements on praying for
him.

Well being a Christian and listening to the music of Rush can be difficult at
times.  I have a deeply profound love for God, and being a Christian is not
always the easiest thing to do.  However, one of the most fundamental issues
of Christianity is love and compassion for fellow man.  If everyone is
entitled to believe in what he/she wants, then I offer up to you this shampoo
simple explanation for the prayer offered to Neil, by myself and others on
this list...

Christians believe in the healing power of prayer, and the believe that God
hears and answers those prayers.  Just because Neil may not share those
beliefs, doesn't mean that God won't hear and answer our prayer that Neil's
suffering is eased, and that his "spirit" does not remain broken.
As opinions go, you may not subscribe to this idea, but I wonder that if we
started to believe that that prayer didn't work, would we also stop trying to
share the "gospel" as it were with those who do not yet believe.

Having said all that,  I will tell you that I do listen to Rush all the time,
I enjoy the music, and even have a great time at their shows.  And if there is
one thing that I have learned from the boys, it is to not close my mind to
anything, because anything can happen.

I know we try not to burn TNMS time on theological discussion, but I think it
is good to hear all three sides of the story.

Oh, btw I cannot wait for the video!

Till next time,

Olin

I had a really odd dream last night.. I somehow travelled back in 
time to my first Rush concert in June 1977 at Newcastle (England).
I managed to get a seat in the front row, somehow.. after the 
support band (Stray, I seem to remember they were quite good) left 
the stage, one of their roadies handed down one of their guitars
to me.  It was a black SG with only one pickup.. still plugged in.

Anyway for a laugh, I decided to crank out "Spirit of Radio",
knowing that it wasn't due to be written for another two years and
none of the audience had heard it .. then I had a cold thought..
Alex & Geddy  would be able to hear it over the PA and would never
write a song they'd already heard before..

The dream was so vivid that I had to check my copy of Permanent 
Waves when I woke up to make SOR was still there...

Digital Man is perhaps my favorite Rush tune. According to TNMS #99, it
was only performed live on the Signals tour. But that list doesn't include
tours after Presto. Has Rush performed Digital Man live since then? I know
they did not perform it at the T4E show at Fiddler's Green in Colorado
last year.

Does anyone know how the band feels about that song? Do they not like it,

 James Smith mentioned: "in "A Work In Progress" Neil Peart states that the
drum solo is a good place for him to experiment and take chances in a
concert..."

Its also a place for him to play some of his drums bits from songs not played
live.  I know of two, but there may be more.  For example, this "Rythym
Method" features Presto's "Scars", from 5:31 - 6:03.  Its very obvious,
especially the fills from 5:54 - 6:03.  In addition, we get "Momo's Dance
Party" from around 4:10 - 5:30 (this tune reminds me of Weekend at Bernies II,
where the voodoo bewitched Bernie dances whenever music is played).

I can't believe someone said he can do without "Leave that thing Alone!"  To
my ears, that song is the epitomy of Rush's musical prowess, and each
instrument and musician is showcased.  Neil is simply incredible with his
fills, Geddy's superb mini-bass solo's are in the forefront, and that guitar
solo of Alex's literally gives me shivers, the way is "soars" and keeps
getting higher and higher.  I wonder if they get as much of an adrenaline sure
when playing it as I get when hearing it.  I only wish that for Different
Stages they had blended "Thing!" the "Rythym Method" similar to "YYZ" on ESL. 

Thanks to all of you that answered my question regarding Hammersmith.  And by
the way, the Clash song I mentioned is titled "White Man in Hammersmith
Palais", from their 1st album.

I really, really don't mind if Rush is not as commercial as they once
were.  Just think about this people, us fans of the "prog scene" or
the "prog metal scene" (whichever group you want to belong to) is
as tightly knit as it ever could be or will be.  Much of the thanks
can go to newsgroups like this one (for Rush) and others for
bands like Yes (Notes from The Edge), King Crimson (Elephant Talk),
etc.  Please, forget the charts and remember that numerous
odler acts are experiencing the same plight.  Do you think
Robert Fripp of King Crimson has EVER cared about his chart
standings with his Eno, projeKCt, or KC albums???  Do you think
Jon Anderson stays up at night because his new age ramblings
don't top the charts????  No, they don't care and Rush won't either
and we fans shouldn't.  Face it, liking Rush's music is not a popular
choice for people in general but we shouldn't care because Rush
will not sink so quickly that they can't continue to write
material and tour in support of it.  Rush will go on
as long as they enjjoy what they are doing and ARE ABLE.  Back to
the "closely knit idea".  We are closely knit relatively speaking and
it's much harder for a fan base to dissipate once it feels like "family."
I would not say it's a cult; hopefully we don't center our lives on this
handful bands (or just Rush).  The following is like rooting for the home
team
in sports or something.  

Those rappers, country singers......they will live quickly and die quickly.
They will be an afterthought in years to come.  The memories of Rush
will live on in those who dared to go there....like us.  This is something
special, the appreciation for music....for the music of Rush, among the
music
of others.  It's music, it's life, just enjoy it and free yourself of the
"plastic"
society we exist in.  I emphasize "exist" because I don't subscribe to music
the way that society wants, I subscribe to "freewill".  I live my own
life....not
"their's."

This is partly due to the fact that CD's rarely get damaged enough, or
wear out enough, to replace, the way tape or vinyl does.  The reason
Pink Floyd's DSOTM sold so well for years was that people played it

So, a friend of mine raises parakeets (yes, this is Rush-related; bear
with me).  She has bred a variety that have head feathers that give them
a mop-top, over the eyes, Beatles look.  Hilarious.

Entertainment Weakly reviewed Rush rather badly.  But let us recall that
this is the publication that thought Buns n' Poses Abuse Your Protrusion
was about the greatest rock album of all time.  They thought Starship
Troopers was as good as Star Wars (it bombed in four weeks, which was
still too much damage to RAH's reputation.  Thankfully, his widow made
them take his name off that piece of refuse.  Director Verhoeven
deserves to be castrated with a rusty spoon for treating one the classic
SF stories in that fashion.)
So, The reviewer claims that the drum solo "ain't happening."  Obviously
not.  It was neither juvenile thrash bang nor straight 4/4 time, so it
wen't over his 2nd grade mentality.  He claimed 2112 and NS were
"masturbatory."  Obviously.  It sounded to me like Alex was having an
orgasm during both, and I sure as hell was.

So, I have found an appropriate use for EW--lining the bottom of Dusty's
Parakeet cages so the Beatle-looking birds can shit on the critic...

I want to say a public "thank you" to Rob Miceli for his hospitality
towards me at The Orbit Room on the night of the 13th.

I was in Canada on business, and took the opportunity to see Toronto.
As luck would have it, Alex was there that night.  I met him shortly
after dinner while things were still calm, and expressed a brief
"thanks".

The place got very busy and crowded, but I did also get to meet and chat
with a few really big fans.  It was a great experience.

Later,

My jaw dropped when I read this letter regarding Alex's appearance at the
Orbit Room on 13 NOV.  I was also in Toronto for the weekend and convinced
the friends that I was with to check out the Orbit Room.  I had been there
before in the summer one evening and my girlfriend and I were 2 out of a
total of 10 people in  the room (including the band;it was a Tuesday).
Anyways, my friends and I arrive at about 11 pm and discover a line.  The
line spanned the length of the stairs so we decide to wait for a bit.  We
get to the front of the line, finally (there were tons of dudes weaseling
their way in) and a real nice woman was controlling the door.  Well, my
friends (not Rush fans) found out about the $5 cover and didn't want to go
in after that :(  If I had know Alex had been there that night I would have
pleaded my case a little stronger :(  Oh well, maybe he had already left by
that time.  One bonus that night was the cute blonde taking money gave me a
kiss when I was able to provide a cigarette.  So it wasn't a complete loss

To all Rush fans,

I want to make a statement: Rush is a band for those who use their
brains.  Yes, this is true.  I'm 28 years old, so when I observe today's
artists' that have record contracts, I must stratch my head in wonder. 
Marilyn Manson?  Come on man!  This guy, nor his band, have enough
talent in their big toes to hold a candle to Geddy, Alex and Neil.

When I speak to true Rush fans, [not those who like "Tom Sawyer" only] I
leave thinking to myself, "Self," [you see, that is what I call myself]
"...that was a smart individual I just conversed with."  But when I
speak to those young juveniles who admire those idoits who can't hold a
tune, but are making millions, I have to wonder what is wrong with
America.

Thus it is written; so it shall be.

Hey folks --

Thought I'd alert you to a GREAT group.  I know that we are a
collective group of many different musical interests and tastes;  and
I figured that as music aficionados, some (or most) of you would
appreciate great vocals.

The group is called M-PACT! and they're a 5 piece a cappella group
from Seattle.  Their repertoire ranges from jazz to funk to everything
else.  They are 100% a cappella and AMAZING!  They make incredible
sounds with their mouths...  each time I've seen them live, their main
vocal percussionist does a drum solo with his MOUTH...  and it sounds
INCREDIBLE!

With no further ado, I'll tell you how to get hold of some of their
tunes...  http://www.m-pact.com.  THeir new CD is called "2," and I
suggest you listen to the sound clips "Rain" (whoa, amazing texture),
Fantasy (great arranging), and If We Try (just all around happy
sounding).  Though ALL their material rocks, these are among my
favorites.

These are great guys who have become friends of mine...  and their
vocals are class-act.  CHECK THEM OUT!
