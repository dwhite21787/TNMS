Hey folks:

Just a couple of things....

1) To the guy who mentioned Rush as having opposite views in their lyrics
("Anthem" vs. "Alien Shores"), I thought your comment was great. I don't
think it means that was is NOT a political band, or doesn't care about
social commentary.
I think that they represent what most of us do..living examples of
"dichotomeys".
Who say's you can't have individualism without community? I remember reading
Neil's interview in the "Libertarian", I believe it was, and he talked about
where their where numerous areas where he STRONGLY disagreed with what Ayn
Rand said, but also felt that she played a certain part in his thinking at
the time. But, he evelved, and learned that you CAN live with "two sides" to
the story. Neil mentions he was rather bothered by a couple of things..1)He
didn't like her "write off" of the Woodstock Generation, and 2)He saw so
many people who subscribed to her views as always TALKING about certain
things, but never DOING them. I just wanted to point out one last point
here....that two issues and points CAN live side-by-side. My wife believes
in Capital Punishment, and doesn't really believe in gay rights. Me, on the
other hand, opposes Capital Punishment, and am very much for gay and equal
rights. BUT, she is very educated, and I love AND respect her ver dearly for
it. She doesn't try to "cram" her thoughts down my throat, and I don't
her's. We respect each other, period. So, opposing views CAN live in
harmony..in fact..it may be only human nature. Besides, the world would be a
DAMN boring place if we didn't have different oppinions.

As far this whole Neil vs Phil Collins; Alex VS whomever....people..as one
other fine person said...the members of Rush have always showed great
respect for their fellow musicians. EVERYBODY has their own strengths and
weaknesses. Don't forget, each musician out there is also an ARTIST, and
many on here seem to forget that. They measure techincality as the only
means of "goodness". Even just look at Alex for a moment...he could play
like a shredder and a zillion miles a minute. But, he uses the ARTISTIC
instinct of how he fits into Rush's music, and create such elated solo's;
colours; textures. Even Phil Collins....I may not like much of his solo
work..but he also writes music, and thinks as the drums as becoming a part
of the WHOLE of the song, not just something to look at seperately. You
know, I've been very much into Celtic-pop lately (big here in Canada), and
the musicians rely on "feel" more then anything. Yes, the technique has to
be the..BUT..as the saying goes..the WHOLE is greater then the sum of it's
individual parts. I listen to a song as a "whole"....I don't sit there and
pick out each players parts. Take a song like Bravado for instance...very
simple guitar/bass/drums line...etc..but the COMBINATION of
guitars/bass/vocalharmonies/and rhythm make this song just dripping with
emotion. There are no 10,000 a mile minute solos, or whatever....but just
the sheer melting of THE CRAFT..songwriting...and I think Rush just seems to
get better at that, especially in the last 10-15 years. Besides, Rush are
not JUST musicians, they are ARTISTS, and I think they pride themselves on
that very much.

Anyways, IMHO...

Peace..

Slim Jim likened Neil to Ronaldo.  Sorry, Slim, Ronaldo is definitely no Neil.
Neil has never been over-hyped by Nike.  A better comparison would be Neil and
Franz Beckenbauer, since Der Kaiser revolutionized the libero position, ie
took it to a higher level.  Johan Cruyff might work as well, at least better
than Ronaldo.

BTW, the fastest guitar player is Edwin Moses.  The man is quick.

>>> Neil Peart is the Michael Jordan of drums.

I think it would be more appropriate to compare Neil Peart to an 
international sports star like Ronaldo, rather than someone who
plays a sport which is really only popular in one country.>>

As much as I love Rush and Neil, any comparison to Michael Jordan is
completely offbase and utterly ridiculous.  Be realistic.  First, Neil's
abilities in comparison to other drummers don't even begin to compare to the
way Jordan dominated the sport of basketball.  Jordan is widely perceived as
the greatest basketball player in history.  Neil holds no such honors.
Second, Jordan's national and international prominence is legendary.  He is
probably the most famous athlete in the world right now, outside of perhaps
Ali.  Most people in America, let alone the world don't even know who Neil is.
I love Neil as much as anyone here, but to compare him to Jordan is just plain
silly.  They don't belong in the same sentence.    

As for basketball being popular in one country, are you kidding?

Dear rush freaks,

I watched VHI's "metal mania" this weekend which covered bands like 
Motley Crue, Kiss, Ozzy, Metallica, Def Leppard, etc.  While watching 
the one on Ozzy, they went into his days with Black Sabbath.  A brief 
flash of a chart indicated that they were the number 1 band requested 
for radio play in about 1974-5.  Guess who was number five? That's 
right, our boys. They had some pretty stiff competition.  Number 2 was 
Zeppelin, I don't remember 3, Queen was 4 and Rush 5.  Just thought I'd 
clue you in.

Take care all.

Chris

Hey all,

I could rave about the beauty of "Totem," but I won't.  Instead, I'll say 
that its great to see the Fixx get a mention on tnms.  I've always seen some 
similarities between them; not in their musical styles (the Fixx are a lot 
more minimalist), but in the lyrics and social messages.  Unlike a chameleon 
band like Rush, the Fixx unfortunately stagnated until it was too late and 
the 80's went by (and yes, I do have their 1998 album).

Cheers,
Simon

Hey all,

No, this isn't a shameless name drop, but a serious concern.

To wit: my musical tastes evolve, as do all of ours, and over the past year 
I've seen a swing away from Rush and towards Phish, Hornsby, and world music.  
Its nothing drastic, no apostasy, but COS, FBN, HYF, and other albums that 
once were permanents have now dropped by the wayside.  So, my fear:

what happens if Rush mgr, bless her soul, experiences a sea-change and drifts 
away from the band towards Kenny G and Bolton and tnms falls by the wayside?

   [ Kenny G and Bolton?!?! *shudder* Now Live or Our Lady Peace on the
     other hand... :-)                                         : rush-mgr ]

Something to think about as we wait for whatever happens to the band.....

and btw, what news is coming from the band?

cheers,

Simon

In two seperate posts folks have asked about Scarred Records.

1.  The web address is:  http://scarred.mit.edu/index.html

2.  Policy of cash only...I've only ordered one disc (Signals Over London
Remaster...it rocks), and I received it in 2 weeks from mailing my cash.

3.  The quality of the disc painting and liners is amazing, IMO.

Carry on.

[ Yes, but who is the Dennis Rodman of drums?              : rush-mgr ]

I would say that it's the drummer from Poison, Rikki Rockett. On a side
note, I have only seen one other drummer who played while standing up.
He was the drummer from The Stray Cats. But he only played a snare, kick
drum and a ride cymbal. How RR could play a full kit while standing is
beyond me.

Not being a great radio listener but i do remember various bits of Rush 
on the radio from the  80's mainly from Tommy Vance before he went very 
metal.

This is all from memeory but I remember Xanadu two or three times,  and 
he also played some tracks before album releases such as Tom Sawyer and 
Spirit of Radio from the ESL, New World Man (Signals) and  Afterimage 
(GUP) and i think Red Barchetta from MP.

Alan Freeman played Nobody's Hero just before Counterparts was released 
and some guy who i can';t remember his name played Anagram from the 
Presto album just before it was released.

Also the Old Grey Whistle Test from around 1985 had a short interview 
with Alex and played a bit from The Big Money video.

Anybody else got any recollections ?

Agreed!  Originally, back in the late seventies there was a spot 
on Metro's rock show called the "hot & heavy half-hour" - by 1979 
or so, because it was the most popular part of the programme, it
had taken over the whole show, at which point it became the "hot & 
heavy express".

Rush had a fanatical following in Newcastle in the late seventies,
due in no small part to Metro Radio, I would say.  They played 
ATWAS to death in early 1977, and by the time Rush came to 
Newcastle City Hall (June 11 1977) the Geordies were really up for 
it.  It was a fantastic night, the audience went absolutely wild
and you could see that the band were overwhelmed by the response.
We wouldn't let them go without a second encore and I'll never
forget the look on Alex's face when they came back on stage to do
Best I Can.  He looked amazed!

Cheers

<A NAME="2174029">Subject: Bands... In Case Anyone Else Cares</A>

When someone talks about bands other than Rush on the NMS, it's usually
DT, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Genesis, etc. Lately though, there have
been a wide variety of people & bands mentioned here; which is really
refreshing. Someone defended their affection of Semisonic recently.
Semisonic is a talented 3 piece (git, bass, drum), but bass AND drummer
fill out Semisonic's sound with keyboards. Their song, "Singing In My
Sleep", is a perfect pop (a GOOD thing) song in a similar way that
"Spirit of Radio" is a perfect pop song. It has really great, heartfelt
lyrics that anyone into making mix tapes (ME!) can relate to. Juliana
Hatfield was mentioned as a Rush fan. I like her voice. Helmet was an
almost-thread on the NMS recently. The drummer IS a Peart fan. Someone
who hadn't listened to Helmet asked if they were worth checking out...
Yup. They are heavy as hell. I don't mean DT heavy, or Metallica heavy.
I mean HEAVY. Very minimal & spare. They have been described as having
"military-like precision". If this sounds good to you, well there you
go. One last band recently mentioned was the punk band MxPx. This one
through me for a loop. Nice call. I have Move to Bremerton & I enjoy it
quite a bit.

Now for MY band plug (besides the above Helmet plug): Take a listen to
Massive Attack. They are trip hoppy, electronic & yet quite organic.
I've heard Geddy say that he listens to them.

CMW

P.S. I know I'm behind a bit, but I just bought REM's Automatic for the
People.... What a gorgeous record! "Drive", "Nightswimming" & "Find the
River" are just beautiful.

I still am stunned by that simple question. Obviously
Geddy has had to think about this every tour, so he's
come to accept it, but great honking googliemooglies!!!
That "20 years" bit completely blindsided me.

Hello to Nick and all who have written me in the last several months about
seeing me in various media, on NPR, in Spin and Swing and Tikkun magazines,
etc.  

I haven't been able to sneak in as many Rush references in all these
media as i would have like, though occasionally i get the opportunity!  

My new book, _Virtual Faith: The Irreverent Spiritual Quest of Generation X_
is the culprit.  If you see me speaking in your hometown or hear me on your
radio station, please say hi!  I have yet to meet a fellow NMSer in my
sojourns around the country or in the media. 

All of this would explain my silence on the NMS in the last several 
months.  Things have been VERY busy.  And on top of this i'm trying to 
finish a Ph.D. dissertation!  Still, i'll have you know that i cranked 
the new Rush album all the way home in the rental car from a gig at 
Amherst College in Massachusetts last night.

I remain, your Rush theologian,

Is it just me, or does anyone else think this way.

Is it really twenty years since they wrote Permanent Waves? I mean not
released but actually wrote it.

It was such a ground breaking record at the time, a brilliant sharp and
clean sound, fantastic songs as ever, but so much more current.

I mean call me old (36), but 20 years is a hell of a long time to me. I love
the old stuff, I adore the recent stuff, and I worship the bits in the
middle, but 20 years, good grief!

I don't care what hall of fame they are or are not in, they get my medal
every time.

I don't know what the band are up to, or what plans they have, but if they
stopped now, I would be happy with what they left behind.

Thanks lads for a colossal time.

<A NAME="2174033">Subject: Interesting Review of the band</A>

As Much as I hate Rolling Stone Magazine I recently read this in
The "Rolling Stone Album Guide"

"At least Rush pumps out a more approachable and human brand of sci-fi
fusionoid pomposity than say, lofty elitists like "Pink Floyd" or "King
Crimson". That vague populist bent suits this musicianly Canadian power
trio, and hints at at its preconceptual roots as dull, perennially
second-billed metal plotzers.
Drummer Neil Peart, guitarist Alex Lifeson and bassist Geddy Lee have all
developed some fearsome chops on their instruments over the years; their
love of trickery time signatures and busy solos is what hypnotizes fans and
bores everybody else. Lyricist Peart's mystifying cosmic bent and lead
singer Lee's clawing banshee howl inspire similar love-it-or-loathe-it
debates. "2112" and "All The World's A Stage" mark the end of Rush's muddy
space-plowboy phase; with "Permanent Waves"("Spirit of Radio", "Jacobs
Ladder") and "Moving Pictures"("Tom Sawyer", "Limelight") the group sculpts
a more tuneful, AOR friendly approach without foresaking its
trademarks--middlebrow philosophizing and flashy instrumental trappings.
After "Signals" and "New World Man", popular tastes took a shift away from
the 70s' -identified progressive rock sound -of course, Rush has continued
to follow its quest, regardless of trends.
"Chronicles" gives a definitive overview of Rush's first 15 years,
graphically charting the bands gradual development over two hour long
discs- the impeccable sense of chronological detail will either be
informative or excruciating, depending on your taste. After that, you're on
your own. Rush is in it for the long haul."
Reviewer---Mark Coleman(1992 ??)

As a long time Rush fan who has read many a rip on his favorite band, at
least this review gives some
 a little shall I say "truth" to what he was trying to say....."You LOVE
em--or---You HATE em"
Oh well I found it interesting.....

Regarding the question of the "bonus tracks" on the Rush remasters.  When
ATWAS and ESL were originally released on cd, "What You're Doing" and "A
Pasage to Bangkok" were deleted to fit the album on one cd.  When Chronicles
was released, those missing songs were added to the track listing.  When the
entire Rush catalog was remastered and re-released in 1997, new technology
allowed more space on the cd and the songs were returned to their original
spots in the lineup.

     Hello fellow Rushians, here's a question that is a little more senible
that the Peart-Collins or fastest guitarist debates.  (Sorry if I offend
anyone!)   I have a couple of questions about Alex.   1)  I understand that he
INVENTED the guitar stand that he uses live when he does songs like "Closer to
the Heart."  You know, the one that holds his Ovation while his PRS or
whatever is strapped below it.  Is this true?  2) I also heard a rumor that he
played some part in the development of the pedal (I think it's a pedal) that
makes his electric guitar sound very much like an acoustic.   He used it on
such tunes as "Driven."
     By the way, I was at the concert in Dallas on the 24th of May (LPS) and
heard the version of "The Trees" whis is now on DS.  Jsut thought that was
kinda cool!

"Seconds Out" by Genesis contained drums played predominantly by
Chester Thompson, Genesis' touring drummer from when Phil took over on
vocals.  Bill Bruford only played on "Supper's Ready" I do believe,
and Phil played drums along with Chester on some of the longer, more
intricate arrangements.  This held true up until Genesis' most recent
tours.  But as I have written before, I feel that this whole
Collins/Peart debate is an exercise in futility at best.  Both
drummers are extraordinary, this from a drummer and long time fan of
both.

Hello fellow rushians! until now I have been taking the voyeristic 
approach to enjoy this news letter, and I have been enjoying it very 
much. I just have not had anything of interest to report. But I have to 
tell someone this story who will appreciate it, because the police 
officer, nor the other people involved werent too appreciative. 
  The other day I hopped in my into my automobile appropriatley named 
BY-TOR, Prince of Darkness, and took off on a quest to go get some 
nourishment. I turned on the radio, and started to sample the choices 
that Utah radio has to offer (written Sarcastically). I stopped when I 
heard ELO´s Turn to stone, and I started singing along. I have always 
had a secret love for the Electric Light Orchestra, but had a hard time 
admitting to it, until now. As I approached an intersection on 90th 
south, the song approached it´s end, and it quckly went into this 
amazing ¨bum bum bum¨, ¨bum bum bum..... It was the beginning to 
Subdivisions, on Utah radio. I about pooed my pants in excitement!! I 
lost all control, and started grooving out to this fantastic song, 
thinking It´s about time Rush started getting some more airplay on this 
station! Then I thought about all the people listening to this station 
probably enjoying this song, most not even knowing who the hell is 
singing it. Then I thought that maybe, after hearing they will go to the 
local record store, and pick up a Rush album. And then of course they 
will then get addicted, and have to collect them all, and then they will 
join all of my fellow rushians on the TNMS fanzine, and all because they 
finally played a Rush song on this radio station. Then suddenly I saw in 
front of me a brown bus full of handicapped kids, and the next thing I 
saw was my beautiful by-tor suffer a painful, and messy death as she 
plowed into that brown tank of a bus. Now my point to this story is I 
don´t think this incident would have happened if rush got a little more 
airplay. I even tried to blame the whole thing on the radio station, but 
the police officer looked at me as though I were some kind of idiot. So 
I hope you all have learned something from this story. If you happen to 
be driving, and Rush comes on the radio, pull over. Thankyou for 
listening.
Sincerely, Matt osmond

The bonus tracks are simply the fact that "What You're Doing" is on ATWAS and
"Passage to Bangkok" is on ESL.  Previously, these were deleted on the CD
versions and only available on Chronicles.
