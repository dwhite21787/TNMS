For the paranoid among you, no "Natural Science" did NOT get dropped off the
live album setlist; my copy/paste didn't quite grab it all... so do not panic,
NS *IS* on the live album.

Doug was kind enough to send in the partial setlist of the 3rd live album,
from the AFTK tour:

   Something For Nothing / Cygnus X-1 / Cinderella Man / A Farewell To Kings /
   Working Man / In The Mood

He also mentioned that there is a CDROM package in the works. It supposedly
will contain trivia, live footage, videos, interviews, a history on the band,
and a game. 

Perhaps THIS is why they had me take down the RV files from syrinx? (as if 
seeing the RV version would cause a SINGLE SOLITARY Rush fan to NOT buy the 
CDROM, hah yeah right)

Touchie subject huh?
     I have to say that I don't hate Dream Theatre, but I feel they are a
major let down...........
I loved "Images and words", but I did not like the shift to metal like Chunk-
a-Chunka on the" Awake" album. That's probably why Kevin Moore left and that
was a huge nail in the coffin for that band. I think that the sucess of "Pull
me under"laid the ground work for the Awake album. Bad call.
   The best example for why Rush would never make that kind of mistake is
compare Moving Pictures to Signals. They did not milk the previous success,
instead the moved on and the moved on again with Grace Under Pressure.
    They have not stopped moving ever since. I still like bits and pieces of
every Dream Theatre album, but until the learn what being a progressive band
is from the heart and not by a billboard chart, they will be lucky to remain
second best.

Pretty strong comments, I would have to say I disagree with some of them.
Try to catch DT live sometime (they play small clubs, awesome shows), if you
think they are "soulless", or listen to "Falling Into Infinity", it is a
much more mature album.  There are plenty of people who have criticized Rush
over the years for being all chops, and no soul, and that's because they
don't really know the music.  We all know that's not true.  You have to
remember that DT is still a relatively young band, and they've gone through
lineup changes already in their short existence.  DT is technically amazing,
but Rush is better at crafting music, and much of that is songwriting, and
experience.  To quote Geddy from the booklet in Chronicles,

"I think the writing stage is the most rewarding; everything else revolves
around that.  I don't think that was true 10 years ago, it was playing
then."

I love DT, but I can say that they are still in the "playing" stage, where
that is the most rewarding part.  I believe that their songs get much better
musically every album...so give them a few years.  Its a little unfair to
hold them up to Rush at this point, I think its pretty safe to say that Rush
is almost everybody's favorite band on this list, and nobody is going to say
they like DT better.  Plus, Rush has a lot more experience, they've been
making music a hell of a lot longer.

I don't know if there is a point to this whole message, I just needed to
express MHO on this, as a DT fan.  But I would say for those who think Dream
Theater is drivel, try out "Falling into Infinity" (borrow it from a friend
or something) before making a judgement, and give them 10 more years before
trying to compare them to Rush.

Ad

P.S. Please flame me personally if you feel it necessary...the NMS really
doesn't need more flames.

P.P.S.  I would say that DT's song structures are more influenced by Yes
than Rush.

Not to be too pompous about it, but I was at the second Worcester Centrum
show on the CP tour (March 12, 1994).  I know for certain that they did
not play "The Pass" that night.  The only track from 'Presto' they played
was "Show Don't Tell" complete with inflatable rabbits and animation.  
	Hope this clears some stuff up.

<A NAME="2082012">Subject: Top 100 Solo List</A>

Hi all,

I wouldn't sweat the injustices of the recent Top 100 Solo List too much.
These lists are all bulls**t anyway. If you want a big shocker (too me
anyway), the recent Top 100 Books of the Century (or whatever it was called)
in USA TODAY excluded anything from Ayn Rand (such as "Atlas Shrugged" or
"The Fountainhead")!! Now THAT'S an injustice, as anyone who has read "Atlas
Shrugged" can attest. 

Speaking of Ayn Rand...I have read several of her books now, and I'll tell
you how I got turned on to her. One day I was in the bookstore, and I was
thinking I wanted to read one of the classics (get some culture you know -
ha). Anyway, I go to the classics section and there is "The Fountainhead" by
Ayn Rand. I think to myself - "I know that name - she was mentioned in the
credits for 2112. Cool! I think I'll buy this, it must be a good science
fiction novel..." - duh - what I dork I am!! I am very glad I read it however...

The new and improved NMS web page looks great!

Later,

Doug.

<<Rush would probably not be interested in doing this, ......but if they
ever did.......what songs would you want to hear? I have 2 choices I
would like to start this list with:

1. "NSU" by Cream
2. "The Wizard" by Black Sabbath>>

Well, I love the idea of a Cream tune, but NSU would *not* be my first
choice.  (Believe me...I love the tune...it just doesn't seem interesting
enough for Rush to be able to work with it.)

Actually, I've always wanted to hear *anyone* cover "Tales Of Brave
Ulysses", and I can't think of a better band for it than Rush!  (But can
Geddy get his voice down that low?  ;) )

For a second tune, I'd have to say "Bells Of Saint James" by Kansas. 
It's really a great tune, and I'd love to hear what Rush can do with it.

Third, I'm gonna have to say probably "Keep Yourself Alive" by Queen. 
Once again, I just want to hear what they could do with it.

Now, I'll have to stretch for a forth tune, and say either "My Name Is
Mud", "Jerry Was A Racecar Driver", or "Tommy The Cat" by Primus.

Or, who knows...maybe just the full version of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.  ;) 
(Imagine the drum solo *this* time!!!!  :) )

<A NAME="2082015">Subject: Was Neil in Queen????</A>

I'd like all the Queen fans on this list to break out your copies of the
Hollywood Records 20th anniversery editions of the album "Live Killers". 
Look at the page with all the pictures on it (when you first unfold the
liner notes).  The top row of pictures, third from the right.  John
Deacon (with long hair) playing his bass.  Is it just me, or is that a
*dead ringer* for Neil Peart (Fly By Night-era)?  

You need further proof?  How about this?  "John" (if that's his real
name) is the quiet one in the group, never talking to anyone, and simply
wanting his own privacy.  But by all accounts of people who've been
friendly to him, he's a very friendly person.  There's also another
picture of "John" on the very right of the page, very bottom picture in
the far-right column, which shows "John" with his hair cut, and he once
again looks like Neil Peart (this time Roll The Bones-era)!!!  Also, you
never see them both in the same place!!!!!!!  HAHAHA!!!!!!!  =)

(Oddly enough, for any MxPx fans there might be out there, in the liner
notes to Teenage Politics, there's a picture of Yuri in which he looks
like the *spitting image* of Robert Redford!!)

One more thing, since I'm on the subject of pics...doesn't anyone else
here think they could've gotten a better picture of Neil playing his
drums for the AFTK liner-notes/inside cover?  I'm sorry, but I laugh my
ass off everytime I see that picture, because it looks like he's about to
fall off his throne drunk or somethin'!!!  And neither Alex *or* Geddy
look that goofy...why just Neil?

I got my first look at the Geddy Lee Jazz Bass today.  The bassist in my
band bought one and I have to say that I really like it.  It sounds great,
better than his real 76 Jazz bass.  Those pickups area absolutely slammin'.

As for the painted on fret markers that was a common practice for Fender
during the 70's.  Not all basses got the mother of pearl or the black
inlaid markers.  Anyone who has studied Fender knows that there are nothing
if not inconsistant when it comes to features and options.  

The craftmanship of the GL jazz bass that I saw today was by far a bargain
for the price that my friend paid.  (About half of the price that he paid
for his 76.)  

He played it tonight all though our session tonight, and has declared it
his new main bass.  Not bad considering that it's his sixth.  After playing
it for a while myself and listening to it all night, I give it a big thumbs
up.

The hard part.  Not buying one for myself!

Hi all,

I saw some messages about Dream Theater and as a DT fan, 
wanted to throw in my few percents.

 Scott McDow <mcdow@ibm.net> wrote

>Couldn't have said it better myself. I'm not saying

Well, too much for the senses is just very objective. For my senses 
the music is just great. I think DT is more progressive as compared 
to Rush, but I guess everybody has his own definition of true prog 
music. I guess Rush is just different prog, but from a viewpoint 
of song structure and (as I would call it) "stability" of songs, Rush 
is far ahead (of DT and any other band in the world).

If you don't think DT is too much for the senses and you think your 
senses can have somethng more, I would like to recommand Emty Tremor. 
Their debut album Apocolokyntosys is compared to Images and 
Words from DT, but this young band from Italy certainly have their 
own style. I would say their album is even more prog than DT. If you 
would like to hear something from them and challenge your senses, 
look at their fanclub's page for some sound samples (from 
Apocolokyntosys and their unreleased album) at

http://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/venue/1794/

I was really blown away when hearing their album for the first time! 
I would say as must have for true prog fans!

Hello fellow NMS'ers,

Just a quick FYI on the so-called 'Top 100 Solos' list. It seems to have 
been a reader poll conducted earlier this year. Therefore the results 
should tell you more about the people who read GW and give a crap about 
such lists. For Lerxst to rank at 94 (and Zappa to rank at 60, Santana 
to get only 1 entry, etc.) while Pantera gets 3 or 4 entries has, IMHO, 
no bearing on what the actual top 100 guitar solos are. That actual list 
exists in the hearts and minds of each and every one of us. 

I look at the list so that maybe I can get turned on to something I've 
perhaps never heard before. But it still pissed me off that Working Man 
was the only Rush to find it's way to the article.

Rush-MGR: Nice job and thank you for this informative and sometimes 
amusing forum!

That's all I got for now.

     Someone said recently that the title of the upcoming live album ought 
     not to be a topic on the NMS. Why not? It's very valid topic, if you 
     ask me. So here it goes.... I said before that I really do like 
     "Dimlit Stages for All Ages". I really do. I said before that it has 
     multi-level meaning, and it does if you think about with a 
     light-hearted, yet critical mind. Besides the neat-o meaning(s), it 
     sounds cool. A little different, but refreshing. Someone correctly 
     questioned if "Dimlit" is actually a word. Well, no. To be correct, it 
     should be "Dimly Lit Stages for All Ages", but "Dimlit" sounds better. 
     Words are only "correct" after they are used by people for a time. 
     Now, there is talk about the title being "Different Stages". It seems 
     to meet with more approval here on the NMS, but I don't like it. It's 
     bland. I'll take either title because I'm pretty confident that the 
     packaging & song list will be superb. My greatest fear, title-wise, is 
     that the words "cyber", "virtual" or "net" will be used. Please. 
     Don't. If you're listening, please. Don't. Please.

     P.S. Bob Mould has a song called "Compositions for the Young & Old". 
     That would be a cool live album title for Rush; especially when you 
     consider the fanbase.
     
     P.S.S. To all getting bent out of shape over the 100 greatest guitar 
     solos, don't sweat it. Those lists are good for laughs; nothing more.

     Since the show, their season premier, was in Vegas, they made some jokes
about the origins of gambling.  One game they mentioned was called "GOLDRUSH."
They said, "you answer questions about the rock group Rush and win Nazi gold."
There was also a joke about goats, methinks.  There, it is reported for all to

Hey All!

I must say that I am somewhat disappointed that Natural Science appears
to have been cut from the live album. It looks like 2112 will be from
the TFE tour, which makes sense, since it is complete, but why include
another Tom Sawyer over something new? We're already going to get a
bunch of stuff on the Hammersmith CD that has been released on ATWAS and
ESL (Another CTTH! In the mood! AAAGH!). I can appreciate the importance
of this show in their career, but a show from the hemisphere's tour
would allow for more previously unavailable live material, such as
Hemispeheres and Circumstances, although A Farewell to Kings, and
Cinderella Man would be great. I'm not too hot on Cygnus X-1 at the
moment... some parts are great but a little overblown. I'd also like a
live version of The Camera Eye, but they'd have to go back to the MP
tour to get the complete version.

I was adding up the time for the two CD's based on the track listing,
and I knew that if they included 2112 on the newer CD's that they would
limit what they could put on from the 'being considered' list. Let's
hope that they fit 75 minutes onto each CD. They used to argue that they
didn't include material that they wanted to because of space limitations
on LPs. Well, the sound quality of CD's doesn't deteriorate if you fill
them up, and the manufacturing process is so reliable that they don't
get many rejects (there used to be many more rejects if they put much
more than 70 minutes on a CD). So here's hoping for 225 minutes of
music.

What happened to 'Natural Science'?!?  That would suck if they didn't

_Different Stages_ for the title and it even conforms to the stage theory
for their live album titles.

I have always thought that 'Heresy' was a good showcase for Neil's drumming
ability.  I haven't even attempted to play this one on drums.  It also shows
that he is able to incorporate many influences into his playing; even a
rhythm he heard while sleeping on a rooftop in Togo.  Another good one is
'Bravado' especially the fills at the end.

I know how you guys hate rumors. I'm not too fond of them myself but, I heard 
a rumor that Neil was on politically incorrect. Can anybody confirm/deny.  
What was talked about?

   [ Yes Neil was on. He didn't say much, probably two sentences' worth of
     stuff (he kept getting interrupted).                        : rush-mgr ]

Also, awhile back I was watching My Generation on VH1 and there was a
reference to Rush.
The question entailed: what do these artists have in common.  Phil Collins,
Neil Peart, and someone else.
And the contestant responded right by answering drums.  Just some FYI.
Lately too, I have been having to put up some defense about Rush and the
red star of 2112 and their
classic symbol with the man and star.  I have had alot of people tell me
that Rush is devil music all because
the star is slightly resembling a pentagram.  Well I told those ignants to
listen to their lyrics.  You can't understand
anything until you've experienced it.  And obviously, they are closed
minded and haven't experienced Rush.  I think
the song Witch Hunt explains it all, don't you think?  Any ways, it's not a
pentagram.  It's not drawn the same
way.  The corners aren't interconnected.  It's just a star in a circle.
"The red star of the solar federation" is all it is
supposed to represent.  I would be curious however, to know how  Neil came
up with that symbol.  Maybe its a reference to the Soviet Union in some
way. I don't know.  In a way Rush hasn't stop using this reference
either I think.  Look at how many songs contain Red in the title.  -Rush

Greetings fellow Rush freaks,

     I cannot seem to comprehend all of the ad nauseum comparisons
which are continuously made on the NMS regarding Rush and Dream
Theater.  To be completely honest, outside of the fact that the two
bands are lumped under the genre title "progressive rock", there are
no real similarities.  Dream Theater has more complex musicianship (in
most respects) than Rush, while Rush simply writes catchier tunes. 
Rush is of course by far the better of the two (in my humble opinion,
which is like an asshole, everybody's got one) but what is the point
in wasting everyone's time with the comparisons?  Just relax and
enjoy, or don't, the choice is ultimately yours.  Later.

To all those guitar players out there (bassists included), I'm trying to
play "Bravado" on piano.  Therefore, I need someone to help me out by
giving me some notes/chords.  See, I can play by sound, but for I can't
seem to figure out what key that is in.  Please, if someone could just
send me the key signature and notes, I'll figure out what octave and
stuff.  Thanks!!

IMHO:  The name of live album, "For every (sad) son of a bitch"   
I hope they put "Red Barchetta" on the live album, I love how Geddy just
improvises the ending with that bass.  RUMOR:  This guy that sells
Bootlegs, and knows that I'm a huge fanof Rush, informed me that one of
his distributor pals swore that "The Pass" was played along with "Vital
Signs" at a couple of shows during CP tour.  He saw a bootleg of it, but
it's real bad audience tape.  He said they probably played it for the
sole reason that it could be put on an upcoming live album.  See, this
guy that distributes imports and bootlegs to small music store markets
also said that the reason why they probably didn't use songs from RtB
concerts was because too many soundboards were being sold or stolen
(that's why so many RtB bootlegs exist).  Again, this is rumor only--only
comes from the mouth of a man who knows the bootleg industry.

Hey,

This thread is probably long extinguished, but I just wanted to add 
my endorsement to the Mercury remasters. I got Signals yesterday. If 
asked which Rush album is my favorite, I have to pick Signals for 
sentimental reasons. Subdivisions was the first Rush video I ever saw 
(9th grade), and the LP was the first one I got (a Christmas present 
from my stepmom and dad. It helped pass the Christmas blizzard of '82 
in the grandest style). Its themes of adolescent suffocation in 
suburbia and of adolescence as a metaphor for technological and 
political upheaval struck a chord in me that still resonates today. I 
always thought the narrow stereo picture, squashed dynamic range, and 
claustrophobic mix were puposeful musical choices. When I bought the 
album on CD a few years later, the sound of the transfer served to 
reinforce this.

I was unprepared for how dramatically different the remaster would 
sound. The stereo perspective is very vivid and three-dimensional. 
The guitars chime, sing and roar. The drum sound is very crisp, and 
the synth-bass notes rumble. I played my original CD and could not 
believe the difference. One is a hologram, the other is olive drab 
wallpaper. I can hardly wait to hear the other remasters in 
comparison to their older counterparts. WOW!!

Happy listening,

Matt

Hello everybody, It's Cristiano again.

Reading the NMS I've noticed that the old "Dream theater is good, Dream
theater is bad" thread has been re-debated. I'd like to add my 100 Lire
(I'm italian, you know!); I absolutely LOVE Dream theater, I've seen them
live two times, and the last time I've also met them (great people, very
friendly and warm). Now you might say "Hey, this guy loves 'em, so he'll be
everything but objective". Yes and No. I've written in their defence, but
I'd like to state that they're actually "borrowing" riffs from Rush and
other bands. Want some examples? Here they are:
The middle section of "Innocence faded", before the solo is basically the
"wind in my hair..." section from "Red Barchetta"
The verse bass riff in "6:00" is very similar to the "a quantum leap
forward..." part from "Natural science". DT copying Rush? I don't think
so... I mean... In the prog-rock kind of composition there are some...you
can call them cliches, like playing drums in 7/8 and keeping the ride bell
straight on the eights so that it moves between downbeat and upbeat at the
end of any measure. Put on a Yes, a King Crimson  or an ELP album; chances
are you'll find some similarities... But I see I'm deviating from the basic
thread... sorry ! ;-)
I absolutely don't agree with the other NMSer who says DT is slightly ahead
of Blind guardian and Symphony X. That's because while the guys from those
two bands are extremely gifted as musicians, DT has developed an unmatched
skill in arranging their songs (of course that's a personal opinion);
they're light years away from those other bands, followed by their close
friends, Fates warning (their drummer is the new Neil, hear "Inside out",
you'll see!). I really think DT and Rush are similar... When Rush started
playing they were  drinking from the "hard rock" pool that existed at that
point... Led Zeppelin, Hendrix, Cream (names given from king Lerxt in an
interview). DT drank from the same pool...in which were flowing new
waters... Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, even Frank Zappa, Rush and the
whole prog movement; basically you play what you hear, and as Rush did,
they are synthesizing all their musical knowledge and also adding their own
personality to compose their stuff. I can understand many of you can't
stand the heavy sound of the band, but I can also imagine that in 1975
"Bytor and-you-know-who-he's-white-and-furry" sounded a little bit too
heavy and "out there". DT are young... let them grow and you'll see... take
a listen to "falling into infinity", they sound extremely mature and many
of you will reckon many "Rushy" moments (definitely Mike Portnoy, the
drummer, ate bread and Hemispheres when he was a child). Rush is great..
no... wait... RUSH IS REEEEAAAALLLYYY THE GREATESTEST (double superlative)
BAND IN THE SOLAR FEDERATION, so it's obvious they've influenced many
younger musicians... Look at DT in this way... They're the most gifted sons
of daddy-Rush, and they'll carry and pass the torch of PROGRESSIVE ROCK
(drums begin to roll... sounds of distant fanfares)to keep its flame alive
to enlighten the youngest generation to come (now a choir of 139 children
in white robes begins to sing "Alleluja"); Who...in the dark times of the
brit-two-chords-and-a-melody-so-simple-but-beautyFoul-pop in the black days
of indus-grung-alterna-quack-bark-wuoulw-spatapam-rap-ska-rock...who will
go to the teenager (reversed baseball hat, HEAVY jacket also in the middle
of an african summer, and a pair of the-fabric-is-enough-for-three-pairs
jeans) give him two good slaps on the neck behind and slip in his walkman
some great prog tape? who? who? WHOOO? EH? (two white dressed man come in a
strange car with a silly noisy flashing light on the roof, put a nice new
white jacket on him and carry him away in a comfortable "stuffed" room,
while the children are still singing the end of "marathon" (asoh version).

In response to the Burning for Buddy post....

First off, I AM a serious Rush fan, but perhaps more accurately, I would
classify myself a MUSIC fan.  That said, the Neil Peart productions of the
Buddy Rich Band 2 volume set (to date), is nothing short of impressive.  To
me, it serves both as an excellent introduction to big band jazz (aka
'swing'), and also illustrates the diverse prowess Neil has with laying
down a rhythm, no matter what genre.  I would not recommend these sets for
someone wanting to hear Neil's drumming (he only plays on one track on the
second set as well - but it's the longest one!)..... I WOULD recommend
these albums to someone wanting to expand their musical horizons, and at
the same time, show a little support for a project that one of our dear
Rush boys has done an admirable job with.
