I have all of the digests since I joined the list about 9 months ago ...
why I kept them all, I'll never know.  It wouldn't be very difficult for me
to search through them, and sort them, and put them someplace accessible.

I've already got this bitmap mail service that I've been running, and it
wouldn't be very difficult to set up something for digests.

If there's a desire to have things like this, I will be more than happy to
take the time to set it up, and maintained, etc.  Please send me email, and
I will post a note in a few weeks telling everyone whether it's going to be
done or not.  Please don't post here, since this should be simply a
discussion of Rush material, not misc. things.

     - Jeff

I had a couple of questions about some old RUSH music:  does anybody
out there have an exact data for the "Stellar Dynamics" album?  The
best I can do is '1974'.  I've seen another boot from Cleveland dated
8/26/74, recorded at the Agora.  Is this the same as S.D.?

Also, on that album, they do a song I don't recognize:  "Fancy Dancer".  
For now I'll assume it's not one of theirs, rather a cover (like the 
Beatles' "Bad Boy").  Does anybody know who originally wrote/recorded it?

Also, does anybody have the lyrics to "You Can't Fight It"?  How many
(besides me) think it was cannibalized to become "What You're Doing"?
Listen carefully to the guitar solo ...

Thanks in advance,

No offence taken!    I just was making a joke!

I'm just mad I didn't know in advance about Neil visiting the Roseville
site!  :-)
