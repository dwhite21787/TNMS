Ok, I've read as much as I can without putting in my opinion concerning`
the 'musicianship' of PW and the 'failed' experiments of S and GUP.

I feel that Mystic Rhythms is one the most talented songs to date, not
to mention how the feel of the music compliments the lyrics like no other
group can master.  Also the creativity in the texture of the song must
be appreciated (especially the drums!)

As far as GUP and Signals, I challenge anyone to name some songs that have
some melodies as beautiful as Analog Kid or Afterimage.  Speaking
of Afterimage, I wish they would come back (at least for one more song) to
the sound they were playing with during the 'lead.'  Dealing with the
'failed' experiment:  I think it was a success!  Ok the texture wasn't quite
perfected but it for me was a perfect blending of the technology characteristic
of new Rush and the deep raw sound of oldish Rush (compare the Weapon to
Witch Hunt)

I find it hard to compare albums and even have a preference, but it's hard
to hear negative things with two awsome and unique albums.

Hi,

   I am kind of new to this list, but I have to say that the albums Hold Your
Fire and is the worst album I have ever heard.  It is so Psuedo poppish that
it makes my stomach turn(literally!!!!!).  How can anyone listen to this that
doesn't have to(as in someone who is committed to a home for those with no
ear for music whatso ever).  I mean to listen to these songs is to put your
finger down your throat(the term here is GAG).  If you like this album
you really need to call 1-800-DOCTORS to get the name of a good psychiatrist
in your area.  Well, now that that is over, I am so glad to be on this list
and look forward any reviews of Caress of Steel(It is my personal favorite)
and thier other albums.  I lok forward to any comments anyone has about my
first posting.

first of all, I'm rather upsett from a few posts that i've read about
the convention...................

from what i gather from talking with slythex on irc, he told that
there was about 150 people that said "I WILL BE THERE AND $$ IS NO
PROBLEM!!".. so if $$ was a issue afterall then why did people
commit?? it makes me want to vomit when someone can't keep
sure, i'd expected a few people to not make it, and I do understand
shit happens which is unavoidable, but c'mon out of 150 people with
money problems.. give me a break...

This is in response to Chris Chamberlin's suggestion for the longest
time lapse in a rush song before lyrics occur.
(Hey, this is also my first post, for anyone who cares :^)

My vote, although I only own 10 Rush CD's :( is for Xanadu,
off the great AFTK album..
I'm not sure if you actually had the answer when you posted that, but
I thought that was an interesting topic!
Listening to Signals at the moment...one of the more (seemingly, from my
point of view) underrated Rush albums...

I'm quite content with Peter Collins being the producer of the
supposed upcoming Critical Mass..Peter did producing for Suicidal
Tendencies, Queensryche, plus some other rather cool bands.
(As well as producing PoW and HyF, two of my favs)...
I'll probably post more when I get some unfinished computer science
business finished :^))  till then...

Hello RushFans(Tm):

   I just wanted to let you know. As some of you might know, I used to
be the ART keeper (you know, the trivia file), but I'm being shut down
(in fact, everyone here in Mexico) from the net. So, to the point.
I won't be able to keep the ART anymore, so the new ART keeper is
Dan Delany, the FAQL keeper. If you want the trivia file, mail him,
he'll take over from now on.

   I really enjoyed this list, it started me again on Rush, and I found
out a lot of things about the boyz (yes, I'm calling them the boyz, I don't
mind :)). Keep on with this list (even with 'Black Holes' threads!).

Hey Gang.  Just got my hands on an in the studio music interview with Alex
and Geddy on compact disc.  It is an interview about the MOVING PICTURES CD
but interestingly enough, the copyright date is 1992.    I have the Rushian
Roulette and Lavilla Strangiatto bootleg CD's on the way and the suspense is
killing me.  Does anyone out there know if a boot exists from the soundboard
that has the song "THE CAMERA EYE" on it.  That song was done up excellently
in Kansas City when they toured for Moving Pictures.  One song that does not
recieve the attention that it is due.  Any way, gotta go now.

I missed this, what happened ? Did someone tell Neil about the list and he
thought it was bogus, or what ?

   [ For anyone interested, his "actual" response is in Digest #5 (found on
     anagram.umd.edu in rush/digest)... in summary someone was showing Neil
     computer equipment, and the screen happened to be displaying an issue of 
     TNMS (back when we were all discussing what time Neil's watch said inside 
     the Presto CD booklet), and his comment was something to the effect that 
     "they should all get a life"				: rush-mgr ]

This doesn't sound like the Neil Peart we know and love....

I don't know about "get busy," but "homeboy" is a pun, son.  Is Neil
saying "you better run, homeboy" or is he saying "you better run home,
boy"?  Both fit, certainly Neil purposely made it ambiguous.

This is not meant to be a flame, so "relax".  :^)

BTW, I like the rap, too.

Hi,

I have one question about the RCB, that everyone is so all fired up about.
These are not derogatory comments or anything, just seeking some knowledge...
Hypothetical Case (ok Real story ;)) : Suppose a guy/girl does not have a boot
to make a copy of and send to the RCB.  Suppose, further, that this individual
would be interested in the coveted footware (in other words, joining the RCB).
How does this guy go about getting some material from the RCBureaucrats?. Also,
is there a criteria for rareness, or rather, if I get (ok this guy is me ;->) a
recording at a record show or somewhere and you already have it, how do I get
in?  Since there are only a finite amount of recordings out there and the
market region that I am in is not, to the best of my knowledge, loaded with
extremely rare stuff.  How do I know that when I spend $30 or $40 on a
recording that you don't already have it and all I get out of it is this one
recording that everybody has.  OK, the POINT:  I have NO footware and I would
be interest in the RCB, what do I do???

Thanks for the info,
and ...oh yeah..."I see Red, and it hurts my head!"

Okay, I'll bite. Without the aid of my CD collection (or any source to
check) I will guess that the answer is... Xanadu.

Of course, there are quite a few possibilities... The Camera Eye, Anthem,
Jacob's Ladder, Cygnus X-1, and many others. Because I won't be able to

I wasn't going to waste everybody's time with an article correcting a

That last line should end "suspiciously similar lines".  I was puzzled
by how I could have missed that.  When I called up the file on my
original posting, it turned that out I never forgot anything, I just
let the line go too long and the word "similar" must have been cut off.
 Even if I had made a mistake, "rash stupidities" is not the word I
would use in this situation.  As for my credibility, do you know me?
Do you actually think less of me because you THOUGHT made a mistake?
I'm sorry I'm not perfect.  I didn't realize someone would have so much
trouble making sense out that line that they include it in an article
complaining mistakes!

(Calm down, count to 10 ... okay)

I guess my point is that not everybody has excellent writing skills.  I
certainly do not.  This message is probably full of errors.  However,
there is no purpose in attacking someone's credibility for making a
mistake, especially if they (I) never made a mistake to begin with.

Fellow Rush Fans,
	Three cheers for Mr. Grammar.  Maybe I'm picky, but sometimes the
English (if you can call it that) used in this newsletter drives me up the wall.
By the way, Mr. Grammar, what does "oeuvre" mean?
	As for the rap in RTB, I think it sucks.  I like the rest of the song,
even the music behind the rap, but I just can't get used to my favorite band
rapping.  Some people have written it off as humor or the ability to integrate
other styles of music into their own.  I call it a sellout.  As a matter of 
fact, the entire album didn't strike me as anything special (I can feel those 
flames already).  I'll admit there are some great songs on the album, but it 
took a lot of listening to get used to it.  It gives me the same feeling as 
HYF did when it came out: disappointment.  Don't get me wrong.  I like these 
albums, but I guess I just expected more.  Personally, I still think that 
Presto is the best album since Signals (maybe since Moving Pictures).

The band is Weather Report, and "Heavy Weather" is probably their
most well-known album.  It features the often-remade song "Birdland",
which you may have heard several times, especially the version with
vocals popularized by the Manhattan Transfer.  The original is an upbeat
jazz instrumental.

Rhythms are varied enough through the album that various pieces probably
found their ways into Neil's style, but I have never heard the connection
stated.  Without trying to describe it I'll just say: It's worth a listen.
I'd probably put it in a sylistic category somewhere near Santana and Tower
of Power, or several Jazz-fusion folks, but the connection's pretty vague.

<A NAME="683015">Subject: Ramblings</A>

Just getting a few RUSH thoughts off my head as I've been away
for a few days (In Toronto on Sat. 5/15, saw Leafs beat Blues.
Was hoping the boys would be there, but no sign of them).

First, enough with this RCB stuff! Either subscribe to them or
don't. But let's not waste time discussing them, it's not worth
it (sorry if that's considered a "flame").  Second, I was
curious: Is your favorite RUSH album the first one you ever got
into?  My first listen was MP and it is still by far my favorite
(followed by ESL, the first CD I ever bought).

Lastly I just wanted to share a moment I recently had.  I just
bought the ASOH disc and when I put it on and heard the cartoon
type intro I had goosebumps as it brought me back to my first
RUSH concert (Signals tour) and how they had the same opening.  I
had never known that ASOH had this bit.  I used to tell all my
friends how cool I thought the opening was and now I can hear it
all the time!  Sorry, one more comment.  When I saw them on the
Signals tour they opened with The Spirit of Radio, and Geddy
changed the word "radio" to "baseball" during the song (mainly
because it was the day after opening day).  Was this common on
that (or any) tour or did I get lucky?

   [ It seems to be the consensus that he said "baseball" throughout the
     Signals tour (at least 3 separate occasions have been verified).

that tripe in the slitest. Here's my reasoning (as flawed as it
mite be).

    This is a news group for Rush fans, no ?

    Typical reasons for liking rush:
      a: Incomparable individual musicianship
      b: Facund leeriks of lowness, unequalled in todays rok (IMO)
      c: Transcendant consonant continuity
      d: Survigrous resonance that taps 1's inner sensez with
         melodious hooks of musical intreeg.

    Now, given just theez tipical reezons, how kan U ekwate any of
theez to anything U C on MTV ? 2 me, itz inkonseevabl. U wood never
heer a Dead-Head say he/she watched/liked MTV, so how kan Rush fans
say any different wen the 2 R so diametrically opposed ? I don't know,
maybe I lak the sekret. Some 1 help me 2 understand.

<A NAME="683017">Subject: NON RUSH RELATED MATERIAL (Dream Theater)</A>

    Hello all,

        Sorry for the non-Rush content but I thought the Dream Theater fans
here might enjoy this.  On Tuesday May 18th, DT played on show at a club here
in Buffalo.  This was the second time they played here in the past 6 months.
Anyway a local radio station broadcasted the show LIVE and I recorded it.
I've listened to some of it and it sounds great, if you happen to be
interested in a copy let me know.
        But there is a catch...Friday the 21st I graduate which means I'll be
losing my account here at Buff State, so the only way (for now) to get a hold
of me will be through the mail or phone.  (the mail might be the best choice)
So drop a line if you are interested...by then I'll have listened to the whole
thing and I can let you know exactly what is on it.
        I hope to back real soon, especially before the new album comes out,
so until then have a great summer and Roll the Bones!
