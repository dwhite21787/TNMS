I think this is the one aspect of RUSH that has really captivated me
throughout the years. I find that I get myself into modes where I'll
listen to something from them, and then, in disgust, toss it back onto
the shelf where its sits unlistened.

Later, by some fluke maybe, or on a whim, I pull it out and throw it
into the CD player, only to rediscover it. Suddenly, I'm pulling the
albums out that surround it, or are in a similiar phase.

This happens continually. For the person who rated "Presto" last on
his list, he may turn that around in 6 months. Rush has changed enough
and has provided us with enough material that we can go through moods
with their music.

So, it's not which is their best or worst song/album/cover/producer
etc. It's who are you today what what mood are you in?

The best Rush is whatever is playing at the time. The worst, well it
has to be my track of Spirit of Radio...the one with the skip/stick in
it...that track really sucks :-) (so I got a new CD.....)

I Also do not like the Rap section (although it is hard not to like
anything from Rush, or even force yourself to like since it is Rush
You just want to 'trust them' that it is good stuff, eventually
you will like it, but not this time.), but I can't convince myself it is a
joke.In a Peart interview (sorry, forgot the reference, but its in the ftp
files somewhere) I read that he considered Rap music "A genuine form of
musical anger and frustration".  So it seems to me they were playing with the
sound of Rap, and what resulted is not Rap, not a joke, just Rush experimenting
with a new musical sound.  But to me it sounds like Rap and regardless if its a
joke or not it is hard to 'get into' like 'normal' Rush music.
I also remember in the same interview that Geddy doing the voice was a result
of many auditions that were turned down.  They just couldn't find someone
they liked-for it made it sound "too Rapy".  As for the lyrics, it
definitely isn't "Rapy", it is more of the same theme of the rest of the
album: Chance, circumstances, Roll the Bones!

Lame excuse, but if Geddy is really incapable of reverse lip-syncing then
they should get rid of the bouncing-skull video and replace it with a
close-up view of Geddy doing the rap *live*.  Personally, I go to concerts
to see bands actually perform the songs that they release - any extra
video effect should be a plus and not a substitution...

Anyone with some brains could use a really obscure song title, lyrical
phrase, or trivia fact relating to RUSH as their passwords.  Those types
of passwords would be almost impossible to figure out, even if the
perpetrator *knew* that they related to RUSH.  *Obviously* using words like
"geddy" and "presto" might get you in trouble.

I guess you could say I'm fairly new to Rush, since I didn't really get into
them until last September, but the way I got hooked was listening to four
friends of mine do covers of Rush's stuff together.  The first Rush song I
ever heard was a medley they did of Xanadu/YYZ, then Time Stand Still.  My
friend who was the band's guitarist loaned me ASOH, and, well, the rest is
history, as they say.

<A NAME="688009">Subject: Longest before vocals, and such randomness...</A>

Well, as the original poster on the "What's the longest time before the
vocals come in" thread, I thought I'd follow up.  Xanadu is indeed the
winner - the vocals come in at ~5:03, compared to ~4:28 for 2112 and
somewhat less for Hemispheres.

Hmm... seems to me that many of Rush's finest songs are also rather long
(Xanadu, 2112, The Camera Eye, Natural Science, LVS, etc).  "Critical
Mass" would be made one better, IMHO, with a nice long song along those
lines.  I know Rush has moved beyond those epics of old, but a nice long
jam could be a real winner...

Next in the ever more obscure trivia - As Rush has "matured" (?), Geddy
has displayed an aversion to the "hey babys" of In The Mood, that eternal
staple of the concert-ending medleys.  What might be some of the words
he's replaced "baby" with?  How about a hint - in listening to my newly
aquired Spirit of St. Louis CD boot, he says something, but I can't figure
out what the hell it is.

By the way, The Spirit of St. Louis (from the PeW tour, as you might have
guessed) is a fine boot - a definite highlight of it is Natural Science,
never a favorite of mine until I got this version.  Also recently aquired
is Over The Europe, which is just as good as everyone else has been claiming.

<A NAME="688010">Subject: Worst guitar solo (By a great player)</A>

I don't seem to recall any of Alex Lifeson's guitar solos as being "bad".
Some of them aren't very memorable though.  I would like to say that there
is one particular guitar solo by an INCREDIBLE guitarist that absolutely drives
me crazy over how sloppy it is and how it leaves me wincing everytime I hear
it.  I'm refering to Steve Howe's solo in "Heat of the Moment" on the first
Asia album.  I think that it just flat out sucks.  The structure is OK, but the
actual playing is horrible and there are some definite nonharmonic (out of key)
notes near the end of the solo.  Maybe he intended for the solo to sound like
it does in order to make a statement that even though he was in a "pop" band
he was still the same "art rocker" he had always been.  Maybe not.  I don't
think that Alex has done a solo that stands out as being so far beneath his
average output as Howe's solo on that song is from his usual virtuosic
performances.  Please feel free to flame me personally about this.

Could someone please send me the address for the Primus list?

Also, what particular song took the longest to get used to?  Mine is probably
"Vital Signs" from Signals.  I got the album in late '84 and had a difficult
time listening to that song until around late '91.  I don't know why, but it
freaks me out that I used to skip such an awesome song.  Oh well!

They did on all the versions of RTB I have seen. (CD, Vynil and I pretty sure
their on the tape as well - it would be most unlike Rush to make such an
arbitrary distinction).

In response to the 'printing of RTB rap lyrics', the lyrics (to the rap) are
certainly on the cassette inlay (although not integrated into the actual
song lyrics, maybe they didn't like it either Chris... :) ). I seem to
remember it as 'homeboy'. Sorry. MC Peeert strikes again I think.

Hmmm... not sure I agree it's a security risk. Could be if you pick
something embarrassingly obvious like 'geddy' or - yes, you at the back
there, we know who you are - 'rush'. Mind you, 'Zgedneil' is an old password
of mine, I suppose that's a bit obvious really. Oh well. I'm sure you can
keep them obscure enough for it to not be a problem. Unless the cracker's a
major Rush fan, then you have problems. More to the point, I don't think
crackers deserve to be thought of as 'anyone with some brains'. Any *moron*
could do that. And no, fact fans, my current password is not Rush-related.
Used to be, though.

Mumble! If they dump Critical Mass as a title I will be one unhappy bunny. I
hope this is disinformation. Otherwise I hope the album is damn good to make

Uh yeah, get typing... :)  I'll try to see if I've got anything else, but
I'm not sure. I've got exams next week too, but they don't matter (um...
HHOS on that one). Anyway, I certainly think that 'for whom the bus rolls'
is a seriously neat journal, and I really want to see the 1st bit! I think a
single file for all Neil's stuff is a bit awkward, maybe a separate directory
under 'special' on syrinx? Maybe all of the 'special' directory should be
sorted into directories like this? Maybe I should stop saying 'maybe'?

It's all too much. I'm so stressed I may even do my coursework which has to
be in tomorrow... aaargh.

The lyrics ARE printed on the CD booklet (at least on my Atlantic
7 82293-2 CD), page 4, next to a picture of three rolling bones and
a dice window (?).

It goes: "Better run, homeboy"

Whadd'ya mean "why didn't they print the lyrics to the rap"???  I don't
remember them NOT printing them.  Here they are from memory (meaning
that I realize they could be wrong, so don't bother flaming):

(Reprinted without permission)

Jack, relax, get busy with the facts
No zodiacs or almanacs or maniacs in polyester slacks
Just the facts
Gonna kick some gluteus max
It's a parallax, you dig?
You move around, the small gets big, it's a rig
It's action, reaction, random interaction
So who's afraid of a little abstraction
Can't get no satisfaction from the facts
You better run home boy
A fact's a fact from Rome to Nome boy

(interlude)

(Shit, I can't remember the first phrase!)
blah blah blah, spin the wheel, if the dice are hot take a shot
Play your cards, show us what you got, what you're holding
If the cards are cold, don't go folding
Lady Luck is golden, she favors the bold
That's cold, stop throwing stones
The night has a thousand saxophones
So get out there and rock and roll the bones
Get busy!

Regarding the "homeboy" vs. "home boy", I remember commenting to myself
when I saw the words on the inner sleeve of the CD how great of a play
on words it was (then again, this is a long time ago, so again I could
be wrong).

WEll I went to check those famed Dream Theather band.....and here is the
report.

Before the show started they played Limelight, and Freewill, which got me to
a good start.  The show begins........... The band can paly really good
live, the bassists was pretty incredible for the first 30 minutes, and then
he lamed out.  The keyboradist was really good.  the guitarist was really
good, the drummer was good with the band, but without the band all he did
was copy Neils drum solo.  Part of his solo was just like the solo from
ESL.  Anyways, the band can still a few lessons from Rush.  They defenetely
played very tight as a group.  They are up & comming.

TNMS shirt!  I couldn't believe the number of people that approached me...
I personally don't like the shirt that much, but it was a magnet.  

   [ A shame.. I'm sure if you mailed meg@syrinx.umd.edu and returned
     the shirt she can provide you with the FULL refund, no questions
     asked, and that goes to anyone else too.             :rush-mgr ]

I met a guy that has seen Rush 22 times.  The first time he saw them was 
when they were opening for Blue Oyster Cult in Dallas.  He said they were 
no more that 700 people at the show.  He has alot of pictures of this, plus 
he meet the band 7 times.  I'll talk to him some more, and relay any good 
info here!

Sure is a BIG RISK!!! Anyone could crack passwords this way - or even
worse: download Crack 2.0 and feed to it the Rush lyrics as a dictionary
and then run it - instantly any account with a Rush-related password will
be discovered. That's why I don't have passwords related to me in any way
- not things I like, not things I hate. Only things that do not have
anything related to me.

O.K.: sorry for the sermon, but now that he's talked about this I must
      warn you about all the possibilities.

BTW, I heard that the new album is not gooing to be calleeed _Critical
Mass_ anymore. You got any ideas on the new name? (I already was working
on a spoof of the album (_Cynical Mess_) - I guess I'll just have to
wait and think :-/.

    Well,  I've been listening to all of the talk about who likes and dislikes
    HYF and I decided to add my thoughts on the matter.  I started listening
    to Rush at about the time of AFTK and PEW and started getting all of
    their albums.  I loved MP on the first listen but SIGNALS, P/G, and POW
    all took a breaking in time.  I bought HYF when it first came out and I
    absolutely hated it.  I bought PRESTO and had the same reaction.  I then
    went about 3 years without listening to any of the newer albums.  About
    the time RTB came out I decided to give the newer albums another
    chance and now I love them.  Go figure.  I don't really know why the
    initial dislike but I now think they are great albums that just happen
    to be a LOT different from the earlier albums.

Hi Everybody.  In yesterday's post someone wrote about how they were
disappointed about Rush not playing the "rap" section live at the concer
t they went to.  I saw Rush last year in the early summer at the Pacific
Amphitheater in Irvine, CA, and they did perform it live.  It sounded
fantastic!!!  It was better than the studio version.  In fact, it was
pretty incredible.  There was an added keyboard part that complimented the
existing guitar/voice/drum parts perfectly.  IMHO, I think that if you are
completely disgusted/opposed/disappointed with the "rap" part, you should
go back and listen to it again from a Rush point of view, rather than a rap
point of view.  I am not a fan of rap music, and at first I was tripped out
that Rush could do something like this, but I have been a fan of theirs for
almost 20 years and I couldn't dismiss this song just because of a shallow
first impression and narrowmindedness.  I did go back and listen again, and
I'm glad I did.  It exhibits the precision and perfection that only Rush can
accomplish.  They have the ability to adapt and create the most incredible
music from the current styles that only one-hit-wonders can do only once.
If you still don't like it, that's okay, but do it from the point of view
you would dislike something of theirs and not blame it on Rap music.

They did not sell out.

See ya

Did they not perform the rap live in the US?  When I saw them at Wembley in 
London, they performed it really quite well, I was quite amazed... the 
Skeleton was on Video singing, it would stop then RUSH would continue, they 
would stop, and then the Skeleton would carry on singing.. etc...

And.. thats all I have to say really.,...

Hey everyone!

I have been a member of this list for 2 years now and I don't remember ever
seeing this brought up when people talked about the symbolism of album covers.
I FINALLY bought Power Windows on CD and when I looked at the cover I noticed
that the picture on the inside (the kid with the binoculars) is also
superimposed on the screen of the large TV set on the front cover.  Check it
out!

Hi everyone!

'Been a while since I've posted.

"right to the heart of the matter":  I took the liberty of uploading a
silly little .au file that I made last summer, when I first started
playing around with _audiotool_.

I think (hope) most of you would enjoy it.

I can upload .voc or .wav versions, if there's any interest, but please
mail me directly.

Yours,

Nick "superior cynic" Bruels
