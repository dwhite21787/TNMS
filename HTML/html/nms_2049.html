Read your post about rush - Iron Maiden!!!!

I was with ya all the way up until you said Iron Maiden was washed up!!!!
Maybe in America...

In Europe and South America Iron Maiden is Selling out especially in
Brazil...

I am in Canada...I payed $22 to see rush....I am paying $35 to see
Maiden...

And Maiden has almost sold out their copps colliseum show in Canada as
well..for June 28th.

so I'm gonna have to disagree with that one...

Martin,

" Narpets"   is an anagram for parents.  Mama y Papa.  "Didacts" is a
rearranged addicts.  I think you guys are mui bien (mucho bueno?) to
translate this stuff.  The music is so powerful, but the lyrics are
awesome!   You are great to translate and share with others.

My son Alex, who just turned 5 thinks "It's my turn to drive."  Just to
contribute to the kiddie lyric thread.  He keeps saying that he wants to
go see Rush.  Don't we all?

There's an old saying that goes something like this, "Better to keep quiet
and have people think you're stupid, than to open your mouth and remove all
doubt."  C'mon guys, are we supposed to believe that TRUE Rush fans (or
NON-Rush fans, for that matter) didn't know about this tour?  Even if I
hadn't been on the Net, I still would have had the initiative to find out
about, and then go to the eight TFE shows that I went to.  Rush follows
every CD with a tour!  Duh!

My RED BARCHETTA would be a 1995 Acura Integra.
And yes the obvious song was the first song played.

But living in the "Great White North (east)", I drove it home from the

Hey Ed, they played Rush in Marine Midland when the Capitals won also.  I
guess that means the Sabres are going to win the series.  And, if you look
closely at the TFE tour program (yes, for you who don't know yet, Rush did
tour after TFE), you'll see several photos from the CP show at The Aud.
Slam dunk for the Sabres.  Rush Dominates!

<A NAME="2049009">Subject: Your Own Red Barchetta / Rush and Kids / King's X</A>

This is my first post.  I'm relatively new to the list, but I've been a
Rush fan for close to 20 years now.  I remember hearing "The Spirit of
Radio" when it first came out in '79 or '80.  I was in elementary school
back then.  From that point on, I've been a diehard fan.  I'm 30 years old
now and Rush is *still* my all-time favorite band.

Anyway, when I turned 16, I bought my first car: a 1974 MG Midget.  I fixed
it up really nice and had it painted bright red.  One of my favorite
pastimes was driving around with the top down in my own "Red Barchetta"
while listening to Rush.  I don't have that car anymore (couldn't afford a
full-time mechanic), but I always think about that car every time I hear
the song.  I loved that car.

I have a 2-year old daughter now and believe me, she is getting her share
of Rush as we drive around town in my Black Honda Civic Barchetta.  All
indications suggest that she loves the music of Rush too.

And, for those of you interested in King's X, I recommend "Gretchen Goes to
Nebraska" and "Out of the Silent Planet".

 -David.

Hey there, Hi there, Ho there!!

The only reason I knew about the T4E tour coming to Boise, ID was 
because my little sister's ex-boyfriend and his dad like Rush and they 
happened to hear a radio spot promoting the concert.  I immediately 
called the BSU Pavillion's box office and heard on their recording 
that, indeed, An Evening with Rush was scheduled for May 19th, 1997.
The next day, I heard the radio spot myself.  The big thing was that 
it was the first time Rush had been to Boise(Or anywhere in Idaho, 
for that matter) in 12 years and that they were going to play 2112 in 
it's entirety.  So...I got to see my heroes in concert without having 
to drive 4 hours to Salt Lake City, UT!!

Be this as it may, what other reference exists that covers the three in such
detail...?

And how many FAQs have been beefed-up over and over again simply from the book's
info?

In other words, how much would we NOT KNOW were it not for VISIONS?

And I never remember the "B-Man," as he's called, making any claims to being
anything other than a fan who got close...thus the tone of his book, I suspect.

Yes, I agree:  Too bad a serious journalist didn't have a piece of VISIONS. 
Although right now, 1998, might be a good year to start a definitive work,
seeing as the odds of Rush being through look pretty high.

I just noticed somthing today I though I would share with all of you.  I was
looking through my comic book collection (including The Defenders comic
dedicated "To Alex, Neil, and Geddy of Rush, And the Rock N Roll comics
featuring Rush) and I came across my Beavis and Butt-Head collection. And for
the first time I noticed that Rush Counterparts was mentioned in it. Just
thought I would mention it.  Also I would like to second the nomination for
Natalie Merchant as a female singer...I have all of the 10,000 Maniacs and
Natalie solo albums...She is incredible...One last thing, For those of you
interested in hearing the song "Bad Boy" that Rush played live in '74, I just
made a wav. of the entire song, It has the Proffesor on the drum kit, and it
is really cool. 
Also I noticed this thread...Water...examples...
Here Again (Like a mountain river bleeding)
By-Tor and the Snowdog (Across the river Styx...)
Lakeside Park
Into Darkness (Fording the River Dawn)
There are tons more obviously, Just wanted to point out a few...Neil once
commented "We come from water...the source"...I guess he want's everyone else
to know

To add from Japan, not only from his outfit and unique charactor,
"Animal" Leslie was very well-known and good relief pitcher
while he played in one of the professional baseball teams in Japan.
I recall the footage through TV program that once he recorded his 
own song in studio wearing Rush T-shirts!

Speaking of baseball player, amongst those who like baseball in Japan,
Wallen Cromatie(sp?) is also very famous as good and impressive 
professional baseball player once played in Japan.
Of course, his name can be found on the back of "Signals" cover!

<A NAME="2049015">Subject: U2 Vs. Rush</A>

I think, long ago, like maybe two years ago *when I lurked only* 
someone on this list compared Rush with U2.  I would like to comment
on comparing these two bands and defend U2 against the attacks from
a Brazilian NMSer.

You can't compare these two bands to find similarities...except in one
instance, these bands are BOTH true to their art, the art of music.
Rush has high integrity in musicianship, technically if not emotionally.
Rush is not "emotionally" saturated *IMHOP*  In other words, their
music nearly prefectly blends emotion and cold-calculated music...to
a certain degree.

Now, most of us will say U2 is none of that.....and, this is true.  But,
U2 has high quality musicianship in another way - they are emotionally
"saturated".....every note, every lyric (in The Joshua Tree era at least)
was full of soul!!!  Yes, soul!!  U2 always said they wanted to make soul
music....well, they did!!!!!

One more thing, Rush is not really associated with a religion while U2 is 
leaning heavily in the realms of Christianity.

This is how I feel about these two bands personally.  Rush's music is
ridiculusly
intelligent in my mind and I find a certain kind of comfort in that - their
music has helped me mold a good outlook on today's society.  BUT, U2 is 
more emotional, more searching, more "me", and more "real."  I can identify
with U2 because I think they believe in much the way I do myself.  With
Rush,
I feel the lyrics are more meant for the everyday dealing with
people....from other
religions, etc in everyday life like at school or work (we should put
religion
aside at those places).  U2 is, well, more sacred to me.....

This isn't getting much of anywhere.  Anyway, I just want to sum it all up
by saying that I like U2 and I like Rush; which kind of music (and message)
I like more ...well, I can say I like U2 more on the message side of things.
Rush is, hands down, the BEST in musicianship!!!!!

Defense of U2;  Hey out there, U2 is not popful, U2 is not horrible, U2 is
obviously not for you but don't shun them!  Bono NEVER bad-mouths people 
and he (and the rest of the band) only wish the best for each  and everyone 
on earth - not just U2 fans.  Now, while I can't guarantee Bono listens to 
2112 or Moving Pictures once a day, once a week, once a month or ever.....I 
can say that he(and U2) would say they respect Rush if they were asked what 
they thought of Rush (I'm sure they've heard of them).

(Sorry Rush Mgr. if this post seemed kind of U2-leaning; but, I've mentioned
Rush numerous times on WIRE (the U2 listserve) - I even had some good 
responses....oh, and U2 is like neck and neck with Rush for being my favorite 
band)

Take care all,

Chris A.  

ps.  Just curious, are there any other U2 fans or "WIRElings" on the NMS?

<A NAME="2049016">Subject: VH1's Top 100</A>

Hello there,

I'm going to "cut to the chase".  After being somewhat disappointed with   
the "Limelight" pop-up-video.  I waited hours to see Rush finally get a   
little respect on VH1's Top 100 Artist/Bands of All Time, after all this   
one was being picked by the musicians themselves ... right?

Well, unless they showed up in the top 15-30 or so (missed some of   
those), they didn't make it.  Now, IMO, the producers of that show should   
be thrown to a pack of wild wolves.  Let's add the host Kevin Bacon for a   
little flavor.

I guess that as time goes by, the list will change.  Only the greatest   
make that list ... hmm.  With all due respect, Nirvanna - number 42?, and   
(take a deep breath) ... The Clash at #31!  Even more ridiculous was Devo   
in the top 40, yes that's right ... Devo.

OK, I'm finished complaining.  On a lighter note, in response to the   
"Kids and Rush" post my son (26 mo. old) keeps saying "mus-mus" (music)   
in the car.  So I turn on the radio .... "No! ... mus-mus daddy he   
says!". So I put on Moving Pictures and he smiles from ear to ear, and   
says "yes daddy mus-mus"!  No kidding  folks!

This is why I like to make a copy of my CDs, then play the copy and put the

for your own personal use. :) With blank CDs from $0.70-2.00 per cd, and
writers as low as $250, it's become very affordable.
If anyone wants a recommend, I use a Phillips CD-R (SCSI) on a Windows NT

Hi all--
For those who haven't seen Dean Haglund of the X-Files (playing the role of
Geddy), check out this months Yahoo Magazine with Gillian Anderson on the
cover.  There are a couple of articles and pictures of the Lone Gunmen.

I was also wondering what type of rock stations play Rush.  Are they
straight away classic rock, playing all pre-80's music, or are they a
mixture of classic/new rock, playing classic and bands such as Alice in
Chains.  I've noticed that one station in town that plays classic/new rock
will play any era Rush, but the Straight away classic station will play only
SOR, TS and CTTH.  Just wondering.

Karen, I wanted to post a reply to your opinion on Visions and then
apparently I forgot about it. To put it briefly: You took the words
right out of my mouth.

I received Visions as an unexpected gift (through the mail) from a
distant friend, and make no mistake, I was thrilled and blown away that
such a book *existed* the first time through. Later, it became apparent
that *way* too much of the book was about Banasiewicz's adventures
following the band, this at the expense of more objectivity and broader
scope. And the lyrical references weren't just cheese - they were
*Velveeta*. 

I'm very curious about the purported reply from B-Man. He does a bit of
whining in the book about certain interactions of his with Rush, so I
wouldn't be all that surprised if it really was him. He comes off (in
Visions) as a little, um... high-strung. Feel free to e-mail it to me
privately - and you too, B-Man! Love to hear from ya! (heheh) Hey, we

Dear All,

Don't know how many Norwegian subscribers we have on the 
NMS at present, but I just thought I'd let them know that 
the Elm Street Rock Cafe in downtown Oslo appparently plays 
Rush on the stereo - check it out! (The info. comes from my 
fiancee, who lives in Oslo, is still unconvinced that Rush 
are the best band in the world and prefers the Smiths!).

As some of you may recall, I had posted my intention to 
provide an analysis of why there are no D'oh songs on Power 
Windows.  I've now decided not to, simply because all you 
need to do is stick it on the CD player and you'll *know* 
why.

P.S. I don't wanna start a war or anything, but my personal 
opinion is that CoS is Rush's most under-rated album 
because it's their worst.  If it wasn't for Bastille Day, 
that CD would never leave my CD rack.

     I must disagree with the point about "Red Sector A".  That song is not 
     about a world on the brink or totalitarianism.  Instead, "Red Sector 
     A" provides us with a snapshot of the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust 
     through the eyes of a victim that is ever so close to freedom.
     
     "Are we the last ones left alive?
      Are we the only human beings to survive?"
     
     Interviews with Holocaust survivors revealed that when freedom did 
     come at the end of the war, a great many believed that either they 
     were the only survivors of the war, or that very few people were left. 
     
     "For my father and my brother, 
      It's too late.
      But I must help my mother
      Stand up straight."
     
     When freedom came, the survivors still had a great deal of dignity 
     left.  Despite their poor condition, many survivors walked out of the 
     concentration camps through pure strength of willpower and dignity.
     
     A song such as "Red Sector A" clearly demonstrates, once again, the 
     depths and thoughfullness that is behind most of what RUSH has 
     produced.

Iron Maiden washed up?  In your opinion, of course.  Have you heard the
new album, Virtual XI?  It's actually a return to form for them, after X
Factor where they were finding their way with a new singer.  Iron Maiden
will never be washed up, as long as they continue to write albums and
tour.  I don't think the departure of Adrian was a big problem for
them...they were very successful before he ever joined, and his direction
was never in the Maiden tradition anyway.  He was an excellent songwriter
and guitarist, and contributed a lot to their late 80's sound, however.

Up the Irons!

I'd just like to add my 5 cents on this whole B-Man confusion. A close
friend of mine is personal friends with Bill and through him I have met
Bill myself and the whole Hold Your Fire thing is a crock!! He never did
anything like that. It's a bad rumor. I've heard this sraight from Bill
himself. "Why would I do something foolish like that", Bill said. He had
a great relationship with Alex and Neil but more so with Geddy. They
were pretty close friends. Bill in short said the reason he & Rush no
longer communicate is something personal that he won't share with
anyone, and has nothing to do with some leaking of Hold Your Fire to
radio. 

As far as Visions II goes , I agree with someone who posted that Neil
should be the one to do it!!!

I always wondered what happened to the B-man. I heard the radio show that

Boy! That would be a rather lengthy issue!

Now to my main point.  For all you Madrigal fans out there, does the line
go "in vain to search for Order, or i v t s f Honor?  The lyrics say
order, but listening to the song, it sounds more like honor.

Also, as you may have guessed, I just got the remastered AFTK as well as
MP and P/G.  I have had the hemispheres album for about a year now, and
listening to Cygnus X-1, book 1, and then listening to hemispheres, is
really an amazing experience.  Cx1 seems to enhance Book II more that if
Book II were to be listened to alone.  Also, you can hear heartbeats at
the end of the song very faintly.

Also, that picture includes the fire hydrant from Signals, and the clock
over the restaurant is set to 21:12.  Who knows whether those newspapers
on the front steps have "Dewei Defeats Truman" on them or why the Statue
of Liberty is in the top right window of the restaurant building?  I
know this has been discussed before (maybe in the FAQ), but I'm not sure
of the other album connections here.  (I think the 15 signifies the 15th
album of Rush)  I guess this all would be easier to see on a large
record album instead of a small CD booklet. :-)

If you haven't noticed already, there are lots of references on Exit
Stage Left as well.

****I don't listen to Iron Maiden, but 6/4 and 12/8 are entirely
different.  Music does not translate fractions like math.  12/8 is a
triple pattern group as    123    456    789   101112  which is often
counted in 4/4 where three eighth notes get the beat, more like 6/8
123    456.    6/4 is literally 6 quarternotes to a measure and is
duplex meaning that  two eighth notes get the beat,   COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.  Like I said, I don't listen to Iron Maiden, but they are
probably playing in 12/8  because it is more common, and 6/4 is usually
reserved for slow art song type passages....not very popular in any of
your "electric band" type of music (meaning anything besides orchestral,
some jazz, and "band" (schools)music)  Not saying that it has never been
used, it is just not as widely used.  If it has a triplet feel, it is
12/8  if it is just 6 quarters per measure, it is 6/4.  What Rush does
so well, is alternate back and forth between triple meters and duplex
meters, anyone can play entire passages in different time signatures,
it's the switching that makes it unique.  A lot of metal bands do this,
so I'm sure it runs wild in Iron Maiden songs, which is good, it marks
musicianship.  Think of Zeppelin's "The Ocean".  That is a prime example
of a song that switches back and forth between meters.  It gets really
interesting when you break away from meters based on 2  3  or  4  like
5/8 and 7/8 which have long beats vs. short beats ala "Natural Science"
12    12   123    12   12   123   or   12   34   567    12   34    567.
Not flaming here, it's just that Music Education Degree rearing its ugly
head, couldn't let the meters go by.

i heartily agree, if rush re-release a few of their albums they could
really put themselves in the "LImelight."  in omaha, one of my friend's
acquaintances(?) bought T4E a month or two after it was released because
of the cover, and he hadn't heard of them (he thought they were a new
band!)  suppose Rush released, say Spirit of the Radio, Tom Sawyer, A
Farewell to Kings, Working Man, and What You're Doin' as singles (with
the re-release of the albums hot on their heals) and put some $ into
advertising them?  maybe (gasp) a "modern" music video for the songs,
some t-shirts, and a few television appearances... they'd make it big on
the music scene in a blink of an eye.  

if there are people that actually listen to hanson (eww.....
::shudder::), spice girls and other crap like that, they must be really
desperate for good music.

another thing about the warcraft 2 codes concerning rush: you may be
right about "hatchet axe and saw," but i hadn't heard THAT code until a
couple of months ago.  because the code is just "hatchet," but it could
just be that they shortened it because it was too long.  of course, if
they shortened that, why not the cars' "every little thing she does?"
