Hi all

Well, hopefully things have settled down by now.  Yes, the issues
which appeared to be #287 and #288 were really both editions of the
same issue.  The real #287 was the second one sent.  There IS NO 
ISSUE #288.  The issue #289 was supposed to go out Wed. night, but
actually went out Thursday morning.  Also, the special edition 
transcription of the initerview was apparently a re-post, so it's
a wasted edition.  *sigh*

I think I have things set up right now.  Keep your fingers crossed.

   I would like to give my opinion on the question of rushs music videos.
 Jon C. Slenk stated that their videos are terribly bad. I think that
this is the furthest thing from the truth.  It is true that they don't
have girls running around half-naked ( Have you seen Van Halens
new video..... SCHWING!!))  But I think that is the point. Rush aren't
trying too sell themselves or anything else by use of cheap thrills.
They try to sell their music which is the most important thing.

      I can see how you think that the " Time Stand Still " video looks a
little cheesy.  But I think that this was the point.  They probably had
access to a blue screen and just thought they would have some fun with
it. They also have excellent serious videos  " The Enemy Within" "DEW"
"Big $" and by far my favorite "Lock and Key"  All of these videos are
available on the Chronicles Video Collection  except The Enemy Within
which is on the Through the Camera Eye video collection.

When I attended the HYF tour I noticed speakers hanging in the back and on 
the sides of the arena.  Since this is the only tour I've been to (so far), 
I'm wondering how long this has been done and if others like/dislike the 
effect?
                                           later,

<A NAME="291005">Subject: Neil with cancer?</A>

    I know that this topic has been mentioned previously
and is even on the most frequently asked questions
list, but I have been hearing some things recently
from Rush fans are disturbing to say the least.  I have been
told by about five people that Neil is suffering from
leukemia.  Upon hearing the rumor initially, I quickly
dismissed it in my mind, having heard that kind of
crap before.  However, I am beginning to have
doubts about Neil's health myself, since I have heard the
rumor both rather often and from compeletely independent
sources. Two people pointed out the fact that after the Power
Windows tour, Neil no longer had a tail.  They said that the
reason for this was that he was forced to undergo chemotherapy.
   I don't know.  I really hope that there is someone
out there that can deny this.  I just want to be sure.

Flames are not necessary.  I am not attempting to scare
people, cause countroversy, or be a smart ass.
I am merely genuinely concerned with the health of the Professor.

[ For what it's worth, I've heard the rumours about Neil and Geddy for
  almost ten years now (since Signals), and noones dead yet.  :rush-mgr ]

Douglas Adams calling his 4 (or 5) book _series_ a trilogy does not
change the fact that a TRIlogy is a _series_ of THREE books.  The
Hitchiker _is_ a trilogy... if you ignore the forth and fifth books.

While we are on the subject of trilogies, I wonder if the Boyz have caught
that great cinematic feat, "Surf II:  The End of the Trilogy".  Quite a
good movie, two thumbs up! :)  Also, on Bastille Day, I believe my friends
and I were watching MTV when the VJ said "Well, since its Bastille Day, why
don't we play ...", as five heads turn toward the TV in wonderment and asking
ourselves, "Are they really gonna play a Rush video before midnight???",
"... Van Halen".  I am still wondering where the Van Halen/Bastille Day
connection is.  Any help would be appreciated.  Finally, I have a copy
of Pieces of Eight on tape, if anybody wants it.  Email me if you want
a copy

You would not believe what I got in the mail today.  (Well, it was addressed
to someone else who had left and it was bulk mail, so it became mine.)  There
is this place that handles bootlegs and other live performances and sells
"blank" video tapes to customers, but the tapes just happen to have what you
want on them.  (Get it? No profit from sales of the performances.)  Anyway,
they sell things really cheap and have a very large collection of material.
It's called METAL & MORE.  It's run by a guy in Seabrook, NH.  I'll give the
address at the end of the posting.  For now, here are some neat RUSH stuff
which I found in the catalog.

MONTREAL  '83, '84     TORONTO  '88, two nights in '90
ST. LOUIS  '88         PHILADELPHIA  '90

These are just a few, and they are all around $20!  This isn't an advertisement
or anything.  I haven't even ordered from this place yet, and if someone has,
could you let everyone know how the service and merchanise was?  I'm pretty
damn excited about seeing some RUSH video bootlegs as I have never seen them
live (I became a major fan after my first listen to MP late last summer).
Montreal '83 sounds very inviting to me.  This guy also lists the quality of
each tape.  He says he uses TDK and a few other major brands to copy onto.
There are also some professional videos with rare stuff from other countries
like performances on Japanese television and interviews.  If someone hasn't
tried this place out yet, I'm going to give it a go because I want some
bootlegs *bad*.  I think most of the RUSH was shot with just one camera.

Here's the address; I think you should be able to request a catalog though
it might cost you a U.S. dollar.

       Tim Turcotte
       18 Farm Lane
       Seabrook, NH  03874

That's my addition to the bootleg talk.  I'll let you know how the ordering
goes because I know we all need a little more RUSH.  (It's been a while
since something's been released ya know.)

Regarding the EcoPak: AAAAARRRRGGGGH!! That really sucks!
I called up Atlantic to find out about it, and they were clueless.
But I did get the address to write to and complain about it:

Atlantic Records
75 Rockefeller Plaza
NY, NY 10019

I'd just write and tell them why the EcoPak rots, for example
its not durable, it's not as easy as a jewelbox to replace if
it breaks, etc. Why dump the jewelbox along with the longbox?
I agree the longbox is bad but.... They don't seem to have problems
shrinkwrapping cassettes, do they?
I figure they think that we'll buy the stuff regardless of how
it's packaged, and they're probably right. If this comes to pass,
here's an idea: take all the ecopaks, replace them with jewelboxes,
and then dump the blecho-pak in their lobby. If we can get thousands
of people to do this, maybe they'll get the point!!
At the very least, they could design the damn things so people could
move the art into a jewelbox if they so chose with a minimum of
destruction.

the rush one ;)

after digging through the pile of guitar magazines that is threatining to
take over my closet, I found some articles on Rush that don't seem to have
been transcribed yet.  I know that someone is working on the Guitar World
March 1990 article, but please tell me if anyone out there is working
on the following articles, so I don't waste my time and yours:

Guitar School May 1990
Guitar For The Practicing Musician Oct. 1986
"      "   "   "          "        June 1987
Guitar World April 1988
Music Express Feb. 1990

If no one is working these, or they have been posted, please email me within
the next week and a half, as that is when I will start typing.

I aslo can transcribe the Guitar For the Practicing Musician May 1991 interview
with Alex.  Once again if someone is already transcribing this article, or it
is already done, please let me know.
