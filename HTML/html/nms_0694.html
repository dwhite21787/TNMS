Hi -

I raced over to the library and looked up the blurb on the Ferrari
barchetta.  The headline was: "No Rush on Ferrari's New Barchetta"
which gave me a laugh.  Like everything else from Ferrari, it looks
to be a monster car.  Oh Santa . . .

That's right, fruitcake.  The now-infamous Rush Cassette Bureau Catalog has
been updated once again.  This time, "Rush Rarities 1" and recordings from the
"Hold Your Fire" and "Presto" tours have been added, not to mention another
"Roll the Bones" show (that, in all actuality, sounds almost as good as "Over
the Europe").

So, whaddaya waitin' for, jerky?  Drop yer Unca Beezus a line and say, "Gimme,
gimme, gimme!"  We are a kindler, gentler RCB.

Eleven (11) satisfied recipients so far.

Cool tid-bit, Doug.. And speaking of this, they had a big

?3? or ?4?.. that ducks, or maybe even sucks, but I would have really
gotten pumped hearing Tom Sawyer cranking as KVE walked on stge.. We

Jello!

I have to agree with Tracey about the girl in the "Escape from Moving
Pictures" film.  Admittedly, and I'm a very open-minded person, I
was a bit taken aback and, yes, even disappointed that they showed
that.  I'm not trying to be feminist or anything -- obviously they have
to cater to their audience (and even themselves) -- but, sheesh!
Especially when the cartoon guy says, "Hey, kid..."  KID?!!  If they had
him say "Lady", OK I'd give 'em a little slack, but KID?!  A bit low
for my tastes.
There's only been one other instance that I know of where the band, or
any of its members said/did anything that made me nuts from a
"sexist" point of view.  Neil's drum contest in Modern Drummer.  When
he said (and I paraphrase), "one of the most interesting entries was sent
in by a female drummer with a minimalist credo..." and then went on to
half-criticize her playing.  My hair stood on end (no, it wasn't me --
are you crazy?! :-).  What do you mean *female drummer*?  What does
being female have to do with drumming?  Why does it matter what gender
the drummer is?  You don't go around saying, "Oh, he's a good male
drummer."  I was really mad at him.  Damn it, Neil!  Of all people! argh.
Other than that, though, as Tracey said, they've done a damn good job,
at least up til now (!), of not getting into all that sex crap.  Except
of course, Alex's offerings now and then for people to take his wife,
and having her be the hostess on the bus...

p.s. The Broadway production of The Who's "Tommy" won a whole host of
Tony Awards, and Pete Townshend won for Best Music and Lyrics in a
Musical Production (or something like that).  Hooray!  It's really odd
seeing a rock song being performed Broadway-style... :-)

Jello again...

(Speaking of Neil)  He must have changed his placement of his solo
during the GUP tour, because when I saw them, he did his solo in the
middle of 'YYZ', not 'Red Lenses'.  But it was later than the ESL
version.  It was during his last fill, and I remember when it ended that
Alex came in with that long solo-like part he has, before they switch
gears to the 'orchestra part' in the middle.  But I like it better when
he does it in the middle of a song, with no introduction (and why doesn't
Geddy call him 'The Professor' anymore?  I miss that nickname).  It's
just more fun that way.  Maybe Alex and Geddy got tired of waiting for
Neil's cues, or something (???).

(there was a point to this, but now I forgot it...)

ho-hoo!

p.s. who was the other person from Hawaii?  Paul?  (Hi Jim!)  Get in

J.P Thompson - I don't think that the meant that The Rhythm Method was in
YYZ, but that the drum solo (noname)was in YYZ.  As for it being the same
solo, it's not true.  Granted, Neil uses the same framework for his solo
but the sections are always changing (kinda like your house being
different on the iside from your neighbours'). If you're a drummer then
the changes should be pretty obvious!  I, personally laughed out loud the
first time I heard him do the "horses at the starting gate" or whatever
you want to call it.  I'd been wanting him to do that for years since he
used to do something very similar, it was a great relief to finally hear
him carry through this idea :-)  Speaking of changes, how about all the
electronic stuff that he's does now?  Isn't that alone a change or are you
expecting him to come out and do something completely different?  "Now,
ladies and gentlemen, Neil would like to perform WIPEOUT" :-)

It wouldn't surprise me.  After all, Neil made a statement in a Modern
Drummer interview along the lines of:

  "Don't copy one drummer, copy a 100.  That's what I did."

HIYA FANS EVERYWHERE

Just a quick clarification about the Rhythm Method. The reference to
it being in YYZ was of course from ESL. This was FROM the MP tour.
It is also quite a bit different from the present day Rhythm method
(if it was even called that way back then). The newer version
incorporates much of the earlier version but now has a much bigger
percussion section, as well as the synth/brass section.

I think that the earlier solo apeeared on ATWAS and also on the p/g
tour.

The Rap's OK on RTB but I must admit to being uneasy with it. However
there are always little bits of some songs that I cannot get on with
(yes I know RUSH are perfect - it's me that isn't).

I think thats enough from me!

HI (Again)
Just remembered something.

Isn't the last song that Alex and Geddy wrote both Lyrics and Music
CHEMISTRY from Signals. This still has Neil playing on it, of course,
but i think DIFFERENT STRINGS did too.

Not forgetting of course, the collaborations with PYE DUBOIS on TOM
SAWYER and FORCE 10 which is not really relevant to the question, but
what the hell, they're both brilliant songs.

Sorry about the double post rushmgr

I'm Sorry for not being sure what you're talking about. I just deleted my old
NMS's and don't recall this topic. If you are referring to the contest Neil
held several years ago in which contestants submitted tapes of their solo for
judging, the winning solo did have the Marimba in it, but it was not what Neil
plays in his solo. As I recall (perhaps erroneously) Neil's _Pieces of Eight_
came out before the contest. I remember thinking that it was a gyp that
someone won just for playing like Neil. If Neil heard the solo tape before P
of E, whether he ripped anything off or not seems debatable. Melodically, P of
E sounds nothing like the winning solo, and it was also not initially in his
solo. It was a sound disk he did for MD when he bought his Ludwigs and
KAT. Blah blah blah.

As you know, there is no solo on MP, but on the MP tour, the solo was in YYZ.
I'm willing to bet it was not called The Rhythm Method at that time, but
something more along the lines of Neil's Big Drum Thingy. But that's being
petty. I do agree about the solo content, I'd like to hear new stuff. Granted,
every tour he changes a lot, but like you, I'd like to see a great big new
solo every tour. I can see why Neil will keep the cowbell thing for the rest
of time, but I really can't figure why he seems to keep so much of the solo
the same for tour to tour. Who knows?

Along the same lines, I'm getting tired of hearing Tom Sawyer EVERY DAMN TOUR.
For rtb, I saw them at both the beginning and the end of the tour, and in the
middle they toured with Primus. Thank God. Les would play Cygnus X-1 during
other tunes, and seems to have turned Rush on to playing more obscure
material. When I saw them at the end of their tour, they were playing
Analog Kid, and snippets from Cygnus X-1 and other old tunes. It was a joy to
hear them teasing the audience with so much material that had been misplaced
for so long. Also the Kooky little thing at the end of ASOH where Geddy plays
a walking bass line and Alex dances like a nut... when they played that live,
it seemed to go on forever. Those are the things that make a concert
special to me. I'd love to see much more of that. Blah blah blah

By the way...  Now THIS is being petty...  La Villa (studio), YYZ, and Where's
My Thing are not songs.  Songs need to be sung.  Hence the title.  It is wise
in educated company to refer to such things as works, pieces, tunes, little
ditties, whatever. Just don't call 'em songs.

<A NAME="694013">Subject: Enough RAP already!</A>

Is this, or is it not a Rush mailing? If it is, I'd just like to know, why
has a 30 second little bit of music, that's not even really rap, dominated
the entire NMS for the past 10 or so mailings? Enough already! Personally,
I don't like RAP (and if one person tells me I haven't listened to it
enough, or that I'm not giving it a fair shake, I'll strangle them!) I
don't mind the "spoken section" in RTB, it doesn't bother me, what does
however bother me is hearing everyone harp on it for weeks on end like
this. WHO CARES?!?! UGH! It's gone from a discussion about whether it was
a good idea to put it in the song, to an out and out discussion of rap
itself with very little to do with Rush at all. If it continues, I might
just drop this mailing, it isn't worth it. If I'd wanted to read about
Rap, I'd have looked for a Rap mailing list. So enough!

Oh, and to the gentlemen who was having trouble with English, and didn't
know what "Homeboy" meant, it's gutter speak, I don't think there's one
solid definition, I guess the closest translation from garbage english to
real english would be "friend" but I don't think that cuts it, because
it's not used exclusivly that way. It's street slang, and if you're
learning english, it's a word you can easily avoid. It's junk.

Basball player Kelly Gruber made his first trip back to Toronto as
a member of the California Angels.

>From the Toronto Sun (June 8), copied without permission:

WHAT A RUSH: Gruber had a familiar visitor in the California clubhouse
after last nights game.
   For about 15 minutes, he chatted with Geddy Lee, the lead singer and
bassist for the rock band Rush.  The two are friends dating back to
Gruber's playing days in Toronto.
   Lee was certainly not impressed by the negative reception Gruber
recieved from many Skydome fans.
   "I don't think it's good to boo the guy," said Lee, who was accompanied
by his son.  "That was a little bush.  Everyone rode him pretty hard.
   "He's a music fan and a real gentleman.  He has always been good to my
son."
