yes, real women like RUSH!

Hinano, RUSH doesn't have the backstage bimbo type fans, because
THOSE types of fans aren't interesed in the MUSIC, they are interested
in the GUYS on stage who are singing/playing it.

RUSH are top quality musicians...so, there fans are people who like
top quality music! ya know, i had an attitude about RUSH for a couple of
years...one of my favorite bands, The Runaways, opened up for them...
(this is when WOMEN playing rock & roll, especially 16 year old women,
wasn't WAY too much for America to swallow) and the guys is Rush stood
at the side of the stage LAUGHING at the RUNAWAYS!!! ooooooh!

but...over the years, i've come to forgive them! i realize now that they felt
threatened! @8*) yeah riiii-eeee!

<A NAME="251003">Subject: Rush fans in general</A>

The thread about women and Rush fans reminded me of a comment made to me by a
security guard at the "Presto" show at Shoreline Ampitheatre in the SF Bay Area
last year. I had to attend alone as my wife was living in Boston, and none of
the people I knew there were in any way fans of Rush, so I took a book. At the
time I happened to be reading the _Koran_, because discussions with a housemate
of mine about Moslem fundamentalism had got me to thinking that it would be
good to read it and see where all this stuff comes from. So there I am carrying
the _Koran_ into the show and the guard frisks me and wants to know what I am
carrying. I tell her it is the _Koran_, and she just shrugs(as though she's not
clear on the concept) and says, "There sure are a lot of studious people here
tonight." I remarked that "Rush fans *are* a special breed," and went on in. I
don't know if she ever realized *how* unusual we are...

No, most of the earlier albums (see FAQL for complete list) had 10+ minute
tracks, some with multiple movements.  Check-out "Natural Science" from
Permanent Waves, and just keep working backwards in time.

> Question: IN YYZ whats that noise that occurs several times about halfway

Check the credits: Neil is playing plywood and bell tree.  Combine the two
just right, and viola!  Listen to this as loud as you can stand it, and you
can almost tell.  Note that in the live version, he's using a "China Boy"
(that's really what it's called -- call-off the ACLU) cymbal to get a crash-
like sound without all the effort.

I do remember when Black Hole came out. I had a good time watching it. I still
quip the small robots quips from time to time, even though his name ecapes me
at the moment (the other one was named "SAM"). Anyway, if anything Neil and
the Authors of the BlackHole were well read on astronomy. There is a system
called Cygnus X-1 it consists of (as well as researchers are able to tell) a
BlackHole and a Star. Since I am a programmer I don't pretend to know how they
fit together, just that they supposedly exist.

On related note, I have wondered if Neil used the name Cygnus for the "God of
Balance" in Hemispheres. Exactly because of the unique combination of Star and
BlackHole supposedly there.

<A NAME="251006">Subject: "Rolling the Bones" as an album title...</A>

	Given that the next album is supposedly titled
"Rolling the Bones", and given that this is a slang phrase
for "rolling the dice" I thought I might add some confusion
to the discussion.
******* disclaimer - this is just me wondering aloud and
	probably has little base in reality... *********

	In Canada last June the deadline for something called
"the Meech Lake accord" passed.  This accord was an agreement
between the premiers of the provinces concerning amendments to
the Canadian Constitution; these changes were generally seen
as being to appease La Belle Province, Quebec.  According to the
agreement (made at a *very* long meeting at a chateau at Meech
Lake, I believe in 1987), the Premiers were to get the results
of the Accord ratified by their home provinces by June 23, 1990,
or the deal would fall through.  (Bear with me, the background
is important to my wondering, unless of course you already know
this....)  Anyway, about a year before the deadline it became
apparent that some provinces were going to have trouble getting
this agreement ratified by their legislatures; ruling parties
had changed, the voters were complaining, etc. and so on...
The federal government and Prime Minister Mulroney, the architects
of the deal, didn't really organize any further talks or try to
help get the accord approved; they just made dire noises about how
"rejection of the accord is a rejection of Quebec", etc., and
about how the future of the nation depended on ratifying the accord,
and so on.  Finally, about 2 (maybe 3) weeks before the deadline
a meeting of the premiers was called to try get this thing passed,
and 2 premiers went home to present the results to their
legislatures.  To make a long story short (if that's still possible
at this point), the deadline passed without ratification by
New Brunswick and Manitoba (there simply wasn't time),
and Quebec has been hopping mad ever since, with much talk about
separation, tearing apart the country, etc.
	So now I get to the point... in an interview the Prime Minister
was asked why he didn't call the meeting earlier, since it was apparent
that the 2 hold-out provinces needed coaxing to even present the
accord on the floors of their legislatures.  His response was that
he looked at the calendar deadline and counted back to find the
most opportune date to "roll the dice".  This poor choice of words
really outraged a lot of people and is still discussed in newspaper
columns and editorials today (well, last weekend, anyway).  It is
now a point of reference in Canada - you say "roll the dice",
and some people will think of Meech Lake.
	So what do you think - could this have some bearing on
a similar album title?  "Rolling the Bones" is hipper than
saying "Rolling the Dice".  I'm far from convinced that Meech Lake
could have anyhting to do with the title, but hey, the postings
were getting sparse!  I hope I've explained the background
adequately.  I'm sure I'll be told if I haven't!

[ This may be a good question to ask Neil via the Backstage Club. :rush-mgr ]

On the subject of The Black Hole and the name of the Black Hole
being Cygnus...Well, this is because they are both using real
astrophysics--at least to the extent that the only discovered
black hole(if it is indeed such) is indeed at Cygnus.

        In NMS 248 D Schmidt asked about the play list for the
Presto Tour.  I happened to go to four shows, about a month
apart.  The first show was (I think ) the first one of the tour
in Greenville, SC . . . you could tell the boyz didn't have all
the bugs worked out of things yet.  The play list was:

        In Order:  Force Ten, Freewill, DEW, Time Stand
Still,Subdivisions, Marathon, Red Barchetta, Superconductor, Show
Don't Tell, The Pass, Closer to the Heart (from a Farewell to
Kings), Manhattan Project, Xanadu, YYZ, Scars, War Paint,
Mission, Tom Sawyer.  Encore: The Big Money, 2112 (overture)
LaVilla, In the Mood, then ending from ASOH video-the Geddy's
jazz thing.

        The other three shows all had the same songs in the same
order, but The Big Money was replaced with Spirit of Radio, and
they added a short version of Wipe Out to the Jazz ending.

        I happen to have a tape of the show your friend saw at
the Nassau Coliseum . . . another great RUSH concert!

Howdy folks!!  Yeah, I'm still here at Tech for another few weeks, and
have still been picking up the Star so I figured I'd spout off about
a few things.

Firstly, kudos to Adrian for putting the Power Windows transcription
up...  I never got the tourbook, and found it very interesting and
quite hilarious.

Secondly, my spare change (more than $.02, mind you...) on the new album
and so forth.  I agree with those who think of the dice rolling
connotation of "Roll the Bones".  I truly hope this is what they mean
if that is indeed the title.  If it isn't, I think the boyz have been
back to Monserrat again....(oh brother...)

Finally, a non-Rush item, but still of importance.  Yes is making a stop
at the brand-spanking-new Walnut Creek Ampitheatre in Raleigh, NC
and THIS TIME I got tickets.  So Rush-mgr, if you're gonna check
THIS show out.  I'll be there.  I couldn't go to the one at  GMU
because of prior committments.  Sorry.

[ Yeah, I'll bop right down.  Got a ticket waiting for me?  :-)   :rush-mgr ]

Yes it has.  My friend, Kevin Anderson, who is friends with Neil, just received
a letter from Neil a few days ago, and Neil told him that the new album is
indeed called "Roll the Bones" which is from a 1960s book by Franz(or is it
Fritz?  I can't remember....)Leiber that Neil read and enjoyed.  The album
title has also been mentioned in various music magazines as well.

Anyone like to take a stab at posting the keyboard chord
progression of Subdivisions? I have the book(s), but they
seem geared more towards guitar. The guitar chord structure
when the keys are silent or soloing is of some interest too.
I have some of it worked out, but not most of it.
Anyway, I would like to know.

It struck me as I was (re)listening to Signals: that period
was perhaps Pearts strongest as a drummer. Throughout, his
drumming was crisp, authoritive, and imaginative. The styles
used are wide-ranging (even a DISCO beat!), and diverse in
tempo. Drummers and drum programmers would learn immeasurably
by just trying to replicate what is on that lp alone. As an
exercise, try listening to ONLY Peart on that LP.
