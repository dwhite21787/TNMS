Greetings Rush fans!

I was perusing the back issues of TNMS and someone had posted "I was 
listening to ... 'Territories' drum part ... Neil's beating out 16th's on a 
(hi-hat? na, too bright for that...?) AND a rhythm on (roto?) toms...is 
that possible?"

Is that possible?

Any responses? I'm not a drummer either.

Good day, Rush fans and other assorted hosers.

I'm a proud re-subscriber to the NMS mailing list.  I was an avid reader in 
college (three-plus years ago), but discontinued after my roommate 
complained that the NMS took up too much space on his hard drive.  I found 
out later he was full of it, and just wanted me out of his room.  Jerk.

Back then I was a silent observer.  I really enjoyed the dialogue, and the 
depth of knowledge people brought to the party ("NO, Alex NEVER used 
D'Addario strings in the June of 1979!!!"), was, dare I say, awe-inspiring. 
 But since I've rekindled my subscription, I figured I'd throw in my two 
cents of Rush philosophy. And I'll do my best not to wax poetic for too 
long.

For me, Rush has always been my greatest comfort.  No matter what changes 
in my life, where I live or travel to, or how I occupy my time, their music 
remains a constant . . . like the Pyramids or something.  No matter what 
bands fall in and out of my CD player in any one month, I always find 
myself returning to the boys in the end (usually feeling guilty when I go 
to my collection).  They are who I turn to when I'm wired, tired, fired up, 
or feeling down.  And always, the music - and the impact they leave - is a 
pure rush (no pun intended?).

And it seems like it's always been like that.  Their music has always "been 
there" for me, which, as most of you can attest to as well, is why I feel 
compelled to "be there" for them . . . despite their perpetual absence from 
any critic's top 10 trillion bands of all time.  Other bands make an impact 
on my day.  Rush affects my Life.  And I know you all understand exactly 
what I'm talking about.  Rush fans share the punchline to this grand, 
celestial joke that nobody else gets, and that's what's so sweet about it 
all.

Anyhow, enough sermon, I'll climb off the mountain now.  But, I'd like to 
toss this cookie out there: If the comfort of Rush keeps me together, it's 
my ineffable, Rush-associated experiences that bookmark some of my greatest 
memories.  What I'd really like to hear about are some of your most SUBLIME 
Rush-connected memories.  Not just the ordinary "Dude, the Presto concert 
was truly righteous," but the truly extraordinary, snapshot-in-time, 
out-of-body experiences that permanently cling to your memory banks.  I 
know I have mine, but that's for another posting . . .

Anyhow, thanks for letting me share.  I feel this venting has done wonders 
for my inner child.

Later.

Well, about a year ago I put a thread up about what would happen if one of the 
band members were to pass out or become incapable of completing the show, and 
they pointed to YOU to come up and finish the set, which songs would you prefer 
to play, and which instrument would it be?

I kept on putting results together, and I kept getting more and more results.  
So here, NOW, are the *final* results:
They are listed by instrument, with the number one song meaning the most people 
picked that song on that instrument.

For the Drummers:

10) Natural Science
9)  Double Agent
8)  The Big Money
7)  The Spirit of Radio
6)  Stick It Out (Most pointed out the kewl backbeat fill in the middle)
5)  Driven (This post was pre-TFE...good showing for only having half the time) 
4)  Red Barchetta
3)  Tom Sawyer
2)  Freewill
1)  2112  (duh)  
Special mention goes to "The Rhythm Method" although I find it hard to envision 
the following:
Geddy Lee:  "Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr....Um....What's your name?"  "Oh yeah, on 
the drum kit"

Guitarists:

10) Driven
9)  Stick it out
8)  Cold Fire 
7)  Limelight
6)  Fly By Night
5)  Tom Sawyer
4)  YYZ
3)  La Villa Strangiato
2)  Red Barchetta
1)  2112

Bassists/Keyboardists

10) Where's My Thing
9)  YYZ
8)  La Villa Strangiato
7)  Freewill
6)  Force 10
5)  Driven
4)  Territories
3)  Show Don't Tell
2)  Distant Early Warning
1)  2112

That's it...is you would like to add to the list....I will keep compiling!!!

The picture as described is from the Moving Pictures tour (Early/mid

Not to really play into that 4-CD April Fools Day joke or anything, but seem 
to recall Alex employing "The Omega Concern" during the Presto tour to 
play the tune "Presto".  I saw them live twice that year (once in Providence, 
RI and once in Worcester, MA) and seem to recall it being played live.  Any 
Nor'easters out there that can verify this?
 
I too was slightly disappointed at VH-1's top 100 artists.  Although I was 
happily surprised to see some artists acknowledged for their sometimes 
unnoticed work (Parliament, Sly and the Family Stone), I was very 
disappointed (yet not surprised) to find great, influential bands like Rush 
and Husker Du among the missing.  Guess that's what's happen when you poll 
600 Sheryl Crow/Shawn Colvin types.  Now, I'd list to see that list of 600
artists polled...

Hey!

Did I miss issue 2007? I save every issue before I remove
it from my trash bin... odd. I only received one issue last
week (2006, Wed Apr. 8th) and then one today (2008,
Mon. Apr. 13th). Maybe 2007 will hit the newsstands
tomorrow... : ^ )

Oh I get it. It's like the fear trilogy - backwards. Cool!

So the first thing I tried to do was look it up in back issue
at the NMS site. I was skeptical. I remember trying to
get back issues before only to find there's been nothing
archived since around late 1800 issue (any news on this?).

   [ I've stopped uploading them to syrinx because I have to move the whole
     site off in a few short months...                        : rush-mgr ]

Speaking of backwards, when I first was discovering the
band (around '81) someone "explained" to me that there
were three "stories" done by Rush: 2112 (first side),
AFTK (Cygnus X-1), and Hemispheres (first side). This
person continued to "inform" me that the story was told
in reverse order. The first tale was from ages ago to
parallel Greek Mythology. The second told about how
the main character hopped in a rocket ship and traveled
thru time to arrive in 2112. Wow! Pretty cool huh? Well
I know this is not how Neil intended the story to go, but
it does make for an interesting paradigm shift now doesn't
it?! : ^ )

Anyhoo, if somebody still has issue 2007 (provided there
was one) would you be so kind as to forward it to me?

   [ Hm, I'm beginning to think that gremlins got into the computer system,
     it may never have gone out. If you're missing it, please use the mail
     server "rush-srv@yyz.com" to request it.                   : rush-mgr ]

I, too, watched the show on VH1.  I was EXTREMELY dissappointed at the
fact that Rush was not part of it.  I can't name 15 more inflential
artists, let alone 100.  It just furthers the observation that Rush is
constantly getting screwed by the media.  If anyone's interested, I say
we go down to VH1's main office and spray paint red stars all over the
outside.

This has been bugging me for about three years now, and I hope somebody can
help.  There is a Rush alblum that starts with what I believe is a shuttle
lauch, and toward the end of the alblum is as song that I really love, but
don't know the name of. It makes reference to I believe;
A dancer who can no longer dance,
a writer who can no longer write.

This may sound stupid but I have listened to Rush for the last 18 years, and
they are the only band I don't know half the song titles to but I would bet
I know every lyric.

    [ The album is "Signals", the song you're looking for is "Losing It".
      The 'shuttle-launch-song' is "Countdown"                 : rush-mgr ]

RE sexy Rush Tunes:  There are sexy rush tunes?? 

Well, no, not really.  But there are two that come close: Bravado (live if
you can get it) and Here Again (off the first album, for those who never
listen to that album).

But take it from someone who's tried:  Rush is not the sexiest music out
there.  Trust me, as good as Rush is (and we all know they are divine)
there is a lot of music out there better suited to the task of romance
than Rush.  Some music is just better for some occasions, and there is
music better than Rush (before you flame, wait for the qualifier) for
romance.  I just want to put that forth before some poor schmo on this
list tries to "get it on" to Tom Sawyer, with disastrous results.

The above does not apply if both you and your loved one are Rush freaks.
If such is the case, then a) by all means get it on to Rush and b) count
your freakin blessings, 'cause you are one lucky bastard.

I'm not one to listen to classic rock radio, but today there
was a thunderstorm and I was stuck in 5:00 O'Clock traffic, so I 
broke down and listened to KSHE here in St. Louis. They played
"Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. I hadn't heard the song in 15
years or so, but when I listened to the intro, I thought, "Hey, that
sounds a lot like bits of 'The Fountain of Lamneth'." Now I know
that the song "In the Mood" sounds suspiciously like "Gimme Three
Steps," but I never much thought the Skynyrd influence on Rush was
very significant. Was Alex Lifeson really into Skynyrd around 73-5, 
or was I just delirious from the weather, traffic, and commercial 
radio?

Hi Rush fans:
                     It's a long time since i don't post to the NMS but 
i had to tell you this. Yesterday, that's Sunday, i was very bored and i 
didn't know what to do so i picked my dad's radio, which it's very old 
but still in good shape, and i started to hear foreign radios, i think 
it's in LW frecuency but i don't remember, when i had heard some deutch 
and france stations i picked a Japanese radio or was it Chinese, well i 
don't remember, there was a guy saying some really complicated things 
that i don't understand and i began to laugh and lough because it was 
very funny. When i was crying because of laughing my ears heard this 
Incredible thing, The beggining of YYZ!!!!!!, i couldn't believe it, it 
was Amazing!!!!! And that wasn't all, after YYZ they played Tom Sawyer 
and Driven!!!! Can u believe it? well telling u this makes me fell 
surprised again :), then when Driven was over the Strange things sayed 
by this guy make me laughed again but i'm sure i heared the word Rush 2 
times after that, maybe it was a special hour and the turn was for Rush, 
who knows. Then my Boring was killed.

That's all what i had to say, see u around
Viva Rush!!!

Hi all ..

It's nice to see the list back up again.  But I bet it was even nicer 
for rush-mgr to get the hell away from this infernal thing for a week. :)

Peter Kinnecom made some comments about Rush's music that for the most 
part were spot-on with what I think.  Yep, Rush is three guys who love to 
play, and do it really well.  They love to make great music too.  But I'd 
be hard pressed to call each and every note of theirs "classic".  Talk to 
Geddy, and he will tell you that he can't even listen to their older 
stuff.  Rush is undoubtedly one of the most talented bands of all time, 
but they're not PERFECT.  And I think telling drummers who get into Rush 
just because of Neil's virtuostic playing to "[expletive deleted] off" is 
a bit harsh.  Everybody likes Rush for different reasons.  Some use it as 
a soundtrack to get high to, some like to absorb the whole being greater 
than the sum of the parts, some like to hear Geddy screech ("What You're 
Doing" from ATWAS, anyone?!), some just like to rock out!  At least 
they're listening! :)  But yeah, Rush is a damn fine band made up of 
three damn fine musicians who make some damn fine songs.

Hemispheres ... WOW!  I'm listening for the first time in a while .. I've
been on a Marillion-and-other-assorted-prog-rock binge right now.  I found
myself tapping my foot to "Circumstances" without even thinking about it.  I
was typing something-or-other and it was totally instinctual.  Now that's not
the easiest song to tap your foot to (all those weird time changes).  Hey, I
thought it was neat. :)

Joseph Ornelas asked some questions on some of the weird vocals.  On "Fly By
Night", Geddy's voice has that weird effect on it for most of the song.  I
think it's some kind of flanger or chorus effect.  It's not a defect. :) On
"Spirit Of Radio", Geddy does indeed toughen up the "yeah, your honesty"
part.  Why?  I think it has to do with the theme of the song (commercial
radio).  Geddy's toughening up his voice, kinda mocking the tough-guys of
rock radio.  As if to say "now that it all boils down to the music, let's be
honest, who's tough now?  Who's the real deal?"  Not so coldly charted, it's
really just a matter of your honesty .. Yeah, YOUR honesty.  So why the weird
effect in "Fly By Night"?  I dunno.  That one still escapes me.  I think it
sounds neat.  They probably thought something similar along those lines ("Hey
Broon, how about we put a silly effect on the vocals?" "Okay.") ... I 
don't think they were thinking about it too hard back then. :)

I just heard from a source VERY close to the band.  The live album is going
to be called "Closer To The Heart".  It's going to be a 2-CD set.  It's going
to have 15 different versions on each disc of the title track recorded from
different concert dates around the US and Canada during the Counterparts and
Test For Echo tours.  There will also be a bonus disc included which will
have different versions of the title track, one pulled from each date on the
quickie 1979 tour after the Hemispheres tour but before the Permanent Waves
tour.  All screw-ups have been fixed by overdubs done in the studio.

Am I the only one who likes most of Roll The Bones EXCEPT the "big" 
tracks like "Dreamline" and "Bravado" and the embarassing title track?  
Yep, "Ghost Of A Chance" is a great tune. :)  Rush doesn't do love songs 
often, but when they do, they do them well.  Well .. except "Need Some 
Love" and all the crap from the first album. :)

Yikes.  This is gettin long.  Sorry everybody.  I'll try to keep it 
shorter next time, I promise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dear fellow Rushians,

Hey, hey! AFter reading Joseph Ornelas' post on issue 2009, I felt that
I needed to ask a question about Ged's voice live.  I recently got a
boot,"Run from the Fans".  I have only given it one listen, but it seems
like Ged is really struggling and concentrating on trying to get the
right notes out and just to keep on singing.  AT times, it seems like he
has almost no strength left in his vocal chords to keep going.  I guess
I can understand why all the "official" live releases of Rush were
reworked in the studio--to give Ged a better sounding!  Now, I may well
be completely wrong.  I gathered that only from one live recording. I
have never ever been able to see Rush for whatever reason.  For the many
of you that have, did you ever make similar observations or am I
completely off bass (ha!)?  Thanks.

Speking of bass, I don't know what bass Ged was using on their first
album (my guess is a Ric), but I agree that the bass solo in "Working
Man" doesn't quite have the kick I'm used to in such solos like "Cygnus
X-I: Book I", "Driven" or "La Villa Strangiato".  If it did have more of
a bombastic entrance or, better yet, if the bass was more bombastic
throughout the first album, I believe it would have balanced out well
with Alex's sustaining heavy guitar.  Just a few thoughts!

Take care

Palo

Ok, since nothing seems to be going on with the Fella's for now.

Here's some new music to check out (especially if you are into Crimson, Yes,
Genesis etc...)  It won't all be easy to find, but finding *new* music like
this is worth the effort.

Bands I highly reccomend:  'Spock's Beard', 'Porcupine Tree' (they are on the
WWW),  & 'Discipline'

Bands I've learned of and come to love (or at least enjoy) through the NMS in
the past - King's X (including the new Ty Tabor cd!), Barenaked Ladies, Our
Lady Peace, Rheostatics.

Try the above bands, you might not like them all, but I bet you'll find
several to add to your collection.

   [ Another one that might be of interest, a new band called Fuel. Their
     new album just came out last month, and they're doing the "small bar"
     touring circuit (will be in San Diego next week :-)       : rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="2010017">Subject: Live album titles / complete instrumental album</A>

I've seen them all going around, and I'd like to toss some of my own
in.
In no particular order:
#5 - One Hell of a Band (as in the 2112 tourbook)
#4 - There's My Thing (yes, I stole this from another poster, but I
liked it)
#3 - Gangster of Boats -- If Neil can't think of a title, then G&A
will pick this one.
#2 - Backstage (following the concert idea, the band is behind
curtains after accepting their applause, or)
#1 - Encore -- They come back out for even more music, because lets
face it, our boys love to play.  

I really do think it will be encore; that almost always follows the
applause at a Rush show.  Of course, if Rush does a complete
instrumental album as some of you have recommended (and I too would
kill to have one), they have to complete the Gangster of Boats
Trilogy, all of the songs. 
They are, in order:  

Things
Where's My Thing 
Leave That Thing Alone 
That's Not Your Thing
Get Your Own Thing
Found My Thing
A Farewell to Things

Geddy and Alex said that the two things in _Wheres my thing_ and
_Leave that thing alone_ weren't related.  Obviously, Geddy is looking
for his thing, and Alex tells him to leave his thing alone and find
his own (don't read too much into this, you perverts).  Dueling
guitars and bass through the whole album, while Neil's drums narrate.

Though baseball season in the US is underway, I thought I'd mention this. 
I was thumbing through my friend's copy of "Visions" (you know, the Rush
biography by Bill Banasiewicz), and I read that somewhere in the 1980s
(probably right before GUP was released) Rush made a pilgrimage of sorts
to see Spring Training in Florida. 
	I remember reading in a post in the NMS from a few weeks ago that
someone in Florida spotted one of Rush's trucks down there.  Do you think
that Anthem was sending stuff down for the team(s)?  It might be freaky if
Rush had a secret gig for the ballplayers, but I'm only guessing (in other
words, it's NOT a confirmed fact). All I know is that there has to be a
connection between Rush and the Spring Training season.

While I won't argue with you that Rush does not get the acclaim they
deserve, and that it's shame that they didn't do better in that pole, they
do get some of their share in other situations. I haven't been Stateside in
the last few years to hear the annual Memorial Day Weekend 500 countdown by
95.5 KLOS in LA, but when I listened to it in my uni days, they had quite a
few Rush tunes on the list. They will never get enough acclaim, but that
just makes it more special for those of us who do appreciate them, like you

  Hey NMSers!  My first time on the board!  Great to be here!   Huge Rush
fanatic since '85.  Berklee grad- pro musician, blah, blah... My theory
regarding Double Agent performed live, is that, it would be extremely
difficult for Geddy to be rhythmically precise with the spoken word vocals,
for many reasons.   The spoken vocals, on listening, DO fall into regular
quasi-rhythmic patterns that could be reproduced live.   However, there are
several live performance factors that would make this unnecessarily difficult
to pull off.   The abundance of samples that are triggered during the live
performance of the song, along with the actual live vocal parts and various
musical events that have to hit precisely when they come around make the
spoken word verses that much more important to pull off with absolute
precision.  Plus, add on the fact that Geddy needs to nail down his
rythmically precise bass part while speaking these rhythmically vague lines. 
   It could, in theory, be done.  However, it would not be worth the
tremendous amount of effort required to nail both vocal and bass parts
together while weaving within the structure of the song.  Imagine yourself
playing at one tempo while singing or speaking in another while musical
counterpoint flashes by. Nearly impossible to do.  Try it sometime!!  It is
not fun....  Geddy and the boys realized this and chose the best solution (as
usual!).  And, of course, they performed it perfectly each time I saw them
play it live (5x on CP tour).  Just my ideas anyways!

Tell me about it. If they can perform material from PW and HYF, why can't they
perform Presto? 
Do they not like that album?
I think that they should change the song line up.
Close with Presto and put Tom Sawyer in the encore.

>Many of you have stated that HYF has the most keyboard usage of any Rush 
album.  To my ears, P/G has the most usage by far.   Afterimage, Red Sector A, 
The Enemy Within and The Body Electric seem dominated by keyboards (and I 
love them), whereas most of HYF uses keys as accents.  Am I the only one
that thinks this?<  

Nope,
You are not the only one who thinks this... And you are not the only one
who knows this.... You are correct.. I think there is a big difference in
the way their used and there is a difference (as was planned) with their
role playing in that they were used more as a feature on G.P. then they
became what I feel are the perfect finishing touches on many albums slowly
fading out as their cycle turned back to their bread and butter.

Along with G.P. which suprisingly wasn't mentioned for dominant boards was
the release that opened up the doors to the keys, and that was Signals.
Subdivisions (real thick as well as a solo), Chemistry (main chorus-eye to
eye), Digital Man (small parts in the middle by date with a fate but might
be the peddles), Losing it (heavy), Countdown (heavy)

I still think this is by far the best release with the use of the keys...
They were not tweeked to sound like techno syths., they were used as true
keyboards and actually played. They did an incredible job with Countdown
and Subdivisions with the melody as well as the solos in each...

Don't get me wrong, I love it all! I just feel that Signals is their only
true keyboard album... As time went on their roles were reduced and now
they are used primarily for texture ect. ect...   I would like to see them
stay headed in the direction of TFE, but it would be nice to throw in some
keyboards if they would use them as they did on the above mentioned
songs...

Wasn't the Gettysburg address after the US civil war, ie more like
"five score years ago" (in 1975) ?  I always presumed that the "ten

Hey Rob, I didn't originally post this keyboards thing - Hanstones did.
I replied to him later....

Anyway, I'd like to comment or re-iterate something I mentioned earlier.

Rush has used the keyboards well, (and in various ways - to various degrees) and
they COULD continue to do so here after T4E.  However, it would be great if 
they could further minimize the technologies/keyboards for a while and really 
get into complimenting the spirit of Neil's more emotional/philosophy-driven 
lyrics.  The kind of sound that'd be nice would more "acoustic" sounds, etc.  
I think this direction would be new and unique for Rush.  Now, they
did use some acoustic elements way early on but these elements were always 
quickly hushed by "huge" keyboards, bass, drum, and guitar.  The acoustic/
less-keyboard element has not been fully realized for Rush.

More on your subject....Signals, I think, is definitely the "keyboard
heaviest" album by Rush - the other instruments (including the drums even) 
made way for the sonic space of the keyboards.  Needless to say, Signals is 
not my favorite Rush album (although "Subdivisions" is spectacular),
but it is the BEST of the keyboard albums (SIG,GUP,PW,HYF).  Earlier on,
I think Geddy and the guys were smart by not over-using the Moog synth stuff 
on the late 70's material (AFTK/HEM).  So many progressive bands get 
criticized for over-doing that sound.  Rush used those sounds tastely along 
side nice Lifeson chords and Peart drums and Ged  bass - very tasteful.  That 
was the trial run for Geddy's later (heavier) keyboard experiments.  It's hard 
to believe, but nowadays those keyboard sounds are HARD to find in much 
popular music but thieved sample usage is rampant.....Rush needs to continue 
PLAYING but maybe with even more "traditional" musical instruments.  Imagine 
if Rush had an acoustic set!!!

Hey gang...
I know I'm gonna catch hell for this, but "To thine own self be true.."
I've gotta say that with all this talk about Alex's solo album (which I
still haven't listened too again, but I will, I will), I've got to comment
on his turn toward the dark and grungesque sound he's playing with now. For
better or worse, I'm really more fond of his sound on albums such as HYF,
PW, Presto and RTB. It was cleaner, more elloquent, it had a certain
something that let me just listen and get taken away by it. Now, at the same
time, I know everybody got to "deviate from the norm" and change is
inevitable, but his latest sound just kind of rubs me the wrong way. Don't
get me wrong, I love CP and T4E, but more as a whole. On the older albums I
listened for the individual sounds. I listen to Mystic Rythems several times
over just to pick out the different sounds. I don't have to do that on the
latest efforts. I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense, but it's just
the way I feel..
