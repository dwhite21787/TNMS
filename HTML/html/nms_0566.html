Hello all,

  I just got off the phone with my brother who currently lives in Japan.
I think he rather enjoyed rubbing my nose in the fact that he'll be seeing
RUSH in less than a month, while I'll have to wait years till the next tour.

  That's right, apparently they'll be playing Tokyo December 4 and 5.  They'll
also go to Osaka, but I don't know how extensive the tour will be other than
that.  I guess that explains why they decided to hold off until the after
the new year going back to the studios.

  Is there anyone on this list in Japan?  Why have we not heard about this
before (or have I just missed it)?  Gee, I wish a had a few thousand dollars
laying around for a quick trip to the far east (Aboard the Thailand express?).

  I believe this information is accurate, and I thought there might be some
people interested in the where-abouts of the band.

Rushppl --

Dan Meyer wrote in the last NMS about a Disney movie w/ a ship going into a
black hole, named 'Cygnus.'  If ya think about it though, this really shouldn't
be all that surprising....  Cygnus _is_ an actual constellation (in fact,
between the constellations Lyra and Pegasus), not to mention that it's just a
pretty cool word, eh :)  I think the 'X-1' is just kind of tacked on there by
Mr. Peart however....  Now, if they had named the ship the 'Rocinante' I'd
have been a bit more surprised, eh....

Thanx to those who confirmed my 'hidden face' sightings in HEM and ATWAS...
nice to know I'm not _totally_ nuts!  Also.. I like that 'One likes to believe
in the freedom of E-Mail' quote!...

Hi there.

	Just a quick couple of points...regardless of whether we
decide to do the rarities thing on tape or CD...we've got to get
organized on a few things:

	1) Are we going to get permission from the band?  In my
opinion, this will be necessary if we do anything that'll be
"pressed"...like a cd.  We can probably get away with a tape...it'll
be kinda unofficial.

	2) We've got to decide what songs go on it...this could be
done with a poll (at LAST!...a poll with a PRACTICAL application!).
My vote goes for any non-Rush album appearances by any of the band
members, any songs not on Rush albums (Fancy Dancer,Bad Boy,etc.),
and any old, rarely played live songs (The Necromancer, Twilight
Zone,etc).  Please...NO INTERVIEWS...

	3) We have to be CAREFUL that we make sure to get the BEST
POSSIBLE quality available for each tune!  This might mean some of
the more anal, tightfisted boot collectors out there will have to
donate some material (come on guys...it's only really neat to have
the stuff if you get to share it with others and see them get excited
about it too...).

	Just my opinion...

In responce to Randall Haskin saying RUSH did not play Spirit of Radio in
its entirity during this tour I beg to differ.  I say them at Jones Beach
on 6/20/92 and they played the whole song during the encore. They then
dazzled us with a medley before concluding with a reprise of the
instrumental at the end of SOR before Geddy's famous concluding
statement...

<A NAME="566005">Subject: Favorite Album Cover / 2nd favorite group(s)</A>

Interesting threads, really, though they border on trivia. (I, however,
like trivia.)

My favorite album cover would have to be Permanent Waves.  For some reason,
I find the apocalyptic cover very alluring, as well as the women on the
cover!  Sort of makes you think, too.  I also like Moving Pictures, only
because it has my favorite work of *art*, the dogs playing cards picture,
on it. :^)  The later album covers are neat, but a bit too playful for me.

My 2nd favorite group varies.  I would probably have to say it is Kansas
(with the original lineup).  I also like early Queen a lot, too.  I was
into both of these groups before I was really introduced to Rush, and the
funny thing was that I wanted to get into Rush, because the aforementioned
two groups were changing their sound a lot at the time.  I have recently
been listening to older Yes again, and though I like some of their songs a
lot, I get a bit turned off by their really experimental stuff.  Still, to
be groundbreakers in a new music category (Progressive Rock), you have to
try a lot out.

Hello fellow Rushians...

I rented  the Grace Under Pressure video this weekend, and it was totally
kickin'.  I had no idea that Neil's set was so big, and I was just as
amazed to see him use ALL of it.  Anyways...

I also wonder what Geddy's fascination with beer is.  I have not been
fortunate enough to see the band in concert, but it seemed that in Tom
Sawyer, he said something about beer in the lyrics (Sorry, I don't
remember  exactly where).  Is Geddy known for his improvisational lyrics?
Just a silly question from someone who has only followed the band for
about two years...

Musical Massacre?

Hmm...I've been thinking about the Rush shirt a little bit
more, and I have an idea.  Does anyone out there have a really
good concert photo showing the gang?  Now if that photo
existed and it was clear enough (which I have seen for sale
everywhere down here), then that would be great on the front
of the shirt.

Then on the back, duplicate the aquatic fiery star with the
quote above it:

                         RUSH

                "You can't understand
                    what it means"

Too wierd?  On the note of Randy talking about his German RtB
single with two live tracks.  They sell that out here at a
speciality store, except that it's from Japan and has those
two live tracks on it as well.  I haven't heard the disk, so I
couldn't tell you.  If you're concerned about the SoR live
single, perhaps it's from the P/G tour or something like that!

Just a quick comment on this thread...this is NOT a personal flame. With
the absence of the NMS over the summer, I resorted to reading alt.music.rush,
which I haven't for various reasons glimpsed at since the day NMS was back up.
This thread got SO out of hand on there. It started out as "my second
favorite" and soon there were 10-20 posts a day with people listing 30-40
bands. It got to the point where people were trying to impress people with
their "vast musical taste." I hope that doesn't happen on NMS.

>He ended up getting row 20.  We told him that he'd get stuck next to some
>fat hairy slimy guy, but he sat next to some hot chick who bought him beer

I was at this show also. We already had tickets for row XX. We decided to
try and get better ones, so we walked up to the ticket office at the venue
and asked for the best group of three seats there were. We got 16th row!!!
This is a VERY good way to get good seats. For various reasons, lots of good
seats are always released on the day of the show. Hell, we even waited an
hour before going up to the window cuz we figured all the good ones were gone!
It also turned out that the requestor of the 3rd ticket ended up buying
scalped tix...so I can just imagine what we might have gotten if we had tried
to buy just 2 right when they opened the ticket window!

This is NOT true. Yes, I have posted a few times concerning DT, but I also
made sure there was some Rush content in my posts. DT is a band whose style
is very much influenced by Rush's brand of progressive rock, and since there
is perhaps maybe one post every other issue that contains DT material, I
think people are over-reacting about it. I mean, how many posts did
I have to skip over to avoid hearing people argue over whether Neil was gay
or not??

As for the idea of a DT mailing list, count me in! :)

And one final comment :)

I think the "thumb in the clouds" thing is crazy. It's not a flame, but you
guys are nuts! :) Come on....not every photo/artwork on a Rush album has some
hidden meaning. It seems like some people think that Neil sits around trying
to come up with all these hidden messages to stump the fans. Does anyone agree
with me that this is too farfetched to believe?? :-)

Sorry sound so negtive this post....(one of those days =I).....

Jello

Eine frage -- I recently bought 3 45" singles of Rush:

	A-side: Subdivisions	      B-side: Countdown
	A-side: The Body Electric     B-side: Between the Wheels
	A-side: Finding My Way        B-side: Finding My Way

My question is, does anyone know what these are worth?  The "Time
Stand Still" 45" single is still around.  But does anyone know about
the above 3?  There must not be that many around, but...???

Which brings me to an idea I had concerning these and the latest talk
on getting a rare tape/CD made (cool idea, BTW!).

Could we somehow get made a list of rare/not-so-rare Rush collectibles/
merchandise and how much each item is worth?  Not necessarily boots
(tho that might be included), but stuff like "original pressings" or
specific posters, etc.  Maybe we could enlist the services of
Andrew McNaughton (maybe even Geddy??) to help catalog the stuff that's
out there, and get the help of an expert who KNOWS the market and can
give people an idea of what's worth what.  Does anything like this
exist for purely Rush stuff?  It doesn't even have to be for the NMS
*only* -- I dunno.  It's just something I started thinking about since
I bought those 3 singles (not that I'm expecting them to be worth much).
Anyone know if this is even remotely possible?  It'd be kinda neat to
have a list like that to compare with.  Maybe it could even have a
comparative price on collectibles that might be autographed.  I dunno-
like i said, I just thought about it some time ago and I thought I'd
rub it across all of you to see what you think about it.

that's a wrap!  Ho-hoo!

Thomas Beaudoin asked about the other covers of this cd ....

Well I'm afraid to dissapoint him but as far as I'm aware this is the only one 
of these.  It is the same interview as appeared on the 12" interview picture 
disc over here a few years ago ( the break on the cd is where the record needs 
turning over ) and it's only Alex, nobody else.  I felt a bit ripped off when 
I bought it, even if it is a good interview.

This is my very first post to this illustrious newsletter, so bear with me!
Greetings, y'all.

About myself... (as if any of you care)
	I have not been a Rush fan for a very long time at all.  As a matter 
of fact, I was enlightened to their existence only just after _Presto_ was 
released.  However, Rush has by now made it to the top of my rock band 
favorites list, even though, being Christian, I do not agree with 63% of the 
philosophy purported by the band (well, at least by Neil).  Still, I delight 
in the meaningfulness of the lyrics--especially when contrasted with lyrics so 
common on the rock music scene these days--and in the sheer power of their  
ever-changing musical style.
	Anyway, enough about me...

About the CD...
	I strongly suggest that we do not waste valuable CD time with 
interviews.  The CD is meant to contain music, not conversation.  Maybe some 
extremely short and snappy quips would be OK, if something has to be on there, 
but nothing more than, say, ten seconds at a time.
	Please?
	Rare studio stuff sounds like a good idea, as well as rare live stuff, 
but we should be careful of the sound quality of stuff we put on there.

About Xanadu...
	Even though I usually skip over these discussions, I agree with 
whomever that this stuff should not be removed from the digest.  It seems to 
me that this type of discussion is an integral part of the newsletter.

About Permanent Waves over Flatlines...
	Agreed.
	The version of elm that I have used does not separate each post into 
individual mail messages.  Hmmmm...

  [ Sorry, I meant EMACS uses those lines to separate. 		: rush-mgr ]

About good seats...
	I know nothing. When I saw them at the Palace of Auburn Hills I got 
almost the worst nose-bleed seats possible, only to find out that after they 
sold out the show I saw, they scheduled another show for the following day in 
the same place.  Sounded great, though!

About "I Think I'm Goin Bald"
	Huh?

So, there you go.  Happy hunting!

<A NAME="566014">Subject: ramblings</A>

Hi, hers a few things I wanted to ramble on about:
 This first thing is not to belabor the old/new RUSH thing, but last 
night, I came alot closer to understanding RUSH's development as songwriters,
so here's what I came up with:  Initially, RUSH would have a 1 or 2 musical
ideas, and they would spend 20-30 minutes "exploring" these ideas, giving us
those long early songs.  Gradually, they got better and no longer required
20 minutes to explore as idea, so the songs got shorter, giving us songs
like SOR and Tom Sawyer.  Then, RUSH got even better and started including
several (i.e. 3 or more) ideas in one short songs.  This is the mid 80's,
which saw the development of this from Signals, culminating with HYF, which
Geddy himself called an arrival record.  No surprise then that RUSH found
themselves wondering about the future.  They then found that the songs were
getting to difficult, not only was Geddy having to do too much, but its really
hard to memorize those complex arrangements (I've tried, even though I listen
to RUSH constantly, whenever I try to play one from memeory, I forget it).  So
they got basic with Presto, expressing only one idea per song.  They have
almost come full circle, and that makes me wonder what the future has in store
 for their music.  I can hardly wait til the next album.
 SO that's that, just my humble opinion.
Discussion is encouraged, although I don't want to start more debate on the
old-new thing, which is a dead horse, this is just more of an observation
on all of RUSH's history.  ANy comments and additions to this are welcome.

#2 favorite band (tough call):  Metallica
runner-ups: LedZep, early Pink Floyd, Primus, Frank Zappa, Police

About Neil playing plywood on MP, I believe that's the whipcrack on YYZ.
thanks for listening to my rambles, 
Dan

Hello all,

  I just got off the phone with my brother who currently lives in Japan.
I think he rather enjoyed rubbing my nose in the fact that he'll be seeing
RUSH in less than a month, while I'll have to wait years till the next tour.

  That's right, apparently they'll be playing Tokyo December 4 and 5.  They'll
also go to Osaka, but I don't know how extensive the tour will be other than
that.  I guess that explains why they decided to hold off until the after
the new year going back to the studios.

  Is there anyone on this list in Japan?  Why have we not heard about this
before (or have I just missed it)?  Gee, I wish a had a few thousand dollars
laying around for a quick trip to the far east (Aboard the Thailand express?).

  I believe this information is accurate, and I thought there might be some
people interested in the where-abouts of the band.

Rushppl --

Dan Meyer wrote in the last NMS about a Disney movie w/ a ship going into a
black hole, named 'Cygnus.'  If ya think about it though, this really shouldn't
be all that surprising....  Cygnus _is_ an actual constellation (in fact,
between the constellations Lyra and Pegasus), not to mention that it's just a
pretty cool word, eh :)  I think the 'X-1' is just kind of tacked on there by
Mr. Peart however....  Now, if they had named the ship the 'Rocinante' I'd
have been a bit more surprised, eh....

Thanx to those who confirmed my 'hidden face' sightings in HEM and ATWAS...
nice to know I'm not _totally_ nuts!  Also.. I like that 'One likes to believe
in the freedom of E-Mail' quote!...

Hi there.

	Just a quick couple of points...regardless of whether we
decide to do the rarities thing on tape or CD...we've got to get
organized on a few things:

	1) Are we going to get permission from the band?  In my
opinion, this will be necessary if we do anything that'll be
"pressed"...like a cd.  We can probably get away with a tape...it'll
be kinda unofficial.

	2) We've got to decide what songs go on it...this could be
done with a poll (at LAST!...a poll with a PRACTICAL application!).
My vote goes for any non-Rush album appearances by any of the band
members, any songs not on Rush albums (Fancy Dancer,Bad Boy,etc.),
and any old, rarely played live songs (The Necromancer, Twilight
Zone,etc).  Please...NO INTERVIEWS...

	3) We have to be CAREFUL that we make sure to get the BEST
POSSIBLE quality available for each tune!  This might mean some of
the more anal, tightfisted boot collectors out there will have to
donate some material (come on guys...it's only really neat to have
the stuff if you get to share it with others and see them get excited
about it too...).

	Just my opinion...

In responce to Randall Haskin saying RUSH did not play Spirit of Radio in
its entirity during this tour I beg to differ.  I say them at Jones Beach
on 6/20/92 and they played the whole song during the encore. They then
dazzled us with a medley before concluding with a reprise of the
instrumental at the end of SOR before Geddy's famous concluding
statement...

Interesting threads, really, though they border on trivia. (I, however,
like trivia.)

My favorite album cover would have to be Permanent Waves.  For some reason,
I find the apocalyptic cover very alluring, as well as the women on the
cover!  Sort of makes you think, too.  I also like Moving Pictures, only
because it has my favorite work of *art*, the dogs playing cards picture,
on it. :^)  The later album covers are neat, but a bit too playful for me.

My 2nd favorite group varies.  I would probably have to say it is Kansas
(with the original lineup).  I also like early Queen a lot, too.  I was
into both of these groups before I was really introduced to Rush, and the
funny thing was that I wanted to get into Rush, because the aforementioned
two groups were changing their sound a lot at the time.  I have recently
been listening to older Yes again, and though I like some of their songs a
lot, I get a bit turned off by their really experimental stuff.  Still, to
be groundbreakers in a new music category (Progressive Rock), you have to
try a lot out.

Hello fellow Rushians...

I rented  the Grace Under Pressure video this weekend, and it was totally
kickin'.  I had no idea that Neil's set was so big, and I was just as
amazed to see him use ALL of it.  Anyways...

I also wonder what Geddy's fascination with beer is.  I have not been
fortunate enough to see the band in concert, but it seemed that in Tom
Sawyer, he said something about beer in the lyrics (Sorry, I don't
remember  exactly where).  Is Geddy known for his improvisational lyrics?
Just a silly question from someone who has only followed the band for
about two years...

Musical Massacre?

Hmm...I've been thinking about the Rush shirt a little bit
more, and I have an idea.  Does anyone out there have a really
good concert photo showing the gang?  Now if that photo
existed and it was clear enough (which I have seen for sale
everywhere down here), then that would be great on the front
of the shirt.

Then on the back, duplicate the aquatic fiery star with the
quote above it:

                         RUSH

                "You can't understand
                    what it means"

Too wierd?  On the note of Randy talking about his German RtB
single with two live tracks.  They sell that out here at a
speciality store, except that it's from Japan and has those
two live tracks on it as well.  I haven't heard the disk, so I
couldn't tell you.  If you're concerned about the SoR live
single, perhaps it's from the P/G tour or something like that!

Just a quick comment on this thread...this is NOT a personal flame. With
the absence of the NMS over the summer, I resorted to reading alt.music.rush,
which I haven't for various reasons glimpsed at since the day NMS was back up.
This thread got SO out of hand on there. It started out as "my second
favorite" and soon there were 10-20 posts a day with people listing 30-40
bands. It got to the point where people were trying to impress people with
their "vast musical taste." I hope that doesn't happen on NMS.

>the day of the concert and bought one ticket cuz he wanted to go with us.
>He ended up getting row 20.  We told him that he'd get stuck next to some
>fat hairy slimy guy, but he sat next to some hot chick who bought him beer

I was at this show also. We already had tickets for row XX. We decided to
try and get better ones, so we walked up to the ticket office at the venue
and asked for the best group of three seats there were. We got 16th row!!!
This is a VERY good way to get good seats. For various reasons, lots of good
seats are always released on the day of the show. Hell, we even waited an
hour before going up to the window cuz we figured all the good ones were gone!
It also turned out that the requestor of the 3rd ticket ended up buying
scalped tix...so I can just imagine what we might have gotten if we had tried
to buy just 2 right when they opened the ticket window!

This is NOT true. Yes, I have posted a few times concerning DT, but I also
made sure there was some Rush content in my posts. DT is a band whose style
is very much influenced by Rush's brand of progressive rock, and since there
is perhaps maybe one post every other issue that contains DT material, I
think people are over-reacting about it. I mean, how many posts did
I have to skip over to avoid hearing people argue over whether Neil was gay
or not??

As for the idea of a DT mailing list, count me in! :)

And one final comment :)

I think the "thumb in the clouds" thing is crazy. It's not a flame, but you
guys are nuts! :) Come on....not every photo/artwork on a Rush album has some
hidden meaning. It seems like some people think that Neil sits around trying
to come up with all these hidden messages to stump the fans. Does anyone agree
with me that this is too farfetched to believe?? :-)

Sorry sound so negtive this post....(one of those days =I).....

Jello

Eine frage -- I recently bought 3 45" singles of Rush:

	A-side: Subdivisions	      B-side: Countdown
	A-side: The Body Electric     B-side: Between the Wheels
	A-side: Finding My Way        B-side: Finding My Way

My question is, does anyone know what these are worth?  The "Time
Stand Still" 45" single is still around.  But does anyone know about
the above 3?  There must not be that many around, but...???

Which brings me to an idea I had concerning these and the latest talk
on getting a rare tape/CD made (cool idea, BTW!).

Could we somehow get made a list of rare/not-so-rare Rush collectibles/
merchandise and how much each item is worth?  Not necessarily boots
(tho that might be included), but stuff like "original pressings" or
specific posters, etc.  Maybe we could enlist the services of
Andrew McNaughton (maybe even Geddy??) to help catalog the stuff that's
out there, and get the help of an expert who KNOWS the market and can
give people an idea of what's worth what.  Does anything like this
exist for purely Rush stuff?  It doesn't even have to be for the NMS
*only* -- I dunno.  It's just something I started thinking about since
I bought those 3 singles (not that I'm expecting them to be worth much).
Anyone know if this is even remotely possible?  It'd be kinda neat to
have a list like that to compare with.  Maybe it could even have a
comparative price on collectibles that might be autographed.  I dunno-
like i said, I just thought about it some time ago and I thought I'd
rub it across all of you to see what you think about it.

that's a wrap!  Ho-hoo!

Thomas Beaudoin asked about the other covers of this cd ....

Well I'm afraid to dissapoint him but as far as I'm aware this is the only one 
of these.  It is the same interview as appeared on the 12" interview picture 
disc over here a few years ago ( the break on the cd is where the record needs 
turning over ) and it's only Alex, nobody else.  I felt a bit ripped off when 
I bought it, even if it is a good interview.

This is my very first post to this illustrious newsletter, so bear with me!
Greetings, y'all.

About myself... (as if any of you care)
	I have not been a Rush fan for a very long time at all.  As a matter 
of fact, I was enlightened to their existence only just after _Presto_ was 
released.  However, Rush has by now made it to the top of my rock band 
favorites list, even though, being Christian, I do not agree with 63% of the 
philosophy purported by the band (well, at least by Neil).  Still, I delight 
in the meaningfulness of the lyrics--especially when contrasted with lyrics so 
common on the rock music scene these days--and in the sheer power of their  
ever-changing musical style.
	Anyway, enough about me...

About the CD...
	I strongly suggest that we do not waste valuable CD time with 
interviews.  The CD is meant to contain music, not conversation.  Maybe some 
extremely short and snappy quips would be OK, if something has to be on there, 
but nothing more than, say, ten seconds at a time.
	Please?
	Rare studio stuff sounds like a good idea, as well as rare live stuff, 
but we should be careful of the sound quality of stuff we put on there.

About Xanadu...
	Even though I usually skip over these discussions, I agree with 
whomever that this stuff should not be removed from the digest.  It seems to 
me that this type of discussion is an integral part of the newsletter.

About Permanent Waves over Flatlines...
	Agreed.
	The version of elm that I have used does not separate each post into 
individual mail messages.  Hmmmm...

  [ Sorry, I meant EMACS uses those lines to separate. 		: rush-mgr ]

About good seats...
	I know nothing. When I saw them at the Palace of Auburn Hills I got 
almost the worst nose-bleed seats possible, only to find out that after they 
sold out the show I saw, they scheduled another show for the following day in 
the same place.  Sounded great, though!

About "I Think I'm Goin Bald"
	Huh?

So, there you go.  Happy hunting!

<A NAME="566029">Subject: ramblings</A>

Hi, hers a few things I wanted to ramble on about:
 This first thing is not to belabor the old/new RUSH thing, but last 
night, I came alot closer to understanding RUSH's development as songwriters,
so here's what I came up with:  Initially, RUSH would have a 1 or 2 musical
ideas, and they would spend 20-30 minutes "exploring" these ideas, giving us
those long early songs.  Gradually, they got better and no longer required
20 minutes to explore as idea, so the songs got shorter, giving us songs
like SOR and Tom Sawyer.  Then, RUSH got even better and started including
several (i.e. 3 or more) ideas in one short songs.  This is the mid 80's,
which saw the development of this from Signals, culminating with HYF, which
Geddy himself called an arrival record.  No surprise then that RUSH found
themselves wondering about the future.  They then found that the songs were
getting to difficult, not only was Geddy having to do too much, but its really
hard to memorize those complex arrangements (I've tried, even though I listen
to RUSH constantly, whenever I try to play one from memeory, I forget it).  So
they got basic with Presto, expressing only one idea per song.  They have
almost come full circle, and that makes me wonder what the future has in store
 for their music.  I can hardly wait til the next album.
 SO that's that, just my humble opinion.
Discussion is encouraged, although I don't want to start more debate on the
old-new thing, which is a dead horse, this is just more of an observation
on all of RUSH's history.  ANy comments and additions to this are welcome.

#2 favorite band (tough call):  Metallica
runner-ups: LedZep, early Pink Floyd, Primus, Frank Zappa, Police

About Neil playing plywood on MP, I believe that's the whipcrack on YYZ.
thanks for listening to my rambles, 
Dan
