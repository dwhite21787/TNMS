Well, thanks to all of you who sent me mail offering help/information on
mail servers I could set up on Syrinx.  I think the "winner" has to be
Dave Datta (the keeper of the discography) who sent me a list of several
mail servers and ftp sites where I can get them.  Of course, mucho thanks
to all the others who offered help - your replies were greatly appreciated.

I'll be considering the alternatives in the weeks to come, and consider
installing something after the new hard disk goes in.

Also, the mail server at Ingr.com looks like it may not go away next week
as earlier indicated.  (See Keith's post below for details)  This means
that mail service for back issues, etc. should be uninterrupted.

I think I blew it when I said that Entre Nous was written by Geddy,
it should have been the other psuedo-love song, Different Strings.

One more thing is that Rolling the Bones could be allusion to
drug use.  Sometimes 'bones' are joints (ie, marijuana cigarettes)
So that rolling the bones could be rolling joints to get ready for
a party or something.  (I really doubt it, but who knows????)

        Ok, the '91 Modern Drummer Reader's Poll results are in.  I just
got the magazine a couple of days ago.  Unfortunately, the only place
that Neil shows up is in the Honor Roll section.  They don't let us
vote for him anymore (as well as certain other drummers) because he
has won best Rock Drummer and Multi-Percussionist too many times.  Neil is
eligible for the Recorded Performance award but alas, Presto won last year
and Rush has yet to come out with anything new.  Like I predicted,
Dave Weckl's Master Plan took top honors in that category, and IMO rightly
so.
        Also, the amount of unsubscribe posts to this digest seems to
be on the rise despite the attempts of rush-mgr and other NMS members
to get them sent to the administrative address (rush-request@syrinx.umd.edu).
Obviously, those attempting to unsubscribe aren't even reading the digest!

I believe that this is a real strange effect that you can get if you use
a delay unit of some sort.
Basically, if you turn up the number of repeats to infinite, you get
the signal feeding back on itself with all the added noise and stuff and
it amplifies itself in to the sound that you hear in " Oracle ".

Hope this helps.

Ever since I first heard the rumors of Rush disbanding (oh, about 4 albums
ago!) I've wondered which other band(s) could possibly take their place.
Since then I've found that Living Colour satisfies some of the same pleasure
receptors in my aural nerve network.  But now I keep hearing that this group
called Queensryche is kinda like Rush.  I'm curious enough now to take a
chance on one of their discs.  Can the Queensryche fans on the list send me
e-mail recommendations as to:

	        1) which QR disc is the most Rush-like
	    and 2) which QR disc is the 'best'  (if different from #1)

Always ready for good new tunes,

Good day, eh.

If memory serves me correctly, Neil talks about the boyz witnessing
the  launch of Columbia in the Signals tourbook (which I've noticed
is not at the syrinx ftp site). I believe I've still got that tourbook,
but it's packed away somewhere. (Ah, the life of a student; *sigh*.)
Anybody out there with a copy? And again, from fuzzy memory, on the
Signals tour shows I saw in Wichita, KS, and Kansas City, MO, I recall
the performance of Countdown featuring shuttle launch footage on the
projection screen, which was, quite simply, _awesome_. I've always felt
that the ability to hurl such a massive, complex piece of machinery into
orbit, safely (well, except for once :(, what a bummer of a day that was),
with humans aboard, and bring it down again, is some of the most moving
testament to the ingenuity of the human mind, and that song kinda gets to
me (as does Manhattan Project, in a darker sort of way). Brings to mind
the scene in "2001: A Space Odyssey", where the monkey tosses the bone
in the air in slo-mo, and they cut to the space station... but my story
grows tiresome, and I fear I may not touch your monkey. (Saturday Night
Live reference)

Well...deja vu, dude.

	A friend and I were discussing the same topic recently, and we
both had made the same observation independently. We both have female
friends/acquaintances who just go "Ewwwwwww, you like _RUSH_!?!?" at
the first mention of the band. However, there are exceptions. Which brings
me to my female Rush fan/"bRush with greatness" story...

	My most rabid years of Rush fandom were in high school ('80-'83),
and as I
had played guitar since 7th grade, I was in the habit of playing any/every
tune by the boyz with fellow musicians/Rush-heads at any/every opportunity.
Well, some friends and I were approached by the faculty organizer of a lunch-
time talent/fashion show to play some tunes for the show. Our only question
was "Can we play _whatever_ we want?", to which the answer was "yes." Now,
as near as I could tell, there were just *not* that many Rush fans at our
school, but, hey, they said we could play _whatever_we_want_, right? (Wicked
Grin...) So we
did Freewill, Red Barchetta, and Limelight. The bassist and drummer were
some of the best musicians I've ever played with, and, if you'll pardon my
immodesty, I do a pretty fair Alex imitation myself. So the songs came off
great, nobody dropped a beat or hit a sour note (it sounded even better
than I remembered on tape), and, to our collective incredulity, the crowd
_really_ got into it. Which brings me to the female Rush fan observation.
My last class of the day was English, and when I walked in and sat down,
a quiet girl with whom I seldom talked sat down next to me and said "You
guys were _great_; you sounded just like Rush!" Yes, they do exist, those
female fans. How was this a brush with greatness? Well, she just happened
to be one of _the foxiest_ ladies in the whole school (purrrr, reowrrrr!).
And no, I didn't scam a date out of it; at the time I was going out with
a lady who was pretty foxy in her own right (and who was also a Rush fan,
come to think of it). Then I went to college and became an engineering
geek. B^( (Can you say "not gettin' any?" And BTW, it's _even worse_ in
grad school.)

Intergraph.  TJ has also stepped in as the redistribution point
for all Intergraph TNMS readers.  You will be hearing more about
the server as it happens.  BTW, one fellow did call me and offer
to help.  I'm sorry I can't remember his name (are you listening?)
but he deserves a slap on the back for his effort.

Oh, well... hope I didn't screw up the subject...

Personally, I've always loved the ending to R.B.  It's one of my
favourite endings of any song (RUSH or otherwise).  I don't know why.
It's just neat.

I dunno.... "Roll the Bones" makes me think of something Spock would
say about McCoy... (!).

[ What do you do with a drunken medic... (sorry, couldn't resist)  :rush-mgr ]

Hmmm, well, usually Rush's album titles usually reflect the album
in some way (FBN, AFTK, P have title-cuts and PoW, 2112, GUP, P and
others reflect the songs on the albums).  Maybe they've gotten into
religious hymns, lately (they've been Enlightened!).  Maybe instead of
an instrumental (which would've been a chorus of pipe organs, anyway)
they'll sing a capella in the tradition of old Baroque church hymns
sung by monks.  (I just had an urge to laugh hysterically.)

No no no ... this isn't a flame or anything, I'm just joking around
and being uncontrollably silly.  But it does make you wonder!!!

I have found that most of the women I have dated have *become* Rush
fans while they were with me....gee I wonder why?

My highschool sweetheart and I, in the late seventies, used to
make love to _2112_ quite a bit.  She was a calligraphist, and made
me very nice wall hangings with the lyrics to "Something for Nothing" and
"Freewill" (after _Permanent Waves_ came out, of course).

I had another girlfriend in highshool who didn't like Rush, but she called
me up one day about seven or eight years after we broke up to say that
she had become a Rush fan, that she "finally knew what I was talking about"!

I have had the experience more than once of having a girlfriend who is
quite cool to Rush, who listens to them because I do perhaps.  Inevitably
comes the day when I come home to find them playing Rush when I am not around,
all the women I have lived with for any length of time (3) have become big
fans eventually (buying albums, going to concerts, etc.)

Once I met a woman in LA at a party and impetuously invited her up to spend
a weekend with me in Santa Cruz, where I lived at the time. I didn't
know her at all, and was wondering if it was such a good idea.  I
picked her up from the airport and drove to my place.  She walked in and
looked through my 200-disc colection of music for a few minutes; when
she got to "R", she stopped and said "Oh goody, RUSH" and put on
_Moving Pictures_ REAL LOUD.  I knew we were in for a fun weekend!  She
always liked _Signals_ best for sex...

Which reminds me of atime when I was in the dorms at UCSC, right
after _Signals_ came out.  I was in my room, listening to it LOUD.
When I came out, there was a note on my door, in a very feminine
handwriting, saying "Rush is the ultimate to make love to".  You can bet
I spend a lot of time trying to find out who wrote that note!  I eventually
figured it out!

My current SO was a fan in the late seventies, _Caress of Steel_, _2112_,
and _A Farewell to Kings_.  In College the guys next door used to
play side 1 of _Moving Pictures_, so she knew that too.   She hadn't
listed to them in years when we got together, I had a good time introducing
her to the last five albums (and _Permanant Waves_).  She now listens
to Rush more than I do, its the _only_ thing she'll listen to, I like
to mix it up a bit..no more than 4/5 of what I listen to is Rush! :-)

Well, there's my "Rush and Girls" stories...I think women don't listen to
Rush much for a number of reasons, but they are amenable to *becoming*
fans if someone they care about is one.

I too have noticed the mostly-male following of Rush.  It's evident when
I go to shows; about 3/4 to 4/5 of the crowd are guys, and most of the
women are (dragged?) there with a guy.  For some reason, Rush seems to
really attract the young (14-18) SWM* crowd; they make up most of the
audiences at shows.  I must confess, I too fit the category (or did when
I discovered them - I was about 16 and AFTK was the latest disk out).

>From my limited experiences with SO's, only a few could deal with Rush,
and fewer than that actually liked them.  Luckily my wife was one of those
who could deal with them, and likes some of their (more pop-oriented)
stuff.  She also went to two shows with me, MP and either PoW or HYF.

I have yet to figure out the male/female ratio of the list, but it would
be an interesting excersise ... when I have some spare time.  (hah)

Hi,

a) Does anyone out there know what a Didact or Narpet is...from The
   Fountain of Lamneth on Caress of Steel?

b) Does anyone know where Neil Peart got the name for the 'Tobes of Hades',

[ This is something Neil picked up from a friend's father; the guy used to
  say "Hotter (or was it colder?) than the tobes of hell."  It stuck with
  Neil, and he used it.  Source: Backstage Club newsletter Q&A from around
  1989 (ASOH edition?).                                          :rush-mgr ]

  the 'sign of Ath' (...is rising in the air) or 'By-Tor'? Did he just make
   them up, or are they based on Legends???

Hi,

   I'm sure that occasionally Geddy sings lyrics which are different
   (sometimes only subtly) from those printed in the lyric sheets.

    For example in Freewill, the lyrics state:
      "If you choose not to decide you've still _not_ made a choice"

    but I'm sure GL sings "...you still _have_ made a choice".

[ Apparently this is a mistake in the original printing of the lyric sheet
  for the American (Polygram) release of _Power Windows_.  The original
  Anthem (Canada) version and the later US version jive with the lyrics.
  The orignal US version is retained in the ftp lyrics for the sake of

    Also in Mission, the lyrics state:

         "We each pay a fabulous price, for our visions of paradise..."

     But I'm sure GL doesn't say "visions". It sounds more like "building
     our paradise"???

     Am I right? Does anyone else out there know of any other anomalies
     like these?

     Red Barchetta is one of my favorite songs.  I have to disagree
(politely of course :-) with those who feel let down by the ending.
I agree that it is somewhat abrupt, but I always thought of that
transition as being a kind of relief.  There's this tension that
builds up and climaxes in the chase.  Then, instead of a gradual
letdown, there's a sudden release at the moment of escape.  It always
seemed kind of appropriate to me for the way that someone might feel
just after a very narrow escape.  Just MHO.

[ I still like Patrick's allusion to sex! (NMS #244)              :rush-mgr ]

     Another of my favorite songs is Available Light.  Someone asked
what it was about in the last digest and I think that would be a
really interesting discussion.  (Unless it's been hashed out before.  I
haven't been able to read TNMS as regularly as I would've liked for a
while.)  I think that the song is ambiguous enough that there will be
MANY interpretations, so please take I anything I say about it with a
grain of salt.
     I find the song to be kind of inspiring, but it is difficult to
say exactly why.  I sort of imagine the available light as a metaphor
for the idea that we only have so much time in the world to experience
life.  There's so much to see and so little time to see it all in.
To me the song says there isn't enough time to do/see everything we
want to because the world is such a mind-bogglingly huge place.  This
realization might make some people give up out of frustration, but the
song seems to say, "Even though I can't do everything, I still want to
do everything I can."
     " I want to look at life, in the available light."

     As far as _Roll the Bones_ being the possible new album title, my
first reaction was to think that somebody was playing with us.  Maybe
this is reaching a little bit, but when I compared _Throwing the Stones_
to _Roll the Bones_ the first phrase that came to mind was Rolling Stones.
I thought briefly that this interplay of titles might be somebody's little
joke about about the less-than-entirely-positive relationship that RUSH is
supposed to have with either the band the Rolling Stones or the magazine
Rolling Stone.  Like I said, I think this is reaching a bit, but it just
faintly smacks of the kind of subtle joke I might expect from RUSH to
give out a series of fake (or interim) album titles with some common
allusion.  Just a random thought.
     Considering for the moment that _Roll the Bones_ might really be
the title (for lack of anything better to do :-), I don't think it's
a bad one.  I wouldn't put too much emphasis on the voodoo/shamanism
connection.  I think it could just be a more general sort of reference
to the idea of trying to divine the future.  This would seem to me
to fit in with what I see as a kind of trend in the later music toward
a more introspective and kind of reflecting-on-life tone.  The title
kind of has overtones of the randomness of future events and how none
of us ever really knows what lies ahead for us personally.  I guess I'm
saying it might be more of a statement about the futility of trying to
guess the future.

     I didn't intend for this become so long, but with the volume so far
down and all I hope nodody minds.  I hope I might have inspired somebody
to start a new discussion about some of these ideas.
