last night, I came home and was flipping through the radio stations,
what do my wondering ears hear??? RUSH! on the King Biscuit Flower Hour!

the problem is, I only was able to get the last 10-15 minutes on tape.

did anyone out there get a coppy of this on tape???

I'd be willing to pay a reasonable amount for this...

send e-mail to drivard@hawk.ulowell.edu if you can help me!

thanks,
		Dennis

I think an anonymous ftp would be a great idea! it would make it
much easier to pick up those back issues!

I had a similar experience with _Hemispheres_.  I loved _2112_ when I first
heard it, and ran out & bough ATWAS & loved that also.  Then AFTK came out,
and I came to like it after only a couple of listens, especially "Cygnus X-1".
Then when _Hemispheres_ came out, I listened to it at a friends house the
week it came out.  I was sorely disappointed when I heard side one, which
was supposed to be part 2 of "Cygnus".  It was sooo different!  When "Perm.
Waves" came out, I loved it again, and began my trend of buying their albums
the day (or as soon thereafter as possible) they were released.  I finally
broke down and bought _Hemishpheres_ for the sake of completeness, and was
amazed how much I ended up liking it.  It's now in my top 5 Rush albums, and
contains my (and the majority of others') favorite song - "La Villa".

I must say, I'm more in the class with the ones that don't like HYF.  It's
not that it's a bad album, more like it doesn't excite me like most of the
others.  I also have to say that about _Power Windows_ - it's just not the
kind of stuff I like to hear from them.  I will admit that they have good
songs ("Turn The Page", "Force Ten", "Manhattan Project", "Marathon"), but
as an overall album failed to stir me like their other works.

I think this is what I missed; I'm just an old pseudo-headbanger from the
days of yore, weaned on BOC, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin (when they were still
together), etc.  I was thrilled when _Presto_ came out, with it's return
to a more guitar/bass/drums oriented style.  I was feeling that the last
few albums were too slick, too produced; the songs began to blend together
near the end of the albums.

When I see people posting "I've been into Rush for almost two years now ...",
I can't help but wonder how many of the newer fans have really listened to
_Fly By Night_, with songs like "Best I Can", "Making Memories", "Anthem",
etc.  I'll still put my vote in for ATWAS for their best live album, and
possibly for best live album for *any* band.  Geddy, Alex, & Neil think it
sounded too 'raw', but that's what I want to hear in a live album!  My main
complaint with the other two is that there was too much post-production,
and that it fades out & in between songs, losing that 'immediacy' the first
one has.

[ Sorry, I seem to be rambling here... I'll get back to relevance. ]

Still, I can't fault them for growing, searching, looking for new direction.
I'm a bit sorry Neil made the comment that any of their music that's pre-'80
holds no interest for him, though - never forget your roots!  I'm still a
loyal fan - had tickets for them every show here since '79, but (to quote
another band) "what a long strange trip it's been".  I'll be 'on the bus'
until The End ...  :-)

Well, enough for now.

   Hmmm.

  Is it just me, or do other folks look at Analog Kid, Chemistry, and Digital
 Man and wonder if there is something more than is obvious? Too many breakfast
 bars? Should I stay away from watching David Letterman? Should I not persue
 my psychology degree? I have my ideas(hehehehehe). Anyone else?

Axeman said he heard Alex give a station ID recently at 2:30am.
I heard Geddy do a station ID for a Sacramento station around
the time that RUSH was in the bay area for the Presto
tour. It was during the day, and was followed by one of the
songs from Presto ("Show Don't Tell" if I remember correctly. No
surprises there, eh?).

On the subject of album preference, you know, I really like them
all. I think RUSH (album 1 that is) is a great hard rock album.
Crank up the volume and let 'er rip! Great noise! There isn't a
song on Signals that I dislike, although I do feel that the sound
is a bit "muddy" compared to some other Rush albums. My favorites
from Signals are "Subdivisions", "New World Man", and "Countdown".
I would say that HYF is my least favorite, if I had to pick one
as such, but even at that I play it more than some of their other
albums. The synths seem to blend better and support Alex's guitar
work better than on Signals. One of my favorites from HYF is
"High Water". Something about that song really stirs something up
inside of me.

There is a question that I've always wanted to hear someone else's
thoughts on, and that is "How do you think about Rush?" That is,
how are they classified in your mind? When I think of rock
music, I think of everyone else, and Rush. There is a really big
distinction. I have always thought that Rush sounds really
different from "usual rock music" in a unique way. I don't have
any words yet to say what it is that separates them though. Does
anyone else out there think about Rush in a similar way? Is my
classification really not accurate, but just skewed a bit towards
Rush because I like them so much? This might be a bit hard to
discuss here because the NMS readership is obviously a biased
audience, but what the hell? One factor that may enter into my
demarcation of Rush from everone else is that I have spent a
lot of time over the years *really* listening to their music and
their lyrics and thinking about what I hear and feel. Because of that I
feel that I understand Rush better than I understand any other band.
