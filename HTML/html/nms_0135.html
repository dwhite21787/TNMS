Howdy folks,

    Well, I've finally gotten around to doing it - I've set up anonymous
ftp for people interested in getting back issues of the digest, lyrics,
and "special stuff" (interviews, etc.).  This is a read-only ftp site;
you will not be able to place items there yourself, only download from
here to you (more on this later).

    The address to ftp to is (of course):

    syrinx.umd.edu

       or

    128.8.2.114

for those of you who don't have name resolution.  Once here, you will be
prompted for a name (userid) and password.  Use "anonymous" for the userid
and your userid for the password.

    Once you're logged in, 'cd' into the "rush" subdirectory.  Once there,
you can list the files in the directory.  There is actually only one file
(README) currently, the others being subdirectories.

    The directories available now are:

    "digest" - Contains back issues of the current incarnation of the
                digest from issue # 1 to the current issue;

    "lyrics" - Contains the lyrics for all the albums up through _Presto_;

    "names"  - Contains a recent (thought not always the latest-and-
                greatest) version of the subscription list; and

    "special" - (currently empty) which will contain the longer items -
                interviews, articles, tour lists, etc.

The files in the "digest" and "lyrics" (and eventually "special") sub-
directories are compressed; you'll have to uncompress them on your end.
The names list is not compressed.

    If you wish to submit something to be put into any of these directories,
send it here to the 'rush-request' address; if it's of general interest,
it'll be a special edition, and then placed in the "special" dir.  (Lyrics
won't be posted to the list.)

    As I've gotten the lyrics from another source, I cannot personally
guarantee they're 100% accurate - if you happen to notice something amiss,
please send mail here letting me know.  I'll check the original album, and
make a change if necessery.

    Remember, if you don't have ftp capabilities at your site, there is still
the mail server at "server@ingr.com".

Fellow Rush Fans,

Just a few things here.  First, yes, Neil does introduce some
songs on the Exit...Stage eft video.  I think he says a few
words before "Red Barchetta," "The Trees", and "Xanadu".  I
will maek an attempt to view the video again to make sure
(Seeing it again after a year or two does wonders to my Rush
enthusiasm!)

Second, while taping one of the sepcials from _The Sourece_,
I heard Alex introduce the band.  He said "Hi, this is Alex
Lifeson of Rush, and your Listening to Rush on QFM96,
Columbus, OH".  (Or something like that ;-))

Before I close, I'd like to throw my 2 bits in on  some of the
discussion of _Signals_, _HYF_, etc...  After reading some of
the discussion about signals, I decided to listen to that
album again.  For the most part, I still really enjoy
listnening to it.  "Analog Kid" will always be a favorite of
mine.  For some reason, I could never get into "Chemistry" or
"Digital Man".  But overall, I enjoyed listening to it again.
Now for _HYF_.  I can honestly say that I dearly love that
album.  It has the overall "togetherness" or feel that I look
for.  But even though I did not respond to the album poll,
I have to admit that mya favorite album is still _Moving Pictures_,
and of course my favorite song is "La Villa Strangiato".  Of
teh other albums mentioned here, _HYF_ I rate 3rd, Signals
probably 6th or 7th.

Greetings Rush fans!

One interesting note:

There is now a songbook for Chronicles out (as if none of the songs
on the compilation have ever been transcribed before...!).  I didn't
really get a good look through it, but it seems that all the songs on
the compilation are in the book, including Show Don't Tell.  Just
another tidbit of insignificant information on this hectic, anxiety
filled week (ack!).

Puanani Akaka               Time stand still, indeed!

P.S.  Ed, I'll get back to you!  I'll get back to you!!!

Rush is special to me, but not superhuman.  Other groups are also special
to me, for different reasons.  For instance, I get into Zeppelin because
of the way they conveyed emotion in their music, not because of their
lyrics ("I saw a lion he was standing alone with a tadpole in a jar..").
Rush I appreciate more for their technical finesse, and meaningful lyrics
that match closely with my philosophy of life.  To tell the truth, I
sometimes get annoyed with Neil's lyrics getting too contrived and "cheesy"
at times (eg: Countdown), but overall they're superb.

Rush does sound really different than "usual rock music" (which helps
to explain their lack of airplay), but then lots of groups Deviate from
the Norm.  You don't hear much Talking Heads on rock n' roll stations
either.

Speaking of radio stations, is there some mega-conglomerate that controls
the playlist for all of them?  We have two "competing" rock n' roll stations
here in Sacramento.  They play virtually identical material.  What really
gets to me is when they dig up some oldie tune (eg: Steppenwolf's "Magic
Carpet Ride") and play it OVER AND OVER for a few days straight.  Both
stations seem to dig up the same stuff, play it for a few days, then let
it fall back into disuse.

These stations all seem to use the same tricks, too.  "Two for Tuesday",
the lunchtime "Rock Cafe", "Rock Blocks", "Zeppelin Traffic Jams", etc.
The morning DJs all seem to be David Letterman clones.  They all play
"classic rock" on Sundays (as if everybody's musical tastes change on the
sabbath).  You'd think that these stations would get more listeners if
they weren't doing the exact same things as their competition.  What's
going on???

Don't know why I'm responding to this thread...not the most thrilling
ever, but...

I've heard Alex say "Presto!  This is Alex Lifeson of Rush on KOME,
98.5 in San Jose" or something like that.  Believe it or not, this
was on the morning show (I generally listen to another station that
is positively anti-Rush, sad to say...wish I could convince them Rush
doesn't fit into the neat little slot they think it does).  And, of
course, they (oops, KOME, not the other station, which shall remain
nameless to protect them from the wrath of 500 RushFans) followed the
blurb with a song from Presto (something no station does often enough).
I'm sure I'm not the only one who's dreamt of owning a radio station
that plays nothing but Rush....

Hello Fellow RUSHians,

    I was watching the Chronicles video and I also have the video Through
the Camera Eye.  I was wondering, who was the kid in A Distant Early Warning?

[ Geddy's son (Julian?), I believe.  Maybe another addition to the FAQL, Dan?
                                                                  :rush-mgr ]

    The word "Strangiato"  How is that exactly pronounce?

[ The "a"'s are pronounced like when you say "ahhh" at the doctor's.  Also,
  the "ll" in "Villa" are pronouonced "y" - "La Veeya".           :rush-mgr ]

    What available Anonymous FTP sites are available for a RUSHian like
me to get on?

[ Well, one is detailed in the first article ...  :-)             :rush-mgr ]

    Anyhow, a few questions that has been on my mine.  Y'all have a good
Merry Christmas.

[ Any other questions?  Boy, I aced this test!  :-) :-)           :rush-mgr ]

<A NAME="135007">Subject: Trivia Questions.</A>

Hello All.

I'm currently looking at modifying fortune to look at a database of
Rush related items.  Some of you may already be familiar with the unix
program "fortune".  It came to my attention last year when I came
across a program called "rushfortune".  Someone had modified the
fortune program to look at a database of Rush lyrics.  Everytime you
ran rushfortune it would print out some lyrics from any of their albums.
(from Rush all the way through Hold Your Fire).

I'd like to do something similar on my machine here at UCSD.  I'd also
thought it would be nice to add trivia to database along with lyrics.
This would post a bit of trivia everytime you ran the rushfortune
program.  What I'd like is for some of you to send me some of your
favorite Rush trivia facts/questions so that I can make a fairly decent
database for the rushfortune program.

For example some of the things from Dan's FAQL is a good start for me.
However, the more I get the better.  Preferably trivia of a real
hardcore Rush Fan would be nice.  With good results, I may even post
the trivia file here (maybe as a special issue).  If anything it would be
a good file to have around to test people or even to have fun with
other Rush fans you know.  After all, such a list of trivia facts/questions
could determine the difference between someone who knew what YYZ was
and someone who knew what George Lucas' first film was and what Rush
song was inspired by it!  Funny quotes from the band members would be
nice to add to the database as well, so if you've heard or know of some
funny ones, send them to the address listed below.

These little neat trivia things can range from anything!  So send
me your little trivia questions and facts that you like to ask Rush
fans and I will post a list of responses I get (if any).

Also if anyone has made done a project like rushfortune in the past
and would like to email me details that is fine also!

Thanks.

 And on the subject of Rush being Satanic I find this entry:

As far as trying to file Rush into some category of musical style,
I think there's only one category which is even remotely accurate:

"Rush music".

Seriously, what they do is so different from anyone else out there
that I just can't lump it in with anyone else's music.  I cringe
when someone calls them a "metal band", and I likewise am annoyed
when some reviewer attempts to characterize Rush's music in some
other readily available term that they've scribbled in the margin
of their musical thesaurus.  It's just not fair to Rush: they are
a singular phenomenon.

Regarding all the people coming out of the cracks to say how much
they dislike HYF, I feel compelled to write in response that I
think HYF is one of Rush's best albums.  A lot of the reason for
me feeling that way is "Mission", which has unquestionably become
my favorite Rush tune.  But I also find the entire album to be a
stunningly mature piece of work.. their newfound capacity to use
judicious restraint in all the right places made the moments of
power and excess all that more dramatic.  I feel that they did
some of their best songwriting on HYF.  My second favorite album
is AFTK, also on the strength of the songwriting, so that's a big
criteria with me.  To me, the song itself is what really matters,
not how many hot licks can be crammed into it.  That's a viewpoint
the members of Rush seem to value a lot as well, judging from the
interviews I've read.

Or maybe I'm just getting old.  30 is just around the corner...
