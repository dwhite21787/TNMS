Details on the Rush Pop-Up Video appearance! Through dilligence, effort,
and paying off a few people, I've found that Rush's video "Limelight" will
be appearing on VH1's Pop-Up Video show THIS SATURDAY, May 16th at 6:30PM
EDT/PDT. They will also be showing "Tears Are Not Enough", Geddy makes an
appearance in that video as well (thanks to whoever posted that tidbit).
It'll probably re-air sometime next week as well.

And I *WILL* be getting off my butt (figuratively speaking) and update the
NMS web page. I feel sorry for the poor Artists Against Racism lady, she
keeps getting email about the auction! All will better than it was very soon,
and yes the trader will again lurch back to life.

In other news, the new syrinx (yes, the same one all you guys donated $$$ for!!)
will be up probably in a month or so. A nice P150 running linux (the machine's
been bought, just have had nowhere to put it) with a ton of HD space. I'll
probably even go buy another HD since they're so cheap nowadays (maybe more
memory too). I might even find a use for the "2112.com" domain I have laying
around... ;-)

Oh yeah one more thing and then I will shut up: I finally got around to doing
a RealVideo of Geddy singing at the All-Stars Game a few years back, look for
it (and the Toronto Phoenix QT clip) to be linked in as soon as the page
gets updated!

It has to be a misread, or they were afraid of copyright infringement on
the REAL black hole (;>)
Cygnus X-1 is short for "Cygnus X-ray source #1."  First they discovered
the X-rays, then they decided it was a blue supergiant star with an
orbiting black hole companion that used to be another giant star that
collapsed.  If you'd like a synopsis of why they think that happens,
e-me.
AS the matter drops into the black hole, it is compressed and heated,
and emits a LOT of high frequency energy, particularly X-rays.  Then it
passes the Swartzchild radius and disappears.  After that is anyone's
guess.

As far as replacements or assistants to Al, I love Joe Satriani, but as
talented and skillful as he is, his sound is too different.  My opinion
of his student, Steve Vai, is that he's a legend in his own mind.  Sorr,
but he's very precise and doesn't move me at all.
Satch's other student, Kirk Hammett, would be a promising choice, as
would Steve Howe, Steve Hackett, or Buzzy Feiten from Shotgun
Messiah--catch him on Stu Hamm's "Kings of Sleep," and "The Urge."

John Heald kindly sent me a compilation of Chris Impellitteri.  I revise
my opinion--He's REALLY good.  Can't think why he isn't more popular. 
Sounds like a bit of Eddy influence, and maybe a bit of Kirk Hammett,
and a bit of Terrible Teddy, plus a lot of his own sweat.

Hey, all you crazy peoples out there! I've been so busy that I haven't been 
able to check any NMS' lately. I happened to have time, so I came upon this 
thread.

Of course-Red Barchetta, that's a given. Basically, the whole GUP album 
(for me), exclusively, Between the Wheels. Driven is a good one too. I 
agree with those who said Dreamline. But how about Face Up? The Fly by 
Night album is kickin too.

And nhow about long trips? Sometimes a different class of music goes well 
with a long drive. Personally I can't go down the street without grabbing a 
disc. But I take about 30 on a long trip, just for variety.
Here's a few that I like. First probably the best non-Rush for me is Pink 
Floyd The Wall. Back to Rush: 2112. Hemisphere's (oh hell, the whole Cygnus 
X-1 epic). Live albums. No matter the song on a live disc, it is done 
extremely electrifying. Pumps me up anyway.

Well, take care, y'all.

>This is getting long, I realize... but so was 'MazScape's
>'semiflame'.  There's no need for such a downer when the music is so good.

There was no flame at all. And as for my notes being a downer...well, I'd say
"realistic" is more accurate.

Personally, I'd *love* to see some sort of Rush movie get produced and *work*.
It would have to be perfectly executed, because there's a lot of prejudice
against the band from those who don't know anything about "The Boys."

For example: Most people I've met (in my age group) who know the Rush name
associate the band with pimply-faced geek stoners from 1981 listening to "Tom
Sawyer" in their '77 Mustangs out in the high school parking lot. That's a
tough barrier to kill. You and I know it ain't so, but tell THEM that.

Example: A producer friend of mine was talking about music. Someone mentioned
Rush, and how they hated them. The producer said, "Yeah, me too...I've never
even heard their music, and I hate them."

Okay, so look at the above: A guy who produces feature films who hates Rush
without even having heard their music. Outrageous, but typical (as for my
personal experience; your mileage may very).

It's a horrible feeling to be in a room like that. About the same as being a
Mac user among Wintel folk...the same kind of ignorance and injustice works in
both situations.

Also, someone mentioned that the budget didn't have to be $20-million. To that
I say, "of course not." Many fine films (some of the best, in fact) have been
made for less than $6-million. However, we're talking about a highly visual
band...and to interest distributors and secure pre-sales (with which you
finance your picture), you've gotta have some SALABLE element of some
kind...whatever that might be (a star, or what have you).

Unless you get it financed outright. Hell, there's a million ways to make a
movie...we could be talking all week on this subject.

And to be sure, there's no rule set in stone. Someone might make a barnyard
production on 8mm and sell it to Miramax for $10-million. It might then go on
to win three Oscars and do $431-million worldwide, sparking a fever for Rush
product and sending the CDs flying off shelves. There will be Neil Peart
balloons in the Macy's parade, and a Geddy statue replacing the Jesus in Rio.

BUT: Don't count on it. The picture business is extremely complex, fickle, and
unpredictable, not to mention flaky. Trying to push a Rush film through that
kind of muck is a job for brave and foolish souls...

However, with the right script...maybe, just maybe... ;)

Hi all

I keep seeing these excellent reviews of Catherine Wheel's new CD Adam &
Eve and was wondering if anyone out there has it, or has heard it and can
tell me if it's any good, in a Rush related sort of way. Or, in any other
way to be honest. 
I suppose I should just go and buy it, but there's lots of other stuff on
my shopping list at the moment - new stuff from Francis Dunnery, Page and
Plant, Dave Matthews Band . . .the list is, as ever, endless.

Also - has anyone anywhere got a taoe of the Van Halen show from Down Under
that was recently broadcast on MTV, as I'd really really like to have a
copy. Please EMail me privately and we can sort out a deal ? (My VCR plays
non-PAL tapes, so no probs there.)

Cheers

Rush-fans Over-Using Syrinx.umd.edu? I don't think they exist.
[rush-mgr enters with the open-field tackle]
(That's gonna leave a mark)

Issue 2112:
I say it should include NMS issue #2, #1, #1, and finally #2, all
in one... Sorry, was I not clearly sarcastic enough? Let me try
again. How about Issue #2112 be instructions on how to use the
mail server to get these issues? Reapeated 2112 times? Actually, in
all honesty, I'd like to see #2112 be a confirmed or damn-near-positive
set list for teh live album. I can dream can't I? And if not that, 
how about a retrospective on all the best practical joke posts?
Stuff from April Fools' Day posts and the like? It'd probably be a 
complete pain to compile. but 'twould be cool.

New Album Name:
To whoever suggested naming it "Curtain Call" or something in sequence
with existing live album names, props. Awesome idea. Maybe something
cheesy and encore-related like Threepeat? ;)

David Hasselhoff:
Totally unrelated, but it'd be cool to see him lit on fire.

I hate to sound whiny. I want some. Have some?

Hi gang --

This was mentioned awhile ago, but the post came to me through an
intermediate step.  [and if you can find *that* oblique reference to 
Rush without looking it up, then you deserve a Syrinx Award yourself!].  

First off, let me congratulate the recipients of the Syrinx Award --
The Esteemed Holy Bitch, Eric, Jordan, Hanstones and Rob M. (I didn't
leave anyone out, did I?).  [much belated applause]   Congratulations,
folks!     

Needless to say, however, I was quite astonished to discover that I
myself, was a recipient of our newly appointed Syrinx Award!  In fact,
I was so excited, I wrote out a 15-page acceptance speech!  Including
translations in Esperanta, French, Bantu, Hawaiian, and Vietnamese. 
But, unfortunately, Jim Phelps, disguised as Barney Collier imitating
Rollin Hand got to it before I did!  They converted it to a tape
which self-destructed in 5 seconds.  [much sobs and sniffles ensue]
Damn, the Secretary!  

But... shuckths, ya guys...(big toe in dirt)...thanx so much for the
nominations and the Award.  Really, the other winners really *deserve*
theirs -- they actually DID things for people.  I just knocked my
knees together in fright when Geddy and Alex looked at me.  [Uh,
anyone know where the exit might be?]  :-)  But I'm glad folks enjoyed
the story...and my numerous postings and ramblings.  :-)

Unfortunately (well, for me), and for various and sundry reasons, I've
had to unsubscribe from our beloved Excuse to Talk of All Things Rush.
[mos'ly cuz I ain't gone'be a' dis address no' mo']  Hence my only
finding out about all this just the other day!  [well, actually, I was
told by Jordan earlier, but I didn't believe him].  :-)

So mahalo nui loa for the Syrinx Award.  I thank you all in a most
humbling manner and bequeath to you that which is in your reach -- the
Page Down key!  Mahalo kakou!!  

Ho-hoo!    "Uh-oh...two dozen eggs, two liters of milk..." - Alex 
puanani   	(or...something like that)

<A NAME="2029014">Subject: The D'oh Awards!</A>

Ladies & Gentlemen, your attention please...

Geddy Lee recently commented in an interview with Guitar 
Magazine that on virtually every album they've ever 
released there have been one or two songs which didn't turn 
out quite as well as the boyz would have liked - he also 
mentioned that if you could keep that number down to one 
song an album you were doing pretty damn well.  With this 
in mind, I hereby submit my choices for the 1998 D'oh Award 
for Song Which Didn't Quite Work Out on a Studio Album:

Album:	Rush	Song:	Need Some Love/Take A Friend

A joint award for this album, as both songs are pretty 
much as bad as each other - both are infinitely forgettable 
and catch the band sounding at their most Zeppelin 
clone-ish.

Album:	Fly By Night	Song:	By-Tor & the Snow Dog

Although later albums would see the boyz being able to 
work the concept song a lot more successfully, this one 
definitely counts as a mistake - I mean, those growling 
noises in the instrumental?  What's that all about?

Album:  Caress of Steel	Song:  I Think I'm Going Bald

It may have seemed like a great idea to throw in a 
'light-hearted' number on CoS, but it really doesn't work 
towards sustaining the dark, aggressive mood of the album.

Album:	2112	Song:	Lessons

Alex had yet to acquire any lyric-writing prowess, and 
would not do so until Victor, many years later.

Album:	A Farewell To Kings	Song:	Madrigal

Despite the fact that the pastoral setting worked 
exceptionally well on the title track, the boyz pushed it 
a little too far over the edge on this one.

   [ Hey! I *like* that song! I even occasionally play quake2 under that
     name *evil grin*                                       : rush-mgr ]

Album:	Hemispheres	Song:	Circumstances

The combination of an intensely irritating vocal from Ged 
and the rather pretentious use of French in the chorus 
served to mark this one out as the stinker on Hemispheres.

Album:	Permanent Waves	Song:	Different Strings

This one scoops it for being the least-wonderful song on an 
otherwise superb album (get ready for more of those) - the 
guys demonstrate a recurring trend of making an 
unsuccessful attempt to try something new.

   [ What did he say? What what what?? Methinks someone is insulting my
     dragon song....                                        : rush-mgr ]

Album:	Moving Pictures	Song:	The Camera Eye

Although Neil pulled a corker of a 10-minute song out of 
the bag on PeW, he couldn't repeat the trick on MP.  TCE 
has its moments, both lyrically and musically, but suffers 
from a lack of focus, inconsistent with the rest of the 
album.

Album:	Signals		Song:	Digital Man

Yes, I'll admit, it's groovy as hell, and Geddy's bass 
work is outstanding, but I think Terry Brown may have 
had a point when he advised the boyz to re-work this 
one.

Album:  Grace Under Pressure	Song:	Red Lenses

Neil's experiments with lyrics were genuinely 
thought-provoking and praise-worthy, but the style of 
the song still sounds forced and decidedly un-Rush.

Album:	Power Windows	Song:	None

There IS no weak song on PoW.

Album:	Hold Your Fire	Song:	Tai Shan

Although oriental influences served to make Territories the 
quality song it is, those same twangy guitars served to 
pull Tai Shan down - Neil's picture-postcard lyrics on this 
one didn't help much either.

Album:  Presto		Song:	Scars

The overall approach to Presto might have been solid, but 
the boyz once again headed off into leftfield and came back 
empty-handed.  The emotion is there on Scars, but it never 
really pulls together into anything concrete.

Album:	Roll The Bones		Song:	Face Up

If ever there was a textbook definition of a throw-away 
song, this would be it.

Album:  Counterparts	Song:	The Speed of Love

The schmaltzy title is a grim foreboder of what is to come 
  Neil shows that although he can write beautiful love 
songs (GoaC), he has yet to perfect the art.  Geddy's bass 
tries to save it, Neil's military drumbeat kills it dead.

Album:  Test For Echo	Song:	Time & Motion

Pick a feature on this one - essentially meaningless lyrics 
from Neil, irritating high/low vocals from Geddy, a 
kick-ass but heartless solo from Alex.  All round loser, 
easily outclassed by everything else on the album.

See you next year!

I'd go with the simplest expalnation (Palo's) for this one.  Later 
on, it is quite clear that the narrative I returns, and that there is 
only one Cygnus - "I have memory and awareness.." "The warriors heard 
my silent cry...", but the slip from singular to plural first person 
is by no means unusual, either in letrature or in every day speech.  
Geddy also changes Neil's lyrics on occasion when he thinks they do 
not work, or if he has a personal problem with them.  Limelight was 
originally written in the first person singular, before Geddy said he 
could not do it that way, and so changed it to the impersonal one.  
However, I doubt if this has much bearing on the Cygnus conundrum - I 
just does not work where the we has been inserted.

<A NAME="2029019">Subject: Rush Movie</A>

Hello everyone...

All of the posts that I have read thus far regarding the "Rush Movie" have
been quite interesting!  I think the idea is a good one, and I would most
certainly go see it at the theaters (more than once, I'm sure!  =) ).

But, even though it sounds like the movie could be made for relatively
little money, we must ask ourselves:  Would RUSH really want a movie to be
made?  It seems to me that they would not.

RUSH has always done things their own way - and to me, they've always
seemed like very private people.  I know that they authorized "Visions" to
be written, but then, according to the story that I've read, the "B-Man"
betrayed the band's trust.  

So, I guess I'm just trying to say that I don't think the band who wrote
the song "Limelight" - "Cast in this unlikely role/Ill equipped to act/With
insufficient tact/One must put up barriers/To keep oneself intact" - would
want the story of their life to be splayed across the screens of the world.

Does anyone else agree with this line of reasoning?

OK, how about this one?  Maybe a bit narrow, but appropriate I think.

Post relatively brief descriptions of your first beginning-to-end listening
experience of 2112, side 1.  I know I can't be alone in having a
recollection of listening to the music & reading the lyrics and story on
the inside of one of my first double-albums, and basically being blown away
by such quality music and concept.

Perhaps our kind & benevolent rush-mgr could post complete lyrics & story
notes from the original release for those few NMS'ers cursed with only the
early CD release that included neither - just so we're all on the same
page.

Subsequently, issue #2112 would be comprised entirely of 2112 content, from
people who know best... all us sick bastards who, drawn further into the
twisted web of Rush by this album, are now subconsciuosly forced to use
2112 as PIN numbers & access codes....

HIGH WATER?

Oh boy - I know people listen to Rush for different reasons and everybody
has their own taste, but that has to be just about my least favorite last
songs, right up there with Available Light.

It seems amazing to me that any Rush fan would choose High Water over any of
the songs below:

Circumstances
Something for Nothing
Natural Science
Vital Signs
Between the Wheels
Everyday Glory
Countdown
In the End
Cygnus X-1
Carve Away the Stone
Working Man

I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite from that list.  It is much
easier to say which songs I do NOT think are great last songs -  the already
mentioned, plus You Bet your Life and Mystic Rhythms.  On those four CDs, I
frequently find that the albums end with Tai Shan, Emotion Detector, Hand
Over Fist, and Neurotica.  (Actually, Roll the Bones often doesn't make it
past Ganster, but that's beside the point).

I could probably come up with a list of 10 songs off of all Rush albums that
I really just don't care for that much.  A couple of them would really get
me flamed, like The Camera Eye.   But when it comes to picking the best last
song, I cannot let a suggestion like High Water go by uncommented.

I would have to give the nod to David Lynch.  Was and still is an 
experimental director.  Pushes the envelope as far as directing goes. 
 Does not direct movies for the respect of the mainstream fan or 
critics,    If anyone has seen "Lost Highway" or Blue Velvet" you 
certainly know what I am talking about.  In my opinion his vision is 
unmatched by todays directors.  He hasn't(and I certainly hope he 
never does) jumped on the blockbuster bandwagon.

For this reason I feel he would be the perfect compliment for a band 
that has refused to fall in line with the mainstream and continues to 
do things their way.

Ted,

For the baseball game music, how about: 

Half the World - great guitar, not too heavy. The lyrics are simple but
powerful.
Cold Fire - the theme music may get some crowd response.
Dreamline - you mentioned it, but I just had to mention it again. 
Scars - cool bass, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm.
Prime Mover - the "anything can happen" lyrics should fit in nicely.
Mission - ASOH version
Territories - audience may move to the beat. "A whole wide world, an
endless. . ."
The Enemy Within - one of my personal favorites. Love the guitar/synths
at the end.

I think those are some songs that may be get some of the audience
saying, "That was a kickass song. I wonder who made it." Ted, I really
like your idea of playing newer stuff. After all, that is what Rush has
been making in the 1990's, newer stuff. Overall, we spend so much time
on the NMS talking about 2112/Hemispheres/MP, that an outsider looking
in would think Rush retired. Granted, we need to talk about 70's/early
80's, but lets not forget about late 80's/90's. "Spirit of Radio" and
"Tom Sawyer" are on the radio everyday. Much of the public bases their
dislike of Rush on these few songs. Don't get me wrong, I like Tom
Sawyer, but it just doesn't give me a "shiver down my spine" like most
of the other Rush songs. So, it would be great if we can expose the
world to newer Rush, or Rush besides Tom Sawyer. Here we have a band
that has 20+ years of music, and all the public knows is "Spirit of
Radio" and "Tom Sawyer." A person will walk up and ask me, "What music
do you listen to?" I will respond, "Rush!" Then they will say, "Oh, so
you like that Tom Sawyer song?" And I will say, "Yeah, but it's not one
of my favorites. That's not their best song by a long shot." Then, I'll
try to explain the talent this band has, the powerful lyrics, the
longevity. But, people just don't understand. 

Anyway, great work Ted!!!

Oh, almost forgot Ted, for a BIG BANG, try playing the first track of
the "Animated" boot(if you have it). Everyone has heard "Thus Spake
Zarathustra." People in the audience will say, "That's the 2001 music.
Cool!" Of course, at the end of "Thus spake," a loud wave will sound
through the speakers, and then Dreamline will begin. God, I love the
sound of that "wave."

Hi everyone,

One cold night, a few months ago, I went into Hastings book/music/video
here in Billings, MT. I was in the Rock&Pop music section checking out
some of the Rush remasters. Right next to me was two men in their late
30's. They were talking to each other about buying a CoS or 2112
remaster CD. So, I took the initiative to start a conversation: 
"Have you ever seen them in concert?"
"Yeah," one of them said. "We saw them on the Signals tour here in
Billings."
"Oh really, they sure put on one hell of a show," I said. "I saw them on
tour about a year ago. Have you checked out the Test for Echo album?"
"Test for what?" he asked. "No, we haven't heard of that one."

That's where the conversation ended. It was obvious that these people
had absolutely no knowledge of late 80's/90's Rush. They probably
assumed Rush was no longer playing. Just goes to show you that there are
many supposed fans out there who are only aware of early Rush. It was
actually kind of funny. There I was, 22 years old, talking to some
people in their late 30's who I figured were long-time fans. Usually,
it's people my age who have no idea what I'm talking about in regards to
Rush. Test for what?
	
Recently, I was able to get 94.1(Billings) to play "Resist." It was
during the 5:00 traffic rush(no pun intended). I was excited, to say the
least.

Rush on,

HELLO  

I have been a HUGE Rush fan for 18 years, since I was a junior
high school student on Long Island, New York.  Now I am a teacher in
Alaska (not too many Rush fans around here!), and am so excited to find
The National Midnight Star!  The most recent issue I've discovered was
from September of 1997.  How often do are updates issued, and what's the
process involved in responding to entries and/or posting my own?

I'm not sure who is behind the syrinx.umd.edu web site, but I would like
to thank whomever it is for this great "meeting place" for the genuine
Rush fans of the world!

Last summer, I flew to Toronto to catch Rush's final week of concerts. 
Of course, the show blew me away . . . but the fans I met were
unparalleled.  My opinion was strengthened: anyone who is a genuine Rush
fan has a wonderfully rich, deep soul.  Rush on!

Peace.

Ok, while everyone seems to be on the topic of cool songs, what's with 
"Finding My Way?" For years, I've been wondering why there seems to be 
an apparent "defect" at 0:29 into the song. Could it have been left in 
on purpose to show the world that their very first song was less than 
perfect? Given Rush's later quest for technical near-perfection, you'd 
think that this wouldn't have been allowed to slip by the production 
people. As far as I know, it seems to be the only defect that I've 
noticed on any of their albums. If anyone knows of any more defects, or 
has any ideas as to the 0:29 thing, let me know! Email me or visit my

has a routine set up for a short show and during his show he uses
background music - he plays the same song that I would play at a

"Where's My Thing" from RTB. It's got a good rhythm and it's not too

I agree it is important to set the record straight  where it concerns
Riverfront Coliseum and people being "trampled to death" or a "stamped"

information was posted to TNMS.  Out of respect to those that died and
concert goers everywhere, please allow me to present the facts.

===>Where did you obtain these facts from?  I live here in Cincinnati,
and remember this whole thing all too well.

It was a "festival seating" or "general admission" show.  For those that
don’t recall, since they do not occur at most venues now, it means first
in line gets in first, thus can get the best seats.  Fans would show up
early to be first in line.  Security at the venue allowed people to pack
against the doors.

======> And the Who were rehearsing inside.  People thought the concert
started without them.  That is what caused the panic.  Not to mention
not every entry door to the place was opened.  Only 2-3.

Now days gates are usually set up before the doors into a concert hall
to prevent people from jamming up in front of the doors.

As the crowd grew, the pressure on people waiting in front of the doors
grew.  Security only opened a few doors and was very slow in letting
people into the coliseum.  The pressure on people in front was so great
that they could not breathe.  They died of suffocation while STANDING in
the crowed waiting to get in.  No one was trampled and there was no
stamped.

======>  This is incorrect.  Once someone was down on the ground, that
was it.  They could not get up.  People were shoved forward by the crowd
behind them, and were actually stepping on other people who were on the
ground.  They couldn't stop that.  There were also people who were
pinned up against concrete 'barriers' (this venue is elevated with
street traffic and parking underneath) and the doors themselves.
Authorities and rescue personnel could not reach the victims and the
injured.  The concert went on as scheduled, the band were unaware until
almost the end, and it took several hours to get everyone treated.

That was the beginning of the end for most general admission concerts
and hopefully security personnel are more aware of how this phenomenon
can happened and monitor crowds to make sure it does not happen. That’s
how the gates or crowd control barriers in front of doors help.  Crowds
line up at that point and there is space in front of the doors to act as
a safety valve.

=====>  The City of Cincinnati banned festival seating after this, and
also sued The Who as a possible culprit for rehearsing and causing the
panic.  That issue was settled out of court.

Rolling Stone had a very good article many years ago explaining just
what happened on that horrific day.  You might be able to find it on the
Internet in an archive somewhere and the Library of Congress has a copy
of that issue if you ever what to check it out while in Washington.

====>  This is not a flame, but if you got your facts there, they are
incorrect in some of the details.  I am sure there are others in this
list who lived through this enormous tragedy.
