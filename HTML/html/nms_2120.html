Had a busy weekend and was out all day yesterday yelling at routers (which 
still wouldn't do what I wanted them too), so no NMS was sent yesterday.
The rest of this week will be crazy for me (my brother's getting married on
Saturday!) so the digests will be hit & miss.

I've updated the horizons song, the radio station list and the release
party. I've also added to the radio list if the station will be playing
the album premiere on November 4th. If they aren't playing the new stuff on
your radio station, start bugging 'em!

Oh yeah, if you're in San Diego get your rear to the Tragically Hip show
tonight down at 4th & B, tix only $15!!

As a canuck (sadly with no connections to "the powers that be")  I would
gladly nominate the Rush Mgr as an "honorary Canadian". Certainly Dual
citizenship should be bestowed.  After all, not only does she honour the
Great White North threesome (GWNT ... trade mark reg),  but the NMS web site
>... under the "Broaden your Horizons " section,  has also suggested such
other great Canadian bands as  Our Lady Peace, and the Tragically Hip.  I
have also seen mention of I Mother Earth.  Way to go Rush Mgr. 

   [ Don't worry, IME will be showing up there too! I was trying to spread
     the Canadian bands out a bit, and not have them all in one week :-)
                                                                : rush-mgr ]

May I also suggest great new Canadian Bands such as Big Wreck, and Econoline
Crush. Both are great. For you old timers there is Kim Mitchell and Max
Webster and Triumph.  There are many more too numerous to mention ... it
depends on your tastes. For example,  the band "Barenaked Ladies" are
extremely  talented ... just not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which, did I
mention The Tea Party ? 

Hey Rush Mgr ... I'd sign your immigration papers.

Hi everyone,

I've been reading the digests, but its been awhile since I've posted.
Does anyone know where I can find the Different Stages single that has
"The Pass" on it? I must have it! Please e-mail me privately. 

Also, our main rock radio station cannot play DS yet. DAMNIT!!!

Later,

To those in the SW-Ontario area, I called FM96 today (the only station 
around London that might play new Rush) and asked the program director 
about the new Rush single.  He told me it wasn't out yet.  (Ha!)  So I 
asked if they'd play it "when it did come out," to which he responded, 
"No, because it's live and we don't play live stuff."  Well that's just 
lame.  So repeat after me:  FM96 sucks canal water!

Different Stages will be world premiered on Canadian radio on Weds,
Nov.4 (not the 9th, like in the U.S) I heard this on 97.7 Htz-FM. It
should also be on Q107 in Toronto, so for anybody who has real audio,
you can pick up Q107 by going to www.Q107.com, and clicking on "Listen
live..". Q107 is also playing SoR on HIGH rotation, and 2112 at least a
few times a day.

Caught TSOR on 935 tonight from DS.  Man, that was just an excellent
kick in the ass!!  I could only feel one thing...like I was standing at
the E Center watching the band.  Honest...it was that intense.   I am so
excited about the new album coming out!!

Call these stations and tell them, .....n ORDER them to paly the hell
out of the new Rush album.  Tell them that you want them to make a VERY
big deal out of this tremendous new Rush release.  

Above all, tell them that you PATRONIZE THIER SPONSORS!!!....and, by
doing so, you want your music to be played.

Angels fear to tread where Rush fools in.

I have heard on 103.5 FM here in Chicago will be premiering most of 
Different Stages on Wednesday, November 4th, sometime in the evening.  I 
have been begging for the stations here to play something other than 
TSOR, but...
I will be listening tomorrow for 2112 and/or Limelight as it is Rush day 
on our other "Rush" station, 97.9.  Since I have to work 9-6, this 
shouldn't be hard!  I wish my roommate still worked at the radio

Art Brown asked about an interpretation on the song "Witch Hunt" - from
whose viewpoint is it told?

Well, I see it from the on-lookers point of view. "The night is black,
without a moon.... The vigilantes gather on......Those who know what's
best for US, must rise and save us from ourselves....etc.etc...." I just
see it as a story that is told by someone who is very wise, but very
saddened by what is taking place (maybe Neil!) - not from someone who is
a direct victim to the atrocity described. I vision someone around a
campfire telling stories of old (thowing in some Hemispheres here). Or
maybe I'm having visions of Sesame Street & Romper Room in my head??!?

Hey, all you boneheads (including the rush-mgr) talking about
tinker-toys has made me feel nostalgic. I'm 33 yrs old and right now I
feel like playing with my Hot Wheels!! (which I still have............

I have a tough time believing it's not symbolic of SOMETHING also, but
probably Hugh had reasons for why he created it this way...and believe
me, I'd love to get into some projection about the cover!  When I first
saw it what occured to me was : what does it *mean*???  But good design
has a certain logic, so regardless of, if it means that Ged and Alex had
tinkertoys when they were growing up while Neil did not (????), or that
drummers are somehow more enlightened that guitar and bass players
(????), Hugh did not place the images on a whim.

Wahhhh, rush-mgr, let us go off on this!  It'll keep us from drooling
while WAITING.  Meow.

Oh, hey, I saw Mickey Hart & Planet Drum on Wednesday.  Pretty good
drummin'.

<A NAME="2120011">Subject: T4E Video</A>

I just picked up a video copy of the Test For Echo concert. The show was
recorded in Toronto on June 30, 1997.  The video is 2 hrs. and 42 min. long on
standard play.  The view is from stage right, approx. 8-10 rows back.  The
quality of the video is very good. The quality of the sound is good, but not
great.  
I was first dissapointed in the beginning with the view, only Alex due to
obstructions, but by the third song, the view is improved and Geddy and Alex
are in good view. Neil is right behind Geddy so he is blocked out for most of
the video (bummer for us drummers).  
There are cameras at the concert for video taping for the official video.
Sometimes that camera boom is in the view.  Overall, the video is pretty good.
The song list is as follows:
2001 open/Dreamline, Limelight, Stick It Out, Driven(the view is much improved
at this point), Half the World, Red Barchetta, Animate, Limbo, The Trees,
Virtuality, Nobody's Hero, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Test for Echo, Freewill,
Red Sector A, Roll the Bones, Resist, Leave My Thing Alone, drum
solo(including Momo's Dance Party), Natural Science, Force 10,Spirit of Radio,
Tom Sawyer (complete with three dancing puppets on the amps!) , and YYZ for
the encore.
E-mail me for details if interested.

Oh baby, chills!

Returning to work from lunch today, I happened to catch the last half of the
song.  Have to say: it rocks.

Couldn't help but air-drum.  Dunno what my co-workers might think seeing my
arms flailing around in a parked car, but who gives a shite.  There's
nothing like playing along with every thunderous tom-fill and ride-pattern.

And to be honest, before hearing the tune today, I was less excited by a
live album than a new studio release.  But my tune has changed!   So to
speak.

Trent Reznor doesn't play the guitar or anything else except keys as far as

Nine Inch Nails (at least in _The Downward Spiral_). Sorry to rock the boat

Anyone else have or heard of the Metallica video "Cliff 'Em All?" I got it

To all the RUSH fans,

I am still a fairly new member to the list.  In fact, I never knew =
anything like this was possible.  I have been a RUSH fanATIC for over 18 =
yrs (I'm 30) now.  I have all their recordings in record, cassette and =
CD.  To me RUSH is more than just a "favorite" group, it's like a =
parallel religion.  Although personal convictions associated with the =
traditional religions aside, RUSH has inspired me throughout my life.  I =
know there are people out there who feel the same (heck, I may be =
preaching to the choir).  I can't explain it, the mysticism is evident =
in every song.  My wife tends to think I go a little overboard with RUSH =
memorabilia, so know it's all confined into my computer room (sort of =
like a sanctuary).  There is something that I would love to share with =
the other members of the list but especially RUSH (that'll never happen) =
is an artwork that I painted in 1988.  It depicts a dream of sorts =
combining the album covers of (Hemispheres, Signals, Grace Under =
Pressure, Moving Pictures and of course Hold Your Fire (their latest =
masterpiece of the time).  It's approximately 2' x 3' and its in my =
hallway.  I wonder if it could be digitally reproduced?  A final note, =
RUSH as mentioned before, has been a part of me for approximately 18 =
yrs.  For instance, "After Image" meant sooooooo much to me when my =
father suddenly passed away in 1991.  I vividly remember playing the =
song continuously throughout the day to help me release some of the =
emotions and cry.  I found much comfort in that.  That is one of the =
hundreds of instances in my life which RUSH has been a key player.  If =
there are others like me that find similar comfort (not just liking or =
loving the group) you can contact me off line to share similar stories =
(musi@surf.net.tr) . =20

For now, I am happy to have found an outlet to share similar thoughts =
regarding RUSH which I never thought existed. =20

Final note, my condolences to the Peart family.=20

If we need too much attention it gets hard to overrule
So often fragile power turns to scorn and ridicule
Sometimes our big splashes
Are just ripples in the pool...=20

(I hope the lyrics are right it was from my "Archives" in the head)

G'Day Rush Fans!

This is my inaugural posting to TNMS. I have been a Rush fan for many years
now, but only recently found out about this fantastic digest. After getting
a feel for the postings for a while, I thought I'd add my 2c worth.

I say greatings from La Villa Strangiato, because thats exactly what this
"Weird City" is. Picture this -

Rush CD's in music stores - few and far between.
Rush T-shirts - non -existant
Rush Videos - good luck!
Rush posters - yeah nice try
Rush Misc. Merchandise - forget it!!!

Sorry if this sort of scenario would give you nightmares, but I live it!

But I think the worst thing is something that you guys complain a lot about
too. Most TNMS digests have had at least one "The local radio station only
plays TS, TSOR and a couple of other oldies". Wanna know what the local
radio stations say here when I ask them to play some Rush? "Rush? Who are
they?" Hrmmpph.

So if you think your city's radio stations are giving you a raw Rush
deal.....ha! Try living here!

Anyway...now that I've had my little whinge, I'd better say that living here
in Perth, Australia isn't so bad (appart from that fact that the chances of
Rush  ever playing here is ZERO).

While I'm at it, this is also a Test For Echo for other Aussie Rush fans. I
have only noticed one other Aussie post of late (G'Day Billy Oz). 

For rest of you wanting to expand your HORIZONS down here, I thought I'd
recommend a couple of Aussie bands that you might like to check out.
Hoodoo Gurus - My fav Aussie band (and 2nd overall to Rush). Check out their
best of album "Electric Soup"
Spy vs Spy - A band that is very underrated here..great sound and lyrics.
Best of album is "The Spy File"

Enough babbling from this Aussie for one posting. Looking forward to DS in
November. I probably wont be able to get my hands on a copy until a little
while after the US release date, so if you wouldn't mind, please don't post
any reviews or analysis of DS until after I have a copy. (Oh look out the
window....a flying pig ;-) ) 

Cheers. BlueBro.

    You know, I kind of must say something about it. I'm a Rush fan and
I don't consider myself a weirdo like that guy stated one of these days
here. Maybe some of the readers out there would consider me a weirdo guy
just becouse I'm writing from Brazil but I really can't help them...
    Anyway, I live in a middletown here and I know some Rush fans, so I
can tell you: at least around here, the Rush fans are not as weird as
that guy said all Rush fans are.Of course, all the Rush fans care a
little more about how good the musicians are playing; all Rush fans have
a little more interest in lyrics that means something else than the "I
love you" stuff and I sure think that the Rush fans have a different
point of view about the world becouse the band that we love is different
and we get something from it.
    But I still don't think that, If I'm a weirdo in some aspect of my
life, It's becouse of my fave band.See you later. Bye!
PS: My other favourite bands:

   * Beatles
   * R.E.M
   * Yes

PS2: If someone out there could really have any idea about it, please
tell me why Rush never toured in
South America, I would really like to know. I don't know If some of you
already know that but Brazil already is a place to tour for most of the
bands out there. Right here in Brazil I went to concerts from U2,
Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Jethro Tull, Deep Purple, Yes,
AC/DC,etc... Eric Clapton played here , Jeff Beck is playing here this
month, Van Halen played here in 1983, Metallica plays here since 1989. I
know that our country is a little bit far and the cost of the production
is a little bit high, but they must know about the number of fans they
have here, so I keep asking myself why they don't came here to play at
least a couple of shows for us.Thank you all. Bye!
PS3: I know that listening "Different Stages" for the first time - in 24
days or something like that - will be one of the most awesome
experiences of my life. I'm trying to prepare myself for that although
it's helpless...

WARNING!!!!!  Rather lengthy post ahead!

Hey Rush Fans,
	I'm jumping on the bandwagon that was started by David Ayres, and
seconded by Chris Dodd.  IT IS interesting to hear what other Rush fans
are listening to.  Already I have heard a couple of names that have
raised my eyebrows, making think I have to go give them a listen.  Saga
and Talk Talk are the two I am talking about.  Remember those two from
the early MTV days.  I'm talking about the JJ Jackson/Martha Quinn days.
	Here is my Top 10.  Rush is not ranked, they are in a class of their
own, so to speak:

1.Yes - wonderful, beautiful music
2.Pink Floyd
3.Joe Satriani - one of the few rock guitarist better than Alex IMHO
4.King's X
5.Genesis - all of it, from early Gabriel to later Phil Collins
6.Dream Theatre
7.Sarah MacLachlan - wonderful voice, wonderful songwriter
8.Emerson, Lake, and Palmer
9.Nine Inch Nails - love Reznor's power of emotion
10.Duncan Sheik - Rupert Hine has produced both of his albums

Honorable Mention: Our Lady Peace, Shawn Colvin, Suzanne Vega, Chantal
Kreviazuk, October Project, Soulhat, Queensryche, Extreme, Natalie
Imbruglia, Tragically Hip, Collective Soul, Dick Siegel, and the Dave
Matthews Band.

As for my other love Jazz:
The Rippingtons, Fourplay, Rick Braun (trumpet), Boney James (sax),
Peter White (guitar), Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Nicholas Payton
(trumpet), 3rd Force (new age - jazz), Pat Metheny (guitar), Jeff Berlin
(bass), Victor Wooten (bass), Earthworks (Bill Bruford), Weather Report
(Jaco Pastorius), and Return to Forever (Al DiMeola and Stanley Clarke).

I have one other question: Will the real release date please stand up?!

I know that release dates are subject to change, but this is
ridiculous.  It seems like all the press releases people post here agree
don't with each other.  I have asked my local record shops (still call
them that, old habits never die), but they don't have any info on DS
yet.  Are we to believe Atlantic Records (Nov. 10), or are we going to
have to go on call for two weeks?  Just wondering, because I remember
Presto showing up in stores two weeks early here in Detroit (if my
memory is correct).  If anybody can shed a little light on this, I, and
probably others, would appreciate it.

Take care.

Considering all this recent talk of the Different Stages tinker toy
art, it seems like a good time to bring up a subject related to Rush's
album designs. In particular, what was the significance of the girl on
the cover of Permanent Waves? I had the PeW cover art installed as
wallpaper on my computer (thanks Hanstones, visit his Syrinx
Award-winning page at http://www.2112/net/powerwindows) but
unfortunately my wife caught a glimpse of it. Of course I got an earful
and had to change to the Hold Your Fire art. This was a bit embarassing
of course, but it did get me wondering what Hugh was really up to when
he put together this (ahem) interesting cover.
	Hugh ought to put together a book of all his Rush-related art, sort of
like what Storm Thorgerson did with Mind Over Matter: The Images of Pink
Floyd. Such a book would contain all the designs that Hugh created,
along with preliminary sketches, alternate designs, tourbook graphics,
etc. Hugh could write up liner notes and present it as a coffee-table
book like Storm did. Perhaps it could be included as part of a future
Rush CD-ROM or DVD project. If anyone who knows Hugh is reading this,
ask him what he thinks.

<A NAME="2120023">Subject: TSOR - Live</A>

Ok Folks,

I want to offer a different opinion of the "Different Stages" version of
TSOR.  I AM DISAPPOINTED !!  The drums sound way too fast, Alex isn't
hitting all the notes on the appregio chorus and it just lacks the
overall power of the original.  Hell, even the Exit Stage Left version
of TSOR sounds better, and that one stinks too.  

I will be getting the CD just like everyone else out there, but I just
wanted to give you an honest opinion of that particular song.  I am a
bit peeved that Time and Motion didn't make it to the CD as well.  I was 
not fortunate enough to see it performed live. That is one of the best
Rush songs released in a long time.  It has that Hemispheres feel to it.

If anyone sincerely feels that alot of effort went into this Live CD, I
have to believe that you are sadly mistaken. I agree that mixing a live
album and putting it together can be a tedious process, but come on...I
could have picked a better version of TSOR to put on the CD.  

I hope the rest of the CD doesn't let me down.  I am not a big fan of
live albums. If Rush's live albums had anything to offer besides the way
they are presented in studio, then I would be happier.  I have some old
bootleg stuff that catches some unique changes and moments in the songs.
Those are priceless.

Alex's extended solo on Bravado is awesome.  I hope that is included on
this CD.  I know this post has been a bit harsh, but there are plenty of
you out there saying " Yeah ! He's right ...".  You know who you are.

I am definitely looking forward to Alex's new CD and Rush's new stuff
in....*Gulp* Y2K.

See ya

Fellow DS owners-in-waiting:
In spite of the tradition of Bay Area radio (i.e., no stations worth a damn
play any Rush at all, except for the occasional song on KSJO), I was wondering
if anyone has any plans to have a DS listening party anywhere in the Bay Area
on the 9th. (Don't get me started----the lack of Rush on the airwaves here is
pretty shameful).
Also, rush-mgr., do you (or anyone else, for that matter) know of any plans

party?

Hello all...

It is my pleasure to have been reading the NMS for several years on and
off, and I share your enthusiasm for the upcoming live album!! Oh, how I
CANNOT wait!! 

Cover versions of Rush: I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but
there is an absolutely hilarious cover of Fly By Night done by a group
called Sun City Girls. For those not familiar, SCG have been around close
to twenty years and have released innumerable tapes and vinyl. The style of
their latest releases is very much in an eastern vein, incorporating many
Indian and Asian influences. The FBN cover is on album that contains only
cover versions. Anyone else heard this?? It is quite obscure.
While perusing the latest issue of BW&BK here in Edmonton, I came across
this little tidbit:
"The forthcoming Greg Howe CD features Vitalij Kuprij on keyboards and
carries on in the neoclassical vein of Vitalij's debut solo effort which of
course was produced by and featured Howe. The record also features a
version of Rush's La Villa Strangiato".
I have never heard of either of these two fellows, anyone know what to
expect from this?

	Best wishes to all,

Hey kids!

An active, observant mind caused David Ayers to write:

"As I sit here reading the TNMS with David Letterman in the background,
it occurs to me that in 15 years of watching the gap-toothed one on late
night TV, I have never heard Paul "I'm always happy to mention that I'm
a Canadian" Schaeffer and his band play Rush.  Not even once!!  Has
anyone ever heard them play or even MENTION Rush??  Was he kicked out of
Canada for refusing to play Rush??"

I've never wondered why Rolling Stone magazine doesn't feature Rush, BECAUSE
ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE SUCKS!!!!!!!...ahem... but Letterman on the other
hand has been relatively open about trying out new bands or bands that
aren't household names. I don't know why Dave and Paul have never had Rush
on, but it's probably too late for that anyway. However, with Alex coming
out with a new album next year maybe there's a chance Alex might try to
promote a little harder next time and-... O'course it could be that Paul is
a jerk and Rush just won't work with him. Hmmm...

In other news... I don't usually engage in the wild speculation that
sometimes speckles the NMS, but about the alleged chances of another album
and Neil not writing lyrics and all; here's a thought: Pye Dubois. I'd buy
an album with him behind the pen! Why not?

Does the Japanese version of DS have an additional song or does that song (I

suspect it's additional, so they didn't "fill" up the CD?

Is it possible to change the key of 2112, in the studio, to be "right"?

Is it just me, or will it be sort of funny if NASA blows up John Glenn?

Maybe some of you who listen to alternative radio stations have heard the
new song by DIAL-7 called "All I want"... if not it is on an album called
NEVER ENOUGH TIME on Warner Bros. records, that album comes out THIS
TUESDAY OCT 20th...

Why am I telling you this?  If you pay attention to the music in the
chorus (ignore the vocals if you can) you may hear something out of
TEMPLES OF SYRINX. I noticed about 6 months or so ago when I was hanging
out in the studio when they were adding some tracks to an earlier version
of the song, and there were no vocals in the mix at the time, I started
singing temples of syrinx along with it, and the engineer (a drummer of
course) jumped in and started singing along. The guys in DIAL-7 dont
listen to rush, so it was a cooincidence (there are only so many ways you
can arrange chords in a progression). So dont take it as a copyright
infringement, as it is not even exactly the same, it just reminded me of
it.

DIAL-7 is a kicken GROOVECORE band, with an intersting mix, I recomend
checking them out. (PIMP ROCK)

I also recomend Zebrahead, for those of you who like PIMP ROCK!

(yes this is a refresher of my OC CALI PIMPROCK IN THE HOUSE post a few
weeks ago!)

PIMP ROCK = bands who mix hip hop and rap and funk with some sort of
rock, ie. Rage Against The Machine, 311, KoRn, Limp Bizkit etc..., except
DIAL-7 is groovier, and Zebrahead is poppier, ala Offspring meets pimp
rock

Hey Rushheads,

This is in reply to Tracy Smith who says there is no rush on the radio in
Southern Cal.  It's the same in New York City.  The radio here stinks.  Most
of it is top forty.  And if you can believe this, the top radio station
overall here is a spanish station playing salsa and merengue.  I can count
on one hand the number of times i have heard Rush on the radio in NYC in the
last few years.  Maybe it's a big city thing, but I think that smaller,
local radio stations play Rush a whole lot more than big city stations.

We have three rock stations in NYC: 92.3 K-Rock, which, by the way, is
Howard Stern's flagship station.  They play alternative rock mostly.  Then
there is 102.7 WNEW, which has been in NY for over 20 years.  They are the
best station because they mix classic rock and new stuff.  They are also the
only ones who play Rush.  Finally there is 104.3 Classic Q.  This station is
only classic rock and they suck!  I swear they play Peter Frampton once
every two hours.  What's that song, "Show me the way?"  They play it over
and over.  

Sorry to bitch so much but in order to hear any Rush at all, I have to pop
in a tape or CD.

Peace,
Max
