Does anyone know where I could obtain a copy of this?  Now that I have a

<A NAME="1053001">Subject:  Between Sun and Moon</A>

 Hello to all!

 Someone a short while ago asked something about the meaning of the song
 Between Sun and Moon.  Well, I thought I'd go home and have a look at the
 video of the Kumbaya concert from this fall here in Toronto.  For those
 of you who don't know, Kumbaya was an AIDS benefit concert featuring a
 whole jamboree of artists, including Alex Lifeson.  Anyway, Pye Dubois
 also happened to be there, and what he did was read the poem that he
 submitted to Rush which was to become Between Sun and Moon.  Here is an
 unofficial transcript of it.  There were a couple of lines where I wasn't
 sure what he said and they are marked with a "*".

 There is a lake between sun and moon
 Not too many know about
 Some go there for their high noon
 Some go there for their midnight moon
 It is a moment between silence and shout
 Maybe you, might as well me
 Why the sun, why the sun

 Say yes say yes ahh say yes to self-esteem

 We want to escape because we don't want to fall in
 The signs are clear and so is the fear
 We do not trust the firmness of the ground

 Then say yes say yes ahh say yes to self-esteem

 There is a fine place between actor and audience
 This is the fine line
 The fine line of living
 This moment experienced  *This spin deliverance*
 Do what you want to do in no ordinary way
 Say what you need to say in no ordinary way
 And sing what must be sung in no ordinary way

 Say yes ahh please, please say yes to self esteem

 Some go there for their high noon
 Some go there fo their midnight moon

 It is the moment between silent and shout
 This is a fine place
 *Faces* face to face
 These bonfire eyes
 In the lake of the sky
 It is our light to land and leave
 Never so dark to unravel the weave
 Never give up and never say die

 Do what you need to do in no ordinary way
 Say what you need to say in no ordinary way
 And sing what must be sung in no ordinary way

                                        -Pye Dubois

 Well hearing this and reading the final lyrics to the song, I *think*
 it's got something to do with finding a place within yourself where you
 can think and feel and be human, hence, from the song--"This is a fine
 place/To hesitate" and "We just need a break-/From the headlong race".
 Also, since Pye was reading this at an AIDS benefit concert, it may also
 be a song of hope.  Anyways, that's my interpretation.  Feel free to
 comment.  Ya'll post now, ya hear? >

First of all, I can take a pretty good guess and say that you are not really
a Rush fan, since no Rush fan would call their collectibles "shit".
Secondly, there are posts on the last NMS about rumors. Have you thrown your
priceless Rush articles away yet? If not, can I have them? Thirdly, I
believe the proper noun "Christ" should be capitalized. Yes, this IS a

Ron Bratis asked if I have definite knowledge as to who plays what on
Rivendell. I have no other info on the instrumentation other than what
the liner notes say, but since I hear very little classical guitar on the
rest of the album (I'm trying to remember if there's anything at all
besides Rivendell), I just always assumed that Rivendell was indeed the
guitar work in question. So, I guess I'm saying all that to say your
guess is at least as good as mine, and if someone out there knows for
sure that I'm wrong, don't flame me for weeks (like we did to that dude
who posted about "Madrigal"... poor guy).

Someone in the last issue or two asked about anyone hearing the KBFH show
broadcast during the week of Jan9-15th, well I didn't hear it on the radio,
but I have it! It pays to know people in the biz, eh?!!

It's really great! The P/g video stuff is pretty yucky though as there is a
whole lot of crowd noise in the audio. Still a great disc to have and better
than a boot of the famed P/g video show.

	I keep noticing every now and then people continuing to comment
on how great their local radio is, or how bad it sucks (heh-heh,mmmm,Heh-ehe)
in terms of the amount of Rush played.  This is just sort of a proposal
to help those who plan on travelling away from their home "invisible
airwaves" and want the best opportunity to hear some local Rush tastes.

	The table could be kept in the spirit of the radio ;) by stating
whether the station you are refering to is Rush-philic (Rush loving) or
Rush-phobic (Rush-hating).  That way if we are driving through your town
we know where and where not to tune in!

CITY		Station/Frequency	Rush-Rating
Syracuse, NY	WAQX  95.7fm		Rush-phobic
Syracuse, NY	KROC  100.9fm		Rush-philic
Utica, NY	WOUR  96.9fm		Depends (i.e. on DJ etc.)

	This is sort of an example of the type of layout the COULD have.
If anyone has any contributions of your city, or suggestions about the
layout, please drop a line.

Date: Tue, 31 Jan 95 8:27:01 PST

Hi,

Someone asked about the bass part on the studio version of In the End.

The low-tuning effect was created by slowing down the tape speed in the
studio, and not by tuning the guitars & bass down.  Also, since an
upright bass is the same tonically as an electric bass (assuming normal
tuning), why would you think an upright bass is what Geddy used for
this effect?

Not to be overly picky (yeah, right! ;)), but Ged's early studio setup
consisted of a Rick 4001 and Ampeg/Sunn equipment, used with the
stereo "Rick-o-sound"pickup wiring, and not Fender heads.

Geddily yours,

nickb

I haven't seen the picture that Shahid Murtuza speaks about, but it is
probably a Micro-Monitor that Geddy has in his ear.  It is used instead of
a foldback monitor, to reduce the amount of on stage noise.  The foldbacks
that are on stage are just for backup.

But it was in my car when the car got nicked, so I have had to re-do it.

The store "record Converance"  (sp) in Fairfax City, behind Best and sort of
hidden used to carry some Rush material.  There are a few other stores of the
same type in Fairfax City, and in Vienna off of route 123.  The places don't
always have RUSH material...but when they do it is usually pretty good.

	Here's a great seat story....some of you may remember my post on it
last year.
	I went to the April 2nd, 1994 Madison, Wisconson show knowing I had
shitty seats.  (Anything beyond 10th row floor is shitty to me)  Then out
of the blue this lady by me announces she has front row seats for sale.
Talk about being at the right place at the right time!!!!  I sold my other
seat and scooped up the prized ticket.  (also chipped in for another NMSer
so she could share in the glory....ironic that she idolizes Ged and our
seats were right in front of his keyboards)
	I wish that this experience could happen to all Rush fans.  (Unless
your a lucky bastard who happen to win front row seats....I did for Steve
Perry)  April 2nd, 1994 has so far been greatest day of my 21 and a half
years on Earth.
	Too bad festival seating went out of style.  I still have a few
local venues that still use that form of seating.  You can ALWAYS get front
row if you show up to the place early.  The bruises you get on your chest
hurt though! (From the crush up against the barrier)

	I believe that black thing in Ged's ear is an earphone that
operates as his monitor on stage.  He uses it so hear can walk all over the
stage and still be able to hear himself play his bass.  The old monitors
are still on stage, but are not even on.  They are used as a backup in case
the wireless one craps out.

Hello again,

I've been reading the comments about the group Barenaked Ladies. I found out
about them through MuchMusic, and have both Gordon and Maybe You Should Drive.
They're both great albums. I noticed that in the _liner_  notes (Is that
better?) of _Maybe_ that they do thank Rush. Just thought that everyone out
there in Readerland would want to know.

Something I've been wondering about: In the middle of "You Bet Your Life"
what does all that mean?  The "hindu muslem catholic creation evolutionist"
and such. I've looked it the FAQ and it's not in there. If anyone has an
answer, opinion, or a source where I can find the information e-mail me
directly. Thanks.

Hey everyone!!

   I read the post about the RUSH cover band Power Windows and the informal
review of them.  I have never seen then, but I have heard they are pretty
good.

   They are playing in NYC at The Rock-N-Roll Cafe on Bleeker Street in the

11:00 PM. (I love runon sentences!!)  The club's phone number is: (212) 677-

I don't have any of the things you're looking for, but I do have a spare CP
turtoise & hare shirt (black XL never been worn), and a spare CP tourbook,
if you (or anyother NMSer for that matter) are interested. Email me personally.
I've been trying to trade these items on the Freaks Marillion mailing list
to no avail, so maybe I'll try here. Does anyone have a Power Windows tourbook
that they would like to trade?

Shahid Murtuza was wondering as to what the devices in Geddy's ears (as seen in
the CP tourbook) were. Well they are wireless earphone monitors. Geddy is not
hearing a click-track but rather his own special monitor mix.  This type of
monitoring system has become rather popular in recent years and has such big
name practioners as Phil Collins and Shithead O'Conner.  These monitors are a
boon for singers as they are able to hear themselves much easier and thus sing
with greater ease and success.  Geddy and Alex both use these systems although
they also have traditional wedge monitor systems installed, in the event that
the ear monitors die.  Lerxst and Dirk have been using the systems since the
RTB tour and one neat little feature of the monitors is that their roadies can
speak to them over walkie-talkies through the ear monitors! Pretty cool!

If any of this is wrong, please correct me and then promptly piss off!!

I was in HMV on Yonge Street in Toronto yesterday.  I asked them if they
had a listing for a new Rush disc.  They told me they had nothing, not
even anything tentative.

However, if anyone is interested, on a completely unrelated subject,
apart from the fact they are also a great Canadian band, Sven Gali is due
to release their second album on March 31.  It is called "In Wire".  I
saw them in December performing some of the new material.  It is quite
different from the first disc.  It seems to be somewhat like Red Hot
Chili Peppers, although others have said a mix of Pink Floyd and NIN.  (I
really can't hear it though.)  They have a new drummer, and some really
rocing songs.  The guys in the band seem to have a lot of fun making this
one.

Till then

Chris

<A NAME="1053020">Subject: Lierary references: rush lyrics</A>

As is well known, Peart alludes to many literary works in his lyrics.  I
know that a lot of these were pointed out in the FAQ's and by other
people.  I am going to _try_ to point out some other things.  What I
discovered was that there is a book by John Dos Passos called _USA_, and
the first chapter is "The Camera Eye."  It is a technique of writing invented
by Dos Passos to describe surroundings as they would be through the lens of a
camera.  Two more books that he wrote are entitled _The Big Money_ and
_the Grand Design_.  Coincidence?

There's also the peculiar refernces to "the elder race" in 2112.  I
discovered this also in H. P. Lovecraft's writings.  He, in turn, alludes
to an occult book called _The Necronomicon_.  2112 contains a lot more than
the whole Ayn Rand thing.  I'll have to say I was disapointed when I found
the lyric "if you choose not to decide..." was paraphrased some fifty
years earlier by Sartre.  Oh, well.  It's still a great line!

Of course then there are the numerous mythological references in
_Hemispheres_.  I won't get into that here, unless someone would like to
open a discussion.  That's the great thing about Rush- you can always
discuss their music or there lyrics.  Doing that with a band like The
Rolling Stones would seem ridiculous (not to belittle the Stones).

I apologize if I said something that was already said.  Give me a break,
I'm new.

  Hopefully this puts the discussion to rest.  Mr. Stothard is exactly right,
  I've read the same article and the synopsis that Geddy said was, "We(Rush)
  are all correct - but not all the time and that is one element for us
  staying together all these years".
  Another article found some years ago attribute Rush's long endurance by
  being a trio.  Tough decisions made are by vote, no splitting.

  Again, those were not the exact words written.

I've been reading TNMS for over a year now. I have enjoyed the opportunity
to hear others' viewpoints and be kept up to date with the latest Rush
info. I'm curious, though, after reading some of the posts from some of
the admitted older Rush fans, to the makeup of the readership of this
list. (I figure I'm probably one of the older readers too.) Has anyone
ever done a survey of the subscribers? I remember having to provide some
info to the rush-mgr in the beginning when I subscribed, but don't remember
what it contained. Is the information available? Would anyone else be
interested in profiles of other Rush fans? I wouldn't mind helping out in
such a survey if it hasn't been done.

   [ All I ask for is your real name when you subscribe, mainly to keep 
     track of you in case later you ask to be unsubscribed, but don't 
     remember what address you signed up under!                   : rush-mgr ]

Hey all,
  Just read someone post and "counterpost" regarding the AFTK cover. This is
what is written in the "Bible"...I mean "Visions" by the B-man...
  "The buildings in the backround of the cover to 'A Farewell to Kings" are
in Toronto. For years Rush fans have tried to figure out where in the city
the picture was taken from. The foreground  of the cover is a seperate
photograph shot at a demolished warehouse in Buffalo, NY. That picture was
matted with a photo of the Toronto skyline. One of those most perplexed about
the cover is non other than Rush's road manager Howard Ungerleider who lives
in one of those buildings!" -- page 35.
  As for the "tower" in the picture, I see a lot of those around Buffalo rail
yards. They are very tall light poles, but not AS tall as the CN tower!

I just picked up an incredible boot called Storm in St. Petersburg.  Though 
i'm not new to Rush, I enjoy the live and rare (including bootleg) items as 
much as the studio music.  If anyone out there knows of any retailers or 
individuals that sell this kind of material, I would be most grateful.  I did 
find an import store that sells rare imports and bootlegs, but he says the 
Rush stuff is hard to come by and there isn't too much demand for him to try 
to stock the material.

After explaining to him that he would have demand if he stocked the items, he 
told me he would look into it. (yeah right).

Hi all!
I am not back on this list yet, apparently due to

However I made a serious mistake in DA and had put it in
before I realized, so do not take dblagnt.btab, take
dblagnt.btab2. It is the correct one (or, at least,
closer to being correct).

Whoever is able to take things out I hope they'll get
rid of it before it does any damage :^). It's prolly

be a while...

<A NAME="1053031">Subject:      Between Sun & Moon</A>

Here is one thing I recall about the meaning of "Between Sun & Moon".

In the Counterparts CD release radio special, Neil was talking about working
with Pye Dubois on this song.  He said that as in the past, Dubois sent him
a poem and he modified it to fit a Rush song.

But, (here's the important part) Neil said something to the effect of, "Pye's
lyrics are often cryptic and even I don't completely understand them."

Please understand that I am paraphrasing what Neil said because it is late at
night and I don't feel like searching through my cassette tape to find the
exact quote.

The point is that Neil probably doesn't completely understand the meaning of
the song himself, and thus it is open to everyone's interpretations.

It likely is his disc is the audio is buggered. I've got the same CDV and it's 
starting to rot. The 'snow' in the picture isn't *that* bad yet, but it's 
obvious. My audio is perfect as well.

Another thing to indicate that if the audio is going bad, the disc 
is at fault is the fact that the same audio *isn't* used for the video and 
audio-only portions. You'll notice that the video is an edit version and is 
shorter than the audio only track on the same disc. Besides, the video 
information is analogue while the audio (both) is digital.

Hi All,
	Hey, what's the age breakpoint for being a dinosaur?
I'm 30, but I don't fell extinct yet (but I do have 2 kids!).
My first Rush song was The Trees, put on a tape for me by a
friend, but my first real Rush experience was hearing a
preview of Moving Pictures on The Friday Rock Show (UK).
I must also add that I wasn't that keen on Red Barchetta,
as it jarred with my sense of melody (The bit just after
the first verse). I got to like it though!!

To change the subject, someone on here was talking about
Alex being a Master of Harmonics, especially "pinch harmonics".
Can someone tell me if these are the harmonics A la Red Barchetta,
or the sort that tend to be in solos, which are more like squeals,
where you catch the string with both finger & plectrum.
I do play guitar, but i'm not up on the terminology.

Thanks

Date: Wed, 1 Feb 1995 10:58:42 +0000 (GMT)

A big hello to all NMS'ers out there!.

A couple of things . . .

In NMS #1052, Shahid Murtuza <smurtuza@chem.psu.edu> asked:

>  While paging through the Counterparts tourbook, I noticed (as I'm sure
>many have), that in the concert photos, Ged is wearing something in his ear.

I must say that I haven't seen the Counterparts tourbook (as Rush didn't
tour the UK then) so I can't say for certain but I distinctly remeber that
in an interview in a UK magazine called 'Guitarist' just before the Uk RTB
tour (first half of '92) Geddy e xplained that he uses a 'micro monitor'
system which consists of a small earplug, he said that he also uses
standard monitors as well. So I assume that's what you saw in the CP
tourbook. I would quote the exact 'Guitarist' issue but I don't have it
with m e at the moment. It's also well documented that Neil uses earphones
to sync with click tracks when playing things like 'Red Sector A' live.
I
realise I could be completely wrong so forgive me if I am! (my first
posting ever!)

Also I'd love to hear from any NMS subscribers in the UK (or
indeed anywhere), I have a number of friends who are avid Rush fans but it
would be great to swap stories/info etc anyway.

I thought that I should also mention details of a bootleg that I found:

Whilst on an educational trip from University to Strasbourg (France) and
then Stuttgart (Germany) last February I came across a 'Live' CD called
'RUSH HOUR' 'Greatest Hits Live'. The cover features a polar bear on an
iceberg (?). I found this in a German Audio/visual shop called 'LERCHE',
inside the CD itself is 4 colour screen-printed with the same polar bear
image. The booklet features a short history of the band (auf deustsch!).
Unfortunatley I don't have the CD here so I can't give the track listing,
but I remember that it features recordings of stuff from Roll The Bones as
well as older albums, unfortunately no drum solo but it does include 'The
Pass' - a personal favourite. It's definatley a bootleg as my brother rang
Atlantic UK and they had no knowledge of it.

If anyone specifically wants more details then e-mail me and I will
endeavour to get the track listing etc - I also want to translate the band
story when I get time, I'm finishing my BA (Hons) Industrial Design degree
so I don't have any spare time now but I will after June.
