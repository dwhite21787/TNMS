Fellow Rushians,
   I just finished reading Mike's (cubsfan) results for his poll on favorite
Rush albums and songs, and I think it's a good idea to take such polls.  It's
interesting to see the different things people like about Rush (I, of course,
as many of you, like EVERYTHING about them...they're just the perfect band.)
Anyway, I am now conducting a poll of my own.  I would like to know the other
types of bands that Rush fans (Rushians) like and listen to.  So if you want
to take part in this poll I would like to know your top 3 favorite bands (or
singers...can be any type of music).  For instance, my vote is:

   1) Rush (duh!)
   2) Led Zeppelin
   3) Metallica

So act now!  'Rush' your vote to "delbusso@vms.pitt.cis.edu".  Thanx.

	For those of you who are pi--ed and dismissed about getting bad
seats for a show, don't give up hope--Roll the Bones!

	At the Knickerbocker Arena show for the Presto tour, a friend of
mine and his friend got what he called "Uecker seats". They were
sort of behind much of the stage and in the upper level. Well, some lady
came up to them before the show started while they were sitting there
complaining about their seats and offered them tickets. She said she
couldn't stay for the show and thought they were ripped off as far as
seating was concerned. Out of her kindness, she gave them her tickets for
free and then darted off without another word. My friend looked down at the
tickets and noticed that they were---
		---FOURTH ROW---!!!!!!!!!
	My buddy got to rock in the fourth row just out of pure dumb luck.
Neil is truly right.   Fate is just the weight of circumstances.

By the way, Dave mentioned something about Geddy having had a nose job. I never
heard or read this before. It still looks the same to me.
What's the scoop??

it might be difficult for some people to ask for one if my email

in case you missed the email address and want to be sent the RTB

Hi out there!

First of all, as far as the dice on the RTB cover go, I think
it could be interpreted as order degenerating to randomness,
as it usually does....sorry, I'm taking thermo right now!
I usually don't get into cover interpretation discussions,
but I thought that whether it meant anything or not, it was
at least a plausible explanation.

With the "People" magazine review, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? That
magazine is a rag, and rags are only good if you own a pet that
can't relieve itself outside.....boy, do my girlfriend's back
issues of Rolling Groan do a nice job in the guinea pig's cage!
So absorbant! So easy to roll up when cleaning!

To the person who set up the VCR to get the RTB video off of
eMpTyV, I did the same thing. Twice! First I set it to tape
for 6 hours from midnight to 6 am. Nothing. In fact I saw
the VH video 3 times, the John Mellon-head video 4 times, and
"Black or White" twice. Yech!

Then, I set it to tape for 6 hours on a Friday from 11 am to 4 pm.
Again, I saw VH and John Mellon-balls umpteen times, Michael
Jackson, Paula Abdul, and I am SO down wit O.P.P. I can rap it
in MY SLEEP! The only bright stars were Ozzy's new video and
Metallica.....MTV's garbage to music ratio definitely approachs
infinity exponentially!

I'm just gonna have to kill someone at MTV if they don't play
the F*&%ing video for me.......

Hello everyone. Just thought I'd tell you that I heard that tickets

haven't seen this in print yet, but I've heard it from a couple of
people. The opener, by the way, is PRIMUS! Primus will be touring
with Rush on the West coast leg of the tour. Talk about an excellent
show! I would have liked to have seen Eric Johnson, but I'll settle
for seeing my favorite band from San Francisco open for Rush
instead. :)

  2112 is taken from the book "Anthem" by Ayn Rand.  I was wondering
if there were any other songs by Rush that are from books.  If so,
I definately want to check them out!

<A NAME="382311">From: mrinne@daredevil.cs.hut.fi!</A>

I am one of the poor unfortunate people, who have never managed to see Rush
live. At the time of the ASOH tour I was busy graduating and during the
Presto tour the Finnish army kept me tied up pretty well. Now I'm DEFINITELY
NOT going to miss this tour.

As the European dates seem to be finally surfacing, this should be the time
for quick decisions. I was originally thinking of The GB (Birmingham or Lon-
don), since I've never been to England before. Anyone have a clue? I just
can't believe they'd entirely skip their English following, so something
should happen just about now. Also, if tickets become available, would any
considerate fellow Rush-fan out there care to help a few foreigners to get
decent seats? Trying to get decent tickets with international long-distance
calls is just about hopeless.

To Frank Lancaster:
In case England fails, I'd like some info on how to get tickets to one of
the German shows, hopefully in the northern parts (less driving). Which
concert are you going to see? Koeln (K|ln)?  And if they don't have inter-
national service (I'd be surprised), would you care to help out?

One very quick and easy solution would also be to fly to Amsterdam and try
the dutch date. At least I don't believe that one will sell out...

LAST BUT NOT LEAST: Any other Rush-fans besides myself and Kaneli who will
be going? Atthe? If we decide to do Germany by car, a group of four would
probably be optimal. (I know it's a waste of bandwith to post something like
this back and forth across the Atlantic, but it's still the fastest way
to reach everyone...)

And to every person fortunate enough to live somewhere close to their
regular tour route: Rejoice!

A big thanks to the poster who listed the Columbia House CD numbers for Rush. I
just received a copy of the Hemispheres CD and I can't believe how much better
it sounds than my sorry old vinyl LP. Hemispheres is perhaps one of the
greatest albums from the Rush Masterpiece era (by that I mean albums that have
one or more long narrative songs on them). However, my CD cover only has the
picture shown on the front of the LP cover. The picture on the back of the LP
is not shown anywhere. Is this just Columbia House saving money, or are all
Hemispheres CD's manufactured this way. Also, while I'm on Hemispheres, both
Cygnus X-1, and Cygnus X-1 Book II, mention a ship called _Rocinante_ (sp?). Is
this ship out of Greek mythology or something or does the name have some other
meaning.

It's quite plain that this guy has never listened to Rush but for about 5
minutes.  He'd obviously read other reviewer's comments about Geddy's
vocals, so he thought he'd jump on the bandwagon.  While I can see that
some may not *like* Rush, any reviewer that knows anything about music
cannot deny their talent.  Obviously, this guy is just a plain Bozo.

And speaking of shrieking vocals, there's a lot worse out there.  Anybody
heard the lead singer from Cinderella lately?  Although he can sing when he
tries, he can also have the absolute worst voice of anyone I've ever heard.

	Just a few misc. questions about seeing the show when it
hits San Diego.

1) Does anyone know when the tickets go on sale for LA/San Diego
and/or where they're playing?

2) Are there any good places to get tickets I should know about? All
the outlets I have ever been to have been swamped by the time
lottery numbers were handed out. I have yet to get good seats for a
concert.

3) How much are good seats if you buy them from a ticket broker? I
suppose it depends on how good and who you buy them from but is
there a range of prices one can expect? $50? $100?

Please reply via e-mail unless you think other readers would be

For whomever asked what the statements "Brought to you by the letter B," and
"Brought to you by the letter D" meant, here's what I think.  It's my
opinion that they're just references to the childrens' show, "Sesame Street."
If you watched it when you were young, as I did (or maybe you still do :)  ),
then you'll remember at the end they used to say something like "This episode
of Sesame Street has been brought to you by the lettter P and the number 4."
OR maybe that's not what the Boys are referring to, and I'm just trapped in
my childhood !!! Later...3wks til I see Rush!!!!

<A NAME="382017">Subject: 1001001</A>

Maybe I'm just being teased here, but I'll bite and give my explanation.
'1001001' is the ASCII code for the letter 'I'.  This fits with the
theme of an android caught between its machine nature and its self-conscious/
quasi-human nature.  So, the chorus is a plea for help,  'I'm in trouble,
I need help' becomes '1001001 S.O.S....'.   'S.O.S.' is used (in the world
at large I mean) because it is convenient to signal in morse code, another
machine (albiet not computer) code.

As for 1001001 = 73 (decimal) being an important Rush year, as was
suggested by someone else, that's a darn cute trick if Peart planned
both meanings together.

A friend of mine once suggested that 'crack the code' was an anology to
attempts to sequence DNA.

    like this as it is. (I'm half-hoping he'll see fit to flame any callers
    with dumb questions). Too bad he wasn't on last nite, eh Patster? :)
    Wot say we come up with a list of possible questions, in case anybody
    manages to get thru? At least let him know that all the NMS people went
    out and got lives. :) Too bad he wasn't on last nite eh, Patster? :)
    Oh, the bonez in the inner cover of the tourbook spell out REMEMBER DEATH
    in morse code. They didn't make it too hard to decipher! :)

    Oh Tero, I agree that Fish is a 'lyrical genius', but much prefer
    Steve Hogarth myself. The band seems happier with him too.

Look, you've got to understand- some nights they're going to be clowning
around having a great time, and others they're just not going to want to
play.  This is one of the unfortunate results of being human.  I don't
think it's because they're losing it-- you go try to play 60 concerts in
75 days or whatever and tell me you're going to be up for it EVERY night.

Yes! I have actually seen the video twice in the past 12 hours. Yesterday, I
noticed that MTV reran the videos that they played around 1 in the afternoon
yesterday at midnight. Today, I saw the RTB video at 1:30, so maybe they'll
show it around midnight tonight. Just a guess. It was quite painful to sit
through all the drivel that they showed last night just to see RTB, but it was
worth it...and they played the new Metallica video, which I think is _great_!
Anyway, good luck if you're still trying to catch The Boyz on eMpTyV.

What I find amuzing about this review is how inaccurate it is, and how little
the reviewer knows about anything.  I have no problem with the album getting
a bad review.  It happens.  Some people just will not like Rush, or this album.
I can deal with that.  What I have a hard time dealing with is how the reviewer
goes about it.  What Shrieking occurs on the album.  After listening to the
radio all day yesterday, I heard many examples of shrieking/screaming on an
sone... Many of the current HeavyMetal/HardRock/GlamRock (call them what you
will), use this style for vocals.  But Geddy??? Not on the last 3 or 4 albums
at least...  And where is the "thumping" drums???  To me, this is one of the
more underplayed albums as far as drums go.  And, in my opinion, Neil has
seldom gone for the "thumping" drum sound.  Intricate and often prominate,
but not your standard rock drum sound.  If the reviewer wants to criticize
the album, so be it... Let's just hope they get the review correct.  Same
with R.S.  Oh well, such is life...

So there I was, in my dorm room... came back from lunch, a friend
of mine ready to pop a Manfred Mann CD on the player, and then I
turned on MTV in the vague hope that they'd show the video, and lo
and behold, there it was.... This was around 12:24 p.m..  I think
we're starting to see a trend here.

Aside note, to anyone in Peoria... Community Progressive Radio (I
think it's like cable channel 18) is playing "The History of Rush,"
a 2 hour show (the second part) beginning at 11 p.m. Saturday.

One more bit:  At the very, very end of the Minneapolis show, Neil hit the
distinctive 2-beat pickup to Superconductor and when Alex and Geddy were
caught offguard and started looking at him like he'd gone mad (they'd already
played the song about 45 minutes previous), he stood up and waved his arms at
them, shooing them away!  Real humorous.

This happened to me also.  Luckily, I caught it and was able to exchange
mine at the show.  It's copyrighted by Anthem Entertainment, so I would
contact them about a replacement.
Sorry I can't help you more.

**To those who are going to future shows:
If you buy a tourbook, BE SURE to check it _before_ you leave the show.
It's easy to exchange it while you're still there, but after you leave...
Quite a few of the tourbooks seem to have their pages uncut this go around--
so BE SURE to check it.

At the beginning, I couldn't hear Alex's guitar at all.  Funny though,
during "Dreamline" I couldn't hear Geddy's bass!  Of course, R. Colesium
doesn't have the greatest acoustics in the world (they suck).  I haven't
been to another concert there, so I can;t say for sure if it was sound
techs or just the building that was screwed up.

>(Ones that sounded better too).

Did you see the first or the second Cleveland show??  The show I saw, Ged and
Alex moved around quite a bit.  I _think_ Geddy said "Goodnight" at the
end, but I'm not sure; it got lost in the crowd noise.

Neil mentions in the tourbook he uses Pro-mark "Signature" sticks...
Same thing???

I'm sure the picture is a joke of some sort, stuck between the one of
Alex and his pictures and Geddy and his noses.  Screaming??? Laughing???
Maybe he's trying to make the statement that he thinks _Poetics_
is a piece of junk! :-) :-)
