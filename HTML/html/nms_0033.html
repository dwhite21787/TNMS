An example of poetic license:

	"he and she are in the house, but there's only me at home"

Come on, Neil!  Get a life!  He's at home, too, and she's hiding in the chest.

I've notice so far that everyone has been giving their 'Ultimate Band' list,
and that very few people are mentioning Alex Lifeson as one of the Guitar
players?  Why?  Have you all forgotten some of his really kick a$$ solos that
he used to do?

Here's another idea for you.  Does anyone listen to the music of Vangelis?
How about getting him to write music and play keyboards (I believe he does all
the boarding on his stuff).

And now, I'm probably going to get killed, but how about Rick Astley for vocals,
or at least (like New Kids on the Block), he could be the stage performer.  Next
to Rush's light show, he had probably the best stage show I ever saw.  I also
like his voice, I don't know why, I just do.

Well,  'May zombies never eat your brains' (James Monroe, author of parts of
	The Cthulhu Casebook, as quoted on my autographed copy)

Anagram (for Mongo)

Well, having changed positions from plain 'ol Programmer/Analyst to
System Administrator has is advantages and disadvantages.  One disadvantage
is time!  Lately, it's been hell trying to "fit" into this position and
have time to simply read the digest!  Finally, I broke down today and said,
I am going to catch up with all the digest postings!  It was tough, but
I finally got thru them all.  Just a few comments:

Re: Rush "dividing line"
	Maturity is an excellent word as someone mentioned.  I'm not much
	a lyric person but I, personally, have noticed a musical change.
	Not just shorter songs, lower-octave singing, and the obvious but a
	change due to technology improvements.  A good example is not playing
	"With Hunt" till GUP (simply cause it was not possible to reproduce
	it live with the same "exactness" as produced in the studio).
	Notice that The Boyz are utilizing the methods of today's improvements
	in technology more and more?  Both in studio and in the concert hall.
	They are not just a guitar/bass/drums band as I thought they were
	back in the mid-70's.  When I think of bands that have been around
	since the early-70's, most have kept the same sound (Stones, The
	Who, etc).  Not many have taken "full" advantage of modern technology
	like I think Rush has.  Yes, there are the "effect" bands like Floyd,
	etc. but they have always been like this for the most part.  Rush has
	"evolved" with audio technology.  This is all my opinion, of course,
	but this is the major attribute I have noticed since the release of
	"Exit... Stage Left".  Anyone agree?  Just some more thoughts to
	throw in the bin.

Ok, lunch is over ...
Dan...

I heard a tape of a radio interview program called "Up Close" that
had Rush as the guest.  It was produced in New York by Mear Perfect
Productions as an exclusive presentation of MediAmerica Radio.
Producers were Dewitt Nelson, David Bales, and James Fahey, executive
producer was Dan Mear.  At the end where they said all of this, it
was said that the show was distributed on CD.  Does anyone know how
I might obtain this?

Also, I'm having some problems accessing the lyrics server.  Would
anyone volunteer to send me some/all of the Rush lyrics?  :-)
