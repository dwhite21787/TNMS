I would like to cast my vote along with Craig, who said, "I think you should
resend Issue 1 of the NMS. It would be nice to read some of the original posts
and see how different (or similar) they are. And it would make for a nice
'Retrospective' ".

I think that would be a great idea.

I have solved it!  I know why Rush hasn't been as popular since E...SL!!!
It's because there are 13 tracks on that album.  I mean, how could they have
chosen such an unlucky number?!?  DOH!  (Just kidding of course.)

Speaking of E...SL, anyone else notice that little blip at 3:35 of LVS?  It
is even on the remastered version.  What is that?  Did they have to switch
master tapes or something?  It sounds kind of like a bad splice.  This album
still has my vote for best drum sound, though; especially since it is a live
album.  The sound of the snare, hi-hat and bass drums simply rules on this
one.

What was the thinking behind the drum sound on ASoH?  Every other album has
the drums positioned as if you were sitting at the drum throne (fills from
left to right) or standing right in front of Neil (right to left).  On ASoH
the drums and cymbals are all over the place.  He will do a fill that goes
from right to left back to right and then back to the left for the cymbal
finish.  I thought maybe it was because it was in Surround Sound but this is
definitely not the case as a listen on my Pro-Logic receiver proved.  Maybe
it was done as if you were actually playing like they attempted on MP?  Or
my other thought was that he is placed sideways relative to your listening
position so that drums cymbals closest to the crowd are on the left and ones
further back are on the right.  That's got to be it.  It's seems to be
different on each song, though.  Oh, never mind...

<A NAME="2023003">Subject: On stage non-improvisations</A>

Happy hello's and warm salutations to all....
I just thought I'd drop in my 2 cents (3 cents Canadian) on the subject of
the apparent lack of stage spontaneity. I've had the "pleasure" of being in
the music biz since 1986 (hired gun guitar stuff), and have been exposed to
some stuff that the average listener (or concert attendee) rarely ever sees.
    I can understand why there can't be a lot of improv at a Rush concert,
due to the fact of the amount of choreography required between the lighting
guys, the sound guys, and the  band itself. If they did a "off the cuff"
setlist, I really doubt that the show would be anything like the spectacles
that we have all been privy to (I'm not saying that it would be a bad thing,
just not as polished). My perception of Rush as a live band, is that they
are striving to be PERFECT on stage, meaning extremley polished, very tight
and professional. Flying by the seat of your pants onstage, while very
exciting and fun, can possibly lead to DISASTER!!!! For example, maybe Ged
forgets the words in mid-song,or Alex starts into a solo break in the wrong
spot. I would hate to see that happen to them.
OK- I know that some of you may be steaming mad at the thought of "Rush
making a mistake". Please remember, they are human beings and they can make
boo-boos just like all of us.
All in all, I think they should just keep doing it the way they want to, and
for those who don't like it...stop going to multiple concerts. It's that
simple.

chad, for the true fans, please, next time, don't go!  i mean, since 
you're the type of guy who can't be satisfied with those "uninspiring, 
embarrassing, robotic, just plain stupid" stage antics, you really ought

and then you follow up your rush bashing by saying "i love rush & i

supporting them, not blasting them for using the same stage antics.  
yeah, that danny guy laid into cmoney pretty hard, but at least he didn't 
slam the band this list is supposed to support.  your opinion is yours, 
but don't think we don't see you winking and crossing your fingers when

Hi all.  First post here.

Surely "Scars" counts as Disco Rush!!  I'm not a disco (or 80's) fan by any
means, but what a cracking tune!  (Off a _really_ cracking album with a
great atmosphere about it, but not lacking melody in any way)

I'm pleased that someone (on this list) recently pointed out the criminal
underrating of "Presto".  I like "Red Tide" a lot, and also "Available
Light".  In fact, I can't understand why so many here rate "HYF" so highly.
I really think "Presto" is a better constructed album, and more original.
But then, I guess with so much good material over the years, everyone's
going to have their faves!!!

BTW, food for thought:

Why were Rush one of the _very_ few bands who managed to go on producing
good music in the 1980's??  Most 80's stuff is formulaic and dull.

Well, must go, but must first say how great this list is!!  Especially here
in England, it's really not easy to find people who appreciate the genius of
Rush.

        Had to comment on the NMS 2112 issue. I'd also like to see, not so
much skipping the issue, but putting something other than posts up. The main
reason I say that is, I really don't want to see 5 or so issues of posts
like "Did I make it??" or stuff to that effect, just because someone has to
get a post in # 2112. Or really, that the Rush-Mgr would have to go through
and *weed* all those posts out....or get 100 times the normal amount of
posts from people looking to get in the issue.

        As for what to put in the issue, that's a good question. I think
someone mentioned posting a list of NMS subscribers in that issue. Or maybe
post a cool article not previously on NMS. I have an interview with Geddy
about the 20th anniversary of 2112 that might be cool reading for that
issue. Or Neil's letter to the editor grilling the guy about his article :)
Has that been on NMS?

        I guess it's a tough call as to that something special to do for
that particular issue ;)

Here's another idea for TNMS #2112, which is comin' up fast...
everyone submits a "What RUSH means to me" post.  You know,
good and self-indulgent, the kind of thing that would make all
those uninitiated non-Rush-fanatics (poor bastards) sick to their
stomachs, but which the rest of us would truly enjoy.  Just
put "2112" as the subject, and our always diligent [ rush-mgr ]
could save 'em up, to be published in a very special, freakin'
huge edition of The National Midnight Star.  Ya think?  =)

Good call. I think that Neil would shy away from even using the word
"worship" to describe anything he does.

>> Ayn Rand of course (also given credit
>> of sorts in the liner notes of 2112).

Neil (not to mention Alex and Geddy) has mentioned numerous times in
interviews that he no longer thinks of Ayn Rand being much of an influence.

Erik DePoy asked the following:

>        Why couldn't Rush devote a little time each night to improv?

Neil has said before that he thinks improvization during a show is weak
sauce. He was asked if he ever improvizes. As best I can remember the quote
was something like "Those who improvize (during a show) have never
practiced a day in their lives." So, I wouldn't count on it ever happening.

Another thought: a Rush concert featuring a full symphony orchestra

I think the reason that there isn't a Retrospective III is because

Well, they're both in triple meter (12/8 & 6/8) and both make very
effective use of minor6 chords and their inversions. Pretty good
call...which brings us to:

I'd like to start (or maybe resurrect) a thread about the "family tree"
of Rush songs. As an example of what I mean, I see "The Trees" as the
direct descendant of "A Farewell to Kings". I'll bet everyone can see
the obvious musical parallels, but what convinced me before everything
else was the group of chords (mainly) used and the tonal center of the
song (I'd call it an A mixolydian in my personal and bastardized
theoretical parlance). So, the parent of "Kings" is...? The offspring of
"Trees"...?

I think we can make up the rules as we go along, but here are some clues
to types of resemblance:

Musical (endless permutations here)
Lyrical theme or style
Sound texture
Role within an album (i.e. "the ballad", "the rave-up", etc.)

I'm heavily biased in favor of the musician perspective, but I think
that ideas from non-musicians can offer fresh and interesting
perspectives that musicians might miss. So... c'mon, everybody! Anyone
with at least 2 Rush albums can join in on this one.

BTW, I think the rush-mgr (why do they call you The Holy Bitch, and do I
really want to find out? ;>  ) does a pretty good job of presenting a
good variety of Rush fan "types". I agree (although it was unspoken)
that it is the responsibility of contributors to keep criticisms
directed at content and not character.

Heh. Good one. But you know how obscure those cultists like to be, and
openly acknowledging the 2112 influence would have made them Baab (who
probably drives a Saab) :> Also - I'm sure you care :) - it was supposed
to be "MLB" (Major League Baseball).

Wouldn't it be funny if, say, Neil posted to the list? He'd be careful
to conceal (the fact that he's only too real, hehe) the fact of his
identity by not giving away inside information and by occasionally being
somewhat critical of (guess who?).

Funnier still if he actually brought up the aforementioned in his own
post! Who could possibly know? Oh, it gets so convoluted...

Somehow people thought that I paid 650 for front row at Jones Beach. It was
only 400(but I would have paid 650)
Since we are on the subject. I was holding a little sign that said" Can I have
a pic Alex, please?" He said no! At the end of the show, he gave away one to
some grade school age kid in the second row! :-(
Talk about paying the price, w/o counting the cost!
Actually, I didn't mind paying the money, because I always wanted to get front
row and I definetly got my money's worth. Heck, now I know the correct way to
play alot of the stuff we have on tab.
There is a second reason that I paid the money-
I'm sabbath observant. Translation, I can not buy my tickets on Saturday when
they go on sale,so I am screwed!
Hence my posting a few weeks ago to meet a jewish girl who likes RUSH.
By the way, Brett was right-
 -Scalpers are the scum of the Earth!!--

   [ I agree! How fun is it to get to your local TicketMaster, the one that
     maybe 3 rush fans know about, only to see 20+ homeless guys standing
     around a scalper getting their lottery numbers (and money of course)

This might scare some of you but I was just reading the Marilyn Manson
autobiography "The Long Hard Road Out of Hell" and among its twisted and
shocking pages was a picture of Marilyn in a Rush T-shirt.  I think it even
might have been 2112 but his hands were too in the way to say for sure.  He
looked about 15 or 16 in the picture.  He also mentions in the book how he
used to have sex with his girlfriend to none other than Moving Pictures.  You
just never know about some people do you.

refundable.  No different from a scalper, except that a good scalper is
honest about the price up front.

And mine gets me 5th row for 35 bucks.  Well, 50 with the new higher

<A NAME="2023026">Subject: We are NOT alone...Echo heard down under.</A>

G'day all,

Remember the feeling that you get when someone comments to you about the
Rush T shirt you are wearing???  Bear in mind that I know of only 3 or 4
Rush fans in Perth, Western Australia.....

My brother and I went to the last Van Halen show down under this week.  We
had not seen VH before, so there was only one real choice as to what T
shirt to wear.  We both wore our "HYF" tour T shirts that we got in
Birmingham at the NEC (ASOH concert).  We spent a long time in the bar
whilst the support were playing and as we entered, a sheila smiled and said
"Far out...a Rush T shirt...have'nt seen one of those in years!!".  Great,
I thought. At least there ARE other fans out there.  After the show, as we
were leaving, came a tap on the shoulder.  "Love your T shirt, man.  Great
band."  Two VH fans commented on how much they love Rush.  One was a fan
since CoS.  After a good chin-wag my brother and I left feeling pretty good
about the VH concert and the fact that we had encountered other Rush fans
in Australia.  After all...there ain't very many of us around down here!

On the train home, two cops were on board making sure there was no trouble.
 One of them came up and said what a great fan they were, and that they
didnt know any other people in Perth who liked Rush - most people not even
having heard of them.  We chatted to this cop for a while and found out
they had'nt heard anything after PW. I told them about the other 11 albums
and they freaked!!!!!

So a resounding echo heard down under, in one of the most isolated cities
of the world. 

BTW, Van Halen were absolutely great.  Even I left thinking that Eddie was
the greatest guitar player in the world (I should be strung up for saying
that...) Alex VH is a great drummer, and his solo was superb, but he would
have to Neil before God.  Gary Cherone does a great job too.

At least VH gave me a reason to take my Rush drive tape out of the car...

Billy Oz...out.

Did anyone ever see those bumper stickers in the early 90's that said 
"Rush is a band"?  I used to see them now and again in the Seattle 
area when Rush Limbaugh bumper stickers were the big thing.  I have 
always wanted one but never could find one.  Does anyone know where 
to get them?  Please send a private email, thanks.

For anyone living in the Seattle area, there is a cool store downtown 
by the Seattle Center called "Rock Memories" that sells a crap load 
of Rush realated stuff (among many other bands) in excelent

Actually, I think Scott's idea of Rush unplugged is very cool.  I'll 
have you know that a friend and I used to do a very mean acoustic 
2112, myself on bass, him crashing between six- and twelve-string, 
 though it kind of lost its meaning with all the guitar parts 
being acoustic, as you can imagine.  We also used to do Analog Kid, 
though he could not do the fingering on the up and down scale 
section, so we just hit the rhythm chords, and sang diddle diddle 
diddle - well, what's his face on Working Man couldn't play it either.  
I think most of Presto works acoustically, doesn't it?

Leah Slife says John Hannah is either British or from somewhere in

Weddings, he has done a lot of TV over here, as a police pathologist 
in one series for example.  I think his head is a little too round 
for Neil, but I have no alternatives as yet.  Absolutely concur to 
the X-Files man and Geddy.  I also knew a girl at University when I 
was an undergrad who was a ringer - I think it was the hair.

Seeing this makes me realize that most of my Rush wallpaper photos

that are sized to be wallpaper?

I'm the IS person for a large manufacturing company, and go to
people's desks to check on their computers.  Yesterday I got a report
of a dead hard drive, and what do I find when I walk into the guy's
cube?  A small RTB button hooked into the fiber wall!  After I got
done giving him the bad news (he needed a new hard drive), I asked him
about the button.  Ah yes, we are kindred spirits--he's managed to hit
every Rush concert in the metro Detroit area since '80 or so.

Chatting happily about Rush, we walked back to my office, where I
deposited his computer.  When I went to deactivate my screensaver, he
saw me type " **** " and instantly said, "Is that 2112 or RUSH?"

Well, so much for my secret passwords!  I had to change *all* of them
as every one was Rush-related.  Being the SysAdmin, I was able to go
in and look at his passwords for the system--RUSH, 2112, BYTOR,
ROLLTHEBONES, etc.  I warned him to change them immediately, as I had.  

And here I thought I was the ONLY one in the world who *used* to use
the 4-digit requirement-matching "2112" for my ATM PIN and voicemail
password!  <g>

The moral of the story, boys & girls?  If there's another Rush fan in
the same area where you need to have secure passwords, change 'em!  If
this guy hadn't mentioned that he'd figured mine out, he could have
jumped into the entire network admin areas with unlimited access. 
Considering HE wrecked his hard drive, isn't that a scary thought?

But we traded some GREAT pictures! :-)

Here is my little Ticketmaster story....

I used to live down Corpus Christi, Texas during the Presto tour.  I was
trying to get tickets to the Houston show.  They went on sale on Saturday
morning at 10am.  I was there at 1 am.  To my dismay...tickets to a local
Alan Jackson concert went on sale the same time as my Rush tickets.  I was
not first in line, I was maybe 20th.  The store did get going on selling
tickets until maybe 10:30 am.  I was pissed.  I had to wait behind all
these kickers (no offense) for my tickets.  I HAD to listen to country
music all night long...when I finally made it up to the ticket counter I
found out I was the first Rush fan that morning.  I ended up with very
upper prom tickets.  I was veeerrrryyyy upset.  I did get my tickets
though.  To this day....I still can not stand to here an Alan Jackson song.
