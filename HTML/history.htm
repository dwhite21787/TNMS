<P>January, 2020

<P>I have been hosting these pages on a personal server, and I will be shutting that host down in March 2020. I announced this in Reddit <A HREF="http://reddit.com/r/rush">/r/rush</A> along with the suggestion to find a copy of this site in <A HREF="http://archive.org">Archive.org</A>. That led to a donation of over 150 issues spanning #1994 to #2184, so I've updated the site contents and indices, and will make sure the updates get picked up by the Wayback Machine.

<P>If anyone has more missing issues to donate, please contact me at <A HREF="mailto:dwhite21787@gmail.com">dwhite21787@gmail.com</A>

<P>Get out there and ROCK!

<P>September, 2002

<P>Well, it finally happened. I cleaned out (part of) the attic,
and I found a bunch of old National Midnight Star email digest files
on 5.25" floppy disks. Fortunately, I can still read them, and I've
got enough Perl under my belt to write a converter to HTML for these
things.

<P>I did not find these at the
<A HREF="http://www.r-u-s-h.com/nmsmirror.com/">NMS Mirror</A>
though there were some at
<A HREF="http://www.filelibrary.com/Contents/Multi-Platform/43/76.html">this
site</A> but not all of them.

<P>So, here they are! Issues 
<A HREF="html/nms_0001.htm">#1</A> through 
<A HREF="html/nms_0699.htm">#699</A>, spanning June 29, 1990
to June 18, 1993. The home page for indices is <A HREF="index.htm">here</A>.

<P>
The URL for each issue is relatively sane so you
can edit the <U>nms_NNNN.htm</U> string with the numbers 001 to 699
for instant access.

<P>Some of the information is of course way out of date, like the
<A HREF="html/nms_0692.htm#The%20Rush%20Tour%20Dates%20Listing">Tour Dates Listing</A> and the
<A HREF="html/nms_0085.htm#Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20List">FAQ</A>, but there are other tibits
that are interesting and hilarious at times. And for the history
books, the <U>National Midnight Star</U> was named by a 
<A HREF="html/nms_0082.htm#Administrivia">one vote margin</A>.
Other pieces can be found elsewhere, like the
<A HREF="http://www.space-dye.com/drt/">Deep Rush Thoughts</A>
and tons of information at <A HREF="http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/">Power
Windows</A>.

<P>I am missing issues #353 and #491 in this range.
I don't recall what the last issue was - did it make it to #2112?
If I can get more, it should be very easy to add them.

<P>And yes, I am willing to make the raw files and the converter
available. I'll put links here. 

<P>Enjoy! Doug - dwhite@nist.gov
