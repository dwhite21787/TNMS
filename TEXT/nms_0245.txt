Just a quickie here: does anyone have the source for a mail server
which will work under BSD Unix (or better yet, Ultrix) and either
standard Berkeley mail or MH?  If Keith Ford is unable to get alternate
support for his server, e-mail server access will disappear next week.
I'd consider installing his system on Syrinx, but it uses Elm, which I
neither know or have.

Also, since volume seems to be dropping drastically, I will consider
implementing a new policy:  a digest will only be created if there are
more than five items in it.  I don't want to produce the NMS just for
the sake of producing it, if you know what I mean.  This is understandably
a slow time; we've discussed the last album to death, they're not touring,
and the new album is as yet unfinished.  Things will pick up greatly in the
fall with the influx of new and returning bodies, as well as the new album.

Crippen and Young were the first astronauts to fly the shuttle...they
flew sts-1 in the columbia. Interestingly enouhg..i just heard
signals for the first time..and i think analog kid is a downright
incredible song..the fast shifts into tohe corale interlude
and the synths..excellent mix..seemed like a perfection on the already
perfect mix of GUP and PW.

anyhow..may the force be with you.

From: stum@basser.cs.su.oz.au!

G'day mates!

I have two questions:

a) What is The Pass about?

[ In a nutshell, it's about the trials of adolescence and an arguement
  against teenage suicide.  Also, see the FAQL for a more lengthy 
  explanation from Neil.                                      :rush-mgr ]

b) What is Available Light about?

I have my opinions, but I'm not that great at analysing lyrics
(being a computer scientist and all - not an English major!)
so I'd be interested in hearing peoples ideas.
Since (from my poll) it seems The Pass is the best song on the
album (followed by Available Light) I was wondering whether the
meanings were just as great....

I think their both about relationships, the Pass seems to be
about a broken one...and how to handle it.

"Turn around and walk the razors edge"  &lt;be brave&gt;
"Don't turn your back and slam the door on me.." &lt;don't shut me out&gt;.

Also, I agree with Dave about the end of Red Barchetta being an
ant-climax. The song gets REALLY good at that point, and you'd
like to momentum to continue.....oh well!

Also....

You know you're a RUSH fan when

	you find yourself willing to spend ~$1500 to see the band OS!!
	Help...!!!

I've already unsubscribed from the list, but because I had time tonight I
picked up this weeks digest from the ftp and started to read them.  I see
a lot of mention about Queensryche.  Something I heard on the radio the
other day about them that I find really interesting is that they were
announced as "the thinking man's band."  I found this a little strange as
we all have been calling Rush "The Thinking Man's Band" for years.

Oh well, I'm off to sunny Florida.  If anyone is down that way and knows
how I can get Internet access in St. Augustine (preferably free, I'm a poor
student) please drop me a message at:

Concerning the 2112 voice effect on the "show me the light.." lyric..
It's really a simple effect to do. Take any guitar delay pedal/processor
and set the echo to maximum, the delay time to some reasonable level, and
then set the regeneration/feedback/whatever-it's-called-on-YOUR-device to
the maximum. The delay keeps repeating and feeding back on itself
until it finally gets really unintelligble and your amplifier sounds
like its going to blast off to the moon! Good industrial-noise-maker.

This "Roll the Bones" thing... Is RUSH going voodoo, or WHAT?! I never
really could get a good handle on spiritual matter in the band-- I mean
"Free Will" seems to pretty much blow off/criticize religion of most any
kind in favor of Enlightenment-Age individualism. Now they're delving
into occultic/spiritism/animism/whatever? Hum. What do those guys DO
in their spare time, anyway? Geez..

Subject: Bass tab for Vital Signs

Does anyone have the bass tab for Geddy's little
"solo" at the end of Vital Signs (right before he
starts repeating "Everybody got mixed feelings")?
I learned the rest of the song from the Rush volume
of the "Bass Superstar Series", but the author did
not put that part in there. Thanks!

Subject: Ending to Red Barchetta

I'm responding to the Rush fan who wrote that the ending of Red
Barchetta was kinda 'anti-climactic'.

Back when the song came out, I was a die-hard aspiring guitarist, who
upon hearing a tune on the radio (or a phonograph in this case), would
try to figure it out. Although I didn't have too much trouble with it,
whenever I still hear it, I think back to the days when I sat around
with my Lotus, Les Paul copy guitar, and my little Peavy amp, cranked
up to an excellent distortion pettle (sp?), trying to jam just like
Alex was. So, as an answer to your question, I would have to say that
I really love the ending to the song.

There's my $.02 worth.
