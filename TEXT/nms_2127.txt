Hey guys,

I recently came across a boot called Conduction, and I know nothing 
about it.  It appears to be a RTB recording, and though it is priced 
right I have held off on purchasing it until I (hopefully) can get some 
information on it.  So......any of youse guys or gals out there who 
happen to be familiar with this one, I'd love to hear from ya!  Private 
posts welcome.  

Sidenote:  Any Zappa fans with any knowledge of an orange vinyl release 
of We're Only In It For The Money?  Anyone ever seen it?  Rare?  Trent 
and I would both appreciate info on this one.  Right, Trent?

Thanks,

I'm game for this one...
In my 5 disc carousel, there are the following discs:

Big Wreck - "In Loving Memory Of..."
	These guys ROCK!  I've seen them live 3 times, and they kick ass!  Ian
Thornley is one helluva guitar player!
Dream Theater - "Once In A LIVEtime"
	The double live disc just released on Tuesday.  Covers a Paris show on
last years "Touring Into Infinity" tour.  This also kicks ass!  Has 	anyone
been fortunate enough to find the accompanying video "5 Years In 	A
LIVEtime"??
Liquid Tension Experiment - self titled
	Mike Portnoy & John Petrucci of DT, Jordan Ruddess (an awesome keyboard
player), and Tony Levin (a great bass player; played with King Crimson)
all come together to perform a phenominal album.  The last song, "Three
Minute Warning" is 29 minutes of total improv. "Kindred Spirits" is one of
my favorite tracks off this one.
Rush - "Grace Under Pressure"
	This album has always been one of my favorites, even though it's dark.
Kid Gloves rools.
Sarah McLachlan - "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"
	Her breakthrough album, and she's also a Cannuck!  huh huh  Listen to
"Fear" once.  Sarah at her best, vocally, IMHO.

Okay, that's it...my CD player doesn't hold anymore than that!

Subject: Mystifying basslines

Interesting Rush-related event-
My friend Ben was playing his bass guitar in his room the other night
(I wasn't there, he told me about this) and he started playing a
certain riff from "Show Don't Tell". He said he kept playing it over
and over until he got lost in it and spaced out. His mother opened the
door to his room, and saw him there, playing it over and over. She
tried to get his attention, and after about six more run-throughs of
that riff, he finally snapped out of it. Pretty cool, Huh?
Also, I never mentioned this before, and it isn't that important, but
anyway...A while back when I was listeneing to the radio, after one
song ended I heard "Hi! This is Alex Lifeson of Rush, and you're
listening to 95.3 WAOR!" I just thought I'd mention that.

My worst fears have come true.  When I first heard that all 3 discs would be in
a single case I was worried.  I hate those hideous little paper CD sleeves that
scratch the discs.  Anyone know if that Japanese version's coming in a
jewel case?...

I know it's the music that counts, but it's hard to listen to scratched up CDs.

Subject: too many scotches - #1?

Hey!

<erickson_brandon@hotmail.com> says:

>just because Neil said he was hung over when he wrote those
>lyrics, doesn't mean that they weren't up to par.

Neil admits the lyrics were odd (not up to par) *because* he was
hung over. He said he was there to work. Too many scotches the
night before (first night of meeting to record) = dog years. Neil
wasn't too sure about the lyrics, but Ged and Al loved it so they
worked it.

I'd rather be a tortoise from galapagos
or a span of geological time
than be hungover like Neil when he wrote dog years...

I think (judging by the list of releases slated for Nov. 10th)
that DS has an excellent chance of hitting #1. Ironic that
Atlantic is using a Mercury release for the springboard.
Even more ironic (to the rush fan) that it's TSOR. Is it
possible that art as expression can also be a successful
market campaign? Well, maybe for one week at least! :-)

Subject: REAL Dog Years...

Different vets use different formulas, but here's one that seems to make
sense...

Dog Year ONE = 15 human years.
Dog Year TWO = 10 human years.
Dog Year 3 thru the rest = 3 human years.

This more accurately reflects the different stages in the dogs' life
when compared to humans...  Somewhere near the end of DY1, you hit
puberty and are able to breed... DY2 includes more maturing and growth,
etc.

So the "record" 27-year-old pooch in England would really be 100 years
old in human years, and eligible to appear in a photo held up by Willard
Scott.

Given a normal "average" life-span of say, 14 years, dogs tend to top
out at 61 human years.

A more interesting analysis of lifespans was done in an essay by Isaac
Asimov, where he compared relative lifespans of different sized mammals
by counting the number of heartbeats you could expect through a maximum
lifetime.  Interestingly, most of the mammals were bunched in between
600-million and 1-point-1-billion heartbeats - - humans clock in at
around 4-billion at the top...

Yet another characteristic that elevates man beyond the rest of the
animal kingdom.

Back to the point though... Neil would have been hard pressed to turn
this lyric - - 

	"In a dogs life - - 
	  the first year is more like 15...
	  and all to soon
	  he'll be put to sleep with dog-gie morphine..."

Guten tag!

In TNMS #2124 an ascending-aortic-aneurysm caused Jose Ramos to write:

"In reply to Dennis Williamson's question of the day:
"If there was a movie made about Rush, who would play the band members?"
IMHO, I think Neil should be played by Jack Klugman.  Remember the Odd
Couple episode when he had to fill in as the drummer for Felix's band.  He
had some real talent on the skins, don't ya think?"

I think that you're forgetting Bob Crane of Hogans Heroes fame! Remember
that episode where Hogan and the guys are out on a work detail  and cause an
avalanche by playing a jazz tune as loud as they can, cutting off a nazi
supply road? Well, Hogan (Crane that is) was playing the drums and looked
like he actually knew what he was doing. Besides Bob Crane looks a lot more
like Neil than Jack Klugman and... oh,... wait -  Bob Crane is dead, isn't
he? Well... poop!

Okay, so it's a dumb idea. Almost as dumb as this Rush movie thread.

Subject: Greetings.

Greetings fellow Rush fans!

It has been a really long time since I posted to this digest. I have
really been out of the loop with what has been happening with Rush. I
read yesterday's digest and (believe it or not) for the first time heard
of the news of the loss of both Neil's wife and daughter. I was very
bothered and upset to hear of something so tragic. I want to somehow
send a letter to Neil expressing my condolences. I realize that the
letter reaching him is probably slim, and now with him mourning,
probably a chance in a million.
I wanted to ask a few questions concerning this. Please, if anyone can
answer:

1.) Is Anthem the best place to send my letter to? If so, anyone know
their address?
2.) What type of cancer did Jackie have?
3.) What was his daughter's name?

This year I experienced some very emotional moments when my daughter was
born and when I found out that my mom was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's
Lymphoma. When I heard of Neil's tragedy, I said to myself, "Thank God
my daughter and wife are healthy and safe".

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

I believe that the tragic events in Neil's life will, eventually, give him a
completely different perspective on music making and help him to bring to
pass yet another transformation for Rush.  I don't see him wallowing in
his grief for too long.  A passionate person like that has to have an outlet
for his deep emotions and I can't think of anything better to serve that
purpose than his lyricism and drumming.  I am looking forward to at least
one more studio album from Rush.

Has anyone heard if the DS premiere or the Rockline interview will be =

from your copy?

   [ Yes. I'll probably do the entire premiere in RA, and *just* the songs in
     MP3. And I found out that a radio station in San Diego is very likely
     to carry the premiere on the 4th, *AND* they have a RealAudio feed. If
     they confirm this, I will post the link.                     : rush-mgr ]

Also, where can I get an .MP3 copy of any of the cuts on DS?  Atlantic =
records didn't seem to work.

Subject: Fun Fact - YYZ

Greetings again,

I'm sure all of you know this as you are all TRUE rush followers.  

If you haven't already noticed, my signature contains the Morse Code
equivalent for YYZ (_ . _ _  _ . _ _  _ _ . . ).  For any of you who like to
see the connections to the real world in Rush songs, this is the same signal
that the Toronto International Airport (I think that's the one) uses to
identify itself with incoming aircraft.  And if you take this Morse Code
signal and apply it rhythmically to the Neil's intro to YYZ (ding da ding
ding ding da ding ding ding ding da da), it conveniently becomes the theme
for the song.  Pretty cool, huh?

Just thought it was worth mentioning for anyone who hasn't heard it before.

Subject: Free CDs! (almost)

>...READ THIS ENTIRE E-MAIL BEFORE RESPONDING...

OK, here's the deal. I've got some extra CDs that I want to give away
(rather than throw out). This will be a winner takes all deal. All I'm
going to want UPFRONT is US$20 to cover packing, shipping and hassle.

Before I list the CDs and tell you how I'm going to go about choosing
the winner, please note the following:

Rush-Mgr: If you would like this little care package, please indicate so
immediately below this paragraph. For you, I will waive the $20 fee. You
bust your butt for this list, and I really do appreciate the effort.
I've been here since Issue #400 and hope to see many more. If you say
"YES, I'LL TAKE 'EM," send private e-mail with your shipping address.

   [ Thanks for the offer, but I don't like most of those bands to justify
     getting them... :-)                                        : rush-mgr ]

CD List
 ------

1) Rush - Live - Vol. 1 - USA 1989 - The Unauthorised Recordings

This is an Australian boot that is yet another of the GUP video
rip-offs. The bass is muddy, the mix isn't the best, it's been
resequenced, some of the tracks have been mislabeled, but, heh, it's a
Rush boot.

2) Dream Theater - Precious Things

This is a Prism CD-R boot, one of Mike's better DT efforts. I got an
extra one by mistake, and another one I didn't order, but I didn't get a
couple that I did have on order and had paid for, so I guess that about
evens out. Don't get me wrong. I like Mike a LOT (he even gave me a
liner credit on Experience To Extremes) and I've got a bunch of his
boots that I consider priceless; he will be sorely missed. This CD has a
KILLER set list, which includes their Covers Medley (Led Zeppelin, Iron
Maiden, Metallica, Pink Floyd and Yes, finishing with Innocence Faded).
It's basically all soundboard material recorded at various times during
1995 (except for a couple of Images and Words demos from 1991-1992).

3) Ozric Tentacles - Erpland

This may be the best Tentacles release ever. I've got a remastered copy
(plus Pungent Effulgent, Strangeitude, Afterswish and Jurassic Shift)
coming from Cranium Music in New Zealand) shortly and don't need it.

4) Hawkwind - Doremi Fasol Latido
5) Hawkwind - Hall of the Mountain Grill

Except for "Warrior on the Edge of Time" these may be Hawkwind's best
studio releases. I've got limited edition remastered copies (plus the
other three that make up their first five releases) coming from Cranium
and don't need them.

6) Jebediah - Twitch
7) Jebediah - Harpoon

I got these by mistake from Greg's Music World in Australia (I've got a
LOT of Australian blues CDs) when I placed my last order. Greg said to
throw them out; I'm going to give them away. One jewel case is banged up
but the CD plays just fine. Jebediah are a good band, young,
alternative. They're just not my taste.

8) Miles Davis - Birth of the Cool
9) Miles Davis - Miles Ahead (20-bit remaster)

Birth of the Cool is exactly that; it's a seminal album. I just picked
up the remastered CD that includes a couple of live performances by the
nonet that appeared on the original album. Awesome. I don't need Miles
Ahead because it's included in the Miles Davis-Gil Evans box set, which
I own. This remastered version includes 4 bonus tracks and some SWEET
jazz from the master.

That's the list. You expected more?.

How To Qualify
 -------------

If you're interested AND rush-mgr has NOT expressed a desire for them,
do the following:

Via private e-mail (to: johnmaar@mcs.net):

Write a short (if I maximize the Netscape e-mail client (at 1024x768)
and I need to scroll your submission to read it all, you lose) essay on
why you should be chosen
winner-takes-all-for-free-except-for-$20-shipping. Reference the subject
line of this message (Free CDs! (almost)) as your subject line.

Content counts!
Creativity counts!
Grammar counts!
Spelling counts!
'Need' doesn't count for shit (my middle name's not "Ayn" for nothing)!
Geographic region is irrelevant (I'll ship anywhere in the world)!

Submissions will be accepted until I receive my Hawkwind and Ozric
Tentacles CDs from Cranium Music in New Zealand. I was told to expect
them in 7-10 days. I ordered them yesterday (30 October), so let's say
that I will stop considering new submissions received after Sunday, 8
November.

One submission per person only. Multiple entries will be cause to delete
ALL of your entries. Anyone bitching about the rush-mgr being offered
these CDs at no charge whatsoever will be instantly teleported to the
Chicago Bears training facility for use as a live blocking dummy (the
way they're playing this year, that might not be as bad a sentence as it
once would have been).

Once I've selected the winning entry, I'll e-mail the winner privately
with the good news and will ship immediately upon receipt of US$20 (or
one or more quality Rush CD or video boots I don't own - remember, I
said creativity counts!). I become the owner of all submissions and
reserve the right to post the winning entry to the NMS.

Good Luck!

A few weeks ago I posted about a Rush lyrics game on the Internet.  I received
a lot of positive feedback and had minimal problems with it, so I decided to
make the game a little more fun.  To play, go to

http://yyz.dorm.utexas.edu/

Like last time, be aware that the whole thing is being housed on my computer in
my dorm room.  A good time to play is noon to 6.  Also, some people did not
realize that each time you play you get new lyrics, so you can play any
number of times without getting the same quiz.

The semester here at UT ends early December, so make sure to play before
then, or else you'll have to wait until late January.

     As a drummer, I have a firm grasp as to just how good Neil is.  This is
because I can play (ok, in most cases, ATTEMPT to play ;)  ) his music and
experience, first hand, just what an awesome talent he is.  Simply mind
blowing.
     My question goes out to the guitarists and bassists among us - just how
good ARE Geddy and Alex?  Are they the in the undisputed upper echilon of
those who play their chosen instruments as is Neil, or are they just very good
players?

Thanx.

My fellow Rush fans.
	Well as of this writing we are 9 days away.  Imagine yourself at
the venue in either Winter 1996 or Summer 1997.  Waiting patiently for
the Toronto Three to take the stage.  Then you hear the 2001 theme for a
few moments, then you hear the opening chords of "Dreamline".  My spine
will tingle on November 10 just as it did at the opening moments of the
Test For Echo concerts I was at.  
	Speaking of Drealine, that song is just impossible to get tired
of isn't it :-)  And sorry about the teaser.
	Exiting Stage Left,
	Jon G.

i really do have to compliment Michael Z. Williamson <daggers@indy.net> for
having the patience to ferret out the more interesting posts like:

> Dennis Benjamin asked a few questions:
>

SETI researchers tell us that statistically, it is HIGHLY unlikely we are alone
in the universe.  there are ancillary issues like the Anthropic Principal --
where SOMETHING within the fabric of creation stands in to allow sentient life
to form despite overwhelming odds (don't kid yourself:  99.9999999...% of the
universe is either really cold and dark or really hot and energetic compared to
the surface of this planet) -- but that's the gist of it.  the OTHER question is
of course a matter best discussed between you and your spiritual advisor. 
friends of mine who listen to Art Bell tell me the world collapse could come
during the next meteor shower, which may take out twenty percent of our
communications satellites.  but then, i may get hit by a bus tomorrow....and
then, would you do?  without me?

ah, the stuff of Science Fiction !

i have always thought it would be great to have the presence of mind during,
say, a natural disaster or an event of historical importance (like maybe a rush
concert (?)) to look for time travellers who are researching it first hand.

i have never been to rush concert.  has anyone noticed any weird behaviour by
particular individuals?  what a loaded question, i know, but for instance, how
about people in the crowd who keep referring to the band in the --past tense--. 
or who mention an album title that hasn't been released yet?  (like someone
commenting that 'this 1987 rochester performance of la villa strangiato is
inferior to 1999 detroit version' from "Songs from the Parking Lot"** ?)  pretty
scary, huh?

therefore, i think ALL fans attending concerts should be body cavity searched
for their time-locator devices.  who knows, we may even discover a few abductees
 - from those metal balls that the greys shove up their (the abductees, not
their own) noses!  in the interests of science, we MUST do this!
 
> >I think we all need to lay off interpreting the cover of DS. Lets just

> 
> I think we should do both

here, here  (but did anyone notice in the bottom right hand corner of the album
cover that, in VERY small letters, it says to send me ten dollars ?)  guess not.

Greeting fellow rushians,

First, I would like to thanks all contributor who have tried to respond to
my request.  In this way of thinking, Jack Mevorah, James Smith, Chris
Polo, Micheal Gross, St2112, James Robinson and Linda Brown, thanks all 
you for your time.

But my problem is still there.  My question : Did Geddy EVER played with a
pick ? gave me 5 negative answers and 2 positives ones.  What am I
supposed to think ?  I know Geddy has not played with a pick on the last
few tours.  Before that, I was to young to even think about Rush.

So, I will continue to pretend that the pick I have framed on my wall is
really from Geddy as the girl who gave me the pick said 7 years ago.
Maybe someday, I will have another explanation.

Halllo Rush fans,

As a Rush collector for over 15 years, I'm interested in trading my
autographed Counterparts tourbook for a Rush RIAA Record award (any
album). It is signed by Geddy, Alex & Neil. I realize this is a very
rare piece, but have always wanted a Rush RIAA record award. If
interested please email me privately. I want this to go to a real fan
& not some collectors agency that's why I'm only posting here and on
the NMS trading post. Thanks Rush goddess for letting me post this.
