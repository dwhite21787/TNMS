Subject: Ayn Rand and 2112

At severe risk of eternal hellfire and damnation (which would be the
equivalent effect of being removed from the NMS mailing list) I must
publicly question the rush-mgr!!!!
I'm holding my breath, but here goes:

&gt;Does anyone know if the song 2112 is inspired from any piece of literature/
&gt;movie, or is the concept a Peart original?

&gt;  [ It wasn't inspired by any one piece, but was inspired by Ayn Rand's ideas
&gt;    she wrote about in her books.				   : rush-mgr ]

I always thought that 2112 was a nearly exact emulation of "Anthem"
(Gee, what a great title for a song.... Nah, it'd never make it!)
;-)      I fear this may initiate yet another discussion of Peart vs.
Rand, and I know that Neil has REPEATEDLY stated that it is not taken
from Rand but rather an idea he put forth, then realized the
similarity.  None the less, I would have to tell Jay Cadieux that
"Anthem" is the one, Neil's comments notwithstanding!!!  (Somebody
please back me up on this..... I feel alone in the potential windstorm
of the rush-mgr's wrath  ;-) ! )

  [ I always thought the same, but Neil insists that he got the idea from "The
    Fountainhead", (the ideas, not the story itself) and only later noticed 
    how closely it parallels "Anthem".			  	   : rush-mgr ]

Well that's all from "risk land" !!!

Subject: Rush and Baseball!!!

Since baseball is Geddy's favorite sport, and since it is the best time of
year (Spring Training) I figured I'd post a Rush-Baseball list here...

Rush and baseball...the connections

1. Lyrical Change #1 "One likes to believe in the spirit of baseball"
2. Lyrical change #2 "The boy threw down his Brewers cap and..."
3. Lyrical change #3 "The boy threw down his Angels cap and..."
4. Geddy photographed taking batting practice with the Angels in
   1992 and shown in Baseball Weekly magazine
5. Geddy spotted on WGN during a Sox-Blue Jays game in 1992
6. Rush occasionally played on WTBS as they show the score after inning
   as the station goes into commercial
7. In the Distant Early Warning video, the boy (Geddy's son) flies
   over Shea stadium during a Mets game
8. That pre-PoW concert swing, neatly (and intentionally) co-inciding
   with Spring Training
9. In the AFTK liner, notice the Detroit Tigers logo on Geddy's sock.
10. In the Roll the Bones concert tourbook, Geddy talks about baseball,
   and wonders when the Blue Jays will win the World Series, which they
   did last fall, much to Geddy's pleasure!

Anyone got any other Rush-Baseball connections?

&gt;Greetings...

&gt;I haven't written the list in a while, but I came across something
&gt;that I thought might pertain to Rush, but haven't seen anything about
&gt;it in the FAQ or anywhere, so here goes...

&gt;I was in a few comic book stores in LA (Golden Apple, Hi-De-Ho comics)
&gt;and they had what appeared to be a graphic novel based on _2112_, since
&gt;it was titled this. I forget the name of the writer offhand, but it was
&gt;published by Dark Horse Comics. The cover is black and has the writer's
&gt;name and "2112" in large letters, nothing more.

&gt;My question is, is this indeed related to the Rush album? I would have
&gt;looked, except that every copy was shrink wrapped and priced at $80.
&gt;If it isn't, which I would find hard to believe, just what the hell is
&gt;it about, then??

&gt;thanks... I have been wondering about this for weeks now...

&gt;-marsh

	Marsh, this book has nothing whatsoever to do with RUSH.  The book
(written and drawn by John Byrne, for all yunz comic book fans out there),
is set in the year 2112, and deals with (you guessed it), a semi-post-
apoclypitic (sp) future.  It's quite a good book, and I'd suggest taking
a look at it, but no way in hell would I pay $80 bucks for it.

	I don't remember the details of the story, but I do know it has
nothing to do with Rush.  Sorry, but look at the money you'd be saving.

Subject: Rush Wet Dream
Date: Sun, 14 Mar 93 2:04:06 EST

Greetings,

This is my first post to the NMS, and I first want to say how much I
love it!  Anyway, our local rock station played five-Rush-songs-in-a-
row around midnight on Saturday!!!  They were, in order:  Tom Sawyer,
Superconductor, The Spirit of Radio, Lock and Key, and Dreamline.
A pretty diversified list.

The DJ afterwards called the block "a Rush fan's wet dream".  That
was pretty close to the truth; I nearly pissed in my pants when
I heard "Spirit of Radio" starting.  Just wanted to let you know
the Spirit of Rush is alive and well in Atlanta...

One question, though:  Does anyone out there share my extreme
enjoyment of "Beneath, Between, and Behind"?  I know it's one of
their older tunes, but for some reason I can't get enough of that
song these days.  I haven't seen any discussion about it here or in
the archive.

Keep on rollin'
Brian D.

Subject: Alex Lifeson in the Hall of Fame

Good day, Eh?  This is my first post to the NMS, and I must say that I've
enjoyed it a lot.  Just for those of you who wanted to know about Alex lifeson
being in the hall of fame, He was inducted into the Guitar for the Practicing
Musician Hall of Fame in May of 1991, along with SRV and Joe Perry from
Aerosmith. There was an interview with "The Master," and a transcription to
Freewill. Although I was only introduced to Rush within the last year, they
have become one of my favorite bands, along with Alex becoming one of my
favorite players. As a matter of fact, after seeing one of Alex's endorsements
for PRS, I tried one out and bought it, because they are the greatest guitars
I have ever played (they make Ibanezes look like a guitar you'd buy out of a
Sears catalogue :-).  I also had an opportunity to see Rush this summer at a
place near Detroit called Pine Knob, and they did in fact perform the song
Time Stand Still, along with Analog kid, Superconductor, and quite a few
others which I guess aren't part of their regular repetoir, like Xanadu.
Since it was the first time I saw them, I was simply amazed that three men
could make music sound that good!  I guess they did all of those songs because
it was their second time in the Detroit area for the Roll the Bones tour.  The
first was in the Palace, and not suprisingly, they sold out both shows.  Well,
this is a guy from Michigan's U.P. who is always getting asked "are you from
Canada man?" say Take Off, Eh!

Subject: The Delicate Sound of RUSH

  Has anyone ever decided to make a tape of the MOST emotional, and
delicate Rush songs ever made?  This though was going through my mind
one day, and since I had nothing to do, I made one.

  Side 1:

  Ghost of a Chance
  Tears
  Tai Shan
  Different Strings
  Emotion Detector
  Madrigal
  Mission

  Side 2:

  Losing It
  Panacea
  Mystic Rhythms
  The Pass
  Bravado
  Available Light

  This tape fits almost perfectly on a 60 minute tape (Side A is 30
minutes, and B is 28), and I think the order goes well. NOTE:  I
chose these songs 'cause I like them and I consider them very moving.
Now, you may say why GoaC, or some of the other "harder" stuff?  They
are still very moving, even if there aren't any acoustic guitars!

  I await your opinions......................

Subject: re: YYZ award

   I don't want to start answering my own questions, bu tI know for
sure that they won the Best Instrumental in 1982, not 1981!  I can
remember this because WMT was up for the award on the 10th aniversary
of YYZ's victory.  I know this is true because I was listening to the
'Rock News' on the radio the night of the Grammys (1992), and this
was where this info was stated.

   Also, the Boyz have be honoured as Ambassadors of Canadian Rock,
by former PM Trudeau, about 10 or more years ago.

   They currently have a streak at the Juno's for best rock cover, I
think they have won it for every album starting from Signals or GuP,
but I know for sure that Presto and RtB HAVE won it.

  We've gotta document this!

Regarding my post in NMS #633:

It looks like my claim was damn straight and correct since no one could come
up with anything to argue with me.  It seems that all you Rush fans are making
Neil bigger than g-d by still comparing him with Frank Beard.  Pa-leeese!  So
Frank Beard can program a drum machine in his late days, does that mean you
have to compare your great drummer against him?!?  That's pretty sad.

I was at a UF gymnastics meet and a girl from U of Kentucky used
Subdivisions for a full half of her floor routine! Shocked the hell out of
me. When she finished I and my mates(two girls and another guy, all fans of
at least one Rush albulm) stood up and cheered loudly, calling for an extra
point for superior music.

In addition, one girl had her entire routine done to a medley of Doors
tunes, another used Cream songs - including Strange Brew, and another used
old Van Halen. Is this a new trend in gymnastics, using classic or AOR
rock?

Gotta go

  Greetings fellow Rushians,

First, a correction.  When I posted earlier I mentioned that I am addicted to
chilies.  This is not a mistake, but rather a typo.  It is chiles, those
delectable, searing, scorching pods of delight.  The hotter, the better.

Second, I have been reading a thread lately concerning hearing Rush on the radio
and have had little or nothing to contribute.  Here in the Deep South of Alabama
the radio stations almost seem to have never heard of Rush.  Then out of the
blue, one of the local stations plays the Overture from 2112.  I was elated!
But then for the let down.  They let the song run through 'Temples of Syrinx'
and then quit.  Oh well, better than nothing!

Third, FYI this will probably be my only, and quite dubious, contribution to
the FAQ file.  Did anyone know that 1001001 is octal for 111?  As in 3
individual members of the band?  Three single people?  Hmmm, stretching it isn't
it?

C ya...
