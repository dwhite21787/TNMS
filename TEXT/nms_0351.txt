Hello Fellow RUSH Fans!
	Just wanted to relate a small incident.  I received my copy
of Bass Player yesterday.  I was idly paging through it and low and
behold on page 15 I see a full page ad for Roll the Bones!  I was just
a bit surprised!  It is the album cover printed in black and white with
"RUSH" and "Roll the Bones" in red.  It also says something about the
new album taking the RUSH sound to a new dimension or something like that.
(I don't have the magazine with me right now.)
	Well, I'm sure that just made everyone's day.  :-()  But
really, it is good to see that the guys are getting some type of
promotion.  It is esp. interesting that the ad was in a magazine that
reaches musicians, not just the general public.  Hum, maybe records
companies do have a clue every once in a while!
	Good day, eh?

Hey! Does anyone know out there when the crew is supposed to be touring at

Philly????? And when these tickets go on sale?? After seeing them 3rd row
at the spectrum for Presto.... I'm definitely not passing this tour up!

[ I believe it's 12/3, the day before the Cap. Ctr. show.  Haven't heard
  about tickets... Donna?  :-)                                 :rush-mgr ]

Subject:  Rush at the Cap Center

        Of late, I've noticed some people posting information about dates
that tickets go on sale for some shows.  Much to my dismay, however, I've
also noticed that these people are letting us know about sale dates
well  AFTER the date has passed. The main reason I'm on this list is to
get info about shows and the like, but if people just post comments about
how tix "for the whatever show went on sale 3 days ago, and I got my
front row seats"  then there's no point.  I'd rather hear about sale dates
in advance than have people let me (and others, I'm sure) know about
the fantastic seats they got.

        So, what I'm trying to say, is that if you know of an upcoming
date that tix go on sale, FILL US IN TOO!  (This doesn't apply to those
people that got info, and didn't have time to let us know.)

        Luckily I haven't missed the sale date for Wash DC tix, and
I hope I don't hear about it too late by someone in the NMS who
camped out or something and got first row!

        Sorry if this sounds a bit bitter, but I really don't want to
miss out on getting good seats for the Capital center show.

P.S. The only show around here that i know of is at the Cap Center. If
anyone knows about shows at the Baltimore Arena, Please let me and others
know.

[ Last tour they hit Baltimore on the second leg, about 3-4 months after
  the Cap. Ctr. show.  They only filled 2/3 to 3/4 of the Baltimore Arena!

&gt;Oh and about the dogs, please stop it.  It's a damn sonar blip, I was the
&gt;first to say it and I will say it again, it ain't dogs but a blip.  And
&gt;yes I do have a good stereo, I have listened to it 5 or 6 times on a
&gt;Nakamichi 6 disc changer, 7 speaker sub woofer system in a lexus LS400,
&gt;and believe me there is no other way to hear it!  Awesome!

Did anyone think about the possibility that it is _both_ a dog _and_
a sonar blip? (Pretty good way to get two ideas in one sound!) I know
that Geddy has used his PPG synths to _combine_ sounds in at several
instances previously, most notably ``Red Lenses,'' wherein he combined
broken glass with a plucked string (cf. Keyboard, Sept. '84). Combined
sounds also occur in ``Afterimage.''

Subject: ged thinks about being red

A recent posting of &gt;&gt;dmtussey@miavx1.acs.muohio.edu&lt;&lt; about
(I believe highly bogus) claims of obscenities at the end of the
studio recording of Red Lenses, should be of interest to those
who like probing the meanings of lyrics. Namely, that in concert
Geddy occasionally _adds_ lyrics to songs -- lyrics which help
to clarify the meanings of songs. This is of course different
behavior from _changing_ lyrics in order to make jokes. In these
cases Geddy leaves the original lyrics fully intact and adds lyrics
in places where there originally were none. The first instance of
this was his adding ``Old Man'' (whom I take to be Ronald Reagan)
toward the end of `New World Man.' This week I got a p/g tour boot
wherein Geddy sings very clearly at the end of `..Lenses' the words
``i think about/ i think about --  being red.''

BTW if anyone has a theory as to exactly why the I in `Red Lenses'
is printed in lower case, I'd be interested in hearing it...

Well, I've been watching most of this list go by in bemusement
recently, but I did want to say, that I'm going to try to go to both
the Albany and NYC shows -- I just need to know when tickets go on
sale.  Right now I'm probably going with two other friends.

If there are more people going to these shows, perhaps we could get
together for a beer or something before the concert.  I can also sleep
a couple of people on the couches in my house (if you're quiet).  :-)

Subject:      Lerxst has taste (IMO)

Well, some of you may have written in about Ged and Alex being on the
cover of the new Guitar Player magazine (November 1991).  Here's a part
of the interview called Aural Gratification on page 48 that has something
to do with this tour's opener.

GP: What do you listen to for enjoyment?
GL: Alex likes Zamfir a lot.
AL: I get most of my influences from Zamfir {starts whistling}.  I think
    Eric Johnson's _Ah_Via_Musicom_ is a great record.  Normally I'm not
    big on solo guitar records.  They're showcases for someone's playing
    ability--interesting to hear once or twice.  But I really love Eric's
    style and songwriting.

That's all I'll transcribe for now, but I'll say they have quite the sense
of humor, eh?                Craig Rindy aka...you know.

Subject: Opening Acts

   Hello all!  This is my first post to TNMS, but I would just like to comment
about the opening acts.  I am only fortunate to have seen Rush once, but the
opening act did not get booed off the stage.  I saw the Presto tour at
Reunion Arena, and Mr. Big put on a damn good show.  The fans responded well
to their talent.  Of course each person playing a solo got old, but the fans
were still real responsive.  Of course the roof almost blew up when Rush
finally did hit the stage, but they were civil during Mr. Big.  I also heard
from a friend of mine that before the AC/DC concert in Dallas, they were
playing Rush just to fill for time, and that the fans were extremely
responsive to that too.  Almost more than King's X that opened for AC/DC.
Oh well, just another tid bit of info to show that the support is still
there.  Anyone know any dates for the Southwest yet?  Primarily Dallas,
Houston, etc?  Hopefully it is during spring break so I can do the tour of
Texas and catch all of their shows...

Subject:  LIVE UNDER PRESSURE...

Hi folx,
     In response to the person who asked about the LIVE UNDER PRESSURE cd
boot, I've had it for a few months... Actually, its not any new material.
Its really just the GUP TOUR video on a cd, with an exception of a song or
two (Something for Nothing)... Funny, but this cd boot, made by a company
called Metal Memory is ALMOST exactly the same as the TEMPLE OF SYRINX cd
boot, also of the GUP TOUR video, with a couple of songs switched around.
They're both produced in Italy, so its not a surprise they're alike (its
probably the same company). I have both of them. The sound quality is
quite exceptional, but remember, you're not getting anything new really...
     If your into cd boots, look for RUSHIAN ROULETTE cd. Its also from Metal
Memory, and is from the Pinktop Festival, 1979 (This has been previously
available in vinyl form, but still, its nice to have in cd form). The sound
quality is pretty good...
      On that note, has anyone spotted "RUSH - En Vogue" cd boot? No luck
for me in NYC on that. Anywaz...

Hey...

three whatevers in Dreamline (I personally don't think they're
dogs)...has anyone else noticed in Vital Signs:

	Everybody got the EVELATE from the norm....

What is the deal...it is very clear.  Is it just a screw up, is it on
purpose....Is there a word 'EVELATE' I couldn't find it anywhere.  Even
on some of the live stuff, Geddy appears to say EVELATE...
This has been bothering me for some time, so any comments would be
greatly appreciated....

Also- I do have the number to Atlantic records in NEW YORK.  They have a
list of ALL tour dates prior to Dec 16 (when the band goes on vacation).
 Anyone who is interested, feel free to email me at jsbh@andrew.cmu.edu

20 more days until I get to see Rush, 8th row Geddy's side in Pittburgh!!

Marillion Is an AWESOME group! That would be the Ultimate wet
dream-Marillion opening for rush! Me and my friend always wondered if
they ever opened for rush, since they thank them in their Fugazi credits.
I wish fish was still with them , though, but Steve Hogarth isn't that
bad. The lyrics aren't as great as they used to be, but they paint a good
picture. Fish is a lyrical genious.
So......Did I hear that Rush are going to Europe before they hit the west

Subject: Dreamline

    To finally set the record straight about this dog thing.  Once upon a
time someone created this tubular device that was bigger around on one end
than the other and had a cord hanging out of it.  When electronic keyboards
became more powerful, they began to include all sorts of nifty percussion
sounds on them.  They ran out of ideas for instuments to use, so they
sometimes included a sample of that tubular device I mentioned earlier.  If
you go to a music store and try out one of their more expensive keyboards that
happens to include this particular sample, I think that you will find that it
sounds incredibly similar to the three noises in Dreamline.  Incidentally,
the tubular thing was originally created to mimic a dog.

Sorry I don't have a RUSH quote, but I haven't been able to find the right
one yet.

Subject: ROLL THE BONES MEMOR. explained

Hey Everyone.
Well, do to the number of responses for where to get Roll The Bones
memorabilia I have decided to post the answers in the digest.
The best way to get the items is through a collecting magazine such
as GOLDMINE MAG.---this magazine has a lot of people advertising various
rare and collectible items but only through mail order. This mag. can be
obtained at small record stores (not Musicland or chain stores) or by
writing to Goldmine
           700 E. STate Street
           Iola, Wi., 54990
or calling 715 445 2214 ext. 244   , I think the current price is about
$3.50 an issue and you can get a subscription.
Another way to get Memorabilia items is through Record Conventions
where people set up tables and sell their items. This is probably
the safest because you can actually "hold the item" in your hand to look
and examine it. You can also do a little bit of bargaining with them too.
Finally, you can find these items in small 2nd hand record stores because
it is sort of illegal to sell promo goods but the small stores don't really
care too much about it whereas w/ the Main Chain Stores like Musicland
if one store gets busted that can put the entire Chain in jeopardy.

I hope the above helps, if you need more info you can email me direct.

ps: Prices: The Scroll should go for about $20 - $25
            The Press kit about $20
            Cd singles about $8.00 each
            Poster: about $5.00 but i got mine for my Bday. :)
               thanks Rikerman!
so they are not too cheap but those are the ave. prices.
good luck on finding them.!!!

Subject: Baseball and the "D" word

I'd like to start off by addressing all of you people who keep talking about
the World Series interfering with the Tour.  WAKE UP...How long do you think
the Series lasts anyway?  The whole thing playoffs and all will be rapped up
by the 23rd or 24th of October, even if it goes 7 games.  The Blues Jays sre
not going to make it past the Twins anyway and even if they did the final 2
games would be here in Pittsburgh because we all know the Pirates are going to
kick the shit out of the Braves.

Secondly, I would like to apologize for starting this whole controversy over
the sound in "Dreamline".  I never intended it to flame up like this.  It does
not matter what kind of stereo you have, or if you paid $4000 for a pair of
headphones, it is a matter of perception.  Please, I'm sick of hearing how
wrong I was, or even that I was correct.  It was just one person's opinion.

Thank You!! and Amen!!

has got to go!!!  I've been getting pretty tired of reading all the 
recommendations of
skipping out on EJ,  or that you "shouldn't get too excited" about seeing 
EJ open for Rush.
 I sort of expected more from Rush fans, being the superior musical 
intellects that we are.
 I saw EJ already in a small club here in little ol' Charlotte, NC this 
summer and as a
fellow musician and music lover, I would have to say that EJ's playing was 
nothing short of
incredible.

If your a fan of meaningful music, or anyone who won't mind that for 45 
minutes, there will
be no lasers or movie screens, then you'll dig EJ-I promise!!!  Please 
mail any other
questions to t-scottn@ingate.microsoft.com.  Thanx guys!  Oh, has anyone 
heard when the
Boyz make it too the southeastern area??  Talk tu me.

Just a little note to let the guitarists out there know that I
finished transcribing the tabs to YYZ and have sent them along to
Frank (schaaphe@serc.nl), our able tab manager.  I also have the YYZ
bass tabs but have not yet transcribed them.  If anyone *really* wants
the guitar tabs right now, send me mail and I'll get them to you.

Oh yea, and if anyone hears when tix go on sale for the 12/4 show
at the Capital Center, please post immediately!

Subject: RTB Tour and NMS

The tour is almost upon us and knowing that lots of Rush fans will be
going to pretty much the same shows in their respective areas, I've
thought about compiling a list of "Who's going where and when.." concert
for members of the MNS.  I don't know if this is a good idea or not but
here's what I propose:

1.  If you have a ticket to a Rush concert, email me with:
    a) Your name
    b) The date of the concert (listed on your ticket) and city.

2.  That's it!  If you want to meet other fellow NMS subscribers who will be
    going to the same show as you, I will email you the list of names of
    people who will be at your show.

I figured this would be a great way to meet some of the other people on
the list that you would probably otherwise never meet!  So hurry and
send me in your ticket info and let's all Rock.

Good day.

I don't recall if anyone's mentioned this before or anything but I
happened to notice in the liner notes of "Hold Your Fire" the
now-infamous "Gangster of Boats".  It says nothing about Part "X",
just simply "Gangster of Boats".  I haven't looked at any albums past
HYF, but I just thought it would make for interesting trivia.  Perhaps
a question for the Prattster via the Backstage Club?

Subject: Rush memorabilia

Hiya!  I was wondering if any of you knew any good places to get Rush
memorabilia, (e.g. patches, t-shirts, posters, pins, headbands, etc.).

[ See the post above mentioning memorabelia...               :rush-mgr ]

The FAQL mentions the Rush Backstage Club, but nothing else.  Anybody
know how their selection and service is like?

On another rather unrelated note, does anybody know where I could find
guitar music for 'Time Stand Still'?  The only music I've seen is the piano
music from _A Show of Hands_, but like most piano transcriptions, it doubles
the vocal line in the right hand and probably leaves out a lot of other parts
as a result.  Much appreciated!
