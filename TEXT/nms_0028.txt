Yes, that rumbling is there on the p/g CD.  I believe we had a discussion
of this a few months back...  If you've got a subwoofer, you can hear noise
there on the ASOH CD as well.

Subject: Alex on New release

	I was watching Much Music on Wednesday (Much is Canada's
MTV equivelant) and they were interviewing GOWAN.  This band is
out of Canada.  GOWAN, who primarily is a male vocalists says that
Alex plays on several of his songs on the new album "Lost Brotherhood".
He said he couldn't get Alex to go on their upcoming tour because he
was in another band.
	I haven't heard any of the songs yet, so I can't comment on
the guitar parts.  If anyone hears anymore let us know.  I believe
the first release (at least in Canada) is called  "All the lovers in
the world".

If I hear anymore dirt I'll pass it on.

I always interpreted it to mean "words by Neil, music by Alex & Geddy".
I read/heard in an interview that Neil goes off by himself, and Alex &
Geddy get together, and they all produce stuff.  Then they get back
together and see what fits with what; moods, etc.  Of course, I can't
remember the source...

I too have this on my CD.  For some reason, I just assumed it belonged there.
(Read that to mean 'too lazy to bother about it'.)  Maybe I'll go home and
check it against my album version of GUP; gee, it might pay off to have both

Yes, the Digests are archived to some extent; you can request specific
versions from the administrivia account.  We are currently attempting to
implement a more offical system of archival/retrieval, but it will have
to wait on a certain list member's getting out of their job and back to
school.  Hopefully we'll see an announcement sometime in September!

After receiving mail and seeing it in the list, I went back and checked

But speaking of boots, how about someone keeping a list of the boots

That sound was intentional on the part of the band.  They put it there.
It is on my vinyl copy of the album also.  I beleive it is supposed to

Subject: Last call for Washington DC RUSH party
Date: Thu, 09 Aug 90 16:03:05 EDT
From: David Arnold &lt;davida@umd5.UMD.EDU&gt;

Hi all,

    This is the last call for input on the potential RUSH party in the
Washington DC/Baltimore MD area.  If you are interested in getting to-
gether with other people interested in RUSH to hang out, listen to some
tunes (maybe even some officially released material :-) ), and have a
few beers/hamburgers/hot dogs/etc, this is your last chance to let me
know!

    I'm hoping this flies, sometime around the end of August/beginning
of September.  I've gotten a few replies, but have room for more.  If
you kept putting it off, don't anymore, because all further communication
will be solely via e-mail & phone, not through the Digest.

    I'm located about 1/2 way between Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD
(Laurel, for those who know the area).  It's a little over an hour from
Richmond, VA, and about 2 1/2 hours south of Philadelphia, PA.  If this
is a reasonable distance for you to travel (we're also semi-convenient
to Amtrack lines), drop me a line.  If you book early enough, I may be
able to arrange crash space for you.

    Those of you who have responded (and received a reply from me - if
you haven't heard back, I didn't get the mail!) need not respond again;
I've got your names & addresses on file.  I'll be sending out mail
sometime early next week, so time is getting short.  Friends are welcome
(within reasonable numbers!), as well as tolerant SO's.

    Hey all you folks that met at the Capital Centre show - consider it!

    Please reply directly to me, NOT to the list!

Until later,

I bought the album back when it first came out.  I must have returned
3 or 4 copies to the record store before giving up.  I figured that
it was a defect in the master pressing.  Anyway, I then heard the
same sound on the radio!  I figured that the defect was really wide spread.
I then heard the same sound in the *concert* !  After thinking about
it for a while (~10 sec) it finally hit me!  The sound (IMHO) is something
like rockets (ICBM's, maybe).  After all, think about the song title.

So, the sound that you hear isn't a defect, but a sound effect.

From: ronz@imager3.llnl.gov (Ron Zasadzinski)
Subject: The Fountain of Lamneth

Someone asked a while ago (quite a while ago I believe) about how
Didacts and Narpets fits in with the whole of The Fountain of Lamneth.
Here's my interpretation: The song in its entirety is a metaphor for
an individual's journey through life (up to a point: not as far as
death). The "Fountain of Lamneth" symbolizes a goal, perhaps the innermost
goal one is aware of.

The first movement _In The Valley_ describes
childhood: "I am new; [...] I am young. Sight unseen; life unsung."
The images conveyed at first are those perceived by a baby: "My eyes
have just been opened, and they're open very wide. Images around me
don't identify inside. Just one blur I recognize, the one that soothes
and feeds. My way of life is easy, and as simple are my needs." The
"one that soothes and feeds" would be the childs mother. As the movement
progresses the child begins to feel the pull toward that inner goal, feels
the desire to discover the purpose of life: "Yet my eyes are drawn toward
the mountain in the east. Fascinates and captivates; gives my heart no
peace. [...] I live to climb that mountain to the Fountain of Lamneth."
#1 is thus childhood.

The second movement is _Didacts and Narpets_ which I believe symbolizes
the educational phase of life. As discussed previously, Narpets is
an anagram for "parents" and a Didact is a moral instructor or the like,
i.e. a teacher. This movement is fast and confusing with shouted and
garbled words here and there. I think this symbolizes adolescence, when
the emotional realm is almost out of control. The confusion painted in
the song may also be a statement about education, that it is mostly
a bunch of confusing garbage, yet our teachers and parents insist
that we go through it (as they shout "LISTEN!" at the end). So #2 is
adolescence and secondary school.

The third movement is _No One at the Bridge_, and describes disillusionment
with the world one has been taught is real and the ensuing panic and
confusion. "Crying back to consciousness," describing entering
the "Real World" after finishing the educational phase, "the coldness
grips my skin. The sky is pitching violently, drawn by shrieking winds."
These words describe coldness and confusion perceived in the world.
What the individual was taught was supposed to bring freedom, but in
fact it only binds him: "Save my ship of freedom. I'm lashed, helpless,
to the mast." His thoughs drift back to when he was eager to take
control of his life "Remembering when first I held the wheel in my own
hands, I took the helm so eagerly and sailed for distant lands" but now
things are too rough and he feels lost and abandoned "But now the sea's
too heavy. And I just don't understand, why must my crew desert me
when I need a guiding hand?" He cries out for guidance and help, but
there is none. #3=disillusionment with the world after finishing education.

Movement 4 is _Panacea_. Here the character finds an apparent escape in
a woman. However, it is really just a lure, pulling him farther into
the ways of the world and way from the truth he seeks: "Panacea, liquid
grace. Oh, let me touch your fragile face. Enchantment falls around me
and I know I cannot leave. Here's a meaning for my life, a shelter from
the storm. Pacify my troubles with her body, soft and warm. Naked in
our unity, a smile for ev'ry tear. Gentle hands that promise me
comfort through the years. Yet I know I must be gone before the light of
dawn. Panacea, passion pure. I can't resist your gentle lure. My heart
will lie beside you, and my wandering body grieves." Here "lie" can be
seen as having two meanings; 1) his heart will lie beside her, meaning he
will stay there, and 2) his heart will be lying to itself if he stays,
as he is defying the inner pull to find the truth. This is further
supported by the last words "and my wandering body grieves", his body
wants to continue the search and is grieved to give in to the
worldly lure.

Movement 5 is _Bacchus Plateau_. Like _Panacea_, the title is
very indicative of the content of the movement; drunken behavior and
no movement (toward the goal). "Another endless day. Silhouettes of
grey. Another glass of wine. [...] Long nights, time out of mind."
The character feels the inner pull surfacing, knows that he has
denied it in the way that he chose to live his life: "Crimson, misty
mem'ry, hazy glimpse of me. Give me back my wonder. I've something more
to give. I guess it doesn't matter. There's not much more to live."
The memory of something greater shows itself for a moment, but like
we all have experienced, in the "drunken state" while one is subject
to the world, one won't go the distance to move forward, to break out
of our routines and get on with what we know is the true path. In
apathy we remain prisoners to habits, concepts, and lies. "Another foggy
dawn. The mountain almost gone. Another doubtful fear. The road is not so
clear. My soul grows ever weary, and the end is ever near."

Movement six, _The Fountain_. Somehow (which isn't explained), the character
breaks out of his plateau and finds himself almost to the top of the
mountain: "Look, the mist is rising, and the sun is peaking through.
See, the steps grow ligher as I reach the final few. Hear, the dancing
waters; I must be drawing near. Feel, my heart is pounding with embattled
hope and fear. // Now at last I fall before the Fountain of Lamneth. I
thought I would be singing, but I'm tired, out of breath. Many journeys
end here, but the secret's told the same. Life is just a candle, and
a dream must give it flame. //  The key, the end, the answer, stripped
of their disguise. Still it's all confusion, and tears spring to my
eyes. Though I've reached a signpost, it's really not the end. Like Old
Sol behind the mountain, I'll be coming up again.// I'm in motion. I am
still. I am crying. I am still. I'm together. I'm a part. I'm forever
at the start. Still, I am."

Isn't that awesome! That is one of the most under rated Rush songs there
is (along with Cinderella Man and certainly a few others). Neil is
so able to put into words the way life really is. I find this song
extremely profound anyway. Those last few words are absolutely true:
"Though I've reached a signpost, it's really not the end. Like Old Sol
... I'll be coming up again. [...] I'm forever at the start. Still, I am."
We are always moving. At no point do we ever reach a Final Goal and then
retire from life. Every moment is a new beginning, a starting point
for something. The words "I am still. Still, I am." are very meaningful
to me also. It is through stillness (of mind and heart) that the truth
is actually known. In stillness our true individuality is revealed.
And no matter what our external circumstances may be, that reality, that
truth is always present: "Still, I am."

Jeff O'Hare expresses a concern that there is something wrong with

"Distant Early Warning".  Well, I checked on my cassette of the
same album, and sure enough, there is a crackle on it, too!  Does
anybody else have a copy that's like this?  Maybe there was a bad

supposed to represent, though... I don't know.

From: Donald Cross &lt;CROSS@ucf1vm.cc.ucf.edu&gt;
Subject:      'Distortion' on Distant Early Warning

The crackling sound that one hears on Distant Early Warning has
really provoked a lot of thought from Rush fans...I once heard
Geddy Lee on RockLine talk about it.  He said that the sounds were
deliberate, and were generated by one of their programmable synths.

Many people find the crackling, static-like noises at the beginning
of that song to be very distressing, thinking they are a screw-up.

However, I have always really liked them in that song...here's why:
The song's lyrics start off thus:

   An ill wind comes arising
   Across the cities of the plain
   There's no swimming in the heavy water
   No singing in the acid rain

When I listen to these words, I think of a desperate cry from the
ruins of a decayed civilization, and the sounds of static indicate
a voice struggling to get through the radio noise...
for some reason it reminds me of the scenes of the future in the
movie The Terminator where bands of humans are communicating via
radio to coordinate their battles against the machines gone mad.

This is something of an abstract image, and a very subjective one,
I'm sure.  I'm not sure anyone else will agree with it, but hey,
that's what music's all about!

Don "Quixote" Cross

P.S.  "Rocinante" was indeed the name of Don Quixote's steed.
In fact, in medieval Spanish, the name comes from Rozin "old hag"
+ ante "before".  The name is meant to imply (if I am interpreting
Cervantes correctly) that the horse was just an old useless horse
which came to glory only after Don Quixote took him as his
proud steed.  At any rate, I have always loved this allusion in
Cygnus X-1 and Hemispheres.  By analogy, the protagonist of these
songs becomes the romantic dreamer, driven by desire to explore,
and the Rocinante is his ship carrying him to the black hole...
