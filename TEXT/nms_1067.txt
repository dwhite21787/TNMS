Welp, looks like I lost about 40 posts or so... I'm trying to recover them
from a backup tape but it'll take a few days. They were *ALL* posts sent on 
March 8/9, if you think your post was lost feel free to send it in again, but
like I said I should be able to recover them.

Now it's time to prepare for yet another storm.. :-)

Are the people voting on the grammys required to listen to the records they
are voting on ?

I saw a program a while back about the cannes film festival which stated that
it was not uncommon for the jurys voting for awards to have not seen the film
that they are voting for.

Just a thought.

Subject: You know you're a true Rushnik when...

Greetings again from 'Bina's merry abyss...

I loved Sylvia Smith's idea of having a Rush song for one's wedding
processional.  I hate "Here Comes The Bride" anyhow, and I nominate
"Closer to the Heart" for the perfect Rushnik wedding song.  First
dance?  "Time Stand Still", naturally.  (Or maybe play that during
consummation.  Chuckle...)

Other ways to tell if you're a true Rushnik...

You refer to the right-wing American radio fatty as "Limburger" so's not
to confuse any lovers of great Canadian Rock.

You begin your day with a friendly voice...namely, Geddy's on "Spirit of
Radio."

You attend a pagan gathering because you just love "Mystic Rhythms".

You buy a Pan flute after hearing "The Temple of Syrinx."

You refer to all flicks as Moving Pictures.

You get into Walt Whitman because of "The Body Electric".

You hum "Big Money" whenever you pass a bank.

You knuckle under and read Ayn Rand just because the Boys are said to be
inspired by her work.

You think of the job from hell as "Red Sector A".

You make regular pilgrimages to the Orbit Room.

You start reading Coleridge because of "Xanadu."

You decide to try the Rhythm Method of birth control.

You buy Rubbermaid stock because it sounds like Neil bangs on their wares
in "The Rhythm Method".

You watch the Three Stooges because the guys open A Show Of Hands with
the Stooges theme.
I'm sure that others can add to this list!

'Bina.

From: rush0132@collective.cais.com (rush)

I would like to respond to the comments by D. Brunberg made in TNMS #1063.
 I am a first-time poster soooo...

I was first introduced (kudos to J. Chan for pointing out that almost
everybody is "introduced") to Rush by my cousin in 1979 with 2112 (I thought
the waterfall/stream in the background was sooo cool).  As soon as I got
home (he lived in WA, me in MA) I promptly bought and wore out three copies
(1 vinyl, 2 tape) of 2112.  Now, of course, I have it (as well as all the
other albums) on CD, so it never wears out.

Back to D. Brunberg:  thanks for starting an interesting topic, but I would
like to politely (no flaming here) disagree.  IMHO I don't think Neil ever
had a strong commitment to Ayn Rand and her philosophy.  Some points to
ponder:

  o  In the FAQ, Neil is quoted as saying the resemblence between 2112 and
and A.R.'s book "Anthem" was not on purpose.  If 2112 was based on "Anthem"
I would think he would say so.

  o  I think the lyrics to "Cinderella Man" are totally counter to the
philosophy of AR.  Philanthropy(sp?) has no part in her world.

As for Neil's transition over the years, 1 small point -- Circumstances and
Roll the Bones have similiar themes.

D.G.

P.S. - Anyone want to start a conversation on whether AR's philosophy is
bunk?

Subject: ULTIMATE RUSH COUNTDOWN

     Well, here it goes.  All 116 songs.  This is my RUSH ultimate coundown
     for my radio show here at Loyola Marymount University.  The countdown
     started on February 2, 1995 and will probably finish in the first week
     of April.

     DISCLAIMER:  I realize that many of you will disagree but it is very
     difficult to discern one song as better or worse than the other.
     Also, if you asked me to make a countdown a year ago or a year from
     now it would probably look very different.
     Thanks for your time  Any ideas for future Rush radio shows...please
     e-mail me.  I like hearing from all of you guys and gals!

     There it is Ladies and Gents.  Please e-mail me your comments both good and
     bad.  I'd appreciate it.  Do you think the band would like a copy of a show
     or two?  I have all the shows on tape.  Look out for the alphabetical
     listing in a future posting.

     Here is the album countdown based on this song coundown.  I took each album
     and added up the songs based on where they appeared in the countdown  For
     example, Moving Pictures score was computed by adding 1+6+9 etc.  Then I
     divided by the number of songs on the album to get an average for that
     album.  Moving Picture's average was 33.3.  I called this the Listening
     Enjoyment Percentage (LEP).  LEP is the average song placement for each
     album.
      The lower the number the better the album because the higher the songs
     appear in the countdown.

     ALBUM                              LISTENING ENJOYMENT PERCENTAGE (LEP)

Okay folks,
                         SIT DOWN.

Oh, pardon me you already were!
What in the heck is the deal with that old rumor (pardon me for bringing it
to the surface  AGAIN!!) That there were satanic slurs in live
'back-maskings' of Rush songs, and that the whole message of Rush was/is
anti-GOD etc.
I really drew back when I first heard this, but have since laughed it off and
got on with enjoying all those tasty vittles on Counterparts, 'Bones', and
Presto.
WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS RUMOR,   PLEASE.  anyone?

You better sit down for this one:

Time: Power Windows Tour
Place: Brendan Byrne Arena (East Rutherford, NJ)
Players: Me and a security guard
What was I doing: Trying to get backstage

After a great show in the first row, I decided to give it a shot.  I take
out an ID card I got through the mail that says "PRESS PASS" (indicating
I am from the press and supposed to be given special privileges).

	"Nope," says the concert security guard, with a grim look on his face.

	"C'mon," I plead.  I'm still holding up my badge.  I should have
demanded to go backstage based on the First Amendment (Freedom of the Press).

	The guard shakes his head.  "Forget it."

	I reach into my pocket for Plan B -- money.

	"No way," he tells me, with surprising confidence.

	With another twenty-dollar bill I show in his face, I decide to
mirror his cockiness -- "C'mon. Don't fight it!"

	"Go home"

	"You want another twenty?" I reach into my pocket but he
interrupts this action.

	"Leave or I will call the police!"

	So I leave.  Before this merry conversation, I told my Rush buddy,
Barry, to wait for me outside.  When I get outside of the arena, I begin
to look for him.  It took me twenty-five minutes to realize that Barry has
stranded me.  In retrospect, I think he assumed I got backstage and went
home jealous.
	I can still see myself, sitting on the curb of the littered and
abandoned parking lot, reading the tourbook.  When I sobered up from this
realization, I took a $90 taxi ride home.

	This concludes the first of four concerts I attended in one week,
three for Rush and one for The Firm.  Each has a story of its own,
strange yet memorable.

Subject: Flaming a flame

  Hello fellow fans
      I couldn't help notice the post that was a parial flame.  One fan
mentioned that Alex's last name was the only one that could be spelled
using elements.  Someone else criticized him wrongly.

    lithium = Li
    iron =    Fe
    Sulfur=   S
    Oxygen=   O
    Nitrogen= N

  You don't just use the first letter of the element, as was suggested by
the flamer who said "there are several elements that begin with 'e'"
  If we did, chemists the world over would be confounded, not knowing
what element someone was talking about.
     As a chemistry major, i couldn't let this glaring error go untouched.

    As far as Rush content, I am glad to see some old dinosaurs floating
around out there. I have followed the band since pre-MP, so I guess you
could call me old-school.
    Someone mentioned "Before and After" the other day.  I think that
song is arguably the best on the first album.  The intro is pretty cool
and the lyrics are not nearly as cheesy as say "Take a friend," "what
you're doin'" (which absolutely rocks!),or "in the mood"  (all great songs,
but come on. Just listen to the lyrics. You can't help but giggle now and then)

No cool sig for me.

Subject:      Peart Pearls

Hey NMSers!

In the latest issue, someone commented on the change in Neil's lyrical
style, and the decreasing number of "Peart Pearls" (quotables for
e-mail sig-files) in recent releases.  I kind of think that his writing
has improved and has been fairly steady since Hold Your Fire.  My
reasoning is that he is now writing from life experience, and from a
much wider range of literary sources.  In much of his older material
he practically stole alot of words from various authors.... he didn't
really as he's always admitted sources, but there have been times
where his lyric is so close to the source, that the source should have
been noted in the album.  (i.e. Xanadu - Kubla Khan, Limelight -
Shakespeare).  I think his writing has always been fantastic, but I
would bet that many of the older Peart Pearls have sources in the
works he drew his inspiration from.  In more recent material, I think
he draws on ideas from literature, but he now has more life experience
with which to interpret them, and more ideas of his own to include,
and so his lyrics contain more of himself now than in the past.  Back in
the 70s, I think he would have been lost without his literary sources,
but today, I think he could sit down and write something that is quite
mature and thought provoking, drawing primarily from his own imagination
and experience.  He has improved.

I've seen debate about the Ultradiscs quite a bit... actually just
questions and responses.  I think that if the album had a digital
master tape, which everything since MP except p/g had, then as long
as the regular CD was made from a digital copy and not an analog one,
there will be no difference in sound quality between the MF gold discs
and the regular CDs.  If there have been analog copies in the chain
between the original master tape and the regular CD, then the MF gold
CD should sound cleaner.  On older albums, the orginal master tape was
likely not used for the regular CDs, and so the MF gold CDs should sound
better, but (in my humble opinion) the sould quality of those albums
probably doesn't warrant the expense.  I'm not saying that the production
is bad.... I love the bass guitar sound in Hemispheres, and AFTK is a very
clean recording, but kind of thin in places.  It was pretty good but not
the best of it's time.  If anyone knows where one can determine whether
analog copies are still used to make CDs where the original master tape
was digital, I'd like to know.  It happened in 1983 with Billy Joel's
Nylon Curtain, and CBS/Sony corrected it.

and after reading for awhile...

Hey folks - another first post, and from a woman no less.  I must first
say how happy I am TNMS exists (thanks Rush-Mgr!).  As soon as I think I
have seen just about everything here, I see a little bit more.

You knew this was coming - my Rush history and favorite records in 150
words or less.  I was 13 in 1981 when r n' r entered my life and with that
came MP.  I thought Tom Sawyer was the COOLEST tune, even bought the 45
before the record.  My first show was the P/G tour and as of now I have 9
shows under my belt.  I don't sleep on cement for tickets anymore but I
will run through a department store like a lunatic to get to the
Ticketmaster window,(with my pal Eddie Vedder at my side).  I remained an
average fan until 1990 when I started dating a guy who,lived and breathed
the band and took me along for the ride.  Once again I realized how
fantastic this band was and I have stuck ever since.  The guy has been
asked to move on, but I digress...my favorite albums/songs for this week
include CP (Nobody's Hero, BS&M), PoW (Territories), Signals (Analog Kid),
and PeW (Entre Nous).  2112 and Hemispheres are great for me when I am
watching something like hockey (Go Wings) on TV.

Some personal junk and I am done.  I live in the Detroit area (no we will
not hurt you) so we get 2 shows pretty much guaranteed every tour.  Alex
even made the comment during one of the CP shows, "great to be back here
for the 90th time".  I feel for you folks that have to travel great
distances to see the band, or get skipped altogether.  Sometimes this town
really pays off.  I work in purchasing so I am on the net frequently and
deal with email all the time.  I would love to hear via email from fellow
Rush heads, and my mailbox is never too full for anyone who wants to chat.
I feel I know a decent amount about the band and their music and I am
always willing to hear more.  Lately I have been into collecting magazines
and interviews as well as bootlegs here and there.  The music of this band
has been around for some rather pertinent events in my life and it always
will be.  It's cool to be a part of this classy group of fans.

See ya...Ginny      ak385@detroit.freenet.org OR gragazzo@k12.dserv.com

	When I met Geddy and Alex at the HYF tour show in Buffalo, they each
left in cars which may have been their own. Geography lesson:
Buffalo-Toronto=short distance.

Subject: Re: 03/07/95 - The National Midnight Star #1064

	Due to spring break, I'm just now responding to #1064, which is one
of the better issues I've seen in awhile:
	1)  As a fan of Pink Floyd, I was thrilled when I found out that they
were nominated for the "Best Rock Instrumental" grammy along with Rush.
Both bands have
been equally overdue for a grammy.  (Actually, you might say that PF was
even more overdue, since their first album came out 7 years before Rush's
first.)  I have faith that Rush will eventually be recognized.  As
Springsteen said, "You hang around long enough, and they just give these
to ya".  Heck, Clapton ruled for 30 years before they finally recognized
him!  Anyway, what I'm saying is that Floyd and Rush fans are in the same
boat in many ways, so _please_ put away the rusty (Rutesy?) knife.
	2)  I will agree totally that there are _many_ other fan lists that
discuss their respective bands in as much detail as the NMS, but that the NMS
_is_ the most flame-free that I have seen.  (Hey rush-mgr, do you edit out
flames?)
	3)  I'm not much of a guitarist (I'm a drummer), but I think that the
reason that the guitar intro to "Cold Fire" sounds country-ish to so many
people is that it's played on a telecaster.  Alex rarely uses one, and
they're _extremely_ common in country music.  I always thought of it as
sounding more Stones-ish, but Keith Richards also uses a tele and is very
country-influenced, so I see the connection.
	4)  I absolutely cannot believe that people are flaming the guy who
posted the "rumor" about the Rush country album!?!?!?!?!  I mean, even if you
believed the whole concept, how could you believe those song titles?!?  I
loved reading it, and appreciated the effort put into it.  I hope that
people on this list never stop contributing clever humor for fear of
being flamed by the sarcasm-impaired.
	5)  For whoever posted all that Echolyn stuff:  Who's paying you??

Date: Sun, 12 Mar 95 17:08:00 PST

Guten Tag fellow Rush fans!

I've just started reading the NMS, this is my first posting, and I enjoy it
alot.  Before I start, a) Rush became my favorite group after I heard Tom
Sawyer b) My favorite album of all time is Moving Pictures (or maybe
Hemispheres or Counterparts or...) c) I've never really liked that naked
dude in front of the star (you guys know what I'm sayin'!).  Anyway, I'm in
the Air Force over here in Kaiserslautern, Germany.  All the Rush fans here
including my bud, Freddy "Geddy" "Gus" Webb in particular, were seriously
disappointed in the band's decision to blow off Europe last year.  Surely
this couldn't have been the band's decision?!?  I have a theory.  I believe
that Rush is becoming sort of the "Henry Cameron" of modern day rock.  They
are being unjustly ignored and pushed aside by the present
"alternative/grunge/techno (European)" music movement.

Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm the world's biggest Rush fan--I've seen them
on every tour since Signals--I've even seen certain tours more than once!
 But, did anybody notice that Rush's last 3 studio albums did not go
platinum?  I'm kinda worried.  In this day and age, if your band's album
does not at least go platinum, you're in trouble--I'd say that your band is
in financial trouble.  I mean--they blew off Europe on their Counterparts
tour!  Incredible!  Maybe the band doesn't have the financial backing they
once had in the late seventies and early eighties?  This worries me.

I thought Counterparts was their strongest album since Moving Pictures--it's
incredible!  But after talking to some "Rush fans" (not "Gus", some say they
were disappointed--just read some of the NMS submissions.  Hmmmm....  Public
opinion is a very hard thing to figure out--so I don't try or even care, but
I do care when public opinion steers the fate of our favorite Canadians!

I think the idea to release a CD of remakes of their own classics should not
be pursued--they should concentrate on new material.  Hell, maybe they
should start thinking about writing a 30-minute opus just for grins.
 Wouldn't that be something?  The idea of a live album of old classics is a
great idea, but it won't sell--again, they should concentrate on new stuff.

I'd appreciate some feedback.  I'm at kimp@scilan.usafe.af.mil.

Subject: Cool story (IMHO)

Good day.

I want to pass along a coll story.  The year was 1987, and Rush was touring in
support of Hold Your Fire.  I had already seen the show in Cleveland (actually
Richfield), but I had heard an announcement on the radio that there was to be a
show in Cincinatti.  Alas, the tickets went on sale on a Friday morning, instead
of the usual Saturday morning sales.  Every Rush fan that I knew was unable to
get tickets, as we all had midterms on Friday morning.  So we resigned ourselves
to the fact that we would miss the Cincy show.

On the day of the show, I went to the apartment of my friend, Paul, to watch a
bootleg video that he had recently secured.  Suddenly, Paul came up with a blast
of spontanaiety.

"Dude, why don't we drive to Cincinatti and buy tickets off of scalpers!" he
said.

His thought was that we would get a better price right before the show, because
the scalpers will be desperate to unload the remaining tickets.  I had just
filled the tank in my car, so we said good-bye to Columbus for the evening.

On the way down, we cranked Hold Your Fire, which, given the speed that I was
driving, was the only tape to which we had time to listen.  We screeched to a
halt in a space at the very top of the parking garage.  As we got out of the
car, we saw two guys being lead away in handcuffs.

"What did you guys do?" I yelled.

"They got us for scalping!" said the taller of the two.

Our worst fears were realized when we heard that undercover cops were nailing
scalpers all night.  Any scalpers who had not been caught fled the scene.

"Dude!  What'll we do?" Paul asked.

What could we do?  Sneak in?  Go home?  Cry?

I then noticed the woman who was selling tickets.  She was about my age, and
rather attractive.  I decided that I would perform the politically incorrect and
sexist act of hitting on her, with the hope that she would find me irresistable
and let me in without a ticket.

At first, she seemed interested in my charm.  In fact, she even placed her hand
on my leg at one point.  I gave her our story, and with my best boyish grin,
asked if she could let us in without a ticket.

"No way!" she said, "I like my job!"

I still maintained my charm, as I did not want her to think that I was simply
trying to con her.

"Why don't you just buy a ticket from me?" she offered.

"Isn't the show sold out?" I asked, with great surprise.

"It was, but a few friends of the band didn't show, so I'm allowed to sell the
tickets that were reserved for them!"

Our seats were located at Stage Left, in the first row.  We were standing and
screaming from the first chord of Big Money to the last chord of In The Mood.
At the end of the show, as the band were leaving the stage, I jumped up onto my
chair and waved to them.  Neil nodded, Alex waved and Geddy gave me a "thumbs
up."  I saw Neil turn to Alex, and I read his lips.

"Who's that guy?"

Well, that's my story.  Forgive me if it was too long.  I've got a few more, so
I welcome your feedback.

Subject: Peart Picks (drum licks!)

	I read Dennis Pupello's post about his favorite drum parts, and I had
to first give Dennis a nod of agreement, and kick in a few of my own absolute
favorites! I was always a huge fan of some of the more syncopated
patterns Peart has done, like (you can add these to the list):

 - Red Lenses (a totally underrated Rush classic!)
 - Mystic Rhythms
 - Territories (it took me over a year to get this tune out of my head, and I
		think it is coming back right now --damn!)
 - Scars (is it one Peart or 20?!?)

	As far as fills and breaks go, my top 3 would be:

 - The improptu breaks on La Villa (live) with cowbells and chinas.
 - Natural Science (all of them)
 - The first couple of bars of Digital Man (I now use this fill to test drumkits
for playability)

	IMHO, Peart has grown a bit tiresome and anaerobic during the last
couple of years, but he is still light-years ahead in terms of signature style
and solid cold-cranking percussive angst.

Hi everyone!
I really got a kick out of reading these You know you're a Rush fan

when I accidentally came across a Rush tunen on the radio and HAD to play it
loud!  I've even done the "sit in your car until the song is over", which my
family just accepts now.
I came up with some other odd things that a Rush fan (Me) would do:
	-You go into Sam Goody, Tower Records, etc. and flip through the "R"
section, just to see what Rush Cd's they have.  I also do this in hopes that
someone will notice where I'm looking and say "Wow, I love Rush!"
	-You watch farm team hockey leagues for 5 hours on ESPN just to hear
five seconds of YYZ or Where's My Thing when they cut back from a commercial.
	-You wish you had gone to Fisherville Junior High School in the
'60's.
	-You only have to say the name "John Rutsey" and everyone laughs
their asses off.

A few years ago someone posted a YKYARFW on Prodigy, and I wish I'd saved

actually, he did mention her in the liner notes of 2112, it says something

Here's just a little story I feel like telling .
 When I back home , I used to take guitar lessons from a guy at my

staff , I got a rep as being a big Rush fan . Anyways I found out that when
my guitar teacher was my age ( 17 ) he also was a big Rush fan . The only
difference was that when he was 17 Tom Sawyer was only about a year old or two
old , and when I was 17 Roll The Bones was about two years old .
  Anyways , when I gave up the lessons ( had to , I was going away for 
university ) he gave me a present . He gave me a picture that he painted/
drew 10 yrs ago when he was still big into Rush . And he gave it to me cause 
he thought that I would like it . It's a great picture . It's from 2112 and

 Hello fellow fans!

  You know you are a RUSH fanatic when...
1. The dashboard in all of your friends' cars bear the knuckle imprints
of repeated attempts to emulate Mr. Peart's percussive handi-work.
2. Fuzzy dice on a rearview mirror make you think of a certain RUSH song.
3. You buy a dalmatian and plant a red fire hydrant in your front lawn.
4. You actually own a copy of the "Dogs playing poker" painting.
5. You love to post all of your thoughts to a group of people whom you
probably have never met, because they listen to the same fantastic group
you do.

ah well, `nuff said.

 --Rod.

This is my first post, but when I saw this I knew that I had to say
something. First off, Lifeson can indeed be spelled with the very elements
that were named. Lithium= Li Iron=Fe and so on. Europium is Eu. Elements are
NOT named by the first letter of their names. After all what about Telerium
and Tungsten and Tin? ( Te, W, and Sn). Some elements are named after
archaic names for them ( for example iron=Fe which was Ferrium.) Why on
earth didn't you check a periodic table? You'd think that before someone
creates a  flame, they would check to see if they are right. This is not
intended as a flame of a flame, just a correction. By the way, the best
concert that I have ever seen in my life was Rush on March 23, 1994 at the
Cleveland Coliseum. I had fourteenth row seats, and it was great! ( Required
Rush content). I hope in the future, we won't go off half assed anymore!
By the way here's what your combinations come out to be:

Plutonium   -    Einsteinium  -  Americium  -    Radium  -   Technetium
Plesamrath (pronounce that!)
Lawrencium-Europium-Erbium
Laeuer  (Kind of sounds like a last name.)
Lithium-Iodine-Fermium-Europium-Strontium-Oxygen-Nobelium
Liifeesono (italian ?)

Subject: Anniversary Video

I thought Andrew Logues suggestions (TNMS 1067) of a compilation video would be
worth a go if we can get enough enthusiasm going.

Being a UK based I've probably only seen less than 1% of all Rush material
outside of the released videos.

So how can we move this forward?

The only clip I have is:-

Alex Lifeson Interview on the Old Grey Whistle Test - BBC 1985

Like I said, probably less than 1%.

Regards,

Dave

Subject: First single

To Lynn Hernandez:

The A side of the first single is Not Fade Away and it may have been recorded
by Bo Diddley, but it was Buddy Holly that originally made it famous. The B
side was a still unreleased Rush track called "You Can't Fight It". Sorry to
have to correct you, but I spent so long trying to find the copy of it that I
bought that it is a very important issue with me. Four hundred dollars is
more than I spent on it, but it could go for much more. At one point, John
Rutsey himself sold copies of it along with an autographed picture for $800!

To those of you searching the globe for it: it's out there. Just keep
looking. Try small places all over the country. You'll find it.

Also, I am still lookin for the PeW and AFTK tour books. If you have one to
sell me, let me know. Also, does anyone have a Neil Peart banner that Tama
drums gave away for free in '85? I would love to own one.

Later,
Lee
