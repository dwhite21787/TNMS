Bill and Steve played on older live recordings that may have been used (BBC,

Phil IS a better drummer but I still would rather meet Neil, given the choice.
I recommend to those who aren't steeped in Genesis to procure everything from
Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (`74) through Duke (`80), especially the live
recordings (Seconds Out `77). Atlantic Records has issued remasters on CDs,
but thank God for used vinyl ( remember records?).

As an European Rush-fan I can't stop singing the last verse of 
`Territories' to myself these days: Europe is at war!

Just to remind us:

`They shoot without shame / In the name of a piece of dirt / For a 
change of accent / Or the colour of your shirt / Better the pride that 
resides / In a citizen of the world / Than the pride that divides / 
When a colourful rag is unfurled'.

Obviously he hasn't.  But that isn't the question being raised here. 
This thread has been about Ryan's honoring his customers by fulfilling
their orders as promptly as possible with a quality product.  The
morality of bootlegging is another thread that, ultimately, each person
must decide for themself.  If you believe that it unfairly takes money
away from the band, then that's fine with me.  I used to think the same
thing, and I realize that there are no concrete arguments for my side.  

I'll offer up two instances where the band has spoken on bootlegs. The
first was a text interview I read with Neil.  He was asked about the
performance of Bad Boy from theLadyland broadcast of Dec. '74.  Neil
responded with (not verbatim quote, but the same meaning) "So, you
circumvented our rights, supported piracy, and purchased a bootleg?  I
thought as much, but we'll forget about that."  I believe this is on the
NMS site somewhere.  The second was Geddy on either the DS radio
premiere, Atlantic Records fancast, or the DS Rockline.  Geddy commented
on bootlegs in regard to his producing the live album.  He said that it
was hard for him to feel driven to produce the album when he knew that
fans out there had boots of the tour already, but at the same time he
understood that boots are very important to some of the fans, and
admitted to having owned boots when he was younger (presumably of The
Who?), and understood that these same fans were always there for new
official stuff on release day.

I favor trading over buying, as I don't think anyone should profit off
of live recordings except the band. And for the record, everything at
Scarred can be traded for from other people on the net.  However, if you
do wish to buy a recording along with quality packaging, then Scarred is
THE safest place to do so.  Let's not ignite the old bootlegging thread
again.

Great theme.
Hands DOWN, this is and always has been my ultimate favorite Peart 
lyric:

"Cities full of hatred, fear and lies-
"Withered hearts and cruel tormented eyes-
"Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise-
"Beating down the multitude, and scoffing at the wise."

In fact, that might be my all-time favorite Rush song as well.

Zilla! Go to every local used music store and get as much as you can on vinyl!
You won't be sorry, and SO cheap! Then cut your own tape (through a BBE
processor extremely recommended). DS may not come out on tape ever (or vinyl,

G'day all,

I thought it was a great aussie tradition to abbreviate words (eg afternoon
becomes "arvo", lottery becomes "lotto") but we seem to have a new
one...Ultimate Peart Lyric becomes UPL !

I just had to chuckle...

To keep those interested up to date, Lyrics from "Power Windows" (and
especially "territories") seems to be in the lead for the UPL.  Very apt
considering the state of affairs in Kosovo.

Anyway - keep them coming! Remember - limit to 4 lines.

Like a snake coming out of the darkness :), I'll unlurk long enough to
post about Ryan W. and Scarred Records.  I ordered a copy of SPINNING
YEARS (a DT boot compilation, with c. 8-10 CDs compiled onto one MP3
cd) and had it within a week and a half, and this was a few years ago.
4 weeks' delay for a bootleg is pretty good; hell, I sometimes take
that long or longer for "elaborate" trades.

Spock's Beard -- after hearing "The Good Don't Last" I was sold.
Great band, and not coincidentally they're one of Mike Portnoy's
favorites.  They have a new one out, too, but I haven't gotten it 
yet.  I'm preparing a massive order to Laser's Edge.  :)

My single favorite Rush lyric is also shockingly topical today:

Better the pride that resides

Even when I used to just turn on the radio and listen to new Rush on Q107 or
CHUM-FM, lots of Rush music had to grow on me. I'd buy the newest album, often
with a bit of disappointment initially, only to discover I couldn't get the
melodies and bits of lyric out of my head until I memorized the whole thing,
like every other album. It's cool to turn on a memory like a CD .

I tried to go to the Scarred Records home page and it was no longer

Hola Rush fanatics,

So I've been silent for a while.  It happens.  Classes are starting to catch
up with me.  I have enjoyed reading all about the various virgin Rush
moments, so here's mine:

It was '92, my freshman year in high school.  I was in the marching band,
and we would have various competitions across the great state of Indiana.
On such an occasion, one of my drumline comrades handed me his walkman
during the return trip from an upsetting defeat in Carmel.

Before I knew what hit me, I was being slammed by Tom Saywer.  All I could
think was, "Wow, that drummer is good!"  I was hooked.
 ---

On another note.  It's pretty common (not to mention a good idea) for kids
to learn a musical instrument at an early age.  I started piano lessons at
the tender age of 4, and started drumming at 12.  Music has played a
critical role in the education of many younger kids.   And for a majority of
children who start around 4 or 5, they have a tendency to achieve higher
grades and develop better academically. -

No big deal, Colin. I'm just jealous. My earliest memory was from when I was 
3. Ain't no way I could have played or understood a damn thing. I had no 
contact with the actual instruments of rock music until I was like 14 when my 
friend Jeff got an electric guitar for Christmas. You can see how deprived I 
was.

Subject: Anality, and RushIntro

Hey,

How's this for anal:

	1.  Rush CD's not a part of regular collection.  They are isolated and
organized all nice and pretty like.  Like some, I burn a copy of the cd for
car use, and keep the original untouched.  Dont want them to turn out like my
first copy of HYF.  That was ugly.

2.  I had my wife get me a DVD player for christmas, just because there was a
rumour that the video for DS would only be on that format.

As for the intro to Rush:

High school as a whole was my intro to Rush.  The drumline in the HS band was
a sort of Rush cult.  YYZ and TS were the gospel according to Neil, and
subsequently MP was the bible.  I was reluctant to listen.  I was into bands
like Jesus Jones, Mary's Danish, and Information Society.  Then as a senior, I
was dating a girl who was into Rush.  Roll the Bones was the tour of the day,
and she brought RTB with her on a trip to the beach.  Ghost of a Chance was
the song that finally turned me into a Rush fan.  Imagine that..a girl
converts me into a Rush fan.
Well, I have the whole collection, and am considered by most of the people in
the bands that I play in, a Rush Freak. OK by me!

Subject: The Next Buddy Rich. . .

I was flipping the channels the other day before work and came upon what
looked like a public access presentation of some sort.  There was a guy
standing in front of a drumset, interviewing the kit's owner.  The kit was
large (20+ pieces) and had about 10 cymbals of varying sizes and shapes.  The
interview was over and it was back to playing, so I stayed tuned.

20 minutes later (by now, I will be late for work) the guy stopped playing the
kit.  There was an older man accompanying him on keyboard and accordian; yes
accordian.  The small crowd watching applauded politely, not fully realizing
what they had really just witnessed.

The drumming was sensational - clear, precise, deliberate and complex.  Not as
"musical" as a Neil composition but that was not this drummer's agenda - he
was just showing his chops.

Maybe some of you have heard of this guy.  His name is Jacob Arnon - and he is
about 10 years old.  His dad was the accompanying musician.  The audience was
5th graders.  I was FLOORED!  In fact, seeing this kid whack away like that
made me realize just how far I have to go, just like when I walk away from a
Rush show.  AMAZING!

I am not easily impressed by drummers - I have seen Portiny (just can't spell
his name) and Bozzio in clinics over the last year.  Both were good and did
some incredible things but didn't wow me like a Neil, Carter Beauford - or a
Jacob Arnon.

I asked myself after if I was just wowed because the kid was, well, A KID!
Yes and no.  If Neil had played what the kid played; no real big deal - I
expect that from a seasoned pro like him.  From a Bozzio (and I am not
knocking him), well, it would have been a better show than his clinic.  And,
no, I couldn't play everything Jacob did on that show.

The show was produced by the L.A. (I believe) public school system. The kid is
certainly in the right place to showcase his talents - LaLa Land.

Remember the name - Jacob Arnon.  Or was it Arnen.  Damn. . .   ;)  Doesn't
matter - we'll all know it one day!

This post could be miles long with all of my "favorites" that Neil has

Sawyer.  As overplayed as that song is, I still must turn it up to
maximum volume and belt out along with Geddy every time (after air
drumming with Neil's solo):

"No, his mind is not for rent

"CMW" responded to "Ike's" comments about Primus.  I too was at the show
in Minneapolis and thought Primus was pretty cool.  Had never heard them
before, their music was "funky" (sorry for lack of better words) but
came away with a better appreciation of Primus, esp. when I heard that
they really admire Rush.  Awesome concert, but not as good as good as
TFE - that was absolute nirvana!  2112, Natural Science, Analog Kid,
sure hope they have another album or two and tour still in them!

I have thought for a while now that the Subdivisions beginning and

sounded similar. More copyright infringement?  ;)

Subject: Will Rush ever be on VH-1's Behind the Music

     Unfortunately, the answer is no.  Don't get me wrong I would love to 
     see it but the bottom line is people just don't know who Rush is.  
     Especially the VH-1 crowd.  Plus if you've noticed there is a thread 
     to all the "Behind the Music"'s.  In the middle of every show there is 
     some sort of tragedy.  Either the person gets into an accident or they 
     get into drugs.  Sometimes both.  And in the end of the program the 
     person has gotten over this with a new sense of renewal and could 
     never have been happier.  This is not the case with Rush.  I know you 
     are thinking what about Neil's recent tragedy but that has occured in 
     the tail end of the band's career.  Plus ofcourse, people don't care 
     about Rush.  They are not acknowledged by the media.  There is a 
     chance that Rush would make the stations Legend's series but don't 
     count on that either.  Really it's too bad.  This amazing band that 
     has done something so special, so different, so well, has been such a 
     diamond in the rough, will go virtually unnoticed.  I don't like The 
     Greatfull dead yet I understand their legacy.  Unfortunately because 
     of the media's stupidness, other music fans will never know who Rush 
     was, what they were about and what made them special.  How sad.  Sure 
     it is their own fault or maybe their own desire.  But when something 
     this great, this once in a century comes along, you'd like to think 
     that the media would find them and show them to us and teach us how 
     great they are and what they meant even if the band doesn't advertise 
     for itself.

I didn't note who asked about this, but i had to respond.  _The Masked
Rider_ was an excellent book.  of course, Neil is an amazing writer
anyway (as if anyone reading this is not aware of that fact).  I read it
on the plane ride to South Korea where i'm currently a professor of
English.  It set the perfect tone for my time here and my explorations
of myself "unmasked" and without context.  It's a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
READ!

On the same note...  I know that Neil has written other books, one of
which is only available through him and not the publisher.  How on earth
could i get my hands on that?!?!  If anyone has a clue, PLEASE email me!

These are my favourite Peart lyrics:

No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent

I think the last two lines speak volumes about Rush--and their fans.

It is just a coincidence that the lyrics came from the same album...

You can check out http://www.cd-plus.com. They have a fine selection of
Canadian music. I would also suggest you check out 54-40's latest,
"Since When...". It is ALOT more "folksy" then their last few
cds.....but the songwriting is just damn fine!! Speaking of which, why
aren't more of you Rush fans talking about great NEW and upcoming bands
instead of the "sameoldsameold".???? There is SO much GREAT NEW music
out there...heck..just check out the TNMS "Mars on the Horizon" section.
The Tea Party..Our Lady Peace...Creed...Depeche Mode. Actually, I
remember hearing "Tragic Kingdom" the song from No Doubt at the T4E show
here in Toronto, just before the show. Their NEW tune DAMN well
rocks...and VERY much reminds me of mid-80's Rush...with that ska
sound..but heavy guitar. Kinda like "The Police" meets "The Sex
Pistols". Oh ya, and if any of you think that just because some of these
young drummers are "new and trendy", they aren't worth anything, thats
pretty close minded. Do you think Neil sits around and listens to Kansas
and (insert 70's dino band here).??? Think again. Now..before you go
thinking I am some "youngster"...I was raised on those same bands too.
But, even as a 30-something guy, I STILL dig ALOT of NEW music...and 95
percent of what I listen too is just such. Anyways...IMHO...

Subject: So many threads, so little time...

Guten Tag, Rush Fans!
	This is my first post in quite a while. Being on spring break this week
has allowed me to catch up on my NMS's, so I thought I would weigh in on
some of the current threads. Here goes...

1>First Rush experience: August 1992--I was at high school band camp when I
ran into a friend who had MP blasting on the stereo. "Tom Sawyer" was just
ending and he began to explain the storyline to "Red Barchetta" as it
started. Can we say blown away? This song, imho, is one of the more simple
compilations of Peart lyrics, and yet it remains my favorite. I think this
song appeals to me because of its ability to stimulate the senses, its
"push the envelope" attitude, and, simply, it was the first song I
associated with Rush. Which leads me to...

2>Favorite 4 lines of Peart lrics:
"Wind in my hair...
 Shifting and drifting...
 Mechanical music...
 Adrenaline surge..."

3>1st Rush concert: TFE Tour. Atlanta. 9 December 1996. I don't know if
this was the last concert at the Omni before it was demolished, but if it
was, it was an awesome going-away party! Three men, raw power, thousands of
screaming fans, and, of course, great music.

4>Goosebumps: As an aspiring bassist, Geddy's solo in the DS version of
"Driven" just does it for me. 

Well, I had better stop before I end up giving my $0.03. Thanks for
listening. Let's hope for a quick return of Rush to the studio! Later...

You know, it's not THAT hard to swivel your way into a rock
bands/musicians life. You just gotta keep at it. Thats how I got to meet
Alex for the first time. It was through Tom Cochrane. Tom invited me up
to check out the recording of his cd "Ragged Ass Road" (in which Alex
plays on 3 tracks), and I still remember sitting in Tom's lovely
studio/den in Oakville, Ont., having a beer with Tom, Bill Bell, and
Lerxst. Mind you, it was funnier watchin Al trying to play golf to show
us he was a better player then Tom, with Tom's wife's cats ball-toy
thingy and a piece of a cymbal stand. Anyway, if there are any "Andrew
McNaughton" types out there...c'mon...share the goods!!!
