Due to the fact that Syrinx crashed sometime last night, yesterday's
NMS (#331) may have gone out to some people twice.  Apparently since
several queues were not quite done processing when the crash hit, when
I rebooted this morning Syrinx assumed that none of the mail was sent,
and re-ran the whole queue(s).  Also, the special edition (part 2 of
the FAQL) never got out, so I'll send it out this evening.  Instead of
it being in issues 330 and 332, it's in issues 330 and 333. (Half-satanic?)

Just a few points that I hope haven't ben brought up in this issue.
I don't think they qualify for the FAQL..

I am also pretty sure that the items will be brought up eventually...

1. Who's the kid on the cover of RTB?
2. What's the significance (if any) of the declining number on the dice
                  on the cover in RUSh?
3. Is there any significance to the pattern that the dice are in under
                  RUSh?
4. Does anyone have any idea what"Gangster of Boats"is? I assume that
                Part IV of the trilogy is just a dumb little piece of humor...

In addition, Billboard magazine reports that the album will be supported by
an EXTENSIVE TOUR...

In  particular, and I can't help but be a bit selfish, I am especially
interested in DC and New York City tour dates. I will relay what I hear.

	Now, I'm only responding on gut reaction to this question,
but I think I have an idea of what it might be.  Of course, feel
free to prove me wrong if anyone knows otherwise (everyone else
does!)...

	Anyway, the NSF replacing "free parking" could stand for

fittingly cynical for Neil to imply! Not that I'm down on cynicism,
I happen to find it very comforting.....praise "Bob" (oops, sorry

     I'm looking at the tiny little CD cover for RTB, and unless I'm
wrong, there are one (maybe two) little "dice skulls" there.  Check
out the die one up and four in from the bottom right corner; kind of
questionable.  The other possible is the die three (and a half) in
from the bottom left corner, very dark.  And that kid is dangerously
close to breaking his mother's back.  :-)

As a longtime fan of both Rush and the Fixx, I have to say that
Rupert Hine's influence is definitely rubbing off on the Boyz.
A lot of the stuff on Roll The Bones sounds like I imagine the
Fixx would had they kept Hine as a producer after _Walkabout_.
Given that we know from interviews that Geddy has listened to
the Fixx, I guess it's to be expected that with Hine as
co-producer, they'd move toward that kind of a sound.  However,
I don't think it's a good direction.  I sincerely hope Rush finds
another producer for their next album, even considering the fact
that I like RTB a lot at first blush... oh well, back to the
barnyard.

Count me in as someone who thinks that Alex did a damn fine job on this
album.  Almost all of the solos are longer than the Presto solos, which
seemed too short for me.  The first time I listened to every solo on this
album, I held my breath, hoping that Alex would play for awhile, instead of
the 8 bars and out philosophy of Presto.  As for hearing other songs in
"You Bet Your Life" (like "supercalifrag..."), the first time I heard
the intro, I sung "Shiny Happy People" over the top, and it fit just fine.
It doesn't bother me that it fits, but is kinda weird!

Subject: Re: 09/03/91 - The National Midnight Star #329

Here's my story of how I came to receive RTB:

 I went to a nearby local record store with my CD boombox.  They were not only
out of copies, but eight people were waiting in addition.

 I went to another nearby CD shoppe and saw many copies, all over the store.
I bought it, and also bought Mark Wood's "Voodoo Violince" (that's another
story).

 I went out to my car and popped it in the CD player and pressed play and
listened to it on the way home.  I was struck on how similar the guitar tone
on "Dreamline" is to "Vital Signs" from Moving Pictures.

 I understand, somewhat, what they want to do now.  Rush is no longer a
"Progressive Serious Music Band" - they're trying a bit more to be a rock and
roll unit.  In fact, some of the progressions wouldn't have been out of place
on the first Rush album.

 I can't say I'm entirely happy with the album, but there are a few intriguing
glimpses of something they're heading toward that I'd love to give them a hard
shove in the direction they're already heading.

 First of all - the production.  Rupert Hine and Mr. Tayler did a similar job
to Saga's "Heads or Tales" album, so I was used to the tinny high end, thuddy
bottom end, and all around oddball production.

 The guitar sound is predominantly single coil pickups - both for lead and
rhythm, and acoustic strumming for rhythm stuff.  The leads are more
discernable and drenched in the cavernous fjord echo Alex has become known
for.  His tone, however, is slightly thin (single coils again), and it sounds
like some of the solos are mixed somewhat low.  The content ranges from
"typical" to "good".  We're not gonna here Vai chops because that's not what
Alex is all about these days.

 I liked how some of the songs that had a four chord progression resolved on a
strange chord, or at least one that is not as typical as one could expect,
then went into the next section of the song.  This is where Geddy shone.

 Drums:  I liked it how Neil managed to stick one of his trademark "Cattle
Stampede" drum fills in some of the more commercial songs.   I approve.  It
makes him more interesting than just a drum machine keeping a straight beat.
Plus, his straight beats are more varied and interesting than a lot of
drummers'.

 Bravado has a very smooth straight beat - this from the king of the "drummers
who don't sit in the pocket" a lot of the time.

 Synth sounds range from what sounds like a bulgarian horn section to the odd
sampled orchestra hit (what someone referred to as "Yes Synth Blasts")
actually harken back to Kate Bush' "The Dreaming" and the ubiqitous "ORCH5"
Fairlight synth sound.

 I liked the rap section in the title track.  The bass sound used in that
section could cause stomaches to flop nationwide.  Very, very* solid.  I want
to know what synth they used for that.  The drums are the typical New Jack
Swing kind of beat (however, not using the swung 16th note triplets they could
have), and the harmonized voice (processed one octave down) is kind of
amusing.  Someone was right - only an uptight white boy who has listened to
"Bastille Day" one too many times could be offended by this.  "Why did they do
it?"  WHY NOT!  Music is supposed to be fun, not some kind of funeral dirge.

 I do, however, miss a lot of the sweeping time changes of the older stuff.
But they've moved on.  "Where's my Thing" is kind of cool.  Alex, white as he
is (love that CD photo of him - looks like an older Keifer Sutherland with
hives) can actually funk out.  It does, however, sound somewhat
underdeveloped.

 Anyway - more comments later.  I gotta think.  Love the album artwork.

Subject: songwriting and HYF

I also don't see what people have against _HYF_. I personally see
it as the pinnacle of the band's career (so far and in not _all_
respects). I, like others, seem to prefer the pre-Hine albums and
are sensitive to the top-40ish edge to the last two albums. If the
boys have learned from the experience, great. For example, I think
Ged's vocals have gotten better by an order of magnitude during
the last two albums. But the songwriting `lessons' are definitely
a double-edged sword, IMHO. On the other hand, I love the sheer
energy of the album and the ``The Weapon''ish guitar work of several
songs. I'd like in retrospect to see RTB as the _Signals_ of the
new period of Rush: an album with some nice songs and experimentation,
but adopting a style (top-40) which is just a little unnatural,
how ever enjoyable. But, as I said in my previous post: it may
have a commercial feel, but it's Rush and I like it!

Gregg

p.s. as for my comment about the Fins: I called them `heretics'
not heretics, meaning that the song `Heresy' applies. Rush
ain't my religion! I meant that they were acting as repressive
conservatives trying to put a blanket on people's joy.
p.p.s. also I meant only to critices the triumvirate who
initially flamed the new album, not _all_ Fins!! For one thing,
Finland is one of the few places which sponsors a regular conference
on quantum logic!!

Well, I must say that the album cover and layout is possibly their best yet,
but otherwise the music contained inside is REALLY BORING. (IMO, remember)

What happened, anyway? They don't seem to have an edge anymore.
It used to be I could find just as many people who hated Rush
as people who love Rush.

Now, it's like people think Rush is ok, without really feeling
strongly either way.

I can't find anything wrong with this album, it's actually got e
good songs on it, but it's not interesting or exciting.
I won't start on the great guitar work throughout the album
that sounds like it was sampled from previous albums.
Or the fact that Geddy & Neil seem to be missing in action (although
they have a heck of a standard to live up to.)

But of course I'll be first in line to buy concert tickets...

I think Alex has been listening to Eric Clapton.  At least, I
get that impression from Ghost of a Chance.

and after 2 more listens, I'm even more convinced that while it may
have been good for the band to work with Rupert Hine, he's just not
the guy for the Boyz.  Or at least he's not the guy I think is for
the Boyz.  Which probably isn't relevant.  oh well.  Fnord.

Maybe this is fairly obvious but the preponderousness of dice in 3's is
obviously a reference to the fact that the band is a trio.  If you
look at the inside Rush picture, the threes are carefully arranged so
you see the one on the other side (3 musicians = 1 Rush).

Now I haven't figured out what the disintegration at the bottom of
the cover pic means.  Has anyone counted the rows to see if they
correlate to # of songs on album or # of albums?  Maybe Rush is thinking
of adding more (or less (shudder)) members?  Just a thought.

Hello all,
Got a few things to respond to.

From: "Douglas G Schwabe" &lt;cschwabe@unix.cis.pitt.edu&gt;

&gt;The cassette is a DIGalog cassette.  This manufacturing process links state
&gt;of the art digital mastering and duplication directly to the finished analog
&gt;cassette.  The cassette sounds great!!!

Hey, my cassette sounds good too!  Taped from the RTB cd!  8)

From: Glenn M. Mason &lt;glenn@welchlab.welch.jhu.edu&gt;

&gt;I just finished to the complete _Roll_The_Bones_ release, and I
&gt;am disappointed to say the least. It *really* does sound like
&gt;RUSH is trying to break into the pop scene. RUSH has changed over
&gt;the years, and I have changed with them and have liked mostly
&gt;everything that they have done, but my first impression anyway
&gt;is that I think they may be losing me at this point. It has taken
&gt;some time for some of the previous CDs to grow on me, but somehow
&gt;I really don't see that happening with this release.

Pop?  I don't think so.  I mean, can you see "Dreamline" in a "Hit Block"
with Paula Abdul's new video on MTV?  I don't think so.... 8)

From: Chris Schiller &lt;chris@cdc.hp.com&gt;

&gt;OK- Let's start the speculation:  The boy on the cover looks like
&gt;Geddy's son (Julian?) from the DEW video, but 7 or so years older.
&gt;How old is he now?  Shouldn't his nose be getting big at that age?

That was my first guess.  I think Geddy will probably confirm it on
RockLine...any news on when Rush will be featured on RockLine?

From: Tony "R." Rice &lt;trice@vttcf.cc.vt.edu&gt;

&gt;Geddy makes a reference to the movie Spinal Tap during the RTB premier.
&gt;During the conversation about Gangster of Boats Trilogy Part 4, while the
&gt;DJ inanely talks about them breaking new ground with such an effort, Geddy
&gt;replies
&gt;   "It goes to 4th"
&gt;
&gt;I fell down rolling with laughter!
&gt;
&gt;Geddy is referring to the cult classic movie "This is Spinal Tap" where the
&gt;lead
&gt;guitarist speaks of his guitar amp (which normally is numbered 1 to 10)
&gt;   "But these go to 11"

You're right!  That was funny.

&gt;Also,
&gt;
&gt;   who is the lad on the cover of RTB?  Could it be Geddy's son Julian?  Any
&gt;guesses?

I already made mine.  8)

From: wbarry@cory.berkeley.edu (Bill Barry)

&gt;A few more odd observations:
&gt;Ghost of a Chance kinda sounds like rewrite of Open Secrets.

Nope.

&gt;Doesn't Nuerotica seem to sound like Def Leppard's Hysteria a little?

Nope.

&gt;Apart from these quirks the rest of the album is great! And who is that
&gt;"chatting" man?

I think it's Alex.  When _Presto_ came out, I taped the "that's nice" part
on to a 4-track, sped it up a little, and sure enough, it was Alex!  The
"mystery rapper's" voice sounds a lot like that.

&gt;RTB? I like it. The song reminds me of a funked-up "Show Don't Tell",
&gt;with "Presto" style acoustic choruses. And I think the rap section
&gt;works just fine. (I have a sneaking feeling that the rapper is Alex.
&gt;It sounds a bit low for him, but the fact that there are drums and
&gt;keyboards in that section but no guitars suggests to me that they
&gt;wanted him to be free to take the microphone if they play it live.

Good observation.  I'll have to check that at the Hamilton show.  8)

&gt;Although how they'd manage the electric/acoustic guitar changes I
&gt;don't know.)

Via The Omega Concern, no doubt!

&gt;From: CP_PWM%CMS.BRISTOL.AC.UK@VTVM2.CC.VT.EDU
&gt;   Point of trivia: On studying the album cover a friend pointed out
&gt;that the number 3 crops up regularly (to symbolise the 3 members of
&gt;Rush I presume).

You're just noticing this fact with this album?  8)

From: Atthe Tossavainen &lt;d37690r@kaira.hut.fi&gt;
&gt;Face it guys, the album does suck big time, they've decided to be just
&gt;another rock band. There's no need to stick the Rush label on this one,
&gt;it might just as well be AC/DC or Rolling Stones or Guns'n'Roses or any
&gt;three-chord band.

Yeah, I can see it now...Axl Rose singing "we will pay the price, but we
will not count the cost".  Keep dreaming.

From: bigal@wpi.WPI.EDU (Nathan Charles Crowell)
&gt;	I have to say the guitar work in Ghost Of A Chance is
&gt;incredible.  That solo is so expressive and well-executed, I
&gt;was completely impressed with one listen!  Even though, the song
&gt;has kind of a dark opening riff, the chorus is beautiful.

That opening riff was in my head all day yesterday!  When I got home,
I learned it.  (Not that hard.)  I'd tab it out here, but alas, no time.

Sorry about the length.

Keep rolling the bones and party on!

Subject: guest rapper and lady dark

        During the CD launch that was aired out of Q107 Toronto last week,
Alex stated that HE did the rap to which Ged immediately replied: "He (Alex)
didn't do it."  So unless Ged isn't telling the truth, Alex can't be the
mystery rapper.  My guess would be that some road crew member did it.  After
all, no credit is given to the rapper which leads me to believe that someone
close to the band is responsible for it.  I could be wrong, perhaps we'll
never know.  Perhaps Neil did it.  That's a possibility I suppose.
        Also, not only were the balls on HYF replaced by leg bones and
wishbones as someone else stated, but the double meanings from Moving Pictures
are prevalent on RTB too.  On the back of MP, there were people making a
moving picture, people physically moving pictures, and people reacting to
the "emotionally moving" pictures.  RTB has the obvious dice (bones) which
are rolled, a rolling skull bone, leg bones rolling through a window, and
if you want to stretch it, the kid on the cover is "rolling his bones" as
he ambles down the walkway.
        For some more conversation material, perhaps someone could tell me
who Lady Dark is.  I've heard of Lady Luck, but never a Lady Dark (until
now of course).

[ Hmmm, I missed this reference, and I don't have my CD today.  Where is
  "Lady Dark" mentioned?  In the "thanks" section of the liner notes?  It's
  not in the lyrics...                                             :rush-mgr ]

Subject: That's no elephant, it's Rupert!

	I dunno if I like where Rupert's heading off to - everything seems
so polished and packed full of noise (not sound, _noise_). Several of the
tunes on RTB are great, and the rest are good, at least IMHO I wouldn't
call any of the tunes a "filler".
	Two things I find _very_ interesting : 1) Rupert worked with the
Fixx & Tina Turner, and 2) I heard that RTB was initially released to
metal-oriented radio stations. I hope (and I believe) that Rush haven't
decided on a "target" market for their work, but RTB didn't continue along
the path I thought they might follow after Presto. Presto really boils my
blood - can't sit still when that's playing!
	I think that the tunes on RTB are basically good, but I ould
like to see them live. I think that if they strip off some off the fancy
trappings and rough up the edges a bit, all of the songs will gain a
bit more soul/passion. Yow! When's the tour?

Subject: Band X, god, the tour, and subliminals...

Yes, If RTB were by another band, what would I think? I've been wondering
about that question... The album does have a commercial flavor. I like
the lyrics, though. (I don't beleive in god either). The riffs are
catchy, but maybe a little too catchy. I am looking forward to the tour
since this album is back to more of just bass, guitar, and drums w/o the
need for lots of digitized stuff. I think they'll have a lot of fun on
this tour, maybe they'll loosen up and do some real jammin'

Noone mentioned the skeleton in the water yet. The CD book is a little
short, but you can see it on the outside longbox. It similar to how
subliminals are done, skulls in the icecubes, the letters s-e-x. etc...

Didn't Alex say "it goes to fourth" ? I'll have to listen to it again...

I would first off like to ask all of those who believe that this is
commercial garbage, the album that is, what would you have liked to hear?
Which album did you want them to repeat or redo.

I think that this is the key.  This album still sounds like RUSh, but
different enough to be a new album.  No two albums are going to sound the
same, thank goodness, and I really find it hard to track your
disappointment.

Guess what everyone, the album sounds new and different!!!  Is it such a
shock.  If you are so homesick for the past, please put your copy of MP
or PoW in your RTB CD case and live with it.

This is not intenede as a flame, nut I feel that is you dislike this
album for those reasons, then you liked RUSh for all the wrong reasons in
the first place.

    -=-

"Now it's dark!" is from Blue Velet, a great film, (I'm a big David Lynch
fan).  If any of you have noticed this, in a number of the older studio
videos you can see an Eraser Head poster in Le Studio, and I have seen
photos of Alex wearing an Eraser Head pin.  I would assume that they are
David Lynch fans also, and decided it was about time to pay tribute.

    -=-

I really doubt that it's julian on the cover of the album.  He has to be
alot older by now.  I do think he is in the Show Don't Tell video, he is
one of the kids in the classroom.  I can't guarentee it, but he looks
alot like the kid in DEW video, only older.

He does not have the same nose as ged, it looks more like his mothers,
but he does have his eyes, you will know what I mean if you see the DEW
video.

    -=-

Yeah I hope they come out with the poster of the wishbones also, they
look great.

There is no suprise people that the dice are tured to the number 3 side,
or that there are 3 bones or wishbones.  It's not just similar to HYF,
but so many other albums have had the same message.  PoW has the three TV
sets, and MP has three pictures on it.  I even believe that the three
rabbits on the top of the hill on the presto cover symbolize the band,
the middle one up in the hat, like neil on his drum kit!

The fact that they may be positioned like the bals on HYF is interesting,
but I was expecting the theme of 3's!

Subject: Roll The Bones rap

I'm listening to (what else?) Roll The Bones and thinking about all
the comments about the "rap" section in the title track.  I'm not
vehemently for or against rap; I don't listen to it myself, but I'm
not going to condemn it as "anti-music" or anything, either.  Anyway,
what the Roll The Bones bit reminds me of is Blondie's Rapture song.
Both songs use rhythmic speech as vocals, backed by original, unaltered
(not scratched or repeated, but "live") music.  Not to mention the
humour inherent in both...  :-)

Subject: RTB ramblings (or my .02$)

   Well, I've listened to the album several times and wasn't planning
to submit my perspective, but due to the generally positive reaction RTB
has received so far, I've decided to throw in my lukewarm .02$. I'll try
and keep it short.
   The album certainly has some catchy tunes (roll the bones, face up and
you bet your life) and some welcome spirited guitar work, but this latest
attempt by the boyz overall is too mainstream and top 40 sounding for this
rush fan. I agree with DEGE@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu (NMS.331) when he says that
Rush is taking a chance trying to make more mainstream music with a rush
flare (hmmm.. power trash?).
   Well, this album left me dissapointed. I'll still try to see them on tour,
and hopefully a good selection of old material will be played to remind us
of what used to be.

Hey, I have now listened to the album a few times and ... and ... I like
it.  Mind you I still think that it has it's problems (TOO POLISHED, and
too well produced, not to mention DDD = Dumb Digital Drecht (IMNSHO) ;-))
but I am sure it will grow on me soon enough.

On with the subject line:
I am truly upset with the band for using the pictures of themselves in
the sleeve.  These are pictures from the same photography session used
in RUSH - _PROFILED_.  That means that these pictures are about 1 year
old.  I was hoping for something new... oh well.

Also...
The cover and other pictures are truly fantastic.... I would love posters
of these.... as a matter of fact, I may call Atlantic today.

Subject: The Mystery Rapper, etc.

There has been a lot of speculation about the identity of the rapper.
Well, I suugest you all read the liner notes. Rupert Hine is credited
for backing vocals.

I usually find that I have to listen to a new album several times
before I can really compare it with a group's earlier work. My initial
impression of RTB is positive, but it remains to be seen where it will
end up in my personal all-time ranking of Rush albums. Right now, 2112
and PeW are in a virtual tie for the top spot. I must admit to not
quite understanding the instant dislike expressed by the Finnish
contingent. Come on guys, don't take it so seriously! Music is an art
form, and if YOU like it, then it's good for YOU. If you don't like it,
then listen to something else!

There have been a few comments recently about Paula Abdul's song
"Rush Rush". There also is a video running on MTV for "Rush" by Big Audio
Dynamite II.

Has anyone besides me noticed the TV show "Fly By Night", and wondered
if the person who named it is a Rush fan? I'm pretty sure the show is made
in Canada. CBS runs it at 10:30 PM Thursdays here in Chicago.

Joan Jett-Notorious
