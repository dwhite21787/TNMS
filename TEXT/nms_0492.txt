Sorry -- I didn't mean 'get bent' in the official flame sense, more of
in the bart simpson sense. What do you *expect* saying 'get a life' to
fantical Rush addicts, anyway?! :^)

I'm rapidly becoming one myself -- I think Hold Your Fire is an
incredible album, and I'm getting into Perm Waves (about a bad
haircut? :))/Moving Pics/Exit--Sage Left compeltely. Signals hasn't
penetrated fully yet, but I love Subdivisions -- it sounds to me a lot
like Genesis, the most Genesis-sounding song they've done. Can anyone
point out songs that lean towards other bands like this?

Alex has a *lot* of The Edge as well as Andy Summers in him -- songs
on the PW/MP albums sound a lot like Summers, where some songs on
Chronicles use effects like The Edge has used. But, Alex gives it a
unique, harder edge than even The Edge. Has Alex done any acoustic
pieces like Steve Howe's _The Clap_ or Steve Hackett's _Horizon's_? I
would be tempted to check out an album with something like that next.

Well.

It sure is nice to have TNMS going again, isn't it?  (Hi, Meg!)  I noticed
a few questions in TNMS that deserve comment:  (names of people who asked
have been deleted because I'm lazy)

&gt; Anyway, there is a point to this post... :) My album (Got it on vinyl
&gt; for a steal! :)) has entrirely different lyrics to 'Freewill' than are
&gt; sung -- hopefully someone can clue me in on why this is so.

--

&gt; Now... I've got a question... What ever happened to Gawain and the
&gt; Green Knight?  I've heard that It's remain are what we know as Anagram.
&gt; Any definate answers?

Both of you, check the FAQ.

Subject: SAVE A DRUMKIT (drummer included!)!!!

Hello everybody,

   This is my first post to the NMS!  I have been reading the NMS for
about 5 months and I enjoy it!  As a BIG Rush fan since 12 years, I have
seen the boyz play here (Quebec City) since the Signals tour and, of course,
each show was a outstanding performance!  As a drummer, I am always
impressed by the constant improving and original playing of the Professor.
I'm playing for a local band and we play a LOT of Rush songs (Xanadu, LVS,
Red Barchetta, The Big Money...)  Unfortunately (!), I am completing my Ph.D
very soon and I will go to work as a postdoc at the University of
Arizona in Tucson.  So the question is: What will happen to my drumkit ?

I have an almost complete Neil Peart setup, including chimes everywhere,
temple blocks, cowbells, timbales, triangle... (sorry, I don't have
tubular bells --&gt; $ big money $).  I DON'T want to sell it!!!  Sigh!
The solution: FIND A BAND TO PLAY RUSH SONGS (and more) IN ARIZONA!!!  If
you are interested, PLEASE contact me as soon as possible!

I expect to arrive at Tucson in next January.  I can also play many songs
of Genesis, Yes, Marillion, Pink Floyd...  So, if you can play bass, guitar,
keyboards or whatever, I'm looking forward very much to your mail!

&gt;I saw Rush both at the beginning of the RTB tour and near the end of it.
&gt;During the second leg of the tour, they added the following songs:
&gt;
&gt;	Analog Kid
&gt;	The Trees
&gt;	Vital Signs
&gt;	Ghosts in the Machine
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Did the Police play a couple dates on the tour?? :-)  :-)

Does anyone have any info on a RTB show that was broadcast in the UK on Radio 1
a few weeks ago??  I'm very interested in obtaining a mint copy if it does
exist!!  Any info would be much appreciated!!

Big Time Thanks,

Subject: Rush at Alpine Valley

Hello All,
	It's nice to be able to sit here and read NMS again!!! (THANKS MEG!).  I
was lucky enough to see the boyz play at Alpine Valley, after already seeing
them in November in Minneapolis.  Got to meet Jimmy (Hi, Jimmy, thanks for the
loot and did you give the boyz the cool RUSH needlework?  Good thing I noticed
you dropped it huh?)  Anyways, EXCELLENT concert, nothing like hearing Rush in
the outdoors!  Once again the nerf arrows were flying and Neil amazed me once
again with his solo (I swear he added a LOT to it since November, and it was
six and a half minutes long then!!)  The Trees was a nice surprise that got
everyone to go crazy.  It was cool to hear them play at least part of all of
their instramentals (correct me if I'm wrong but I thought that I heard all of
them :).  I didn't notice Neil doing his windmill imitation but I could have
easily missed it (Jimmy?).  Anyone know who it was that Alex went over and
kissed?  Was it his wife or what?  I found that rather humorous... Alex just
walking over to the area on the right hand side of the stage, where all the
crew members were, and talking and laughing with them (all the while playing
away of course!).  Definately worth the six hour roadtrip!!!!

&gt;         And as an answer to those who have asked for Neil's address:
&gt; 1)  Neil takes great prode in answering ALL of his fan mail.
&gt; 2)  He is usually about 2 years behind w/responses.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Actually 2 years is probably inacurate. I sent off a letter to Neil
a while back and he sent me a response in the form of a postcard
approximately 4-6 months later ... I can't remember exactly how long.

&gt; 3)  he can be reached c/o Modern Drummer
&gt;                           870 Pompton Ave.
&gt;                           Cedar Grove, NJ 07009

I did not use this address, however. I sent it to Canada ... using an
address that I believe I saw on a TNMS edition.

Just fyi ...

Subject: Returned T-Shirt

	I am posting this for Stephan Iannce.  The NMS t-shirt I sent to your
address was returned to me with a note saying that there was no such apt.
number.  Since I don't have your e-mail address I'm posting here because
this is the only way I can possibly get in touch with you.

		I HAVE YOUR NMS T-SHIRT!!!!!!

	Please send me your address so that I can send it to you.  Thanks.  My
email address is "mark@yvax.byu.edu"

	BTW, Rush in Salt Lake City was pretty good.  The new Delta Center kind
of sucks for concerts though - terrible acoustics :(  It was kind of
dissappointing to hear such a great band, known for exceptional sound quality
in such a crappy sounding stadium.
	By far the best songs were:

	Time Stand Still
	Bravado (GREAT!)
	The Trees (as always)
	Xanadu (that intro was INCREDIBLE!!!)

Take care,

-Mark
