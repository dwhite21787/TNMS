Today's Topics:  Transcription of the RTB CD Launch
----------------------------------------------------------

[ At long last, I'm getting around to posting some backed-up extra
  material.  This is the transcription of the Roll The Bones CD Launch.
  Thanks to Paul Ackerman &lt;pga0625@ritvax.isc.rit.edu&gt; for the tran-
  scription!  (Sorry it took so long, Paul.)                 :rush-mgr ]

Title:         CD Launch for Roll The Bones
Date:          Thursday, 29 August 1991, 11:00pm EDT
Length:        One hour
Type:          Question and answer interview, no phone-in
               questions
Band members:  Geddy and Alex
Interviewer:   Dan Near [sp?] of WNEW
Recorded from: WNEW, 102.7 FM, New York, New York
Audience:      Various United States and Canadian radio stations
Songs played:  "Dreamline", "Bravado", "Roll The Bones",
               "Subdivisions", "Where's My Thing?", "Heresy"
Transcriber:   Paul Ackerman  (PGA0625@RITVAX.ISC.RIT.EDU)
Abstract:           The mood for this interview seems very
               upbeat, and light in most places.  Discussions on
               the songs "Bravado" and "Heresy" seemed more
               serious because of the songs' content, but not so
               serious that they aren't dismal.  Geddy and Alex
               joke often and really seem to be having a genuine
               good time.  The interviewer, Dan Near, sounds
               energetic and laid back.  He seems younger and
               less experienced at giving interviews than Bob
               Coburn of "Rockline," but sounds more relaxed than
               some of the "Rockline" interviews I've heard.
                    This is my first time transcribing anything,
               so please bear with me on the format I use.  Any
               criticism is more than welcome.

Voiceover -    ".... and liftoff!"  [The beginning of Distant
               Early Warning fades into the background.]

Dan -     "And good evening North America, my name is Dan Near. 
          I'm coming to you live from the studios of Q107.... in
          Toronto, Canada.  Along with me is Geddy Lee and Alex
          Lifeson of Rush.  And we're gonna play a bunch of their
          fine new recording _Roll The Bones_ for the United
          States and for Canada.  Now is that your general
          understanding guys, of what we're doing?"

Geddy -   "That's what I thought."

Alex -    "I think so."

Geddy -   "That's what I think.... I think so, yeah."

Dan -     "Well.... how are you doing man?  I understand this
          particular album, _Roll The Bones_ renewed enthusiasm
          for what you do.  Could you take off on that a little
          bit?"

Geddy -   "Elaborate you mean?"

Dan -     [sounding aloof]  "Or elaborate, sure."

Geddy -   "Sure.  [Geddy and Dan laugh]  Let's go back, I guess,
          to the end of the _Hold Your Fire_ tour, which was kind
          of a long and exhausting tour.  And I think at that
          point everyone was getting a bit frustrated, and a
          little down on touring and.... not very positive shall
          we say.  Then we go to the _Presto_ album, recording of
          that went very smoothly and things were feeling quite
          good through that process.  And I think it was through
          the mix, when we were in London, the three of us
          hanging out together, we started talking about plans
          for the tour.... the upcoming tour of _Presto_."

Dan -     "Playing volleyball.... "

Geddy -   "Yeah, doing all the good stuff.  And things started
          seeming more positive than they had in a long time. 
          And that carried on through the _Presto_ tour which was
          kind of a shorter, more carefully arranged tour.  And
          we had such a good time on that tour that, you know,
          things started to snowball for us, I think in a very
          positive way and it carried through making this album. 
          So, I'd say it's very optimistic right now."

Alex -    "I think it's important to note too that we took about
          seven months off after the _Hold Your Fire_ tour before
          we started working on _Presto_, which was by far the
          longest time, by a factor of at least two and a half,
          that we'd ever taken off before.  And it gave us.... "

Dan -     [interrupting]  "So by quick calculations that's about
          two months you've taken off before?"

[All laugh]

Alex -    "Yeah.... two months.  Good, very good, very good!  And
          he only used a calculator for that one.  He didn't use
          that.... ruler thing.  And it was really important, I
          think for us to get away and kind of divorce ourselves
          from everything that we do for a living."

Geddy -   "Yeah, it was really a matter of priorities.  We were
          starting, I think to resent having the band as the
          priority all the time."

Dan -     "Well.... I guess it worked so well, 'cause from what I
          understand on this record, you guys cut short your
          vacation to go record, right?"

Geddy -   "Yeah, pretty well."

Alex -    "Yeah, well we finished this record early.  We finished
          a couple *months* early.... which is unheard of for
          us."

Geddy -   "Yeah, we actually spent more time writing and
          rehearsing than we did recording this time, which
          is.... we still spent a lot of time, we spent about
          nine weeks writing and rehearsing, and getting ready
          for the recording part.  And we spent about eight weeks
          recording the album, which was a great feeling to know
          that all the preparation was worth while."

Dan -     "I definitely think the results are outstanding.  Radio
          has already been hearing this song we're about to play
          called 'Dreamline.'  A couple of lines stand out from
          this song that maybe relate to what we were talking
          about, 'we're only at home when we're on the run,' and
          'learning that we are only immortal for a limited
          time.'"

Geddy -   "Yeah I think that, you know, relates to us in kind of
          a very personal way as to some of the things we were
          just talking about, but also it's kind of a universal
          feeling that you have when you're a certain age where
          you believe that you can do so much and you're kind of
          invulnerable.  That you can, you know, get along on no
          sleep, you can drive as fast as you want, and you'll be
          fine, you know, you can get away with murder.  And
          there comes a certain point in your life where you
          realize that you are *vulnerable*."

Dan -     "Well.... let's take a listen to some music here, all
          right?  Let's take a listen to 'Dreamline.'  Live from
          Toronto.... this is the CD Launch for the new one from
          Rush, _Roll The Bones_.  Now hop in everybody, somebody
          in the back seat here has got a road map of Jupiter....
          and this transportation is the best yet.  'Dreamline'
          from Rush."

[Just as the vocals for "Dreamline" start some mumbling is heard
in the background.  Apparently, the microphones being used were
still live.  The only thing that I can understand is the
interviewer saying, "Yeah.... it sounds like you just woke up or
something", and then there is some laughter.  It is unclear who
he is speaking about.  The rest of the song continues without a
hitch.]

Dan -     "All right.... that is called "Dreamline" from the new
          CD from Rush.... _Roll The Bones_.  Were you ever
          concerned about the title of the album at all, that
          people would get, like the wrong meaning from it? 
          Because bones refers to.... [sound of dice being
          shaken] the dice, right?"

Geddy -   "Right."

Alex -    "Right."

Dan -     "Okay.  You were never concerned about.... "

Geddy -   [interrupting]  "What do you mean.... Dan?"

Dan -     "Oh.... [laughter all around]   I'm going to walk away
          from this question, and get on to another.... "

Geddy -   [softly]  "I don't know what this guy is talking
          about.... "

Alex -    [deepening his voice]  "'Honey, when you're done with
          that chicken, can you roll those bones?'  Like, what do
          you mean?"

Dan -     "Yeah, that's what I meant, yeah.  Is Rush feeling
          immortal at all these days?  I mean with that new sense
          of enthusiasm, or is this.... would the.... ?"

Geddy -   "I wouldn't want to go out on a limb and say that.  But
          I'd say we're feeling pretty good, pretty positive."

Dan -     "Yeah, pretty psyched to get back out there again."

Geddy -   "Yeah."

Dan -     "Good, good.  I really feel that the album is such a
          strong one we just gotta keep moving through these
          songs here.  'Bravado' is a song that.... it's
          relatively in a normal, stable time signature.  Is that
          true.... do you know?"

Geddy -   "I don't know, is there any seven in this song Alex?

[Dan laughs]

Alex -    "Actually, I don't think there is."

Geddy -   "I don't really feel comfortable unless there is one
          bar of seven.  In case you're tapping your foot and you
          accidently.... "

Dan -     "No, it's a terrific song.  And there's a line repeated
          throughout it called 'we will pay the price, but we
          will not count the cost.'  Now I understand this line
          was taken from a novel.... Neil read.  Is that true?"

Geddy -   "It could be.  He didn't tell me about that.  Did he
          tell you about that?"

Alex -    "Nor a word."

Dan -     "You guys don't.... "

Geddy -   "We don't talk."

[Geddy and Dan laugh]

Dan -     ".... discuss.... the secrets there?"

Alex -    "He faxed us the lyrics, and we fax him the music."

Dan -     "I see it's that personal way of writing."

Geddy -   "Yeah, it's a personal touch.  [more serious]  No, I
          don't know where inspiration came from.... for that
          song."

Dan -     "Neil had wrote a little piece called 'Row The Boats'
          and on it he said that's from a book by John Barth
          called _The Tidewater Tales_."

Geddy -   [softly]  "Oh, yeah."

Dan -     "What would that line mean to you?  I mean, 'cause
          Geddy, you have to sing these lyrics and 'we will pay
          the price but we will not count the cost?'"

Geddy -   "That's a pretty emotional song for me.  It's one of my
          favorites that I think we've ever written.  Just
          because it's quite a change.... it's quite a different
          song on the album.  It's stands out on the record as
          being a different texture than most of the other
          tracks.  That line to me says really says so much about
          the people, really that move the world, you know, the
          people that go out there and do what has to be done. 
          And they're not worrying about what it's going to cost
          them personally down the road, they're doing what has
          to be done, and they're prepared to pay the price for
          it without worrying about.... the payment that comes
          later."

Dan -     "I guess in the vernacular it could be like, 'Go for
          it, dude!' or something like that."

Geddy -   "Yeah, 'Don't look back.'"

Dan -     "Right.  Now the song is, like you mentioned, emotional
          and your guitar work is just that building sort of
          anthemic feel to it.  Did you learn something new from
          playing guitar on this particular record?  I mean, do
          you learn something new about your instrument this time
          out?"

Alex -    "I don't know if I learned anything new, I think I felt
          a little freer [more free] in the guitar arrangements
          in the way that my guitar parts have developed on this
          record.  That song, for instance, is a very simplistic
          approach from the beginning and it, as you say, builds
          throughout the course of the song.  But it builds in
          very simple steps.  I've think I've found that you can
          get a lot of mileage from that."

Dan -     "I would agree this song really has a lot of very
          powerful emotion in it.  Let's take a listen to it
          right now.  This is called 'Bravado'.  And live from
          Toronto, Canada it's the new Rush CD, _Roll The
          Bones_."

["Bravado" is played.]

Dan -     "That's 'Bravado' from the new Rush release.... _Roll
          The Bones_.  And a tip of the hat to the folks that are
          out there doing the good things for all of us, that we
          need more and more of them, I'm sure.  The title piece
          of the album, 'Roll The Bones'.  I guess this is what
          would be called a.... you know the album, I don't know
          whether you do this intentionally but it's sort of
          follows a theme of.... life being unpredictable, there
          are no set answers, take a chance, do what your heart
          says.  Do you agree with that?"

Geddy -   "Absolutely."

Alex -    "That's it."

Geddy -   "That's the one."

Alex -    "Well, thanks very much."

[laughter and people speaking at the same time]

Dan -     "Okay, let's leave now."

Geddy -   "That about raps it up."

Dan -     "Thank you America, thank you Canada.  See ya'. 
          [regaining composure]  This is Rush doing sort of a
          gender-bender sort of thing.  You got a *rap* in this
          song."

Geddy -   "Well, we like to call it a 'spoken word piece.'"

Dan -     "Ah, yes."

Alex -    ".... section."

Geddy -   "Or as they say in England -- it's a.... *chat*."

Dan -     "That's your producer teaching you that stuff.  I know
          that.... Rupert Hine.  Now, my guess was that Rupert
          did the rap, but you explained to me no, that's not."

Geddy -   "It's not."

Dan -     "Are you going to let us in on who did it?"

Alex -    [interrupting]  "I did it."

Geddy -   "Maybe one day.  *He* didn't do it."

[Geddy laughs]

Geddy -   "Maybe one day.  I think it's a fun tease for a while."

Dan -     "And you're just like one of those tease sort of
          people."

Geddy -   [interrupting]  "That's me."

Dan -     "Yeah, okay.  One thing I do love, especially about
          this particular record is the way you bridge the
          different styles there.  It just seems to flow very
          gracefully.... throughout all those different styles."

Geddy -   "Well that's good, 'cause that's the something that we
          were a little worried about.  Because this song has
          just about every style we could think of thrown in
          there.  It seemed right to do it.  We went backwards
          and forwards as to how to approach it, whether to make
          it all feel more continuous, or to play up the
          differences in the sections, but in the end I think we
          struck a balance."

Alex -    "Yeah, I would agree.  Our concern was that it was too
          fragmented, I think.  After we wrote it we were quite
          excited about it, and I think we got away from it for a
          little while and listened to it, and thought, 'Uhh,  
          this song is pretty stupid.  [Geddy laughs]  We better
          hang on a second here.'  But I think like Geddy says
          it's knitted well together now.  We've managed to.... "

Geddy -   "Yeah, and it's really become my favorite that we've
          done in a long time."

Dan -     "I think this is fabulous, and I can't wait to lay it
          on North America here.  So, why are we here?"

G & A -   "Because we are here."

Dan -     "So let's roll the bones, huh?  Let's go!  ['Roll The
          Bones' starts in the background]  Pull out your dice,
          and.... shake 'em!  [laughs]  This is called 'Roll The
          Bones.'  Live from Toronto, it's a CD Launch for Rush."

["Roll The Bones" is played]

Dan -     "'Roll The Bones', a song from the album of the same
          name.  We'll be back with more.  Live from Toronto with
          Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson when our CD Launch rumbles
          on back here."

["Spirit Of Radio" is used to segue the commercial break.]

Dan -     "Welcome back to our CD Launch for Rush's _Roll The
          Bones_.  I'm your excellent host, Dan Near."

G & A -   [in background]  "Party on!"

Dan -     "Party on guys!"

Alex -    "Righteous!"

Dan -     "At this point before we get back into _Roll The Bones_
          we're gonna play something from one of the seventeen
          other Rush albums.  There's just, like too many good
          songs to choose from.  So, I think we should pick this
          song by rolling the bones.  I have hear in my hand.... "

[sound of paper being unfolded]

Geddy -   "Some bones."

Dan -     "No."

Geddy -   "I'm sorry."

Dan -     "A list of a bunch of your old songs.... numbered. 
          [sound of dice being rattled]  And each of you are
          going to roll the dice.... like one.... "

Geddy -   "One die."

Dan -     ".... one die each.... "

Geddy -   "Take them out."

Dan -     ".... add them up together, and the number that comes
          up that corresponds to one of your songs, that's the
          song we're going to play.  Okay, so.... "

Geddy -   "It's like a trick."

Dan -     "So, yeah.  So, Geddy you've got the cup there, why
          don't you.... let's see if we can use this mike."

Geddy -   "Roll the.... "

Dan -     "Roll the cup."

[sound of dice being rolled]

Dan -     "And it goes on to the floor.... and under Alex's
          chair.  And.... anyone see that number over there?"

Alex -    [away from microphone]  "Yes, it's um.... "

Dan -     "It's a.... "

Alex -    [away from microphone]  ".... Seven!"

Dan -     "Seven!  [laughs]  Okay.  No.  It's a.... "

Alex -    [away from microphone]  "Five!"

Dan -     "It's a five, okay."

Geddy -   "Beautiful."

Dan -     "Alex, do you think you could try to.... "

Alex -    "I'll use my mike."

Dan -     "Oh, okay."

[sound of dice being rattled in a cup]

Alex -    "Look at all the engineers look here immediately.  'Oh,
          no!  You're wrecking my mike!  Who cares about the
          stupid dice!'"

[sound of dice being rolled]

Dan -     "Okay, that comes up with a four.  So five and four
          .... I can add quickly.... and that makes nine, and
          that corresponds to.... "

Alex -    [interrupting]  "By a factor of.... "

Dan -     "And that corresponds to.... 'Subdivisions', okay from
          _Signals_.  So, anybody want to introduce this tune?"

Geddy -   "Alex, would you like to introduce it, or shall I?"

Alex -    "Why don't you go ahead Ged, because in real life you
          introduced this song."

[all laugh]

Geddy -   "As opposed to 'fake life' that we're in.... "

Alex -    "That we're in.... that's exactly right."

Geddy -   "Well, 'Subdivisions'.... from the _Signals_ album. 
          ['Subdivisions' starts in background]  I can't remember
          what year we wrote it."

Alex -    "Eighty-uh.... "

Dan -     "I believe this is 1982."

Geddy -   "1982.... one of my faves!"

Alex -    "Who's introducing this song, anyways?"

Geddy -   "I think we all are."

Alex -    "Well, in that case.... "

Dan -     "Let's just do this, okay?  [laughing]  We are live
          from Toronto.  This is the CD Launch for _Roll The
          Bones_, but this one.... from _Signals_ is called
          'Subdivisions.'"

["Subdivisions" is played.  The CD skips once.]

Dan -     "That was 'Subdivision' [sic] from _Signals_ by Rush; a
          song we picked by rolling the bones."

Alex -    [interrupting]  "By chance."

Dan -     "By chance."

Geddy -   "Ooooh."

Dan -     "Just like life.  It's something you do by chance. 
          _Roll The Bones_ is the title of that new collection of
          songs by Rush and right now I think we should get back
          to that.... because this is the matter at hand here. 
          The next song we want to get to is an instrumental. 
          [emphatically]  Now you guys haven't done an
          instrumental, I think since.... YYZ, right?" 

[Dan pronounced it Y-Y-Zee]

Alex -    "That's right."

Geddy -   "Or as we say here in Canada.... "

G & D -   "Y-Y-Zed."

Dan -     "Yes."

Alex -    "Or as we say now in Canada Y-Y-Zee.... or Zed."

[Geddy laughs]

Dan -     "Is that....  Is Canada changing it's habits."

Geddy -   "It's 'zee', oh."

Alex -    "Yeah."

Geddy -   "I didn't realize we were a 'zee' people."

Alex -    "Yeah.  The schools now.... [groans]"

Geddy -   "I'm moving."

Dan -     "Progress."

Alex -    "It's the only thing that kept me here.... zed."

[all laugh]

Dan -     "Well, first of all, I want to mention that Rush again
          has broken new ground here because apparently the sub-
          title of this tune, it's called 'Where's My Thing (Part
          IV 'Gangster Of Boats' Trilogy)'.  So Rush has broken
          brand new ground by finding the fourth part of a
          trilogy.  I didn't think it was possible."

Alex -    "Well normally most people don't write the fourth part
          of a trilogy, so we thought we would."

Geddy -   "Because most people don't realize you can have a
          fourth part to a trilogy."

Alex -    "Yeah, it goes to fourth."

Dan -     "Oh!  Simple as that.  [laughs]  Okay, obviously you
          two wrote this song.  [laughs, and regains composure]  
          Umm....  it's a fine, fine piece of music, and it's
          kinda like.... you guys didn't intend it this way, but
          it's almost like showing off the way you guys play.  I
          mean it's just amazing..... "

Geddy -   "That's 'cause some guy told us that's what you're
          supposed to do in an instrumental.  [Dan laughs]  So
          that's what we.... kinda did."

Dan -     "Was there any particular reason why you chose to do an
          instrumental or is it kinda just.... ?"

Alex -    "We were forced?"

Geddy -   "It's so much fun to do, too.  We tried to do one on
          Presto.... and every time we started writing it, you
          know, we played this piece of music and be like, 'Oh. 
          This lyric fits perfectly with it.'  So we'd go off,
          we'd steal from the instrumental and it would become
          another song.  And it kept happening over and over
          again.  And finally Neil said, 'Okay.  You keep
          promising to do this instrumental, and I'm not giving
          you any more lyrics until you write the thing.'  So we
          sat down and wrote it."

Alex -    "Actually this whole album is an instrumental album. 
          [Geddy and Dan laugh]  But then we added some words."

Geddy -   [laughs]  "We added some words."

Dan -     "And hence it's got that instrumental underlying."

Alex -    "That's right.... we use instruments."

[all laugh]

Dan -     "Very good, very good.  So kind of like a planned
          whim."

Geddy -   "Yeah."

Dan -     "The opening of this song.... very funky.  Kinda like
          a.... almost like a James Brown sorta deal.  Who's the
          brother here in the band?"

[some laughing, then Alex tries to imitate James Brown's funky
scream]

Geddy -   "Funky as Canadians can get, I suppose."

Dan -     "No, but it really is.  It's a dynamic piece of music. 
          Is there any chance that I can get a copy of the 
          'Gangster Of Boats' part one through three?"

Geddy -   "As soon as we write them."  [laughs]

Alex -    "Sure.  You can have them for sure."

Geddy -   "You can have 'em."

Dan -     "Let's take a listen to this because it really shows
          the musical virtuosity of the band.... Rush.  ['Where's
          My Thing' starts in the background]  All right, this is
          live from Toronto, Canada from the new Rush CD _Roll
          The Bones_.  This is one with no words, just keep
          thinking, 'Where's My Thing?'"

["Where's My Thing" is played.]

Dan -     "Yo.... wow, that is some very intense music there. 
          Rush, from the new one, _Roll The Bones_.  A great
          instrumental that does ask the musical question....
          'Where's My Thing?'  [laughs]  Okay.  We'll be back
          with more of our CD Launch with Geddy and Alex, so hang
          out!"

["Red Sector A" and "Chain Lightning" are used to segue the
commercial break.]

Dan -     "Welcome back United States and Canada.  We're live
          from the lovely, lovely city of Toronto, along with
          Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee of Rush.  I'm Dan Near. 
          Now, you guys thank CNN on this album, and I do believe
          you've done this before.  Were you watching them when
          they were in Moscow last week?"

Geddy -   "Actually I wasn't."

Alex -    "No.... actually we were here.  But we watched a lot of
          them during the Gulf Crisis."

Geddy -   [softly]  "That's why the credit.... "

Dan -     [interrupting]  "They often inspire, I guess, some
          music and lyrics, huh?"

Geddy -   "Well, I mean, I don't think that.... particular thing,
          you know, inspired anything on this record.  I just
          seemed that a lot of stuff was going down that was hard
          to leave the television set during the writing and a
          couple of the songs on the record were, I guess, kind
          of worldly in what they were describing.  It seemed
          quite, I don't know, like they fit in some weird way."

Dan -     "Right.  Well, the next song I want to talk about is
          called 'Heresy'.  And it does, even though obviously
          these events happened last week, it ties into the song. 
          Because the song asks the question, 'All those wasted
          years, all those precious wasted years.  Who will pay?'
          And from reading what Neil has written about this song
          he was saying.... he was talking about the fall of all
          the Communist governments in eastern Europe."

Geddy -   "Yeah, absolutely.  That horrible and wonderful moment
          all mixed into one when somebody realizes that they've
          been, you know, had their freedom removed for so many
          years, and they finally get it back.  It must be such a
          bitter-sweet moment.  All those years.... all those
          lives that were lost and all the struggle, all the
          people that were fighting, all the years, and
          suddenly.... it's all over.  And what do they do about
          all the people that did not survive, who were not lucky
          enough to be around when the wall fell down.  It's an
          unanswerable question, but it's certainly one to think
          about."

Dan -     "And all those years that they endured without food
          even, a struggle to even get food.  I think Neil
          humorously said something, '.... had to wear bad
          suits.'"

[some laughter]

Geddy -   "Yeah.  [Geddy laughs, imitates Rodney Dangerfield] 
          Times are tough, let me tell ya'."

Dan -     [laughs, also imitating Rodney Dangerfield]  "Oh, it's
          rough."

Geddy -   "It's very topical, obviously because of what is going
          on right now, and it was.... I think that's a
          culmination of that whole movement."

Dan -     "And not only from their side of the coin, but think
          from our side of the coin.  I don't know if it was like
          this in Canada but as I was growing up.... the fallout
          shelters, there was..... "

Geddy -   "Yeah, absolutely."

Alex -    "The exercise to get under the.... "

Geddy -   [interrupting]  "Duck and cover."

Alex -    ".... desk.  Yeah."

Dan -     "All that strange stuff just for a misguided ideology."

Geddy -   "Yeah."

Dan -     "Well..... "

Alex -    "That in a few days is finished.  It's just so, so
          incredible."

Geddy -   "Everything is okay now.  Don't get bitter, or don't be
          upset.... it's all.... "

Alex -    [speaking with a thick Russian accent]  "We was just
          joking.  [Geddy and Dan laugh]  It's all big joke. 
          Heh, no sense of humor around here."

Dan -     "I personally took my statue of Lenin down too. 
          [laughs]  Let's play the song 'Heresy' as we think about
          our brothers on the other side of the world struggling
          for their freedom.  Take a listen to this one from
          _Roll The Bones_ by Rush.  It is called 'Heresy.' 
          ['Heresy' starts in the background]  And live from
          Toronto it's a North American CD Launch."

Alex -    [humorously]  "Was that John Lennon?"

["Heresy" is played]

Dan -     [interrupting the very end of the song]  "And the drums
          sort of goes from that, I guess, more tom-tom oriented
          one to the snare, military sort of feel.  Now Geddy, I
          saw you listening to that one.  Were you enjoying that
          quite a bit?"

Geddy -   "Yeah, I was actually.  I haven't heard that in quite a
          while, and it was nice to listen to it, the headphones,
          and get lost in it."

Dan -     "I really like what that song says.  'Must we be
          forgiving at last?'  I guess we, I guess we should."

Geddy -   "Got no choice."

Dan -     "Yeah, okay.  'Heresy' from _Roll The Bones_.  Now
          we're going to be back to hear, I guess part of one
          final song when our CD Launch docks again."

["The Big Money" and "Subdivisions" are used to segue the
commercial break.]

Dan -     "I'm glad you came back with us for the final portion
          of our CD Launch.  We've just been having so much fun
          that we really don't have much time, and I guess we're
          not going to get to this final song I wanted to get to. 
          Obviously, Rush is gonna get on the road, or is this
          not obvious?"

Alex -    "Yes.... no, we'll be out.... "

Geddy -   [interrupting]  "It's obvious to some."

[Geddy laughs]

Alex -    ".... in the second.... half or possibly the.... last
          third.... maybe even the last quarter of October."

Dan -     "Would that be October 25th by any.... ?"

[Dan and Alex laugh]

Alex -    "Right around there."

Geddy -   "On or near that date."

Dan -     "Yeah.  You're going to start the tour, I know, in
          Hamilton, Ontario October the 25th."
Alex -    "That's right."

Dan -     "Then you're heading for the states, and then.... 'bout
          how long.... you're going to go for?"

Geddy -   "As long as we can."

Alex -    "Probably until the middle of December, and then take a
          little break and pick it up in the new year."

["Where's My Thing?" starts in the background.]

Dan -     "Okay.  Well, I think.... I like to thank both of you."

Geddy -   "I hear music."

[Dan and Geddy laugh]

Dan -     "Yes.  I'd like to thank you, Alex.  I'd like to thank
          you, Geddy."

Alex -    [softly]  "You're welcome."

Dan -     "I think _Roll The Bones_ is a wonderful piece of
          music, and we all look forward to having you out on the
          road."

Geddy -   "Thank you.  Well it was great to be here.... to talk
          to you."

Dan -     "We'd also like to thank Ray Danniels and Kim Garner of
          SRO Management Inc.  Judy LeBeau, Perry Cooper, and
          Vicky Germais of Atlantic Records.  Steve Warden, Rob
          Enders, Joey Vendetta, and Gary Widden at Q107 here in
          Toronto, and the Rock Radio Network.  In Canada we
          thank Richard Mark of CelTek.  And from IDB
          Communication thanks to Jill Jamison.  This CD Launch
          was produced by David Bales for Near-Perfect
          Productions and Media America Radio.  This show is
          brought to you by the letter 'A.'"

Geddy -   "A!"

Dan -     "Eh?"

Geddy -   "Eh?"

Alex -    "Eh?"

Geddy -   [softly]  "Party on dudes!"

Dan -     "The executive producers are Duart Nelson, Ron
          Hartenbaum, and me, Dan Near.  We're live from Toronto
          saying Mohalo.... Aloha!"
