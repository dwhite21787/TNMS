The Hip show last night kicked some serious ass! Great show (wearing my 
shirt right now :-)  Saw a bunch of canadian shirts, flags, even some bands
but no Rush. 

I also FINALLY heard TSOR on KIOZ 105.3 in San Diego, they're playing it now!
I sent them email, they're not sure if they're going to be carrying the
album premiere or not -- but my guess is they will, they played the TFE one.
Also KLOS in LA will be carrying the premiere on November 8th, although not
one person has actually HEARD any new Rush on KLOS yet... and if you're in
South Florida Doug tells me there is no Rush to be found anywhere, so bang
your monkeys Floridians!!  (if you didn't understand that, then just call 
the radio stations and demand Rush :-)

I also just got word that the new Kiss album is ALSO having an album premiere
around the same time, so some radio stations may be moving the date around
a bit (maybe that's why KLOS is airing it on the 8th). Some stations may
not even carry the DS premiere because of this!

The great TNMS shirt debate. Well. Now we have a new logo (thanks to Jezebel,
if you play quake on yyz you'll know who that is ;-)  so is it time for new
shirts? My idea:  black shirt, have the NMS square logo on the front in the
left pocket area. On the back, the man w/star & words thats on the main NMS
web page now, the one that says "we are the priests..."  and either under the
picture or above it, have "rush@tnms.com".  What do you think? In time for
xmas? hehe...

And oh yes, the AAR online auction has begun! If you're looking for the
perfect gift for that hard-to-please Rush fan, check out their page, you 
might find something for them, or even for yourself!  http://www.vrx.net/aar

Two final things: I believe the original Atlantic information about DS having
an enhanced cd is incorrect: apparently they're rereleasing TFE as an 
enhanced cd, although I still have no idea what will be on it. The live video
may or may not be out in December, some say it is, some say it's not. 
Atlantic can't make up their mind about ANYTHING!! *sigh*

Good day, eh....

was i the only one to hear the topic last week on Jersey 101.5?  for
those not in the area, this
station is mostly talk radio during the week.  they talk about a
subject, news, political, or 
just fun and have listeners call in an give their opinion or experience,
etc.

i commute, so i started listening to the station for the traffic updates
 they got 'em every 15 minutes.

people started calling with their experiences for getting tickets for
the Dead, U2, Bruce, The Police and
on and on.  then, at once point, Jeff says to Bill something to the

Subject: DS album cover

Hi Rushians!

How's it going?

I put the small DS album cover as my wallpaper (tiled) on my work
computer last week.  You should hear the positive comments about
it!  All the people can really see well is the tinker toys.  They
all go "Tinker Toys!  I remember having them..." and go on about
old toys they used to have.  It's a fun trip down memory lane.
They don't even realize it's an album cover unless I tell them.

So, I give this album cover two thumbs up in creating positive
vibes for fans and non-fans alike.

Rush On!

Hi,
	Does anyone here know if DS will be exclusively put out on CD? I
have seen no info regarding a tape release. I can understand not putting
out the third disc on tape, but there is no excuse to not put out 1 and 2.

Subject: Different Stages Cover

I see that the "Great Tinker-Toy Debate" has begun!  This is good; we all 
needed to have something more tangibly Rush-related about which to post.  
Thanks to Hugh Syme for his continued creativity.

As a kid, I, like many of you, had tinker toys, lincoln logs, and of course, 
Legos.  However, I remember all of my tinker toy spools being unpainted (i.e., 
natural wood), and having a thicker profile than the ones on the cover.  I 
also don't think the edges were as beveled as those shown on the cover.  The 
diameter of the spools relative to the thickness of the green post looks 
proportional, from what I remember (could tinker toys distributed in Canada 
have had different dimensions perhaps?).

I'm sure the album cover image was totally computer-generated.  This could 
explain the discrepancy, whether real or imagined by me.  Of course, it's 
been about 20 years since I've even seen my tinker toy set, so the images 
may in-fact truly represent the actual dimensions.

22 days and counting!  MK

Subject: RUSH sighting at the 1st Predators hockey game

Friday night October 10th, 1998 was the first NHL hockey game in Nashville, TN. 
Although the Predators lost the game 1-0 to the Florida Panthers we still had 
something to be smiling about. In the third period with 10:34 to go in the game 
there was a killer sound coming from the sound system. It was Limelight
and it was played to right be for Geddy starts singing. About half of the 
Nashville Arena were playing air drums with Neil. It was a real thrill.

On a second note, the only radio station here in Music City (Nashville, TN) 
That plays Rush is 105.9 WNRQ The Rock. Today ,10-19-98, the afternoon DJ ,
Moose, said that he heard Different Stages this morning at the station and 
that it was "KILLER".
 
That's all from Nashville,
Rudy

p.s.
Anymore Rush & Predator fans out there?

Hold on a second!.......
Put down the crack pipe!
Are you nuts? What do mean grouping Randy Rhoads as an amateur?  Randy
Rhoads was one of the best guitarists ever.  Maybe you should listen to YYZ
again.  I think that Alex must have been enjoying "Blizzard of Oz" back
when they were recording MP.  That solo has a lot of Randy Rhoads
influence.  Also, I guess if only amateurs use "amplifier noise", that
would make Jimi Hendrix an amateur. Also Jimmy Page, Adrian Belew, and
Steve Howe to name a few.

Depends on if it is harmonic distortion from overdriven amps, or just
noise to impress yokels who who are impressed by white noise. I agree
that Randy kickked ass.  Another tragic loss in the rock world. 

I can agree with your statement that Alex is better than EVH.
Russell Thorpe

Eddy is getting better, though, just like Al.  Unlike some guitarists
out there.

     I just returned from Toronto. I took part in the Canadian 
     International Marathon over the weekend & had a great time (in 
     Toronto, NOT in the marathon). Toronto is a great, fun, exciting city. 
     Of course, I took photos of all the Rush landmarks: Massey Hall, 
     Danforth/Pape, the front steps of Parliment, etc. A side note: Motley 
     Crue was on the sign outside Massey as an upcoming show. It's 
     interesting that Rush played there on their way UP & Motley Crue has 
     been on their way DOWN for awhile. ANYWAY! Here are some observations 
     about Toronto: They DO love their coffee & doughnuts. Coffee Time & 
     Second Cup places abound! Mr. Sub? Are they good? They are freakin' 
     everywhere. Younge Street is really, really long. Torontonians are 
     polite & helpful... Until they get stuck in traffic. More than one 
     person was struck in the marathon by motorists ignoring the 
     partitioned off course. Sad. I asked one driver if he was in a hurry 
     to get to Tim Horton's. He laughed. I told another to shut the hell up 
     & he flipped me off, so I guess we're even. I noticed flashing on the 
     Sam the Record Man sign, "That's Entertainment". I wonder if this gave 
     Rush inspiration for the closing remarks of "Superconductor". I know 
     that HBO used to use "That's Entertainment" as their catch-phrase, but 
     I wonder where it originated. Just my observations & wonderings.... 
     Until later....

Subject: Natural Science

Woohoo! I finally did it! I finally learned the entire bass line to
Natural Science! Whenever I learn a new Rush song, I gain a new
appreciation for the song. (All you musicians out there know what
I'm talking about.) Some of the Rush songs that I have learned in
the past are Closer to the Heart, parts of 2112, Vital signs,
Show Don't tell, Force Ten, Prime Mover, etc. But Natural Science
is so different from any of those. It really blew my mind! I don't
see how Geddy came up with some of those bass lines. They sound
great, but when you read the music and try to play it, it seems
very strange and off the wall at first. Natural Science was
hard to learn because there's just so much to remember. Even the
parts that repeat can be very hard to remember because some of
them are a bit different each time.

I remember a line in the movie Shine where the kid is learning a
very complex piece, and the instructor says "first you must learn
the notes, then you can forget them" or words to that affect. That
rings so true to me. To me, it means that to play a song with
real feeling, you must learn the notes so well that you can play
them without thinking too much about them. You can focus on the
feeling of the song instead of the notes. I always play best when
I relax and feel the music. I think that's something for the
beginners to keep in mind.

Next topic: Why is anyone freaking out over the Japanese release of
DS with Force Ten on it?  Force Ten was on ASOH and sounded great.
I could understand if the Japanese version had several extra songs
that are completely unavailable here. Are you really going to pay
$50 for one (or is it two) extra songs?! I think we need a little
perspective here.

That's my 2 cents for today.

Later dudes,
Chris.

    Well, I have a few questions:

 Isn't it highly likely that we are all just a great big accident in the
universe, and that our time may be up in the next century? Isn't it highly
likely that we (TNMS'ers) happen to live in a time when the greatest set of
musicians, are alive and releasing great music? Isn't it likely that the
cover of the next RUSH album is exactly that: A cover of an album, nothing
more?

 Us, as humans, are always trying to read into things. What if the author
of the book, album, or artwork says that the said item means nothing? It
means that centuries later some damn rich millionaire is gonna pay a
truckload of cash for it. I think we all need to lay off interpreting the
cover of DS. Lets just enjoy the music.

I just read a little mis-info in the last NMS about Trent Reznor.  First,
he does play the guitar & do the distortions himself.  He tours with a
band, but EVERYTHING on the studio albums (Pretty Hate, Broken & Downward)
is all Reznor.

Are there any other Reznor fans subscribing to TNMS?  If you have any

up the new Aerosmith live album and the release dated they have is
Nov.3rd. I asked them and they said yes that is the date. Has anyone
heard of this? I thought it was Nov. 10th. We will just have to wait and
see. Have a good one.

I just got finished listening to the new King's X album and it is really
good.  I would compare it to the last album as far as musical style is
concerned.  Also, the Bosstones live album is great, with plenty of songs
from each era.  Enjoy.

good news!  sounds like we might get an unpolished live album not
overdubbed to death!

Bring on the goofs, time slips and missed notes!  Thats what makes live
performances fun! Leaving the goofs in this time is great! I for one am

Yes, good observation, Fred. The data is overwhelming. 
Here's another likely meaning of the tinker toys. Red 
means Alex is a Communist. Yellow means bananas 
are Neil's favorite food. Blue means Geddy wants to
have another baby... a boy. Sound theory, yes?
Well, I've always known I was cut out for theoretical

Yeah, me too... almost.
	With the exception of the Rush CD's being few and far between,
this person might as well be talking about Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  I
have not seen much in the way of Rush-related memorabilia around here
since the days of 'Roll the Bones' (coincidentally when I was starting to
become a Rush fan).  It also does not help much that radio stations within
the Boston metropolitan area do not play Rush as much as they used to.
	Then again, there _is_ Rush stuff to be had.  All the major CD
retailers do carry Rush CDs throughout their career (including the
remasters), and I do see various Rush guitar tablature books on sale in
both those music chain stores like Tower Records as well as the musical
instrument places. 
	Also, another thing I have realized is that since the RTB tour,
current merchandise like T-Shirts and posters have been sold almost
exclusively at concerts (which, sadly but understandably, are becoming a
less frequent occurrence).  I don't know if the lack of non-musical Rush
merchandise in stores is a Rush management decision or the result of an
insidious conspiracy against the band to prevent their further exposure.
In any case, it does seem a tad strange.

	At least we all still have the music...
							Electronically,

On another note, as a veteren of many AOL rush lyric games, I can tell you that 
if it takes more than two words to get the song, that's two many.  In mpst cases
you could name a song in one word, provided its the right word, of course.  Some

Subject: Lerxst interview

Hello, Rush Addicts.

    Alex Lifeson gave an telephonic interview to a brazilian newspaper
talking bout the new live album, 'n I'll show you some interesting pieces (I
had to translate it from portuguese to english, of course after it has been
translated from english to portuguese [ouch], so don't bash me for
miswritten things or whether this is not the way Alex use to talk).

================
[...]
    "Some of the songs of the CD have already been recorded live before but,
according Mr. ALex, 'this was on purpose because it can reflect the changes
that these songs suffered along the years. When we play a song 20 years
after we have composed it, surely we have a different vision of it. For
example, the version of Closer To The Heart in this album is very different
from the original and from the other live recordings we have made. Songs
like The Spirit Of Radio, Freewill and others, although they don't lose
their original characteristics, they sound more recent.'"
[...]
    [After some babbling about Rush's unique style] "About his influences,
Alex says: 'My influences were many, really many. When I was younger, at
Rush's beginning, I heard a lot of Hendrix, Tounshed and Page, and it was
very important on my formation as a guitar player. After, Steave Hacket and
Steave Howe.' [...] Mr. Alex says that's very hard for him to recognize his
style in other guitarists."
[...]
    "Alex Lifeson promises some news soon: 'We plan to start working in a
new CD next year, in order to release it in this century. Meanwhile, we're
finshing a video of our last tour, that we'll release about march 1999.'"
================

    Now, for fans in South America, he said that's its very hard to schedule
shows outside North America, but he know that they have a lot of fans in
Brazil, and that they really want to play in Brazil and in Argentina, and we
must not lose our hope...

    I hope this was worthy for ya!

    Finally, my lame (really lame) Rush sighting: when my computer boots up,
it shows some place in its first screen "IDE 2: Mode 4, 2112 MBytes".

May the force be with you!
Vinny.

Subject: My Top ten

Hi All,
It's been about a year since I have posted to TNMS, but I had to jump in 
on the top ten list. So here it goes.

10). Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band- Good mixture of blues and rock.
9). Cinderella- Just because they are a hometown band.
8). Kiss- Have a good live show.
7). Megadeth- Just have to love Dave Mustaine's complicated cords
6). Metallica (Pre-Load)- Really good orchestration.
5). Pink Floyd- Very thought provoking lyrics.
4). Molly Hatchet- Very much Murphy's Law music.
3). Alice Cooper- Excellent live shows!
2). Dream Theater- One of the most talented bands since Rush.
And my number 1 favorite band of all time is...
Yes, you guessed it,
Rush- Truly a phenomenon. They have inspired more musicians (that I know) 
Than any other band in the past twenty years.
              
                Thanks,
	       Rick

Subject: Re: lousy radio

Hello fellow NMS readers!

I just want to echo the comments made by Jose Ramos in issue 2120. I, 
too, live in the New York City area (Queens, if you really need to know) 
and am sickened by the lack of support that Rush gets on the radio in 
this the #1 radio market in the United States. Jose mentioned the three 
rock stations that we have in NYC and that only one of them, WNEW (The 
Rock of New York), will ever play Rush. With that in mind...

Instead of playing Rush on the cassette deck in the car, for the last 
week I have been listening to WNEW hoping that TSoR would get played. 
Instead of the new track, I've heard the old PeW version TWICE! This 
pissed me off. I mean, seriously, would you program the same old version 
of TSoR or the new live version. To top it off, one of the two times I 
caught the studio version, it was back-announced as a listener request. 
Did that listener really request the 1980 version or the 1998? Yes, 
Jose, New York radio SUCKS.

My good friend Lenny told me that as he was driving home from work on 
Long Island he heard the new track on WBAB. So, if you find yourself 
within listening range of that station maybe you'll have better luck. So 
far, I've only caught Nobody's Hero and CTTH on that station. 

Now that that rant is off my chest, does anyone know what music stores 
on Long Island use SoundScan? I Know that The Wall doesn't, not that I'd 
buy from those overpriced bastards anyway. I really want my purchase to 
put Rush on the Billboard charts so any info here is greatly 
appreciated. 

Only 2 weeks to go!

Subject: Different Stages version of 2112

Hello fellow RUSH fan(atics).  While driving home from work tonight (Detroit
area) and scanning the dial I ran across a show called "the listening room" on
102.7.  They were concentrating on new live releases and they opened the show
by talking about the upcoming release of Different Stages and to my surprise
the DJ actually played 2112 in it's entirety.  It sounded very cool and only
served to get me even more pumped for the release. 
Has anyone else heard this or any other song from DS yet?

Kind regards,
Greg Bohl.

Subject: The Pass

I was interested to see that James M uses the steering by the stars 
line from the Pass as his signature.  That section is lifted from 
Oscar WIlde.  Those of you who know your Pretenders will know that 
Chrissie Hynde uses the same, closer to the original, in Message of 
Love: "We are all of us in the gutter, Some of us are looking at the 
stars".    You can either call it broad reading, or lifting.  It puts 
me in mind of Wilde's own apostrophe.  Following a witty put down by 
the great man, a friend is supposed to have said, "Oscar, I wish I 
had said that!"  To which Wilde replied "You will dear boy, you 
will."

Subject: From the Midnight Oil Mailing List (Mentions Geddy Lee)

Well, in my search for some news concerning this disturbing twist of fate
for our favourite skinny bassist, I came across this news article.

Musician Caught Smuggling Equipment

PORT MACGUIRE (AP) - Police today raided the ship USS Melody in what is
being called the largest bust of illegally imported musical equipment in
the history of Australia. They confiscated over 400 kg of stolen
equipment right before dawn. The loot, consisting mainly
of bass guitar picks, have a street value of over $300.00. They also
arrested the ringleader as he was caught, redhanded.

Dwayne 'Bones' Hillman, bassist for the famous rock group Midnight Oil,
was taken into custody as he was observed taking out a pick from a box of
the contraband, then proceeding to practice scales on a bass guitar. As
the gaunt man was handcuffed and taken away, he reportedly screamed to the
police "I have to practice! We have a tour coming up!".

When he was questioned later, he offered this explanation: "Listen. The
Australian dollar is down, and the plastics plant that makes my picks went
under. They're too expensive to import! So, I smuggled them in, packed in
between layers of heroin to throw off the police dogs." When asked why he
couldn't play with his fingers like the bass great Geddy Lee, he commented
"Are you insane? And ruin these soft and delicate hands?"

Bail has been set at $20,000,000. The rest of Midnight Oil, nor the
Hillman family, could be reached for comment.

Subject: Sighting/request

First, thank you to those of you offering to help me out with getting DS
out here on cruise on the other side of the world, but I'm on my way
back, and as slow as the mail is, I'd probably not get it until I return
anyway, so we'll keep it simple and I'll buy it back home.

However, if someone would make an audio recording of the album premiere
off the radio (assuming that there will be interviews, and not just
playing the album through), I would be happy to pay for it.  Use of a
high quality Maxell tape is requested.

Lastly, quick Rush sighting, when we were in port in Jebel Ali in the
U.A.E., there is an enclosed area we called the oasis for sailors to go
off the ship right here and drink and get some fast food and listen to
music, they did play 2112 over the loudspeakers which I was most
impressed with.  That's it for now. --Armen

I thought this was great.  It's probably been on here 10 million times,
but I'm slow.

I've already mentioned the TSOR is now being played on 106.1 in
Raleigh-Durham, NC.  I was very happy to hear a track that sounded
"live".  It makes me want to hear the whole thing even more.  I didn't
