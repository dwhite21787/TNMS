	Well, here we go again.  I've heard rumors about a new album
too.  Here are my sources.

1.	The managers at 2 local record stores.  The first is Record
Theatre.  And the second is Media Play.  When I saw the rumors on TNMS I
went to the guys who both said that there was something in the works.

2.	The second was a home page on the WWW.  It wasn't TNMS but a
different one.  I can't for the life of me remember where it was, but it
was more of a "lets get together and talk about Rush page".   It had some
info on the guys, which included a listing of albums and when they were
released.  Following Counterparts was "11/94  Merely Players *live*"
Thats what it said.

   [ THAT information was from the TNMS april fool's issue from 1994... geez
     some people will take ANYTHING as gospel... :-)                : rush-mgr ]

	So who knows.  Maybe we aren't being told so they can surprise
us?  Rush on!!

Shahid -

As I recall, an old bass playyer magazine I have (from around 92) has
a Q&A section with the same question, and what that *earphone* is, is
a new type of monitoring system that is wireless and fits in Geddy's
ear instead of having monitors on the floor like traditional
performances.  It's just one of those technology things that Rush is
into.  The tone of the article made it osund like all three were
going to be using the new monitors, but since I didn't get to see
them this tour (Hampton show) I don't know if the Neil and Alex had
them or not.

Subject: In The Mood live lyrics

Hey there,
	Sorry if these questions have been covered already, but I've been
really curious for quite a while.  Is there a known specific reason why the
boys don't use the word "baby" anymore when they play "In The Mood"?  I've
heard them use "bully" and "ellie" (p/g & SoH videos reespectively).  Is it
because the word "baby" tends to be used in cheesy pop songs?  Another thing -
has anyone noticed that on the "Finding My Way" on the p/g video, Geddy sings
(or appears to sing) "I drank 12 beers" instead of "I've cried some bad tears"
in the first verse?  Just wonderin' if anyone knows or is just as curious as I
am.

Subject: Who's to judge?

As a diehard Rush fan, I often wonder why more Rush videos aren't played
on MTV. But then, I thought, maybe it's better that way. All MTV is
nowadays, as for almost every group, is a big over-produced
over-commercialized  sold-out mass marketed piece of crap. I can't wait
for the 'alternative'/'grunge' thing to run it's coarse. The worst group
I EVER heard in my life has to be Hole. Courtney Love sucks. Flame me if
you want, but she can't sing, and I can play guitar better with my
coc..uh, I mean my nose, than she can with her hands. The only reason she
even has a 'career' in music (Not for long, hopefully), is because she's
Kurt Cobain's wife. To make a long rant short (Too late!), Rush rules
because they built a career on music, not image. They don't trash hotel
rooms, they don't care about playing up to the critics, or selling-out.
Ever want to see a pathetic example of commercialized crap pandering to
the 'elite' rock critics? Pick up a copy of Rolling Stone. Then, burn it.
Rush has more soul than any 'alternative' act out there, and so do it's
fans.--Thanks for enduring my rant, guys!

red cover, and about them? Hmmm....

Jeff,
If you come accross ATWAS that is a trifold, get it. Mercury
started printing copies of this incredibly copesetic live recording
that only folded open once. There are some great live shots that you
can't get in the "scaled down" printing.
By the way, this was my very first album in 1977.  I've had a good
life.  Lynn

Are you referring to the low 'C' - ending the introduction?!  I've always had
the impression it was more studio trickery than detuned (or upright) bass.
 The timbre of the bass doesn't quite match that of an upright and the boys
surely liked those studio gadgets - octaved voices,  instruments distorted
all to hell to get 'By-Tor' - even today ("That's nice!"). Anyway, if you
crank-up the volume as that 'C' is hit, you can hear the note rise slightly
as it holds - could be old recording, but I think more like electronic
manipulation.  Actually, for whatever reason, they play the introduction a
full-step higher in the ATWAS version -- so there's no way to compare.  All
we can do is speculate and pretend like we have a clue!  Thank God for the
low 'B' !

How did he do it?  Ged only knows!

Subject:       Rush tribute band & anecdote

To Eric Larkin,
When I lived in Findlay, Ohio I roadtripped to Toledo to see a Rush
tribute band called "Limelight". As musicians they were pretty good,
but the singer couldn't always hit it. Of course their taste in music
made up for any deficiencies. Their originals were decent. Kind of
Pink Floyd, Marillionish.

Quick story:
Some great friends of mine in the Theta Chi house at the U. of
Findlay, who were from Pittsburgh, drove to Pittsburgh to see the boys
at Civic Arena during the Presto tour. We had to wait till the last guy
finished his finals then we took off down St. Rt. 224 heading East for
Xanadu.  The car packed with beer, Rush cds and us was suddenly were
overwhelmed by a fierce snow storm. We were so pressed for time that
one of us wouldn't even let us pull over so he could "relieve
himself", "No Damn it! We have to make! We just have to!". He just
went in an empty beer can in the front seat. Now that's dedication! We
eventually had to pull over anyway because of the white out got
unbearable. Imagin us, ecstatic because the semester was over and
even more jovial because we were seeing the band that kept our
inspiration going through finals hell (heck, life for that matter).
And now we were at a dead stop in the middle of a snow storm outside
of Akron, Ohio. We were seriously close to tears. We finally pulled
into Pittsburgh around 11:30, devastated. And the weird thing about is
that we ended up having one of the funest nights of my life because
of the company we kept. We played quarters, air-guitared and
air-drummed to Rush tunes all night.  The next morning we arose to
some of the biggest, whitest, lightest snowflakes I had ever seen. It was
beautiful.  I still have the Rush ticket stub that would never be
torn.

We have pride ourselves on having a well put together fanzine, with a lot
of interesting articles:

E.G.
We have regular interviews with the Rush and people in the Rush
organisation.

We run a letters page.

We have competions for Rush goodies, IE rare promos etc.

We have up to the minute news from the powers that be.

Subject: A place for Drummers

Hello Fellow Rush Fans,

	While surfing the net today I came across a site that might intrest all
you drummers out there. I not being a drummer more of a struggling guitarist I
am not sure of the value of the site I will let you be the judge. The address
of the drum site is:

	The Drums and Percussion Page
	http://www.cse.ogi.edu/Drum/

	Now with that out of the way I thought I would inject some Rush related
stuff.  I know that the Dream Band Thread is pretty much dead, however I just
wanted to make a comment as to my observations. I noticed that most if not all
the dream bands metioned had more than 3 members there was even one that had 28
members to the band.  This just shows me just how great our Boyz really are,
because there is only 3 of them and they put out some really great stuff.  I
don't know if any one could come up with just a three member band that would be
as good as our favorite band. (This is not a challenge and I do not want to
reignite the Dream Band Thread).
	Also to all you old timers out there I know just want you to know that
I know exactly how you feel.  I got a letter from a Rush Fan a couple of months
ago (forget the name) who told me that if he were to back to 8th grade when he
was awaiting the newest release Moving Pictures....
	I had to tell him that I were to back to 8th grade I would still be
waiting for the first album to be release in the next year or two. So kicking
back and smoking a doob while listening to my favorite album 2112 with
headphones on is something I can really relate to.
	It is nice to know that Rush as actually spaned at least two
generations with their music and hopefully will span a few more.  As nice as it
would be for Rush to never ever split up and or just simple stop producing I
know that one day it will happen.  At least we will have 25 (I hope) or so
albums to listen too.
	Well enough of all this, time for me to go back to work.  Feel free to
contact me via e-mail if you wish to discuss anything about the band or
anything else for that matter. (E-mail in sig)

Subject: More Dinosaur-type comments

Thank's to Dino for his post on 70's Rush shows, Don Kirshner, "In
Concert", etc.  Wow- what memories came flooding back!!!

I've been lucky to see Rush on every tour since Fly By Night (with
the exception of Presto), and I recall the old days of "festival
seating" quite well. Back then, we'd camp out before the concert
to get great "seats" instead of camping out a month ahead of time
to get good tickets for seats. I was able to get my 35mm cameras
(with extra lenses as well!) in a lot of shows without any hassles
- quite unlike today.

## BTW, for those of you who own the Rush bootleg at "Nelson
Center in Washington DC" in May 1976; it was, in fact, at Nelson
Center in *Springfield, IL*.  I was there and still have
promotional posters of the show. "The Godz" and "Fat Tuesday" were
the backup bands.##

Anyway, I *do* have a vague memory of seeing Rush on Don Kirshner
one night - it seems like it was only 2 or 3 songs - and I would
place it in the 1975-1977 timeframe.  I remember that sometimes
Kirshner would put in a 15 minute segment between the "main" bands
of the night; that's probably where it happened since the main
performance was at least 30-40 minutes long. Boy, that clip would
be great to see (along with many others of the time).

Date: Fri, 03 Feb 95 11:52:00 CST

Hello all!

The following is pretty trivial, but at least it has Rush content:

Because Bose Industries doesn't market its sound systems through retail
stores, it occasionally puts on demonstrations in various cities to sell its
products.  My dad went to one of these events in Chattanooga, TN, last Fall.
 While talking to a salesman about the Acoustic Wave Machine after the
presentation, my dad (for some odd reason) mentioned that his son really
likes a band called Rush.  The salesman responded, "Rush?  That's
interesting.  We just sold one of these [Acoustic Wave Machines--CD variety]
to Neil Peart last month."

I guess what makes this story noteworthy is that my dad even remembered that
I like Rush!  Despite the fact that my fanship started more than 14 years
ago and my room growing up was wall-to-wall Rush posters, I was certain
that, if pressed about his son's musical taste, my dad would say something
along the lines of, "Oh, Steve likes that rock music stuff.  He's always
listening to some band called Go, or Hurry, or something stupid like that."
 <G>

Anyway, for what it's worth, now we know that when Neil cranks up some Big
Band jazz, he's cranking it up on an awesome-sounding Bose.  Until later....

I may be completely wrong, but as much as I can judge from the official

Hi Rush:

     Sometime in 1989 my oldest son who was studying for the CPA

Subject: Another newbie unlurks...

Can you stand another newcomer emerging from the wirework???  I hope so.
I got flamed for coming out of the Closet, so to speak, in the Kate Bush
newsgroup, and ended up unsubscribing again as a result.  So far, I've
noticed people seem to be more tolerant of newbies here...whew. I could
be wrong, but I rather hope not...anyhow...

Since so many others are also coming out, allow me to introduce myself.
I'm one of the surprisingly not-so-few, the proud, the female Rush-niks.
(OOOO!!!  AAAAHHHH!!!  Please, no autograph requests...or come-ons.)  I'm
a Ryerson journalism student, in the grad program; have a degree from
Queen's University, Arts '90, English-lit major.  (Figures already,
doesn't it?)  I'm 27 and have loved Rush for over half my life
already...my first fave song of theirs was "Limelight".  I was
immediately taken with the maturity and truth of the lyrics.  I might
have been a fan earlier, but it took me till I was 13 to discover 1050
CHUM (that's before it regrettably went all-oldies, for those familiar
with Toronto radio...)  I'm still in the process of collecting all the
CDs so bear with me if I'm not familiar with the nuts and bolts of all
the stuff from all the records.  Some I haven't even heard yet, but it's
all on my "to get" list, time and money permitting <g>!  One comforting
thing I've noticed about Rush, all their stuff is consistently good, so
you can buy it sight unseen (or sound unheard) and still be assured of
satisfaction when you hear it at home!  Yessssss.

Another nice thing...their album covers are remarkably bimbette-free.
The cover of PW is mild compared to some I've seen...no flames about this
please, just my $.02 worth.  Sexism sucks.  Fortunately, these guys have
the intellectual capacity to ensure that they don't NEED sex to sell
their records.  The music alone is good enough (don't ever change,
fellas...)  How many bands do you know who can boast of that?  (Ever
notice that all those prefab rappers out there rely heavily on bimbae to
compensate for extreme lack of originality? <giggle>)  Well, time to zip
out of Soapbox mode...

Has anyone else noticed the degree of pun-humor on the album covers,
BTW?  Like, "Fly By Night" with its snowy owl (hey, it flies by night!)
or "Presto" with its explosion of bunnies (you pull 'em out of
hats--presto!)  Or maybe "Signals", with the dalmatian sniffing the fire
hydrant, is a visual pun for pheromones--scent signals!  Whoa, these guys
are funny.  A Show Of Hands opens with the 3 Stooges theme...what are
they trying to tell us??? <g>  I did hear something about one of them
saying fans don't always realize they're being funny...this one does,
though....

Later...

Subject: Sun & Moon lyrics/Harmonics

yah hey dere!
I always thought Sun and Moon was a sort of "vs." of the
male and female psychees.<sp> I.e., in keeping with one of
the general "themes" of the album (esp. Animate), the best
thing to be is not real steroiddy masculine, nor tulippy
feminine, but kinda in between, i.e., in touch with
yourself...but not too many people are like that.
Hence(or 'theretofore'), the first line:
"There is a lake between the sun and moon not too many know
about...
Well, Sun and Moon are mythological metaphors for man and
Woman. I think Apollo was the sun, and Diana was the moon...
(don't shoot me if I'm wrong...Mythology was 5 long years
ago, eh)...and then the "not too many know about", as I've
already explained.

I just get hung up on "the fine place to penetrate..."
<seg>

The Harmonic discussion(not harmonicas, durnit!)
The pinch harmonic is the squeally one. The best example in
Rush's music is probably during the fast part towards the
end of jacob's Ladder. Lerxst plays a theme, then he palm
mutes it(it gets really chunky and heavy sounding but the
same notes), and then he plays it with pinched harmonics.
This technique is also at work in Kid Gloves, though not as
evident.
Another place I can think where you hear a really good one
is during the solo to Dazed and Confused on Zep
One(btw--Page and Plant, April 28 and 29 at the rosemont
horizon--yee hoo!)...He starts the solo, and it's real high
and all that, and then there's kinda a break, and you hear a
neat-o squeal. You can't miss it if you know what you're
looking for.

I'm so surprised to hear Rush *anywhere* commercial anymore

I was watching "Bing" on Nickelodeon last Friday (this is the
show where they talk about what's hot with kids each week)
and during a segment on street hockey with Wayne Gretzky (sp?)
what should be playing in the background but "Stick it Out"?
I was stunned--Rush on a show aimed at young teenagers?
But there it was, loud and clear. Maybe there's hope for
America's youth yet! :-)

Tara,
 If you listen to 'Gordon' you will notice 'The Sprit of Radio' part in the
end of the song 'Grade 9'.  Growing up in Scarborough (a suburb of
Toronto), most of the BNL's were influenced by RUSH but especially
drummer Tyler Stewart.

	The harmonics played at the beginning of Red Barchetta are
open (or natural) harmonics where a player lightly touches the string
over or near a fret with a finger of the "fretting" hand while
simultaneously plucking the string with the plectrum.  The 5th, 7th
and 12th fret locations provide strong sounding (i.e., easily
obtained) open harmonics.

	Pinch (or artificial) harmonics are obtained by fretting a
note on the fretboard while simultaneously touching the string one
octave (12 frets) up the neck with a finger of the "picking" hand and
plucking the string with a plectrum.  These can be heard during the
guitar solo of La Villa Strangiato on ESL.  The "squealing" comes from
the fact that Lifeson is also bending the string while creating the
pinch harmonic.

Hope this helpd.

Well, in general I think it's a way to say, "No matter who you are, the
stakes are the same, etc."  Emphasizing that no one gets a free ride,
exempt from "the odds getting even."

But I have a personal theory (based on nothing) that all the "ists" in
the chorus are things that have at one time or another been said about
Rush.  Neil is fond of saying that he's not an "-ist" of any kind
(except an individualist), and Rush refuses to be pigeonholed as a band,
and this chorus could be a sly way of saying, here's all the ways in which
people have TRIED to pigeonhole my philosophy and our music, ha ha.  I'm
not sure who would have ever called Rush "muslem," but they've been around
for 20 years and heard a lot of strange things from critics and fans.
PLEASE NOTE however: This is nothing but a wacko theory of mine!

Red Barchetta contains "Natural" Harmonics. "Pinch" harmonics, also
known as "Artificial" harmonics are what you are referring to.

Subject: The Band's Name

I know the story of how the band came to be called RUSH, but a co-worker
of mine says that's not true.  He was a teenager when Rush was born, and
listened to that type of music.

He claims that that Rush was originally called _Mahogany Rush_ and later
shortened to just Rush, and that he's sure Geddy Lee was definitely the
lead singer.

Does anyone remember any group called Mahogany Rush or have any more
information on this?  TIA!

Subject: Am I a Dinosaur?

Yo Rushies!
	Dino here. I just read TNMS, #1053, and was interested in James
Screaton's entry. He wanted to know how someone qualifies to be a dinosaur.
Since I am the first to use the nickname, I feel I should lay down the rules for
determining whether an individual is a dinosaur. I should first mention that I
was given the nickname by friends several years ago because of my uncanny
ability to store vast amounts of trivia concerning 60s and 70s music. I also am
able to name the song title and artist of most songs from those decades by just
listening to the first 2 or 3 notes. I usually remember the year of release as
well.
	I would have never imagined that anyone else would want to be a
dinosaur, but since someone has expressed an interest in how one determines
whether they are or are not a dinosaur, I offer the following test. I must
state up front that age alone does not determine one's dinosaurness. Please
forgive the marginal reference to our beloved band, but once again I'm laying
down a line of history for our younger fans to appreciate.
	You are a dinosaur if you can correctly answer five of the following
questions or can identify with five of the following statements:
		(1) Who was the 5th Beatle?
		(2) Have you seen at least 100 rock concerts?
		(3) Were at least half of the shows you've seen general
		    admission (festival style)?
		(4) Did you ever see Rush when they were in their "flowing
		    robes" stage of development? (I mean live in concert)
		(5) Do you find yourself asking the question "What the hell is
		    this garbage on the radio?" in much the same way your
		    parent(s) asked the same question about the music during
		    your teen years?
		(6) Did you see the Beatles' first appearance on the Ed Sullivan		    show?
		(7) Do you know that Ed King, one of the original members of
		    Lynyrd Skynyrd, was also a member of the Strawberry Alarm
		    Clock, who's one claim to fame was the song "Incense and
		    Peppermints?"
		(8) Did you ever see Led Zeppelin live in concert?
		(9) Have you ever visited Sun Studios in Memphis?
	       (10) Did you know that "Rocket 88" is considered to be the first
		    rock'n'roll song ever, and not "Rock Around the Clock?"
	       (11) I used the peace sign before and I'm proud of it!
	       (12) I remember putting a coin on the tone arm of my record
		    player to prevent skipping.
	       (13) "Groovy," "far out," and "funky" were cool terms.
	       (14) Do you know that "Timothy" was the first rock song with a
		    topic of cannibalism?
	       (15) The purpose of attending a rock concert is to enjoy a band
		    making a spectacle of itself instead of making a spectacle
		    of yourself.
	       (16) I swear, Badfinger was just the Beatles incarnate.
	       (17) Can you name at least 10, "one-hit wonders" from the 60s
		    and 70s?
	       (18) Do you remember the *original* Mr. Potato Head, slinky,
		    wheel-o, fizzies, Neccos, Beatle mop tops, or games such as
		    Mouse Trap or Operation?
	       (19) Did you know that Lenny Bruce was doing Richard Pryor's
		    schtick long before Richard Pryor was doing it?
	       (20) Were you pissed to puke when you heard that the Archies
		    "Sugar Sugar" was chosen as the best song of the 60s over
		    anything the Beatles, Supremes, or Rolling Stones did?
	If you have to ask, "Who were the Strawberry Alarm Clock?" or "What the
hell is a fizzie?", you simply don't qualify to enter the gates of Jurassic
Park! Also note that item #4 was my minimal reference to Rush.
	If you are one of the relatively few who can identify or answer at least
five of the above items, you qualify for the title of "dinosaur." May I extend
my sincere congratulations to you. However, you may not use the title "Rock'n'
Roll Dinosaur" as that title has already been taken and is protected by legal
copyright (I wish!).
	I hope I have cleared up the issue as to what constitutes a dinosaur.
How many of you out there fit the bill?

Later, fellow Cerebral Rockers!
