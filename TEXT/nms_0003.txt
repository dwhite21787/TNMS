What is your FAVORITE RUSH SONG is a tough question.

This subject has come up in the past in a small circle of Rush fans
that used to exist in my hometown.  I can't remember the opinions
expressed back then, but I do remember that I could never reach a
decision that would last for long.  I believe that there are no bad
Rush songs; some are better than others, true, but I became wary of
saying "Rush-song-X is my ultimate favorite forever".

My problem is the following.  Rush has produced a very wide variety of
music over the years.  I favor different Rush albums/songs
depending on what state my life is in.  Granted, I have no formula to
determine which album/song to listen to when I feel a certain way.  I bring
this up because I wonder if any one else's taste shifts over the
months/years.  The important thing is, however, that it's always Rush that
remains my favorite band.  I never get tired of their sound; but I just
can't put a finger on my FAVORITE Rush song.  I can't even decide which
album I like best!  Like I said:  for me, it depends.

If I **ABSOLUTELY-HAD-TO-AND-WE'LL-KILL-YOU-IF-YOU-DON'T** choose my all-time
favorite Rush song, I would choose "La Villa Strangiato" (live on ESL).  This
song is a masterpiece, and the improvisations Geddy, Alex and Neil do on ESL
really strike me.  But, don't hold me to that.  ;^)

Someone writes:
&gt;	Can't remember Power Windows (must not have been that good if I can't
&gt; 	remember).

	It was the Steve Morse Band at the show I saw.  Pretty good but
not great, as I recall.

	I've heard that for a few dates on the Grace Under Pressure tour,
Marillion opened for them.  Damn, that's a show I'd like to have seen.

Someone else writes:
&gt;    Anybody know exactly what happened to Broon (Terry Brown)? Why he left?

	He left because they asked him to.  According to an MTV interview
with Geddy that I saw four or five years ago, they'd decided after Moving
Pictures that they wanted to do new things--"We already know how to sound
like Rush," is what Geddy said.  They made Signals, and decided that though
Terry Brown was a great producer of the kind of music they'd been making,
he wasn't particularly good with the more synth-driven art-rock they were
working on now.  So after a long painful period of contemplation they decided
to get a new producer for Grace Under Pressure.

	I don't know what Brown's doing now; I heard something about
another band he's producing but I don't remember the details.

At Cap Center in Largo, MD, on't forget Rory Gallagher one year, a
group called Zebra, or Helix or some other forgettable name, and my
all time fave Rush opening band: Marillion at Radio City Music Hall in
NYCNY.

*************** Warning **************
Possible spoiler of HYF album artwork... but not likely.

1.  The car on the right that's next to the restaurant is from another album
    (I think it's Permanent Waves?).

2.  The number 15 on the building indicates it's the 15th something (album?,
    year of being together perhaps?)

BTW, I got a boot of the Shoreline show.... it's lacking the low end on the
tape, but other than that it's pretty good.  Oh yeah, there is some dialog
of the ppl around me at various parts of the show, but it's kinda comical.

Subject: Last show of the tour, Irvine Meadows, 6/29

I just have to gloat about how I spent June 29 - Don't read this if you
don't like happy stories...

I was a little tense in the morning, since I was just finishing my
traditional week without listening to Rush before seeing them live.  (Try
it sometime - it makes the concert even better!)

Anyway, after finishing at school, I was ready for the real purpose of the
day, which should be obvious by this point.  I drove to the airport (did I
mention that my sister is a pilot?) and met my girlfriend and my sister.
On the way to LA, we got to watch the planes fighting the SB fire and
listen to them on the radio, which was kinda neat, but wasn't crucial to
enjoying the day.

We were met at the airport in Fullerton by Kelly Bowen (formerly
izzyn64@oac.ucla.edu, until she graduated, making arrangements for the day
much more difficult.)  Anyway, we drove to Irvine Meadows...

Strangely, we didn't see any scalpers in the parking lot before the show.
(I view this as progress!)

Being not sure what time the show was, we arrived around 7pm and picked up
some more souvenirs.  (When did the 'Presto Posters' start being sold,
anyway - they didn't have them in April!)  Having accomplished that
mission, we picked up our tickets and bought some food.  (Don't ever buy
food at Irvine Meadows, by the way.)  We debated whether we should listen
to Mr. Big or not, and for some reason we decided to see them again.  (My
girlfriend hadn't seen them before, and couldn't understand why Kelly and I
weren't excited about them at all.)

We were pleasantly surprised to discover that we were in the 20th row, just
a few seats away from being in the center, slightly off to Geddy's side of
the stage.

Ironically, when Mr. Big started playing, the sun hadn't set yet, so the
light show didn't help them much.  But they were joined by a few, far
superior, musicians during their last number, called "Addicted to That
Rush" or something similar.

After Mr. Big left the stage, we were relieved to be finished with that
portion of the show.  (My girlfriend suggested that that was a test of some
kind to see if we really wanted to see Rush - if we were good and sat
through the opening act, we would earn the right to see Rush.  :-) )
Around this time, we noticed that there was a small movie screen above the
stage, rather than behind it, and we also got to watch a guy get seriously
sick and practically explode over some people a few rows in front of us,
which could be viewed as a good thing, since those people left, and they
were really tall.  This way, we could see...   But I still can't believe
that people go to concerts and get that sick - what a waste of a ticket!

But then Rush started, right on time at 9pm.  Unfortunately, as I've
mentioned already, they were using a small screen above them, so the films
lost a lot of impact.  Anybody know why they would do that?  The band
seemed very relaxed for this show - Neil smiled quite often, actually, and
Alex and Geddy seemed very relaxed.  Geddy made quite a few vocal flubs,
but it was still probably the best show I've ever seen them do.  There
really weren't any surprises during the show.  I was hoping that they would
do something special for the last night of the tour, but they didn't.  They
did leave the lights out for quite a while after they left the stage, so we
were thinking that we might get an extra encore or something.  But it was
still a great show with a great audience.  Speaking of the great audience,
was anybody else on the list there?  (Anybody have a tape?)

I would like to get a tape of a Presto show - if anybody has one, I'm sure
I can come up with something from my collection that you'd like...

So after the show, we drove back to the airport and headed home.  (The
fires in SB were really amazing to see from the air, too - they were HUGE!
- especially at night.)

All in all, a good trip.  I guess I've gloated long enough...

Next?

Subject: opening acts

As I recall on the Power Windows tour, the opening band in Worcester
(MA) was The Steve Morse Band. This has got to bet the *best* opening
act they have ever had. I think UB40 opened for them once a while back
on the Signals Tour, as well as Stevie Ray Vaughn. Anyways, it does seem
strange that they would get a band like Mr. Big to open for them. Paul
Gilbert the guitarist seems pretty cool, but Sheehan sounds like some
crazed sex maniac in interviews. Marillion sounds more like a better
opening act [oh, I guess this has to be the best opening act they have
had....in Radio City Music Hall back in '84 I think].

Just a note about the opening bands...

In California on the Power Windows Tour The Steve Morse Band was th
opening act.

I also know that Marillion opened for Rush on more than one of
their east coast tours.

Time to go dig into my Bill Grahm 24year show list and see what I can
find......

This is a list of all of the shows that Rush played in that Bill Grahm
produced. Limited of course especially considering the Signals and
Hold Your Fire shows weren't even put on in the Bay Area due to personal
conflicts between the band and Grahm.
