Subject: The 2112- Al Capone- Chicago streets connection

This is a bizarre little factoid.  As most people familiar with the city of
Chicago know, and for those who don't, there is a street in downtown Chicago
called Rush St.  As a longtime Rush fan and Chicago resident, I've wondered to
myself for some time "Is there a  2112 Rush St.?".  Well, I grabbed my map of
Chicago and checked it out, thinking that SOMEBODY has themselves the ultimate
Rush address- no such luck.  Rush St. is a short street that extends only for
several blocks in the downtown area.  2112 Rush St. would have to extend for
quite a few blocks north or south of downtown in order to exist.   

But I didn't give up.  I decided to figure out exactly WHERE 2112 Rush St.
would be, assuming Rush St. DID extend that far.  I grabbed a straightedge and
a pencil and went at it.  I lined the straightedge along the diagonally-
running Rush St. and followed it north.  Rush St. heading northbound ends at
Division St. (1200 N.) - I would have to extend Rush. St. for about 9 more
blocks until I would be at the mythical "2112 N. Rush St."  
At Armitage Ave. (2000 N.), the north-east running Clark St. crossed into the
path, and followed the path of my straightedge fairly closely as I continued
moving north.  I followed my straightedge up another block to 2100 N.- then up
a tiny bit more...  At last, I was looking at the approximate location of 2112
N. Rush St.   But wait....something was strangely familiar about this spot on
the map.   I ran to my bookcase and pulled out an old copy of "Capone"- the
biography of the notorious prohibition-era Chicago gangster Al Capone.
Although officially unsolved, it is widely believed that he was behind the
infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929.  Flipping through the yellowed
pages, I reached the one I was looking for... 

The site of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, in which seven members of the
O'Banion gang were lined up against a wall and brutally shot to death is no
longer standing.  It occured in the S-M-C Cartage Company- a squat warehouse
long since demolished.  It's address was 2122 N. Clark St.  The mythical Rush
address of 2112 N. Rush St. in Chicago would be directly next to the site of
one of the bloodiest gangland murders in history.  <Twilight Zone music

Subject: 2112 issue/South America's dream

    Hi,everyone!I'm in theTNMS mailing list for about 2 weeks now and
I'm having a lot of fun.You know,I liked the idea from Rob Savoury;about
the 2112 issue being a space for the fans to describe their
relationships with Rush.
    If I may,I would like to contribute to it:
    I live in a middletown here in Brasil and I'm a Rush fan since
1985,when I first had contact with their magic by listening to the "All
the World's a Stage"album.Since this first time I just felt in love with
the band.I just couldn't believe that a band could mix
melodies,harmonies and playing skills so perfectly, interpreted with so
much energy and plus have lirycs that express such beautiful points of
view like the Neil Peart ones. I mean,the guy is the most criative
drummer of all time, and he can write like that either!
    I'm 26 years old now,so my life had so many changes all those years
but there is one thing that never changed:the love and respect that I
have for what these three guys have been doing for the music all those
years,simply pushing it to another level.
    By the way,I think that "Middletown Dreams" is one of the most
beautiful lyrics of all time.It's in the tradition of "Time" from Roger
Waters but  even deeper and universal.
    I still keep one dream alive:a Rush concert here in Brasil!It would
be a different stage for the fans around here and I know that the boys
would like it either.There is so much Rush fans in South America!We just
keep waiting.

  Geddy frequently plays around with some of the lyrics, like throwing 
     some baseball references in "The Spirit of Baseball(Radio)", and in 
     "Tom Sawyer" he sometimes says "catch the baseball" in place of
"catch 
     the spit".

I can attest to the Rush/bowling connection.  A couple of tours ago a
friend of mine had a friend who knew of a private party at a local
bowling alley after a Rush Concert.  She said she could only bring one
friend and invited me.  Unfortunately, my brother was with at the time
and he doesn't drive and it was last minute, so I couldn't go.  But my
bro and I always see Rush together so it was like, oh well.  My friend
said it was the band, roadies and family for the most part.

anyone in so cal (Orange County, between LA and SD) should feel free to
drop by tustin lanes on sunday the 13th (this sunday) for rock and bowl.
My band and 2 others will be playing at 9pm!  Its not rush covers or
anything, but many people who are hearing our tape seem to be liking it!
Samples can be downloaded at

sorry I keep plugging this, but since the topic of bowling keeps coming
up, I thought it would be appropriate for this thread... all info is on
the webpage, or tustin lanes can be called at 714-731-5022

hope to see any local NMS rush fans who happen to be open to, and
interested in new  music, show up at this show, it would be a pleasant
suprise, plus it would make me look good as a player/promoter, trying to
bring people in to see a new band, at a new venue (live bands are new for
tustin lanes)

see ya

 Actually it was 1985 when Alex did that. I'm sure he wouldn't want that
 broadcast around though.  Platinum Blonde wouldn't mind though, they
 probably need the money :)
  
 The other song is called "Crying Over You". Geez, I don't believe I
 actually own that album. It is called "Alien Shores". Coincidence??? I hope
 so.

Hi all,

Yes, another shameless plug here:  Rush E-Postcards.  In fact there's 
one waiting for the NMS readership at 
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Underground/6756/rushcard.htm  
You'll have to plug in the ticket code 1108222814150 to get the card.  
Anyway, I hope you enjoy them.  Send one to everybody you know.

Cool to read what everyone's been saying about Pat Methany.  For me, his 
NEW CHAUTAUQUA album is his absolute best.  I also enjoyed THE ROAD TO 
YOU (Pat live in Europe) and will have to pick it up soon.  Speaking of 
Jazz guitarists, any Charlie Hunter fans?  Check out BING BING BING if 
you can.  Charlie's cover of Nirvana's "Come As You Are" will turn some 
heads for sure!

Anxiously awaiting October 6!

The other day I was reading through a majour Canadian newspaper (the
Toronto Sun) and there was an article on upcoming live albums. I noticed
that Rush wasn't included so I wrote them this letter.

 ----------------------------------------start

Hello there,

 Under the new fall album preview I noticed you left out the most
 successful Canadian band of all time!

    There was NO mention of the Triple Live album coming out from RUSH,
 to be released Nov.17.

     You should all be ashamed of yourselves for not including this.
This
 could be the last album released by the band, do to circumstances
 revolving around Neil Peart (his wife and daughter died within the last

 year).  Neil Peart by the way is the drummer for Rush.

Subject: return of "Madonna rips off Rush" + Eve Plumb action

Hey Rush marks!
("mark" is a wrestling insider term for a fan.... a fan that thinks
wrestling is real, and we all know Rush is the "Real Deal", Holyfield!)

I received several inquiries as to my posting a week or so back about
Madonna ripping off Rush. And unlike the responses I get from a list just
like this, but for Metallica, the Rush correspondence was all very polite,
contained good grammar and no misspelled words....again, unlike the
responses from the Metallica Human Debris. And with the Rush mgrs.
permission, I would like to post what I found.

The following passage is from MTV News online. It is from an interview with
Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam, in which he mentions the correlation. 
 
 ---------------------------------------------------
Throughout the tour, the band has been covering the Who's "Baba O'Reilly,"
English Beat's "Save It For Later," Steven Van Zandt's "I'm A Patriot," and
Pink Floyd's "Another Brick In The Wall." 

Lately, portions of Madonna's "Ray Of Light" have also turned up in its show
and Pearl Jam talked with MTV News recently about how the song had worked
its way into the band's live set.

"Ed has been singing 'Ray of Light,'" said guitarist Stone Gossard, "and
he's pretty into that song...I think it's a great song."

"It reminds me of some old Rush song though," added bassist Jeff Ament,
"like the chorus and the melody, you know?"

"I can't believe Madonna is ripping-off Rush," Gossard said, "but [the cover
songs have] been fun. The best part has been to be able to play different
songs off different records every night -- that's the fun of having five
records.    (end of passage)
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hmmm.... what a weird idea......"different songs, off different records
every night"...5 records.... that would not work I guess if you have 15 or
16 albums, huh? Dare to dream!  Any idea what song(s) he could be speaking
of? 

Y'all have a good weekend, Football is here, and the best sport of all,
HOCKEY, starts preseason next weekend! 

yours in allegiance,
Bryan

Subject: Details of live Rush collection

I saw this in today's Jam! Music from CANOE (at the following
address)...

http://www.canoe.com/Jam/canoejam.html

**********

Canada - Friday, September 11, 1998 

Details of live Rush collection

By KAREN BLISS -- Jam! Music

Canadian rock trio Rush will release a live
triple-album set, titled "Different Stages",
Nov. 10 in the U.S. on Atlantic, and on or
around that date in Canada on
Anthem/Universal. 
                 
Discs 1 and 2 are live recordings culled
largely from the band's last North American
tour behind the "Test For Echo" album. 
                 
"You hear '2112' in its entirety live, which was probably one of the
major highlights of that tour because it hadn't been played in eons,
plus there are some things from the 'Counterparts' tour that weren't
played on (the 'Test For Echo' tour)," says a spokesperson at SRO
Management, who didn't wish to be mentioned by name. 
                 
The big news, however, is Disc 3. Considered a bonus album, it is
an archival concert recorded in 1978 at Hammersmith in London,
England, during the "Farewell To Kings" tour. 
                 
"It includes everything from that album, but also has songs going
back to 'Fly By Night', 'In The Mood', 'Bastille Day', much earlier
recordings," says the SRO spokesperson. 
                 
"These guys hold on to a lot of stuff. They found this, and it was a
great piece of work, so they wanted to put it out for the fans. They
haven't done that kind of thing before." 
                 
Rush -- Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart -- has not yet
started working on any new material. 
                 
"They're concentrating on this," says SRO. 
                 
"It was a lot of work. They did a lot of work mixing and creating,
so they're focusing on promoting this right now."

Can't wait until November 10th !!

Subject: Miscellaneous

Damn so i never used to ever read a whole NMS and i finally just started 
doing that in the last few issues- i used to get them every day or twice 
a day and right after i started reading em i got the next one after 3 
days! what's up with that?

About issue 2112- i think you guys are just plain thinking about it too 
much- it'll never get organized any one way- i doubt it'll ever stay 
blank and i doubt everyone will agree to write about the same topic- i 
have my own ideas for it but i'll keep em to myself- let everyone submit 
what they feel is appropriate and special to them...

a few issues back i noticed someone talking about Tolkien... saying most 
Rush fans like Tolkien- i never knew that. i was sitting there going 
"how'd you know?" So now i was just wondering what else everyone out 
there reads... personally Jim Carroll is my fav author and Robert 
Jordan's The Wheel of Time series runs a close second... i like a lot of 
Transcendentalism too- Thoreau especially- that guy cracks me up ;)

now speaking of misheard lyrics- i am the queen of that. i've been 
correcting myself on a lot of lyrics lately to the point that i don't 
remember a lot of what i said wrong- however, here's the ones i can 
think of at the moment...

Subdivisions- "sprawling on the fringes of the city, need a magic 
border, an insulated order, in between the bright lights and the parlor 
lit unrooms"

Red Barchetta-"sundays i <insert mumble here> and hop the turbine 
freight, to far outside the wire where my winded uncle waits, jump to 
the barn... tires spitting gravel, i come ill my meekly mime... 
straining to live as machine and man..."

talk about butchering lyrics- don't get me wrong, i knew those weren't 
the right lyrics as i sung them but i had to make up something to 
pretend i knew em right? i know there's plenty more but i'll add em as i 
get to em...

all this talk about rush and cars keeps reminding me of how one time i 
was driving on a curvy mountain road coming down at like 70 or 80 around 
real sharp cliff turns, etc.- basically just being a reckless driver but 
having fun with it and i remember ejecting the tape to see what's on the 
radio and finding Red Barchetta on.. i put the volume up so high that i 
had to yell 3 or 4 times till everyone else in the car knew what the 
song was about and why it was so cool that it was on at the moment...

hey, i almost did go to see small soldiers because of tom sawyer in the 
preview... hehe...

okay, out of stuff to say...

I can't say that I agree with using Reznor and I highly doubt that Rush =
would take a "step backward" by enlisting Terry Brown.  Then again, they =
suprised me by going back to Peter Collins after the Rupert Hine =
experiment.  (That one (using Hine) disappointed me a bit even though it =
was exactly what I had suggested.)  I was thinking I would like to see =
them work with (I hope I'm getting the name right) Chris Hughes.  He =
worked with Tears for Fears on "Songs from the Big Chair" and Robert =
Plant on "Fate of Nations."  I thought "Fate of Nations" was stunning in =
the depth of the music.  I think his comlex, layered style would suit =
Rush in both their edgy and atmospheric styles.  Who else is out there?

Subject: Comparing Drummers

Hey all,

Don't mean to throw an apple of dischord into the fray here (I do remember 
that TNMS is supposed to be a constructive collaboration ¯ and it mostly is), 
but I have to chuckle whenever two or more persons start ranting over who's 
the better drummer. 

I, too, went through a Neil Is God! phase and still have a high respect for 
his musicianship.  However, people can compare Neil and Terry and Bruford and 
all those gurus of modern rock drumming (even though Bozzio does do excellent 
jazz cross-overs) 'til the cows float away and when the dust clears (pardon 
the mixed metaphor), the jazz giants like Krupa and Rich and Weckl and Phil 
Jones will still stand aloof.  People on this list should start listening to 
more jazz.

On a positive note: the other day I was explaining for the umpteenth time to 
my very patient wife how Neil plays with words in "Hand Over Fist" ¯ you 
know, "Don't ask me/I'm just sympathizing/my allusion to careless flight  
Don't ask me/I'm just improvising/My illusion's more heat than light"  and 
revelling in their semantic structure and playfulness and just feeling warm 
all over that there does indeed exist a band like Rush for al of us to feel 
good about and to lose ourselves in.

cheers,

I first heard the Santana song "Black Magic Woman" when I was maybe 7
years old.  Until the age of 14 I thought that Santana was singing:

" Got a black plastic woman, I got a black plastic woman" instead of
"Black magic woman"

that's about as bad as it gets.

Subject: Bst live album & Hall Of Fame

>From NMS 2101
=============

The best non-Rush live album:

FRANK SINATRA and the RED NORVO QUINTET - Live In Australia 1959

The single greatest vocal performance in the history of music!!!!!!!
=============
I don't know about BEST non-Rush live album, but it is great (there's
some low level tape hiss from the original master, but it's close to 
inaudible for the most part). What makes this album special is Frank's
speaking part half-way through; it's incredibly funny. He could have
been an A+ stand-up comedian instead of a singer if he'd wanted to. 
Plus, his apology for not showing up for the 1958 shows (he says that he
got drunk in Honolulu and wound up in a geisha house in Japan and missed
Australia completely) almost made me cry from laughing so hard. I
certainly agree with Scott that this CD is a must-have (it's on Blue
Note).

A reply to the studio owner/engineer about sequencing/and or sampling.
You make some valid points about the possible uses of technology by RUSH.
But not entirely accurate.  There is an article in the July '97 EQ magazine
which explains the ENTIRE RUSH midi rig.  It's a VERY interesting article.
They really don't sequence at all.  It's all triggered samples.  They found
it easier to "sample" a sequence rather than to "sequence" samples!
Find a back issue, I think you will have your questions answered!
I did!

There's been some talk recently about the 3/24/86 Diamonds in the Waste 
boot and how crappy it sounds (it does by the way), but I haven't seen 
anyone mention the fact that there is a tape, from a different source, of 
this entire show available through traders.  Forget that Diamonds in the 
Waste crap, which in addition to sounding poor is only about half of 
the show, and instead spend a total of $2.50 on blank tapes and work 
out a trade with someone to get the complete show, which sounds great.  
It's well worth it.

jammin' Rush fans: DANGER: DO NOT MIX.  Sure, shake it hard!  

Free will/Totem thread: Chris and Jason, I wanted to emphasize (one of
you already pointed this out) Neil may not be actually referring to his
actual NEIL E. PEART self when he writes, *I've* got twelve
bananas....etc.  (oops, misheard lyrics.)  So these words may not be 
*his* actual beliefs.  If anyone asked me I'd say the songs don't
reflect his beliefs fully -- not based on what I've read about him, but
just because sometimes songs are written that way.  Of course we all
have thoughts to keep well-hidden, eh?  I like that line the best.  And,
free to browse among the holy chaos!

Ambergris8: I've never thought about taking them all three, them being
family men and all.....but it's an interesting thought!  Made me laugh
long, anyhoo.  Naughty naughty chick Rush fans!  Who said Rush is
without sexual attraction?   This, on the heels of Ayn Rand/Aimee Mann. 
That was gross.  ;-)

Subject: RE: a lot of interesting things

To all fellow Rush fans,
	What does anything that has anything to do about Ryan Leaf and the
Chargers have to do with the Men of Willowdale?  I thought this was a
Rush newsletter?  They are a Canadian band.  You should be talking about
a real sport, HOCKEY!!!  By the way, to the sorry sap that is a
"die-hard" Lions fan, die-hards are the only fans the Lions have.  I'm
from Detroit, I should know.  Never root for a team who have been
rebuilding for 35 years.  As for hockey, the Red Wings SHOULD
three-peat.  As long as Mr. Hull does his usual cry-baby routine, and
disrupts Dallas' devastating defense.  And a baseball note (in honor of
Ged) hats off to Big Mac on his 62nd!  Come Sammy, we're rootin' for you
to catch up!
	Also, for the last time, Pat Metheny's last name is spelled with 2 E's
and no A's.  I have nine of his albums.  I know, I must be the only fool
that loves Rush, and listens to jazz.  On all nine of the Metheny discs
I have, they are all spelled with two E's and no A's.  Except "Imaginary
Day" which uses to elephant heads.  It's a coded thing that you would
have to see to enjoy and understand.
	As for live albums, I don't want to be bias, but "Exit...Stage Left" is
still the best in my opinion.  I have only started receiving TNMS, so I
don't know if Rush was excluded.  Other than that, "Blow Your Face Out"
from the J. Geils Band.  Both this and one other Geils live album were
recorded in Detroit, therefore they get a lot of radio play here.  But
they give so much added energy to the songs, they make the studio
versions sound REAL weak.  And who doesn't love "The Wooba Gooba with
the Green Teeth"?!
	Lyrical misquote: until I was 13 years old (1983) when someone sat me
down to show me the lyrics to "Tom Sawyer", I always thought it was
"Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you, and the spacey invaders get by
on you"
	Possible Rush producers: I kind of like the Trent Reznor idea.  I
thought "The Downward Spiral" was amazing.  His fresh sound would mix
well with the boys.  They have always tweaked their sound from album to
album, with what direction music as a whole was going.  But, in many
respects, as stated by Lee (deckard@uswest.com), producers don't have a
lot of impact on the album, unless they also mix it.  Brendan O'Brien is
a good choice that could do both.  Another one that would interest me is
Andy Johns (Satriani and Van Halen).  He does both produce and mix.  Two
choices I hesitate to say are Sam Taylor (King's X and Galactic Cowboys)
and Steve Lillywhite.  Yes, I still would like to hear Rush and
Lillywhite collaborate.  For some reason or another, Grace Under
Pressure is still my favorite Rush album.  "Visions" describes the
producer thing for P/G as a fiasco.  Eventually Peter Henderson ended up
with the credit.  Hell, maybe they should try one without anybody.
	Question for all you folks.  What is "Mirrors"?  I keep hearing about
it.  Is it a...ACK!!...bootleg? 
	Thank you for letting me spew my b.s.  Until next time.

   [ "Mirrors" is indeed.. um.. footware...                     : rush-mgr ]

Subject: Optimism and other stuff...

Just a few ideas I'm curious about:

1. (insert optimism here) When Rush is inducted into the R&R Hall O' Fame,
what song(s) should they play? Should they allow any other inductees to jam
with them on stage? Who would you like to see play along with them? (that is
if they have the jam session in '99)

2. I've been listening to live Rush recordings as of late and I wonder if
anyone has this problem ---- Does it take you a while to get used to their
studio stuff again. After hearing the raw power of their concerts, the
studio albums seem almost too squeeky clean. What do you think?

Take care...

A few nights ago I had this funny dream...

My wife and I were standed at my parents' house due to a snowstorm. Anyway,
I hear a knock on the door and answer it and it's the boys from Rush. Wow.
Their tour bus was stranded and they needed a warm place to stay. They spend
the night and are really glad we let them stay. I ask for their autograph,
but all I can find for them to sign is a baseball. They sign it and go on
their merry way.

(Strange huh. Even stranger is that the previous week I had the same dream,
but it was Moulder and Scully from the X-Files that stayed at the house in
the dream. They signed the baseball then, too. The ball that Rush signed had
their signatures already on it from the previous week's dream. Analyze that!
  too much TV before bedtime I suppose)

Take care :)

Well...Andy Wallace has worked on some GREAT albums. For starters, try
the last three Faith No More albums....FNM actually reminds me of that
combination of heavy guitar with a bit of subtle keyboard that Rush
utilizes. I PERSONALLY think this is what Dream Theater SHOULD sound
like..but hey..thats JUST MOI!:-) Cliff Norell has worked on 1) The
Colour and the Shape by the Foo Fighters (AMAZING ALBUM!!!!!) 2) The
last couple of Sonic Youth albums (again..really good stuff..) 3) The
last few REM albums. Theres a few things to get ya started...I would
suggest ANY of these albums to Rush fans. Oh ya...and I remember hearing
the song "Tragic Kingdom" by No Doubt on the p.a. at the Toronto T4E
show (I know Neil picks these songs personally..he calls it his way of
operating "..hi own little radio station..". So, besides that HORRIBLE
song "Don't Puke"..err.."Don't Speak"...the Tragic Kingdom cd is kinda
funky and good, and actually reminds me of Rush with some of the ska
mixed with heavy guitar (ala' Alex 1982-1986). Anyways...'nuff of my
