Subject: NMS 1083/Boot Cd

To the person who thought that the names of Talbot and Dubois were just named
of buddies that the person stuck on the CD....YOU'RE WAY WRONG!!

Pierre (sp?) Dubois not only wrote Tom Saweryer with Rush, but also wrote
"Superconducter" off of PRESTO, and "Between Sun and Moon" off of
COUNTERPARTS!!

   [ I believe you mean Pye Dubois...                         : rush-mgr ]

Dubois is a really good friend of Neil Pearts....refer to the Counterparts
inworld premiere interview from October of 1993.

As for Talbot, I know that he wrote "Closer to the Heart" with the boys, but
nothing else that i can tell...

Just wanted to clear this up!!!!

Subject: 2112/Something for Nothing

Hello all...

I know that everone here is interested in lyrics, and was wondering if anyone
here had an opinion on the reference to 2112 (can't say if it was on purpose
on not...)

"The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh...noo.

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over.." -2112

and

"Waiting for someone to call
And turn your world around
Looking for an answer to
The question you have found
Looking for
An open door

No, You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for free
You won't get wise
With the sleep still in your eyes
No matter what your dreams might be"-Something For Nothing

(lyrics taken from ftp at syrinx.umd.edu, any problems with them sould
therefore be addressed to the authors of this file)

The quote  "You won't get wise / With the sleep still in your eyes / No
matter what your dreams might be" seems very relevent to the actions in 2112
above.
  I am very interested in comment either on this forum or at
rivstyx@aol.com   or   76462.3302@compuserve.com
Thanks...

Hi all Rush-fans out there!
I'm a Rush-fan from Sweden who really like to read TNMS,(I've just
taken a subscription on the electronic mag, much easier than download it
from Compuserve).
I want some help with addresses to shops who sell's not so official cd's by
Rush (fax# or e-mailaddress if it's possible) if you have any reliable
boys/women
to recommend.
The shop-list on FTP/Syrinx.umd.edu seems a little bit out of date, I've tried
several shops but there was no answer on their fax#, neither did the e-mail
addresses work.

Thanks in advance, mein froinds!

Greetings!

I am a little behind on my NMS readings (just read 3/27), so maybe some of the
other posters (not the paper kind, the NMS posting kind!) from here have 
already told of this.  Near Colorado Springs out towards the prarie is Rush, 
Colorado.  Other than the cool name, there is not any good things I can say 
about this place.  Oh yeah, I once heard of an unrestored '70 hemi Cuda 
hidden in a garage there.  It's a very small ranching-type town about 20 
miles away.  I have always wanted to drive out there with
my hatchet, axe or saw, and add a nice little wall hanging to my garage.

Subject: More Philosophical Debate

Hello, all,
        This is my first posting, though I've been listening in for over a
year now.  I must say that listening to Rush got me into hard rock about
six years ago (I used to hate it), and that they're still my favorite
group.
        As for the trees:

        I have to disagree with this idea.  Rand held that some people
would always lose out (except, maybe, in her ideal society of Galt's
Gulch).  It is simply how hard one works to be happy and free that is the
determinant of who really wins.  In my mind, the song is a parable to be
taken that when socialism is introduced into a society, it helps nobody,
and actually ends up hurting them.
        Also, I can corroborate what MARQUIRR@academic.fpc.edu said in his
story about waiting for the Worcester Centrum show of Cp.  You're right
Randy, It was *COLD* out there.  My friend and I arrived at 11:00 the night
before, and waited a record eleven hours in the parking lot of a music
store in Lowell...
Around 4:00 in the morning 6 police cruisers came barrelling into the
parking lot and practically scared the life out of us... They thought that
we were planning to rob the store (One would think that other bands had
fans that waited at night... I guess not!) Needless to say that we had an
excellent view of the Boyz, once the concert finally came around, but not
without some truly interesting memories.

Subject: unorthodox playing

I have read in a few past posts ( since I have joined an internet provider
recently!!) about Geddy's
bass playing being less than technical or perfect..   Well, he makes it
sing!  So what if you don't play an instrument like it is supposed to be
played with a certain finger here or there!!   Alex is unorthodoxed as can
be.. Thats why many guitarists can't play him.  Look at Eddie VanHalen.. You
wrote the book there.. But yet he is known as one of the best of all time!
The post a few days ago from the bassist who noted on Geddy's inperfections,
thats what makes a great musician.. Figuring out ways of playing the
instrument like no one else has before.. Thats OK if his thumb sticks over
too far.  If you are gonna be techincal, you will sound like every other
Tom, Dick and Harry, who has ever sat in front of a board and a 16 track.
As a musician myself,
( piano since age 4 and organ, then guitar in my high school days and up to
now! ) I find it difficult to copy many
of what my guitar playing friends call easy.. ( that is average run of the
mill,  Rock and Roll guitarists..)..
Alex, usually I can listen to a few times and play note for note..  Eddie
VH, is the king to me, next to Alex..
But yet I can play *most* of his stuff.. Take Clapton ,  forget it..  What I
am trying to say is there is NO
wrong way to play a guitar or bass.. ( Piano is different,  when my old
teacher kept saying - " Curve your
Fingers-- Curve your fingers! )..  Thats what makes Rush so great.. They are
ALL very much unique..
And since the synth additions,  my point is that they added a fourth
"virtual" musician.. The synths are great.
Counterparts was a great way to escape that a bit..

In response to Phil Romans remark: "Best I can figure is that someone
wanted their buddies names next to the trio and plugged them in."
Read the liner notes and credits on MP and AFTK Dubois and Talbot are
both credited for lyrics along with Neil.  So no buddy theory.

This leaves the question as to who theollaborators are.  I have no idea.
I've noticed the credit before but never relayy gave it much thought. Any
in put would be interesting.

On the subject of Rush's influence on other bands, am I the only one who
recalls the strongly GUP-flavored moments on the first Icicle Works album?
This was particularly true on the song "Factory in the Desert".

I thought this band had promise, despite the ludicrous lyrics.  Unfortunately,
they soon took a creative nose-dive. . . oh, well . . .

Troy (AND ALL OTHER RUSH FANS),

First let me say that NONE OF US KNOWS WHAT THE MEANING OF "THE TREES" IS!
 We just have our own views on the subject.  Only Neil knows what he
originaly meant when he wrote it.

Now, one to Troy's statements on racism,

T>>The song is *not* about taking a little pain for the sake of equality.
T>It's
T>about what happens when a group tries to attain equality by destructive
T>and
T>coercive means.<

T>Sounds like a very racist and/or sexist-driven statement to me. "a group
T>TRIES to attain EQUALITY"? Please justify your statement.

Gee, I don't know.  Could it be that "a group" refers to the maples, and
"TRIES to attain EQUALITY" refers to them wanting the same light the oaks
get.  Why are people like YOU so quick to label a person "RACIST".  I'm
sure you will think I'm one also, but guess what?  I DON'T CARE!

"The righteous rise           "Those who know whats best for us-
 With burning eyes             Must rise and save us from ourselves"
 Of hatred and ill-will"

"Quick to judge
 Quick to anger
 Slow to understand"

T>>The maples could have occupied a different part of the forest that they
T>would own outright and where they would not have to compete with oaks for
T>light.<

T>And I'm sorry, but that sounds like forced segregation to me. Go be with
T>your own kind, etc.

Could the Maples live in the same space with the Oaks and still get as much
light as the Oaks?  I think not.  Oaks by their very nature (which they
cannot change) are taller than maples and therefore take up much of the
maples light.  If segregation is the ONLY way for the Maples to receive
equal quantity and quality of light, then so be it!  Far better than..."the
trees are all kept equal, by hatchet, axe and saw!"

Subject: Hockey 2112; some other stuff

Well, the hockey season is now in its stretch run. As a Detroit sports
fan, I guess I could get into some interesting conversations with the
guys about the Jays and Tigers and Leafs and Wings. Anyway... a few weeks
ago, the Red Wings acquired Bob Errey from the San Jose Sharks and he
took number 21 because Mike Sillinger already had Errey's favorite number.
Well, when Sillinger and Jason York were traded to Anaheim, Errey switched
his number to number 12. So, Errey went from 21 to 12. Cool, huh?

Oh, what else. Oh - I just got tickets to see Boston at Pine Knob in May.
That prompted me to put aside my Rush CDs for a while and relisten to
my Boston (only four?! Sheesh. Darn lawsuits/contracts/picky musicians.)
Anyway, I was reading the "liner notes" or whatever they're called in CDs,
and noticed that Boston makes a big deal out of not using computers and
tapes and recordings and stuff either in the studio or live. Well, knowing
that Rush makes big-time use of MIDI and sampling during concerts and is
always checking out new technologies in their albums, this kinda cheeses
me off. I know Tommy Scholz is a mech-e grad of MIT, and having lived with
a couple engineers in college, I know they can be picky about exactness
(unless it came to partial credit on tests and labs). But doesn't it seem
that Boston is being kinda high and mighty? I mean, especially after their
lawsuit against CBS so they could design high-tech amps and such, they
seem to be taking a holier-that-thou stance. I guess they're denigrating
"bad" uses of drum mahcines and synths, but through Rush and their
proteges, we know computers can be used for good in music. Well, I know
this has little to do with Rush, but it's been bugging me.

Okay, I'll end with some disjointed Rush content. Uriah Heep, a significant
band in the history of Rush, has a song where they just sing the English
alphabet and pronounce the last letter "Zed." As for concert t-shirts, I
was at the credit union cond]cting business and a woman and her little
kid were behind me in line. When I left the teller, the woman said to me
that my shirt (the tourtoise & hare with the "counterparts" on the back)
was interesting or something like that. I thanked her and told her it was
a concert shirt, which seemed to impress her (hey, it is different from
a "Screeming Sexists With Long, Messy Hair - Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Rule
World Tour shirt), and her kid recognized the tourtoise and hare. That was
neat.

Later, David

Hey Rush fans!!!

	This is my first post to NMS.
	Last week I had the pleasure of attending the RUSH Limbaugh show.
Some of you might feel that this is not such a pleasurable thing, but I
digress.  Before the show is actually filmed, Rush comes out and give an
audience briefing, where everyone gets to ask questions.
	In the past, Rush has used some songs by Rush as "bumper music"
in between commercial breaks, and I always wondered if there might be some
sort of connection between the two RUSH's.  So, I asked him, "Are you
a Rush fan?"  His reply was yes!

Thank God he didn't get to Geddy. Or Slash or Einstein or, well you get my
point. The whole Trees debate made me think of a story about Robert Frost.
It seems the poet was visiting an advanced college english class, and they
happened to be analyzing one of the lines from his poems. The professor
proposed many theories about the meaning of the line, and the students had
their own insights. They had been debating for over two weeks, and the
discussion was going nowhere. The professor finally asked Frost what the
line really meant. Frost replied,"I don't know, it just sounded nice.".
The discussion was interesting, but now it's time to move on to something
else. Maybe "Natural Science"?
P.S. Recently I have gotten the idea that I am the only liberal on this
mailing list. Are there any others? It seems everyone likes the OTHER Rush.

Subject: What are the chances?

Ok,

	It's 'bout 4:00 AM and I'm bored.  I'm listening to Presto while
studying Calc.  Then I start thinking about how many people would like to hear
Presto, the song, live.  "What are the chances of that happening?" I ask
myself.

	Not good, I conclude.  See, I know the set lists from about GUP pretty
well, and I know Presto, RTB, and CP for sure.  My studies show that if they
don't play a song on that album's supporting tour, they never play it.

	Then again, it's early in the morning and I'm a bit delirious.  If
anyone has conflicting evidence (set lists) then I'm perfectly willing to admit
I'm wrong, but I just can't think of anything they didn't do for the original
tour that they ended up doing later.  It's a shame - there are a lot of good
songs floating around that they haven't given the satisfaction of playing live.

	Until next time...

Subject: more on the Trees

To continue the discussion on the meaning of The Trees, I will quote reviewer
Rick Clark, in
the All Music (something like that) CD Guide:

" The Trees, metaphorically adressing the Quebec secessionist movement became a
controversial rock-radio hit. "

Not that this is a definitive answer, of course. The guide has a little write up
on the band, and reviews of almost all the CDs. If anyone is interested in 
hearing what the guide has to say, just e-mail me. or if the rush-mgr doesn't 
mind, I can transcribe them all into one post.

In light of your observations of 'Art' and "individual
interpretation," I would like to know what in the hell
your interpretation of this line is.  And how do you
suppose this line fits into the realm of 'Roll the Bones'?
You are a scary individual - puting this line between

Subject: Limelight solo--the best??

I am suprised at how many people really like the Limelight solo!!
It is a great solo, but one of the easiest to play (which
doesn't mean it can't sound great) and I can think of some solos
that are just so incredible--Analog Kid, Cut to the Chase,
2112, Hemispheres, The Body Electric, and Before and After! I guess
it's not so much what is played, but rather how its played--the
23rd fret sustained note is a very nice touch!!! Well just adding
a few thoughts!!

Neil,
       What is the specific type and dimensions of your ride cymbal?
Not the brand name. Say hello to Selina, Alex, and Geddy.
Burning for Buddy was great, but I thought "Cottontail" was a little too
 precise for a Buddy Rich tune.  It doesn't sound like you're having much
fun.  Nice solo, though.  Is Rush ever coming back to La.?  Seems like it's
been a few years.  We're waiting.

Hi,
I thought this might help the people asking about the BMG numbers.  BMG
recently members a rather comprehensive catalog of what looks like all their
CD's.  I definetly got the impression that it was everything they had for
each artist.  The Rush section contained these numbers (which aren't in
the FAQ as of a few months ago):
   FBN     103184
   PoW     103185

ATWS, CoS and R  were not in the BMG list, everything else (except Archives,
never on CD?) was, I think

	(*) "The Trees" is definately about some trees.  That is, in my opinion.

		In The Mood (Tony Benett)
		Roll The Bones (the Rolling Stones, who shoud be Rolling Bones)
		Something for Nothing (Pearl Jam, since the song title
		could also describe their success)
		Time Stand Still (The Dead Kennedys)
		Stick It Out (Peter, Paul, and Mary)
		Animate (The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra)
		and...
		Working Man (as a spoken word piece by Allen Ginsberg)

    Someone recently asked about the definition of "progressive
rock."   Well, for what it's worth, I asked the same question of a
friend of mine, recently.  According to this rather knowledgable (sp?)
source, anything considered progressive rock basically has "roots" in
some other genre of music.  For example, both The Moody Blues and Yes
have stong classical influences ("The Symphonic Music of Yes" or "A
Night At Red Rocks With The Moody Blues" are good examples).  These
are rather obvious.  Not being a great musical mind, I won't even try
to pin down what characterizes Rush as progressive (I'm sure the
complex chord arrangements have something to do with it).

Fiat has just introduced their new roadster: The Barchetta!

They didn't give color choices, but I'd imagine Red must be an option.
(Although the one in Car & Driver was orange...Close.) It looks kinda
like a Miata.  They said that only 15,000 will be made per year, and
that US sales would be impossible.  So for you European NMSers:

You DEFINITELY know you're a Rush fan if you own a red Fiat Barchetta!

Subject: Rush Lit. Allusions... last call
Date: Thu, 13 Apr 95 13:19:19 EDT

As promised I have continued to compile a list of the allusions from Rush
lyrics to works of literature (and other mediums, for that matter) and I
believe my list is nearing completion. Please take a look at this list to
see if there are any additions/corrections etc. needed before I send it off
to the FAQ board. The list is as follows:

*2112 (from 2112) closely parallels in theme and narrative the novel Anthem
	by Ayn Rand.
*Hemispheres (from Hemispheres) mentions Gods and Goddesses of Greek Mythos.
*Name of spacecraft in Hemispheres (from Hemispheres) is Rocinante- this is
	also the name of the horse of Zeus (Greek Mythos), the horse of Don
	Quixote (novel Don Quixote by Cervantes), and the motor home in
	Travels with Charley (novel by Steinbeck).
*Bravado (from Roll The Bones) inspired by a line in Tidewater Tales (novel
	by John Barth).
*The line "wilderness of mirrors" in Double Agent (from Counterparts) is a
	line lifted from T.S. Eliot poem "Gerontion".
*Xanadu (from Farewell To Kings) is based on the poem "Khubla Khan" by
	Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
*Tom Sawyer (from Moving Pictures) is the title of a novel by Mark Twain.
*Jacob's Ladder (from Permanent Waves) alludes to the Biblical story of
	Jacob and the heavenly ladder.
*Rivendell (from Caress of Steel) is the name of a safe haven in Tolkien
	fantasy series (Lord of the Rings by Tolkien).
*All The World's A Stage (both the live album title and a line in the song
	Limelight {Moving Pictures}) is a line from William Shakespeare's play
	As You Like It.
*Big Money (from Power Windows) is the title of a novel by John Dos Passos.
*Grand Designs (from Power Windows) is also the title of a novel by John Dos
	Passos.
*Losing It (from Signals) alludes to author Ernest Hemingway and two of his
	novels (For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Sun Also Rises).
*The image of a "Cold Fire" (Counterparts) is an image that is explored in
	the Tom Robbins novel The Jitterbug Formula.
*The motif of women archetypes in Animate (Counterparts) is a motif explored
	in the Tom Robbins novel Skinny Legs and All and is also based on
	the writings of Carl Jung. (Incidentally, Neil Peart is quoted
	praising the novel Skinny Legs and All in its opening page
	"testimonials".)
*Between Sun and Moon (Counterparts) was inspired by a poem by Pye Dubois.
*Red Barchetta (Moving Pictures) parallels the short story "A Nice Morning
	Drive" by Richard Foster. [Note: I could not confirm nor deny this
	information.]
   
   [ Not quite a parallel, more like a "based on" -- the original story is
     available on syrinx in the ftp/gopher/web site.          : rush-mgr ]

*The line "nothing to fear but fear itself" from The Weapon (Signals) is
	from an inaugural address by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
*The line "thy...will be done" in The Weapon (Signals) refers to The Lord's
	Prayer from The New Testament.
*Necromancer (Caress of Steel) alludes to The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien.
*Panacea (Caress of Steel) refers to a mythological cure all (Greek Mythos).
*Lotus Land from Freewill (Permanent Waves) alludes to a land described in
	Homer's epic poem "The Odyssey."
*Absalom from Distant Early Warning (Grace Under Pressure) is a name from
	the Old Testament story of King David. Absalom Absalom is also the
	title of a novel by William Faulkner.
*Ta'i Shan (Hold Your Fire) is the name of a mountain in China. The song
	alludes to the legend connected with that mountain from Chinese
	Mythos.
*Cinderella Man is based on the movie Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.
*Twilight Zone (2112) is based on the old television show of the same name and
	specifically refers to two episodes.

Ok sharp-eyed Rush fans- what have I missed and what do I need to correct.
In all but a few cases I was able to personally confirm the sources by
looking up the sources etc. Please respond sooner rather than later so that
I can send this list to the FAQ section and begin my next project:
historical/cultural allusions in Rush lyrics.

    [ Don't forget the line in Alien Shore -- "We hold these truths to be
      self-evident", but then again you might call it historical as well!

Hello All!

A local CD store has one copy of _Archives_ on cassette for something like
$15 or $16.  I'll pick it up for anyone who wants it.  This will be a
one-time, first-e-mail/ first-serve offer.  I'll ask if the store can get
more, but I suspect that no one is printing _Archives_ anymore and supplies
are therefore limited.

BTW, I'm sure this has already been said, but let me restate that _Archives_
has not (and, sadly, probably never will be) been released on CD.  It's only
available on LP, cassette, and 8-track.  Now should anyone find it on

Hey everyone!

This is my first entry so I will keep it short.  Rush has been my favorite
band for about 8 years now.  I grew up listening to them thanks to my two
older brothers who were both Rush fans.  I have only been to one concert
though.  That was the counterparts show in Landover, Maryland.  It was
amazing.  Geddy was sick that night and they canceled their next two
shows, but they still put on a great show.  My seats were on the floor so
I had a fairly good view.  The best part was the fire on "Double Agent".
I could feel the heat.

My favorite Rush song ever is "Natural Science".  That song is like many
different songs in one.

Alex's best guitar solos?  Well there are so many that it is hard to
narrow it down to just a few.  I will go with

"Freewill", "Limelight", "By-tor and the Snow Dog" live and "Cygnus X-1"

And finally I want to say What Up?! to my boy Skever out in Hagerstown,
Marlyand.  He of the giant Rush wall clock.

Subject: Rush Tribute Album Wish List

Hi, y'all.  Just thought I'd start another endless thread (you're welcome) .

I think it's pretty likely that there will be a Rush tribute album one of
these years; maybe not tomorrow, but sooner or later.  Here's my wish list.
 The criteria were:  (1) Bands/artists that have identified themselves as
Rush fans in the past; (2) Bands that members of Rush have said they like;
 (3) Bands that I think would sound cool (heh heh huh huh) playing Rush
songs; and (4) Bands you wouldn't neccesarily expect.  Limit of 12
bands/songs.

Steve Morse Band:  La Villa Strangiato
Billy Joel:  Subdivisions
Queensryche:  Overture/Temples of Syrinx
Live:  Presto
Smashing Pumpkins:  Time Stand Still
Metallica:  Anthem
L.L. Cool J.:  Roll The Bones
Eric Johnson:  YYZ
Living Colour (yes, I know they broke up):  The Enemy Within
Lyle Lovett:  Closer To The Heart
Gin Blossoms:  Middletown Dreams
Sammy Hagar:  Working Man

And just for fun . . .
Dash Rip Rock with Robert Plant:  In The Mood

Why are they here? (because they're--OW!  OK, OK, overused joke):

Steve Morse:  He is like unto a god.  And he's a Rush fan.  Buy his new CD.
Billy Joel:  A Rush fan, and I'd love to hear his vocals and keys on this
one.
Queensryche:  Major Rush fans, and can you imagine Tate's voice on "Temples"?
Live:  Neil likes them, and they're a hell of a good band.
Smashing Pumpkins:  A critical darling, and the singer likes Rush.
Metallica:  They like Rush, Rush likes them, they rock, hey, what's not to
love?
LL Cool J:  The only rapper who cares about *music*.  A little weird, but it
could be, ah, cool.
Eric Johnson:  See Steve Morse.
Living Colour:  See Metallica.
Lyle Lovett:  Hey, I think he's great.  Sue me.
Gin Blossoms:  They were on the radio when I wrote this.
Sammy Hagar:  Why not?  He'd wail on the whole first album.

Now, I have to say looking back that I'm not a big fan of at least two of the
above (I won't say which), but I still think they'd do cool versions of Rush
tunes.  Comments?  Suggestions?  Flames? (DUCK!!!)
