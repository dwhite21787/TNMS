                           Frequently Asked Questions List
                                 Part 1 of 2

   This file contains questions that seem to crop up frequently in the Rush
Fans Digest.  It will be posted on or around the first of each month, or
whenever too many of these questions start to pop up in the Digest.  If
you received a copy of this file in email, other than as a part of a
Digest, it is probably because you asked one of these questions.

   This file has been expanded into 2 files because some mailers have
problems with files that are longer than 60K.  Part 1 contains general
questions about the band.  Part 2 contains questions inspired by
specific albums and songs.

   If you want a copy of the current version of this file, email me and
I'll send you the most recent version.

(Polyslo/Blackbird/Zeus users: look in ~ddelany/Info/faql.1
and ~ddelany/Info/faql.2 - they are both world readable, although
the version on Zeus is more likely to be current.)

   If you have any suggestions for additions to the list or corrections,
please send them to me at ddelany@eros.calpoly.edu and I'll add them in.
I'd appreciate it if people who submit questions submit anything they know
about possible answers, since I don't have all of the answers myself!

THE FAQL IS A FILE OF FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT RUSH AND THEIR
ANSWERS.  IT IS NOT AN "OBSCURE RUSH TRIVIA" FILE.
Please consider this before sending me a suggestion for an addition.

DISCLAIMER: The information in this file is accurate to the best of my
knowledge, but I'm not perfect.  If you have an answer to one of these
questions that doesn't match the one given here that you can verify, let me
know, and I'll put it in.  But if you make a bet based on this
information and you lose, don't blame me.

Here's the question I get asked most often, so I'll put it right here
at the start:

One of my friends gave me this file.  How can I subscribe to The National
Midnight Star?

  Send email to rush-request@syrinx.umd.edu asking to have your name added
  to the list.  Don't send email to me - I can't add you!

   Additionally, several collections are available: {sorry - no catalog 
                                        numbers, as I don't have these.}

   Archives (includes _Rush_,_Fly By Night_, and _Caress Of Steel_)
   _RUSH_ Through Time
   _Everything Your Listeners Ever Wanted To Hear By Rush But You Were 
   Afraid To Play_ - this collection was targeted at radio stations.
   It was never officially released, and is extremely rare. It's a
   selection taken from FBN, CoS and 2112.

   _Rush - Profiled!_ - This CD was released to radio stations and
                        is rather rare.  It contains things like band
                        members saying "Hi, this is * of Rush, and
                        you're listening to radio magic."  (Paraphrased
                        from memory.)  It also contains quite a few tracks
                        of band members answering questions.  The questions
                        are printed in the liner notes, so a DJ can ask a
                        question and play the CD of the appropriate
                        person answering that question.  The questions
                        are mostly about _Presto_, since this CD was
                        released shortly after _Presto_.

  * The Anthem release of ESL, available in Canada is [ADD], but
    the US CD is [AAD].

   In the January 1986 issue of _Modern Drummer_ magazine, while discussing
    his appearance on the Jeff Berlin album, Neil says that he "...did a
    similar thing with a musician named Ken Ramm in Toronto.  That record
    was released in Canada."

   VIDEO:

   "1991 Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship Concert"  (Neil on a few songs)
   DCI Music Video

What was the first single released by the band?

   The A side was a cover of a Buddy Holly song called "Not Fade Away."
   The B side was a Lee/Rutsey song called "You Can't Fight It."
   These songs are not on any Rush albums.

I just bought the CD of &lt;Exit...Stage Left | All The World's A Stage&gt; and
it's missing a track!  Is a complete version of this CD available?

   No.  But if you absolutely have to have everything on CD, the 2 missing
   tracks are on _Chronicles_.

Has &lt;song&gt; ever been performed live?

   The 1st anniversary issue of TNMS contains song lists for each tour
   Rush has done up to _Presto_.  This is issue 99, available for ftp at
   syrinx.umd.edu.

What is Battlescar/Max Webster, who plays on it, what is the label/catalogue 
number for the Universal Juveniles CD?  Where can I write to get it?

   Max Webster is a Canadian band that used to open for Rush.  Battlescar
   is a song from their _Universal Juveniles_ CD that was done as a duet
   of the 2 bands.

   People have sent me the names of sheet music books about Rush, but
   I'm not going to include those because there are too many of them
   and this file is getting far too large.  Besides, they really aren't
   about the band.

I heard something about a Rush comic book.  What comic book was it?

   That was Defenders #45. It was dedicated to Geddy, Alex, and Neil of
   Rush on the first page. The story has an anti-collectivist theme to it.
   Since it was printed Mar 77 it makes sense that it would draw from
   2112 (however vaguely).

   The villian (Red Rajah) says, at one point, "Truth is false and logic
   lost, seek the Rajah at all cost".

Somebody posted &lt;item&gt; in the Digest.  I missed it - could somebody
please send me a copy?  Does anybody have the lyrics to &lt;song&gt;?

   An archive server is running at server@ingr.com.

   The address of this archive file server is:
   
      UUCP'ish:  ...!uunet!ingr!server
      ARPA'ish:  server@ingr.com
   
   This archive file server currently supports the following commands:
   
      GET     - request a specific file listed in the index
      SEND    - (same as GET)
      HELP    - request the help file (this file)
      INDEX   - request list of requestable files
      MESSAGE - this is a message to server keeper (do not process)
      NOTE    - (same as MESSAGE)
   
   Commands and file names are not case sensitive.  The body of the
   email is _ignored_ unless the command is MESSAGE (or NOTE), then
   it is passed on to the keeper of the server, currently me.
   
   To make something available on the archive server, send it with
   the MESSAGE command so the server keeper can respond appropriately.
   
   The server is limited to sending one megabyte of text a day.  If
   your request is processed after this limit is exceeded, you will
   be notified that your request failed.  You will also be notified
   if your request contains an invalid command, unknown file name,
   or other problem.
   
   Use the MESSAGE command for questions.  Do not contact anyone at site
   INGR.  This might cause problems and will put the existence of the
   server at risk.


   Additionally, an FTP site has been established.  There are several
   read-only directories containing informational files, plus a directory
   for uploading files into.

    The address to ftp to is:

    syrinx.umd.edu

       or

    128.8.2.114

   for those of you who don't have name resolution.  Once here, you will be
   prompted for a name (userid) and password.  Use "anonymous" for the userid
   and your userid for the password.

    Once you're logged in, 'cd' into the "rush" subdirectory.  Once there,
   you can list the files in the directory.  There is actually only one file
   (README) currently, the others being subdirectories.

    The directories available now are:

    "digest" - Contains back issues of the current incarnation of the
                digest from issue # 1 to the current issue;

    "lyrics" - Contains the lyrics for all the albums up through _Roll The
               Bones_.

    "names"  - Contains a recent (thought not always the latest-and-greatest)
               version of the subscription list; and

    "images" - Contains GIF and Rast format pictures of album covers and
               photos of the band members.

    "sounds" - A directory containing sound files in NeXT .snd or Sun .au
               format.

    "MacSounds" - A directory containing Macintosh-format sounds.

    "c64-sounds" - A directory containing Commodore-64-format sounds.

    "tab" - A directory containing guitar and bass tabs for various songs.

    "incoming" - A directory that's world-writable for uploading files to
                 Syrinx to be moved (by the digest manager) to one of the
                 other directories.  (If you upload something, PLEASE send
                 mail to the Syrinx administrative address to let the list
                 manager know!)

    "special" - Contains the longer items - interviews, articles, tour 
                lists, etc.  Any item warranting it's own file but doesn't
                fall into any of the other categories.

   Any files in the subdirectories with a suffix of ".Z" are compressed; 
   you'll have to uncompress them on your end.  There is a Unix Shell Archive
   (shar) format file in the main directory named "compress.shar" which
   contains the source for the compress/uncompress commands.

   If you wish to submit something for a special edition posting, send it to
   the 'rush-request' address; if it's of general interest, it'll be a 
   special edition, and then placed in the "special" dir.  The same effect
   is created by uploading something to the "incoming" directory and sending
   mail to the 'rush-request' address and informing the rush-mgr it's there.

   Remember, if you don't have ftp capabilities at your site, there is still
   the mail server at "server@ingr.com".

What issue of the Digest is &lt;item&gt; in?

   This list isn't complete, and it probably contains errors.  Let me
   know, so I can fix them!

What is the marital status of the band members?

   In _Visions_, there is a group picture of all 3 band members and
   their wives.

I've heard &lt;rumor&gt; about &lt;band member&gt;.  Does anybody know anything about
the truth of it?

   These rumors have been popping up for quite some time now.  Here
   are some of the ones that have been shown to be wrong over the
   years by the activities of the band:

    - Alex is dying of cancer
    - Neil is dying of cancer
    - Geddy is dying of cancer
    - Geddy has throat cancer; he's not dying, but can never sing again
    - Geddy is going blind from stage lights.
    - Neil is gay.

   {Send me more!  - Dan}

What are the birthdays of the band members?

   Geddy Lee          July 29,1953 {according to _Visions_}
   Neil Peart         September 12, 1952
   Alex Lifeson       August 27, 1953

What are the real names of the band members?

   Geddy Lee          Gary Lee Weinrib
                     { The book "Heart of Gold", a history of Canadian rock,
                       provides this as Geddy Lee's real name.
                       In 1971, Gary Lee Weinrib, Alex Zivojinovich, and
                       John Rutsey all joined CAPAC, the Canadian
                       writers/publishers/composers guild. }
   Neil Peart         Neil Peart
   Alex Lifeson       Alex Zivojinovic

How is "Peart" pronounced?

   It rhymes with "near", according to Neil on the "Rush - Profiled!" CD,
   so I assume that's the correct pronunciation.  That also agrees with
   the way Geddy pronounced "Peart" when introducing Neil's solo during
   RTB shows.

I heard that Neil Peart has a PhD in &lt;field of study&gt;.  Is this true?

   In _Visions_, Neil is quoted (on page 65) as saying that he is
   a high school dropout.  I don't see how he would have had time to
   go to school and get a degree, what with being in Rush and all.

Does anybody have an address I can use to write to the band?

   This address was posted to the Digest, but I can't vouch for the
   correctness of it.

                RUSH
                41 Britan St. (#200)
                Toronto, ON
                M5C 1R7, CANADA

   The Backstage Club will probably forward mail as well.

   _Modern Drummer_ magazine will forward mail to Neil. (or other drummers,
   for that matter!)

Who says &lt;phrase&gt; in &lt;song&gt;?

    Geddy says "One...Two...Buckle my shoe" in "In The End" on ATWAS.
    Neil does the narrative during "The Necromancer".
    I've never seen anything definitive saying who whispers in
      "The Twilight Zone."
    Neil does the "Attention all planets of the Solar Federation - We have
      assumed control" bit at the end of "2112".
    The deep voice at the beginning of "Cygnus X-1" is none other than
      Terry Brown.
    Neil says "Subdivisions" in the song of the same name,
      even though Alex is shown in the video and does it live.
    Alex says "That's nice" at the end of "Chain Lightning".
    We don't know who says "I will be the judge" and "Give the jury
      direction."  I did receive the following email on April 11, 1991
      on just this very subject:

    { Begin quoted text }
   &gt;Good day. I am a Rush fan who has access to an Amiga and a good quality
   &gt;digitizer.  I noticed that in the "Who says what" section of the FAQL you
   &gt;wrote that you don't know who says "I will be the judge" and "Give the
   &gt;jury direction."
   &gt; 
   &gt;Out of curiousity, I digitized that section of Show Don't Tell, and then
   &gt;played it back at the 'proper' speed. Although the main vocal track
   &gt;(Geddy's voice) was obviously too high, I could now hear the background
   &gt;vocals that were intentionally slowed.
   &gt; 
   &gt;The task was fairly difficult because of two reasons:
   &gt;1. The background vocals are very weakly mixed in comparison to the main
   &gt;   vocals, which makes it hard to distinguish the voice.
   &gt;2. The phrases are actually whispered, sampled, and then slowed down by
   &gt;   some factor.
   &gt; 
   &gt;All above statements coming to a conclusion with my submission to the
   &gt;FAQL issue: Neil whispers "I will be the judge" and "Give the jury
   &gt;direction" during Show Don't Tell.

   { end quoted text }

   According to Neil on the Dec 2 1991 Rockline, Geddy does the RTB
   "chat" section.

What is a Lerxt?

   A Lerxt is an Alex Lifeson.

Do the other band members have nicknames?

   Ged and Neil also have nicknames, Dirk and Pratt. Hence "Lerxtwood Mall",
   "Old Dirk Road" and "Pratt & Co." on the map on the back cover of Signals.
      -- from ano@uk.ac.rdg.cs.csres

Where did the name "Rush" come from?

   Paraphrased Background: In August of 1968 the band's formal lineup
   was Alex on guitar, John Rutsey on drums, and Jeff Jones on bass and
   vocals. They got a job to play at the "Coff-In", a coffee house
   in the basement of an Anglican Church [Great name, eh?] for $25/night.
   
   "The band was excited, but they had a big problem. While
   they had been dreaming of playing, they had neglected to come up with
   a name for their group. So a few days before the gig they sat around in
   John's basement trying to come up with an appropriate monicker. They
   weren't having much luck when John's older brother Bill piped up,
   'Why don't you call the band Rush' and Rush it was."
                           -- from _Visions_

Whatever happened to John Rutsey?

   "John's still around.  I see John quite often.  He gave up playing
   shortly after he left the band and went into bodybuilding.  He
   competed on an amateur level for a while, doing that for a few years,
   and has sort of been in and out of that, but he still works out, and I
   work out with him a few times a week at a local gym - at a Gold's,
   here in Toronto." -- Alex Lifeson, in the 2/6/89 Rockline interview
