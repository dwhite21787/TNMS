Subject: This grammar thing...

After replying a little too hastily to the original question about the
grammar in "Lock And Key," and thus watching the subsequent
responses...and THEN watching the posts arrive about
"why-don't-you-people-just-listen-to-the-music....," I felt I needed to
respond.

Why is grammar important?  Simply stated (or as simply as I can state it):
Any form of expression, be it written, spoken, drawn, painted, or
otherwise delineated in some visible or audible form, is a reflection of
the intelligence of the author/writer/painter, etc.  I don't think it
would be a logical fallacy for me to conclude that poor grammar on
anyone's part reflects a poor display of learning experience, and I will
even take that as far as to conclude that it occasionally reflects poor
intelligence.  What it comes down to is that *no one*, not even the great
God himself Neil (as he is so disrespectfully referred to in the digest
and on the newsgroup), has perfect grammar...no one.  I think Neil has
addressed the idea of perfection and living up to ultra-high standards in
several places..."War Paint" immediately springs to mind.

A colleague of mine recently told me, "Bad grammar is like bad table
manners--no matter how hard one tries to conceal it, people still have a
tendency to notice."  Cliche as that sounds, it's true, especially when
one lives, works, and produces in a communication-based environment (such
as my English dept).  I don't think it's too accusatory on my part to
state that it's highly inconsistent to attack those who may be interested
in the formalities and structures of formal discourse while spending *far
too much time* nitpicking every single drum fill, guitar lick, and meaning
behind every written word.  Same argument:  shut up and listen.

This is not meant to be a flame, only an explanation on my part and on the
parts of those who happen to care about the forms in which artistic
communication are structured.  It's not that we have so much time on our
hands that we find ourselves grieving over every little
inconsistency...but have you ever tried to grade a stack of college
English papers, about 40 on a good weekend, and have to deal with tedious,
careless, avoidable grammar mistakes?  If so, then you know exactly what I
deal with; if not, try it and see how much you get to listen to your
favorite music...it's like swimming through molasses.

And like I had said in an earlier post, Neil loses absolutely nothing by being
incorrect...I think his meanings transcend the boundaries and parameters of
grammar.  IMArrogantOpinion, he does fairly well for a high school
dropout...(sarcasm intended)...and extremely well for a self-made
Renaissance man (which I think I can quote him on, and which I think he
resembles more than any form of hero-worship).

Thanks for reading my 0.02...

        "reds" is not an "American stereotype". In fact, the Soviets are=

"rockets red glare" does not have to be a blatant attack on the U.S. but=

 something gloriously, albeit with false pretenses or hypocrisy or whatever=

 the point home, considering Americans are something just about everyone=

 fans).  thus, by using that phrase metaphorically, just about everyone can=
 understand clearly the point Peart is trying to make and can relate it to=
 their OWN situation/government or whatever you think it's screaming at.
        Furthermore, when you're going to launch such a strong polemic, you=
 musn't forget that it is YOUR idea, and not a fact.  In your dealings with=
 Neil, you constantly say, "Neil realized" this or "Neil thought" this.  I'm=

Subject: A Few Things From NMS 1029

	Yeesh I am behind on my NMS so I apologize if I might of
responded to 1017 stuff.

	For what is better phase of Rush I'd say (of the 3 periods I
classify them in) the 1974 - 1982 is the best. WHy? Because some of their
most powerful albums and classics like "Signals", "2112", and "Moving
Pictures".

	I think their worst (not to say it sucked it just didnt have the
power of the oldies) was the 1983 - 1990 phase. Now the Roll The Bones
and Counterparts phase begins. Rush seems to be using more of a.. I dunno
an alternative sound? I hate the word but their sound has turned to a
slightly more 90's bandish sound and something that could fit right in on
MTV's crappy Alternative Nation.

	For a dream band? Hmmmm I'd have to make a 4

1. Rock Band With Maximum of 2 Band Members

	Geddy Lee - Vocals, Keyboards (Rush)
	Neil Peart - Drums (Rush)
	Les Claypool - Bass (Primus)
	Lary Lollande - Lead Guitar (Primus)
	Jerry Cantrell - Rythm Guitar (Alice in Chains)

2. Industrial Band Max. 2 Members

	Al Jourgenson - Vocals, Guitars (Ministry)
	Paul Barker - Bass (Ministry)
	Trent Reznor - Vocals, Guitars (nine inch nails)
	Flood - Keyboards (various)
	Chris Connely - Keyboards (Revolting Cocks)

3. Heavy Metal Band Max. 2 Members

	Oderus Urungus - Vocals (GWAR)
	Jason Newstead - Bass (Metallica)
	Angus Young - Lead Guitar (AC/DC)
	Dr. Giggles - Keyboard (Prong)
	Dave Mustaine - Rythm Guitar (Megadeth)
	Lars Ulrich - Drums (Metallica)

4. Zany Combination Of Previous 3 Band

	Geddy Lee - Vocals (Rush)
	Les Claypool - Bass (Primus)
	Angus Young - Lead Guitar (AC/DC)
	Al Jourgenson - Guitars (Ministry)
	Jerry Cantrell - Ryhtm Guitar (Alice in Chains)
	Dr. Giggles - Keyboards (Prong)
	Lars Ulrich - Drums (Metallica)

	I cant think of the 1 person from a band bands. These may seem
silly and i know the last would never get together except in my dreams.
But oh well.

         -Great line Mr. Hannaman!

Thinking of this privacy topic, I can't help but be a little frustrated
sometimes by the lack of information on Rush, but the other side of me
doesn't want to see this band on Letterman one night and Leno the next.
Selling yourself that way can be really cheap.  Besides, I have thought
many times what I would say to any of the guys in Rush if I met them, but
nothing I can think of sounds unique or sometimes even intellegent.

I don't want to sound like Butt-head, "You guys are cool, huh...huh."
I appreciate what they do, and I let them live their lives.  Fair trade.

Subject:      What's his name?

Neil Peart-
Rhymes with peer, as in "peer pressure."

Kind of like good, better, best, you have pea, peer, Peart.
Thus, loosly translated, "Peart" means - "He who is without equal."

Or, since we are so concerned with English around here,
"He who is most equal"

I prefer the first definition since I don't want to associate Neil with
Napoleon the Pig.

(Definitions are from the OttoPilat dictionary of not-so-funny humor.)

My opinion is this:

	"It was for me not you I came to write this song"  --N.P.

	This means Neil doesn't care what you opinions are about about
how bad presto sucks or what the best rush ablum is.  He doesn't and
neither do the rest of us so spare us the "My opinion" posts!

I really don't know if I could cope with loosing any of my CD/tape/LP
collection!! Rush (and the Floyd) are the two groups I _keep_on_ going
back to all the time! They can't be beaten.

btw, I'm also very pleased with my new subscription to TNMS! :) But I was
a little disapointed to find nobody else from the .uk domain in TNMS 1030!! :(

Subject: Red Sector A

Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation...

	This is in response to the recent post about "Red Sector A", and, in
fact, all of Grace Under Pressure having an anti-American theme.  I could not
disagree more strongly.

	First of all, the comparisons between "Red Sector A" and Nazi
concentration camps are obvious.  However, a fact that is often (and
delibrately) overlooked by the liberal media is that the Communists had
extermination camps which equalled, if not, surpassed the Nazis in
atrocities.  I think "RED Sector A" is an obvious reference to the very-real
Red Menace of the 1980's.  And, as usual, it takes an especially astute mind
like Neil's to point out what others have overlooked.

	Long before the Nazis came to power in Germany, the Communists were
slaughtering humans by the millions.  If you or your ancestors were not
"proletarians", you were murdered.  That is, without a doubt, the moral
equivalent of genocide.  All told, Joseph Stalin ALONE exterminated FORTY
MILLION people!  The Russian government just admitted to uncovering mass
graves containing up to 200,000 corpses!  And, don't forget that these
extermination camps existed long, long after the Nazis were removed from
power.

	My point in all this is that in the 1980's the Communists were a very
real threat.  Liberals always turned a sympathetic ear towards Communism, and
I don't think a man like Neil would be so ignorant as to do so.  This dark,
brooding album, one of Rush's best, manages to convey the fear and agony we
all felt during the Cold War.

	But the point is that the Cold War is over.  We won.  We can all
sleep better now because, despite the frantic ravings of the Communist
sympathizers in this country (ie, liberals), Ronald Reagan had the courage
and fortitude to face down such bloodthirsty monsters as Andropov, Chernenko,
and Gorbachev.

	This should be obvious to all but the most biased, fanatical
left-wingers.  I certainly would not put Neil in that category.  Political
correctness DID exist back in the '80's, it just wasn't referred to as such.
In the 1980's, it was politically correct to criticize Reagan, and to be
sympathetic to Communism.  Neil is not now, nor was he then, a mindless
automaton, waiting to be programmed by the Left.

Subject: Drumming/Peart question

Perhaps some one who knows more about drumming than I do can comment
on the following:

To me, track 18 on the Burning for Buddy disc, *Pick up the Pieces*
sounds an amazing amount like Leave that Thing Alone.  I hear sim-
ilarities both in the over all structure of the piece and in the
percussion line.  Does anyone else hear this too?

When you see *music by Lee & Lifeson* just what do they mean by that?
Clearly Geddy and Alex don't just hand Neil sheet music and tell him
to learn his part...isn't percussion considered music?

Just random thoughts on a rainy day...

Subject: 'Bout time for another video collection!

From: Keefe R. Coble <mac4krc@cabell.vcu.edu>

Hello to the greatest fans in the world!

     I just thought I would bring up the point that the boys need to
come out with another video collection sometime in the near future.
Do you all agree?  I mean,  the last time I saw a video from Presto,
on that ever so wonderful MTV, was when astronauts landed on the
moon, or something.  It's pretty sickening, if you ask me.  The only
time you can enjoy a good Rush video, is when they gather them all
up, and throw them all on VHS.  I have to go to my neighborhood J.C.
Penny store just to see the video for Nobody's Hero on one of their
monitors, because that seems to be the only place that plays it.  It
probably will take one more album to come out, before another video
collection is released, but I hope not much longer after that.  Those
Black & White videos from Presto really kicked ass, from what I
remember, and I really miss seeing them.  Ok, I've complained long
enough, so I'll stop, so other people will have some room to write.
Rock on!

Subject: reissues

It may just be me, but I feel that in the spirit of many prog-rock reissues
going on right now (Yes, Genesis, King Crimson five years ago), Rush should
remaster and rerelease the catalog. I know on some of the more recent CD's
it would be pointless, but here's my idea. Replace the catalog from '74 to
'85. And not just the music, but the entire packaging to include the
original artwork and lyrics. To give an example, take CoS. I have the CD
here at school and the original LP back home. The sound on the CD is
already excellent, but the packaging? The insert in one piece, no foldout!
All it has is a reproduction of the cover and and a track listing on the
inside. Meanwhile, the LP has great artwork (back cover, too!), concert
photos of the band, and all of the lyrics in Olde English type.
Reissuing the catalog with all the original artwork could also make new
Rush fans be able to better understand the music: If you just got 2112,
wouldn't it make more sense with the lyrics AND the narrative pieces
between them? Plus, there are great photos missing from the CD inserts that
do have lyrics. Moving Pictures w/ out a shot of Neil?!? That would have to
be the first. Also, good pictures on the LP of PeW that aren't in the CD
insert, and Alex's picture in the Hemispheres insert..... well, he kind of
looks like a mannequin, doesn't he?
Anyway, I'll leave this topic for all of you to discuss. Any other suggestions?

Subject: ATWAS Omission

In response to Jeff Waite's question about the omission of "What You're
Doing" off of ATWAS in TNMS #1030:

The omission is explained in the liner notes:

" 'What You're Doing' has been omitted in order to release 'All The World's
A Stage' as a single compact disc"

I guess it was a space saving thing - the CD is already 73:40 minutes.  On
the cassette version of ATWAS (which I don't own, but have seen in a record
store), "What You're Doing" is the last track.  As far as the omission of "A
Passage to Bangkok" goes, I don't know.  The track is on the cassette
version of ESL, which I own.  Incidentally, my uncle owns the vinyl ESL,
which I have not listened to.  Silly me.

Also, to address the topic of Album Numero Uno from the Greatest Rock Trio
Ever, the first time I heard "Finding My Way", I immediately thought
Zeppelin.  After listening to the album some more, I realized that it really
wasn't as spacy as Zep; that it had a more down-to-earth quality to it.  I
haven't listened to Rush#1 in a while.  Maybe I should give it a spin
tonight, for old time's sake...

This posting marks my first posting to TNMS.  I was thrilled to come across
it (actually, a friend of mine, the same friend who got me into Rush in the
first place, gave the address to me).  I am so glad that there are
multitudinous Rush fans I can get in touch with.  I'm at Cornell, and so far
I have only met ONE PERSON who confessed to being a fan.  Wow.  If any other
Rush fans at Cornell read this, or if anyone else out there has an opinion
on Rush#1, feel free to e-mail me at rgk2@cornell.edu.  Thanx, and may
you're heart and mind be united in a single, perfect, sphere.

Subject:      dream lineup

Greetings,

I simply couldn't pass up the oppurtunity to throw out my two cents worth in
response to greg's post about dream lineups.  I'll take the challenge and keep
my lineup to one member from a single group.  Here goes:

Drums:  Neil Peart
Guitar:  David Gilmour
Bass:  Les Claypool (styles might clash, but he's best alternative to Geddy)
Vocals:  David Gilmour (sings great too!)
Lyrics/concepts:  Hands down, Roger Waters (He's solo now ya know)
Cover design:  Hipgnosis.

Throw in any amount of members, and imagine what could be if Floyd and Rush
ever got together on an album.  If that were to happen, I could die in peace.
Maybe the universe would align.  The two are, without a doubt, two of the
greatest conceptual bands of all time.  Just some food for thought.

Subject: Musical Taste...

Hi All,
	Several people seem to have taken exception to the fact that
I said in a previous digest that I thought that early 80's Rush albums
contained 'fillers'. Allow me to elaborate...
        I have a collection of some 250 CDs. Of these, maybe 10 percent
are Rush albums. There are probably only one or two artists who I have
more albums by - I consider Rush to be one of my favourite bands, easily in
the top 5.
        BUT, this does not mean that I feel obliged to think that every
song they have ever recorded is staggeringly good. I would probably
classify a third of the Rush songs I have heard as brilliant, a third as
pretty good, and a third as mediocre. I am not knocking their musical
abilities; all of them are superb musicians, and I am hard-pressed to
think of a bad performance on a Rush album. However, some of the songs
just don't do anything for me - either the music or the lyrics (or both) just
fail to move me. In this category I would put most of 'Signals' and about
half of both 'Moving Pictures' and 'Grace Under Pressure'.
        Take 'MP'. 'Tow Sawyer' - brilliant. 'Red Barchetta' - brilliant.
'Limelight' - pretty damn good. 'YYZ' - not bad at all. But the other three?
'The Camera Eye', in my opinion, is about two minutes of good music padded out
to last ten. 'Witch Hunt' - I think it's boring. Can't even remember what
the other song on 'MP' is at the moment. But if it moved me, I think I would
be able to at least remember its title...

   [ You're missing "vital signs" :-)				: rush-mgr ]

        Rush are an excellent band - one of the best. But I am not so
blinkered as to be able to say 'Rush rule - everyone else sucks', 'cos that
just ain't true. My favourite band of all time is probably Marillion - out
of 5 albums they recorded while Fish was the vocalist, I like all but say
2 or 3 tracks. But I admit that even they have recorded what I would consider
to be sub-standard material.
        Cut down on the total hero-worship - be a little critical. It'll
expand your horizons no end.
Hope I haven't offended too many of you this time around - flames to /dev/null
please...
Cheers,
        Simon

Subject: Peart's Politcal Philosophy
Date: Fri, 2 Dec 1994 17:12:31 -0500 (EST)
From: "Charles Joseph Berch" <berchcha@student.msu.edu>

I recall in the past having seen some speculation in the past about whether
Neil Peart was conservative or liberal in his political persuasion.  I would
like to offer my own theory:  Neil's lyrics indicate that he would most closely
be a Libertarian.  I will discuss this by using a few examples from his lyrics.

>From Witchhunt:  "Those who know what's best for us must rise and save us
from ourselves."  Libertarianism advocates a high degree of personal liberty,
and therefore calls for the decriminalization of victimless crimes.  These
include drug use, gambling, and prostitution.  Laws which make these
activities illegal make criminals out of otherwise law abiding citizens.
They are illegal because they either have could potentially harm those who
partake in such activities, or else they are considered "immoral" by the
predominating Judeo-Christian population.  The U.S. government is definitely
trying to "rise and save us from ourselves."  So much for separation of
church and state.

>From Hemispheres:  "We can walk our road together, if our goals are all the
same We can run alone and free, if we persue a different aim, Let the truth
of Love be lighted, let the love of truth shine clear, Sensibility, armed with
sense and LIBERTY, with the Heart and Mind united in a single perfect sphere."
Another Libertarian philosophy is embodied in these lyrics.  Libertarians try
to accept and respect other people's lifestyles and philosophies, so long as
they are conducted in a peaceful manner which does not infringe upon other
people's rights.  These lyrics also call for sensibility, armed with sense and
liberty.  Libertarianism advocates a high amount of personal freedom, but at
the same time realizes that in order to have democracy, you must also have
sensibility and responsibility.

>From Anthem:  "Live for yourself, there's no one more worth living for, ragged
hands and bleeding hearts will only cry out for more."  Libertarians advocate a
high degree of personal responsibility, and believe that welfare systems are
not only unfair to those who work for a living, but also imprisons those who
are recipients of the system, because they basically don't know any other means
of making a living.  This is evident by the several growing amounts of 3rd and
4th generation welfare families.  This is not to say however, that Libertarians
don't believe that they shouldn't help fellow humans, but rather that they
should be able to do it by their own choice instead of being forced to give
money to an inefficient, expensive, and bloated beauracracy such as the U.S.
Government's Dept. of Social Services.

There are several other songs, such as Freewill which are also good examples
of Libertarian Philosophy.  I won't go into further detail because I would like
to keep the content of this post mostly related to Rush.  I am not saying that
Neil is a Libertarian, but rather that the philosophy embodied in many of
his songs mirror Libertarianism.  For those who would like to find out more

Subject: Meaning of the Pass

       >From what I can tell, The Pass is, in essence, a letter to someone who
has committed suicide.  Thus, the line "Christ, what have you done?" is
directed to that person as an expression of the grief, anger, and
disillusionment that results from the suicide of a friend or loved one.
        Neil apparently also broaches the issue of suicide in "Afterimage"
from GUP.  This leads me to believe that Neil knew someone who killed
themself.  "The Pass" and "Afterimage" seem like the work of someone
trying to exorcise his mental demons.  Also, the description of the
emotional aftermath seems to vivid to be a simple pontification on the
issue.  Of course, this is just a hypothisis.  If anyone can confirm,
deny or debate the notion please feel free to e-mail me or respond in the
digest.

Subject: Looking for a good bootleg?

I was browsing through a record show this summer and I ran across a
bootleg CD called "Rush 'N' Roulette '94."  It's a two disk recording of
the Cp tour.  It was priced about forty dollars higher than all of the
other Rush compilations in the stack.  The reason was the sound quality.
This CD had the most amazing sound I have ever heard for a
bootleg.  Check it out if you're interested.  Be careful, however in that
I think there is a similar cd set with the same title from a different tour.

I also found a copy of a radio promo done just prior to fbn.  The reason
it caught my eye is that it includes a couple of Rush tracks I have never
heard before (and I have every album).  One was a
Beatles Cover.  The songs was "Bad Boy" and the other was "Can't you
See."  The date on the tape was 1974, and I believe it was copied from a
CD, but I don't know the title. I noticed someone mentioned these in the
NMS the other day.  What is the "official" name of this bootleg, or is
there such a thing as an official name for a bootleg?  Also, has anyone
ever heard of RUSH ever doing any sort of an unplugged concert (radio
show, small club, etc.)?

P.S.  RUSH is a dynamic group because of its multiple musical styles.
They appeal to different people for different reasons.  To try to pick
out their weakest album is impossible, because everyone has their own
opinion.  Personally I don't believe in a weak RUSH album; the phrase
itself is an oxymoron.  Express your opinion, but respect the opinions of
others!

Greetings!

I have some bootleg questions for anyone out there who could possilbly
give me information that will lead to capture of them!.

First of all, are there any HIGH QUALITY Signals Tour boots out there,
either video or audio?  I know of the video from Montreal and it is
beyond bad quality, so please don't even mention it!  I assume there has
to be others out there from other dates of the tour.

Second, I have some very rare clips of videos (I use the term video
loosly!) and I want to know some more about them.
One is a professionally shot performance of La Villa, starting at the
beginning of the 7/8,
going all the way to the end and then starting the first swirl of the
space sound from the 2112 intro.  It then ends.  This is from the Pinkpop
festival in Holland 1979.  It's absolutely awesome! The only problem is
that its quite regeneratd and the audio signal to noise ratio is pretty
low.I would like to know if the whole set was filmed and if so where I
 could possibly obtain this treasure.  I got my copy from a fanatic
friend who got it from a fanatic friend who got it .... and so on, so
 I really don't know who has the
original.

The other rare video clip I have is a professionally shot clip of The
Temples of Syrinx from what seems to be a Permanent Waves tour date,
judging by their hairstyles and instruments. This video's quality is a
bit better and the sound is acceptable.  If anyone knows anything about
these videos I would greatly appreciate the help.

Also, if anyone is interested in trading rarities (ie live shows, extinct
MTV videos not on Chronicles) either audio or video, contact me to
discuss what differs in our collections.  By the way, I'm also a HUGE
Genesis (pre Abacab era) fan, so if you want to trade Genesis boots
contact me!
