Subject: CONVENTION!

Fellow Trekies errr Rushians!

Emster2112@aol.com has been kicking around the
idea of a tnms convention, get together type thingy.
There has been some very active discussions on the
nms message board regarding a convention for next
year. To some, I'm sure some of the ideas seem far
fetched, but if we commit to this, and work hard, it
will be a fun time! Toronto will be the setting, many
fun things to do in TO. Bring spouses, children, small
animals (no sacrifices) or just yourself. Carpools and
group rate flights. Who knows how far this could go.

I know I've dragged my own feet on this issue in the
past, but if there are enough interested rush fans out
there, I'm in. I've already discussed it with my wife
and she's game. She'll probably shop all weekend, but
it'll be a great weekend getaway. Well worth saving
for.

Anybody even showing a remote interest in this event
please e-Emster2112@aol.com, or mcdow@ibm.net.
The next move will be to set up a committee of sorts
to generate ideas, overcome/forsee obstructions and
formulate an action plan.

Wow. I'm feeling so proactive all of a sudden. I need a nap.

later,
scoots

If I'm typing this while listening to LTTA/DS, what
time signature(s) am I typing in? And then how would
I translate that to words per measure? Uh-oh, Rhythm
Method, now I'm really in trouble. : )

Subject: eMpTyV and other stuff...

Greetings fellow Rush'ers...

Sadly, I haven't heard a lick of DS yet...I hope to be getting it for
Christmas.  When relatives drop hints at getting you EXACTLY what you want 
for once, you don't ruin their plans, I say...

A while back someone (I forget exactly who) was all in a bunch about
gettin' a whole lot of us to email eMpTyV and complain that they don't play 
Rush.  This is an old idea that isn't going to bear fruit.  Just like telling 
Rolling Stone to focus on real music instead the crap they cover.  Both eMpTyV 
and RS aren't going to listen to us and give Rush their due credit, no matter 
if every single one of us storm their offices and threaten to shish-kabob 
every employee until we're satisfied!!  And you know what I think of that???

THAT'S JUST &*@#$*(&# FINE WITH ME!!!

Let's face it...if eMpTyV and RS gave Rush their due credit, it'd be
because they HAD sold out and become purveyors of crappy music.  Am I the only 
one who thinks that it's better off that Rush **ISN'T** mainstream or 
conisdered pop or such???   Bottom line is, if eMpTyV and RS listened to these 
people wanting to give Rush credit...RUSH WOULD BE RUINED AS A BAND!!!!!  PURE 
AND SIMPLE...

I know the people who were advocating this had no malice towards the band
in mind, but the same cry has been made for years and years...  1.)Our words 
would fall on deaf ears... and 2.)If they did listen..Rush would have sold out 
for these people to like it.

Ya know...when I was younger (and I'm only 27 now...)eMpTyV used to play
MUSIC videos...  Go figure...

Later on Rush fans...

At last!!.  DS is finally out in the UK.  I have been reading all the posts
about the album for the last 13 days and had been growing more impatient.  Now
that it is finally out.................................

Superb,  the best quality of any live album I have heard.  I bought Dream
Theater's "Once In a LIVEtime" a few weeks ago, and it's great - but the sound
quality on DS blows it away.

So go on all UK Rush fans - get out and buy it!!!.  I would be interested to
see how much other fans in the UK are paying for their copy.  I paid £22.99 in
a local record store - I think the bigger chains are selling it at £24.99. 
Any thoughts??.

Several have debated the authenticity of the Hammersmith ODEON photo. I

has *additions* for the DS release.

How about Hemispheres (the perfect progressive Rush song), Double Agent,
Time and Motion (very DT-like), Countdown, The Camera Eye, 2112, By Tor,
Fountain of Lamneth, A Farewell to Kings, Xanadu, The Necromancer, and
Jacob's Ladder?  All of those songs jumped to my head as fitting with
progressive rock.

Subject: A Few Things

Well, I finally got DS.  Thanks to a CD mail order company here in the 
UK, I managed to get it on Thursday, as opposed to Monday (the US 
version actually) and it rocked my weekend most heartily.

Of course it's amazing, no need to reiterate what so many have said 
before, but a few points (big suprise).

1.  Driven

My fave song off of DS (not my fave song off of T4E, nor my fave out of 
the studio versions of the DS setlist, but there ya go.  That bass solo 
does it for me).  Anyway, someone asked if Geddy did that groovy bass 
solo on any other shows - he sure as hell did it in Hartford, although 
if I remember correctly it was shorter and didn't have input from Neil.

2.  Bravado

Yes, to whoever wrote that the Animated version is better - I couldn't 
agree with you more.  I personally love Bravado, especially the live 
version, but it does lack the punch of the rest of the disc 1 setlist 
and seems a little out of place (to whoever said the same about SDT, I 
disagree - SDT fits right in as far as I'm concerned and kicks far more 
ass than on Presto).

3.  Analog Kid

I've got the Majestic Symphonies bootleg of this show, and I'm pretty 
sure it's a different, or re-mixed vocal.  Not 100%, but one big 
giveaway is that on Majestic Symphonies the first line gets lost in the 
mix, so that Geddy's first word is 'windy' rather than 'hot'.  Not so on 
DS.

Those are the only songs I have to comment on.  Everything else is just 
way too good.

P.S. The 'make it funky' bit rules!
P.P.S. I heard the DJ-Z-Trip re-mix of TS yesterday - words fail me.

guides to how to install CW, I got two in my copy, so I'm offering to 
mail the spare to anyone who wants it.  First person to e-mail me at 
gregsanderson@hotmail.com with their postal address gets that funky 
insert in the mail to them.

Oh dear.  Seems I've been hoodwinked.  My earlier post
in which I quoted Kenneth Starr's alledged 1987 comments
about perverts broadcasting descriptions of sex acts in
the media turned out to be a mis-quotation or even a
completely made up one.  It *did* seem to be too good to
be true, and when something seems too good to be true,
caution and skepticism are important tools to deploy.

I humbly apologize for my grievous error.

Neither - it's always been part of Britain, which has never been

I was watching the Metallica Behind the Music special on VH-1 when I 
saw the word Rush in the top-ten selling records. It looked like it was 
in the third or fourth row, but I don't know which one it was. It must 
have been CP or RTB.

I would just like to say thank you to Scarred Records.  If it wasn't for them 
I would have never heard some of my favorite Rush songs performed live. 
One of my favorite boots has to be EXPERIENCE TO EXTREMES.  This boot has live 
versions of The Body Electric, Between the Wheels, Afterimage and Red Lenses.  
I never even knew the boys performed these live.  BTW is killer!!!
Which brings me to this observation... Up until Hold Your Fire it seems Rush 
performed just about every song from their albums live.  Why is then from HYF 
to TFE they have performed just a few of the new songs in concert?  I want to 
hear Red Tide, Totem, Color of Right, Available Light, The Big Wheel and so on 
live.

Hey guys and girls,

I was watching VH1's "Behind the Music" of Metallica last night and   
during a quick zoom of a Billboard ranking of the album "Metallica", was   
our boys listed at number 2 for something.  Had to be Roll the Bones,  my   
guess anyway.

Also, I've read on the RRHOF boards were Rush is #3 on the all-time gold   
record sales list behind The Beatles and Stones.  Any idea where I can   
confirm this?

Last but certianly not least, DS is awesome!  Especially since I was at   
the Dallas Starplex show for The Trees!!! I am now forever immortalized   
on a Rush CD!! Thanks guys!

Barry J. Cook from Sandy, UT -- you asked about the quality of the
Rush Remixes -- I say BUY them. The quality is awesome!! I've
purchased many of the remixes, replacing my albums -- they're
awesome!! So feel confident purchasing the cd's.

I've has the DS cd since the release & paid $17.99 for it. The raw
power of the CD's was awesome! I must say though, that the studio
recordings are best. Live performances are great live -- however, I
prefer studio versions. The Hammersmith is great -- hate the fact that
it is "loose" -- the overall packaging is incredible. 

Final note: I crave new studio releases -- I hope that new material is
released soon!!!

Subject: Remasters

There has been some talk about whether or not it is worth it to get the Rush
remasters.  A good idea, what I did anyway, is to find a friend who is just 
getting into Rush, and offer to sell him all your Rush CD's for 10$ a piece 
so you can get the remasters.  You get a huge chunk off the total sum it will 
take to buy all the cd's, and your friend gets a hearty helping of the 
greatest band on the face of the planet.  The extra money it costs for each 
CD (above the 10$) is well worth the advanced sound quality and the extra 
liners (especially the 70's albums) you'll be getting.  Just my $.02.

is the story I got, and ABSOLUTELY nothing is confirmed.  This came to mind
when ALex seemed a "little" vague about doing another Victor in the "chat"
on Sunday night, so hopefully this sheds some light on the situation.

Alex had apparently spent quite a bit of time (over a 4-5 month period)
composing songs for a possible next Victor release. But, he has supposedly
put it on the "back-burner" for a couple of reasons. 1)Alex paid for all of
Victor himself, right down to the artwork, and doesn't, at this time, feel
like investing all of that time, money, etc, again.
The first Victor cost him ALOT of money in the long run, because it turned
out to be an actual monetary loss (with royalties payed to other writers,
etc). It was also a VERY exhausting experience for him, and Atlantic
apparently isn't interested due to the poor sales of Victor.

Now, 2) this second "reason/specualtion" is a little more positive, as he
doesn't want to get into anything heavily "musical" until he has an idea of
what Rush, or Neil in particular, wish to do in the next year or so.

Hope that clears up the confussion.

Peace..

Subject: Warm Up Your Flamethrowers!

I know this is inviting flames, but being a born-and-bred Rush fan I 
simply have to post my thoughts anyway.  It occurred to me whilst 
listening to DS that exactly the same was going to happen as happened 
with ASOH (and Mirrors, and Majestic Symphonies) - that being that the 
least-listened-to track on DS was going to be the Rhythm Method.

First of all, let me say that the following is not intended as an attack 
on Neil Peart or the quality of his drumming.  Anyone who flames me in 
this respect has missed the point of my posting entirely.  I would 
appreciate it if anyone who does feel the need to do so would e-mail me 
personally, so it can at least be kept off TNMS.

Neil is the best drummer in the world.  How do I know this?  Why, I need 
only listen to his superhuman display of dexterity and musicianship.  
Now, I'm not talking about the drum solo here.  Rather, I'm talking 
about *every single track* on DS.

It is my personal opinion that the Rhythm Method is an unneeded element 
of the Rush concert.  Many would argue that the concert simply wouldn't 
be the same without it - I believe that this argument (that of 
tradition) is the only thing which has kept the drum solo in the setlist 
for so long.

Let's look at it logically.  If Neil gets a solo and Al and Ged don't 
then it must be because in some way Neil is taking a back seat to the 
other two during the rest of the show.  Now anyone who has heard DS or 
attended *any* Rush show would know this simply isn't true.

The point is that when Neil really shines is when he is doing what he 
does best - playing with the rest of the band.  True, the drum solo is 
impressive, but the magic of Rush stems from interplay between all of 
the elements in a Rush performance, rather than the highlighting of just 
one.

This is my argument.  I welcome *serious* attempts to dispute it.

As a footnote, I would also add this:  there have been many complaints 
about this song and that song not being on DS since it was released.  My 
personal longing is for The Pass and Where's My Thing to have been 
there.

If the Rhythm Method hadn't been on Disc 2, they could have been.

Think about it...

If you are thinking about updating your Rush library with the 
remasters, think about using BMG record club.  The 11 for the price 
of one deal is the way to go.  They have the Rush cd's and when you 
fulfill all obligations, the total amount spent is about $4.00 per 
disc including shipping and handling.  Why pay $13.00 at a store?

this article they had a short phone interview with Geddy , the questions
are the same as every magazine who interview him does ...

	In the review part they graded DS with 8 of 10 ( this surprised me a

Ok, so I was looking over some customers' accounts this weekend (I'm a

Thank you, thank you, *thank*you*!  A much-needed rant put
in as appropriately humorous terms as one could want.

But, my old band used to play Limelight, and our guitarist
pulled off the sustained note at the end of the Limelight
solo with just an inexpensive little mid-80's delay pedal.

Not completely correct.  Everytime I've seen them play Limelight, Alex played
*both* parts.  Here's how he does it (btw, I can speak to this with some
authority since I've been playing the geetar for about 25 years, and I have
played Limelight many, many times, including the so-called 'magic note'):

Lerxst has a delay effect that is set-up to sustain the note for a specific
amount of time and then fade out.  The delay is preceded in the signal chain by
an A/B box; on 'A', the guitar's signal goes through the delay unit, on 'B', it
bypasses it.  The A/B box is initially set on 'B' and the delay is activated. 
When Big Al hits that note he switches the A/B box to 'A'.  This directs the
signal to the the delay effect, the note begins sustaining, and Lerxst massages
the note until he has it ringing out in a fury (he also pinches it to get some
harmonics into it).  Then, he hits the A/B switch again, once again bypassing
the delay unit, and starts to pick the chords (G#m .. E .. F# .. etc.).  The
'magic note' is still ringing out because he did not deactivate the delay unit,
so now he's got the 'magic note' playing AND the chords all at once!  In time,
the note fades out automatically, as it was programmed to do.

I've seen Big Al do this in concert and I think it may also be visible in the
"Exit.. Stage Left" video.  I also noticed the difference right away because
the way it's played on DS is the way I've always played it! (being too lazy to
set-up the A/B box and the delay unit, as described above, just for this song)

So, this is how it's normally done.  Now the big question is, why isn't it done
this way on DS??

The most prosaic explanation is simply that he missed the foot switch!! 
Believe me, this is very easy to do!!!  Especially when you're playing in front
of 10k screaming fans, lights are flashing on and off, sweat is rolling down
your face and getting in your eyes, and you're just generally caught-up in the
excitement of the performance.  For example, he may have gotten caught out of
place (away from his equipment) when the time came.  He also could have just
forgotten!

He may also have had equipment problems that night and was missing some
required piece of equipment.  Although this is somewhat doubtful since I'm sure
he carries backups of everything with him, and things like delays and A/B boxes
shouldn't break down very often.

Another explanation is that he just decided "to hell with it" for this tour;
maybe he thought, "it's not worth the hassle"!  I doubt this explanation as
well though, since he still needs the delay for lots of other things and so
probably he would have all the needed equipment set-up anyway!  So, why not
just play it like always?

We'll probably never know the real explanation, so we'll each have to make up
our own minds about it (if it really matters to you -- it doesn't matter to me,
personally).

(Technical note: the A/B box is required because most delay units will turn off
their output when deactivated.  So, the delay unit is left activated and the
signal flow to it is controlled externally.)

BTW, the method I described above is probably the most common way to do this,
but there are other ways to achieve the same thing.  Even if this isn't the
*exact* technique that Big Al is using, this method should give you the jist of
how it's done.

Mike, do you know if this is the same effect that Joe Satriani uses?  I just
saw him recently and noticed that he was using a pedal to get that weird
high-pitched sound ('bizarre' is a good word for it!) that he gets on a few
different songs (I think 'The Crush of Love' is one).  I could tell he was
working a pedal, but I wasn't close enough to tell what it was.  I thought it
might be custom made.

As a fellow guitarist Dan, you betcher ass I do!! :)

For the life of me, I can't understand why they rearranged Natural Science.  
Many people pointed out that they repeated the "Wheels within wheels" part.  
Now Dan has pointed out that the second solo is missing.  And, I don't recall 
anyone mentioning this but, the line "Art as expression" was chopped too!  
Why would they bother to chop this one little line???!  That line did lead 
into the second guitar solo, so they probably chopped the two together, but 
still, WHY?

I wonder if anyone here has any insight into this?

        Hello all!  This is my first time posting.  Be gentle with me.  Let
me start by saying that I've loved the site, the posts, and the comments. 
Being a Rush fan (to say the least), I appreciate a place like this.  Thank
you, Rush Mgr.  Enough of the mushy stuff.
        I am a 6th-12th grade English teacher in Orlando.  I am of the mind
that we should make our jobs enjoyable.  My administration gives me free
run in my room as long as the kids are learning.  I've learned that
teaching thematically is the best way for kids to learn.  The more you
connect to a subject the better.  For example: read Romeo & Juliet and one
may watch West Side Story as a connection--but why not play "War Paint" as
a thematic connection to "coming of age"?  Kids need things with which they
can identify.  Rock and Roll is one of the best--easiest forms of
communication to get across to reluctent learners.
        In the past, I have used "Totem" as a lead into a thematic unit on
religion.  I've played the fear trilogy to get my students to understand
the concept of horror.  Everything I've done has really worked well.  My
kids, mostly Hispanic and black, didn't care for Rush at first.  They
thought the music was just some more "Rock trash" but the kids started
grooving on the bass and the drums.  They sat in amazement listening to the
drum solo from DS. "God, that dude's gettin' it!" one of my kids said
today.  They've slowly come to love Rush.  They want to hear more.  This is
were I need your help.
        If you can think of a song that would fit into the following
themes, I'd love to have your comments.  I'd love to share my results with
you when the whole thing is done.  Just Email me with your song titles
typed in under the themes that I have listed.
anger
courage
coming of age

identity/self image
perseverance
religion +/-
friendship +/-
family +/-

I know it's a long list.  Just glance over some of your favorite CDs and
list a few songs.  My research would benefit greatly--my kids, even more. 
If you can think of other songs off the top of your head, throw 'em in. 
The more the merrier!

Dear Rush Fans,
        One question? Is anyone having problems with their enhanced CD. I
certainly am.  I have seen the enhanced CD though, through a friend and I have
to say I think it is awesome. I think it goes quite well with the music of
Rush. Different Stages was an excellent CD well worth adding to my growing
collection. I am a new Rush fan. I've only been listening to them since May
and I've collected 13 of their CDs. Hopefully, Santa will be kind enough to
give me the rest of my MUCH MUCH needed Rush collection. Once again I ask the
question, does anyone know where to find Rush merchandise? Other than online
shopping? I live in Ohio and I've checked a lot of the area stores and can
find nothing. I thought maybe with the arrival of Different Stages there might
be some kind of merchandising out there, but if there is I sure have not found
it. I am almost considering traveling to Toronto during my Christmas break in
search of Rush items. If anyone has any information which might help me in my
quest please please PLEASE!!! Email me !!
Thanks
keep on rockin to rush!!!!
Love,

Subject: Limelight live- Mike Skurka's response

In response to Mike Skurka's response to a post regarding Limelight on 
DS in which, the final sustained note of the guitar solo is omitted.  

Mike, Alex used to play both the note AND the chorus parts live.  He 
used a delay sampler which then sustained the noted until he turned it 
off with his foot while he continued playing the song.  Watch the ESL 
video, it is right there.
Why doesn't he do it now?  Who knows?  Why doesn't he use a wah-wah 
anymore?  Why doesn't Alex and Geddy use Taurus Pedals anymore?  It 
always depends what you are into at the time as a player.  I have a 
collection of guitars and equipment.  I like to rotate my use of all of 
it every 6 months to a year, because I get to like a sound or guitar, 
then I pick up another guitar a year later and I love it, goodbye old 
guitar, etc.  Rush do seem to be getting lazier on stage though!  (A lot 
of old stuff that was played with the Taurus pedals are now on tape 
through the sequencer, which is Ok, but...  Examples of this: Limelight, 
Freewill, Spirit Of Radio, Analog Kid, Natural Science, oh well.  I 
don't mind, but I just was thinking about it.)

Actually, by definition, at absolute zero there is NO movement.  The
entire universe (defined as the area at absolute zero, whether or not it
encompasses the entire univers as we understand it in the literary
sense) effectively becomes one giant particle.  It has no movement
relative to anything within itself.  But them absolute zero is
impossible to obtain.  We've only managed to get with in a few
billionths of a degree....

Would make a GREAT basis for a CX1 or NS type Rush song.....
