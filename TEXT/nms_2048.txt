[ATTENTION ATTENTION!!! OFF RUSH TRACK!!!]

[Enter semi-music-technichal stuff]
I've noticed a few descrepancies on this statement:
  Losfer Words is written in 6/4 (or 12/8 depending on how you look at it)
  The Duellists is also in 6/4 (12/8)
  And in the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, right before the slow bass /
narrative part, the time signature changes from 4/4 to 6/4 (12/8), I
think it changed back to 4/4 and then back to 6/4 (12/8) and then back
to 4/4 at the end of the song... I'll have to find my notes to tell you
for sure...:)

>The biggest similarity?  They do a song based on a Samual Coleridge poem -
>The Rime of theAncient Mariner.

Well... I wouldn't go as far as to agree with your friend.. there are
many differences between Maiden and Rush... I'm not going to get into
all of them cause it would be a waste of hard drive space... Maiden is
good, Rush is better...:)

Actually, Marillion are just the most *well-known* band that began
recording Genesis-Yes inspired/derivative (however you look at it) music.
The other *big three* are IQ, Pendragon, and Twelfth Night, who all had
their origins in the late 70s alongside [Sil]Marillion. Excepting
_Clutching At Straws_ and certain songs by IQ, Twelfth Night pretty much
blew away Marillion, Pendragon and IQ (the Geoff Mann albums only, being
_Fact and Fiction_ and _Live & Let Live_.

Hogarth's voice sounds more robust while Fish's is much more expressive.
Each serves its purpose. Neither Marillion with H nor Fish have recaptured
the ingenuity and glory laid in _Clutching At Straws_.

The unitiated could try either _Best of Both Worlds_ (a 2xCD, one disc
featuring the Fish years, and the other focusing on H) or if that's too
expensive, get _Six of One, Half-dozen of the Other_ (which has the killer,
*restored* version of "Assassing"). I'd say just get _Clutching At Straws_.
It's the best album, regardless of who's singing.

"Grendel" can be acquired on either the new, remastered, 2xCD _Script For A
Jester's Tear_ reissue or the collection _B'Sides Themselves_. A great
track, but it doesn't touch what the band accomplished on _Clutching At
Straws_, one of my favorite albums of all time.

Aptly put, Alex. Hogarth is a singer, while Fish is an *expressionist,* but
Hogarth did surprise the heck outta me with the title cut from _This
Strange Engine_...a fabulous track. Too bad the rest of the album isn't fit
for TP.

Alex, I think you're overcomplicating things here, although I can
understand your position in saying you hear what you hear (by strange
coincidence, I also hear what I hear <g>).

Two points: First, the magic of multi-track recording even at its most
primitive is that it creates audio environments that *never* existed and
*never could have* existed in real airspace at the time of recording.
When this data is reproduced by stereo equipment (first in the studio
monitors), then and only then is this new "creature" born. What am I
talking about? A clue - your head and mine only have two "mics". How
many different mics at different distances from different sources are
there in even a home recording? And that's without even getting into
direct-to-the-board stuff. Bottom line: Sound-on-sound is an illusion
show, fully and completely. No wonder bands can't make it sound "studio"
on the stage, even with the most sophisticated tricks.
 
Second, an electric guitar can sound like an incredible bunch of
different things, even with no effects and no studio trickery. As you
were saying about Geddy, it's mostly in the fingers, and the rest of it
in the head of the listener. Flatpicks scrape strings. Nails scrape
strings. Fingers scrape strings. And besides that, all sorts of things
can happen at the stages of guitar/effect circuitry, amp/speaker, 
microphone, tape, mixer, and finally listener (who can't hear any one
sound in true isolation) to make almost any real or resultant/imagined
envelope possible, including "bowed".

And when this fails, I resort to the "argument by ____" (what's it
called, students of formal logic?). :> Who played the fiddle then? Why
weren't they credited? In 23 years why is there no anecdotal evidence of
such a truly peculiar and maybe funny event? Steel guitar, triangle, and
other such arcane (for Rush) devices have been mentioned; why not fiddle
(or kazoo, what have you)? And lastly, what's so hard to believe about
(merely) a double-tracked solo? It's a commonplace.

And lastly and finally but not absolutely, what's this about a
pentatonic riff? If I take your meaning correctly, that repeated riff is
G - F# - D over and over, not what I would consider a pentatonic riff in
the context of the underlying chord changes, nor really in any context. 

BTW, good stories, Bryan Costello and Stephanie Reigh. 

Barbara, contrary to what's being said, Rush has *already* recorded and
released their latest studio effort. They just did it like Alex did with
Victor, different name and little hype, and no I'm not going to tell you
what it is. You'll just have to search the bins. As for touring, to cut
costs and increase profit margins, they are touring separately with
local pickup bands. 

Paolo, there *are* a lot of Rush fans like you in Europe, but on a
per-capita basis it pales considerably compared with North America, and
touring is not a charitable event. Unless they just did clubs, Rush
would lose millions trying to tour Europe. I lived in Sweden myself, and
though I knew some people who appreciated Rush, the big picture is that
Rush is and always has been a non-entity there.

Subject: Idle Thoughts

Hi all,
     I have to admit that I've hit the delete button for a few months but now
that i"m back,  It's been wonderfull reading all about the latest
news./threads

     Just a few idle thoughts: While waking up to Red sector A this am I
realized that I hadn't listened to g/p in quite some time.   It also brought
back memories to the awseome laser shoiws at thuse g/p shows. here we go..

     What was the best TOUR that you've seen and why?  

      After seeing the boys appx 50 times since MP,  I think my fondest
memories have gto be g/p.  Not only is it a spectacular album but the show was
amazing.  Think about it.

     What's the most that you've spent on a ticket?  ONLY THE TICKET.  I don't
care how far you drove and what you ate / where you slept along the way.  how
much was the ticket alone?

     I think mine was $250. US last summer at Greatwoods for fifth row center
from one of those so called legitamate "brokers" in the yellow pages. Well
worth it because when we got there, the front row was never sold so guess
where we were all night?

     What's the best bargain you ever got going to a show?

       Mine had to bee the first show of the Power windows tour. Cumberland
county Civic Center in Portland Maine.  $16.00 General Admision.  How can you
go wrong?  
I distinctly remember them opening the show with Big Money echoing off the
back wall.  There were no seats in the back of the Civic Center.

     What's the best song to wake up to in the CD alarm clock?
      I personally like Jacobs ladder and Freewill. (I hope this thread
catches on)

      I could be wrong but I think I might have started the whole Issue 2112
fiasco.  It's interesting to see where it's gone.

      Thank you Rush Mgr. for all the work.  I'm sure whatever you decide will
be terific.  I would like to know how many do subscribe. Just curious.

      I wonder if any of these threads will catch?  Untill later, Take care
all! !!!

Subject: Foghat/Rush Cagematch!

     Brad Oldham told this great story about a multiband concert in the 70s 
     that included Rush & Foghat. Apparently, there was some controversy 
     over who (between Foghat & Rush) should be the headliner:
     
     "Anyway, the thought of Foghat headlining over Rush is laughable, but 
     that's what the masses thought would and should be the case.  But here 
     we are 19 years later and Rush is still kicking ass while Foghat is 
     long, long gone."
     
     Unfortunately, I don't think Foghat is "long, long gone" (unless they 
     just broke up). Very recently, I've saw ads for Foghat concerts at 
     lame-o venues in out-state Minnesota. You know, county fairs, the 
     Medina Ballroom (if you've heard of it, you know what I mean), etc. 
     Foghat, no doubt, SHOULD have disappeared from the map a long time 
     ago, but they continue with live shows (no CDs). Many would say the 
     same thing about Rush. My point? Rush is doing the same thing as 
     Foghat (+ releasing exciting new music), but they are still selling 
     out venues like the Target Center, United Center, etc. People still 
     care that Rush perseveres, while very few people give a shit that 
     Foghat is still playing "Fool For The City" at your corner bar. 
     
     For what it's worth,
     Chad

Subject: Rush Sighting at Van Halen Show

Funny that I hadn't read anything about this in the NMS...  I was at the
Van Halen show at the Fleetcenter in Boston over two weeks ago, and guess
what I heard over the speakers as they were setting up- "Tom Sawyer."  If
it weren't enough that VH use SRO as their management and Howard
Ungerleider as their main man on the road, this might very well be the
clincher that members of VH are into Rush- if you believe that VH picks
what songs are going to be played before the show. 

PS.  Unlike quite a few other songs played before the VH show, there were
a bunch of people cheering once "Tom Sawyer" finished... that was cool.\

PPS.  The VH was pretty decent by the way... solid playing and cool
lighting.

I live in Western New York and because of that I'm able to pick up Canadian
radio stations and hear really good music. Bands such as The Tragically Hip,
Our Lady Peace, Moist and the Tea Party are all really great bands and if you 
get a chance I highly recommend buying their cd's or seeing them live. The 
Hip have a great sound and folks in Canada like this band almost as much as 
Rush. The Tea Party are a 3 piece band and their singer has been compared to 
Jim Morrison but the sound is nothing like the Doors. The singer, Jeff Martin, 
actually played with Alex and some other guys at Alex's bar the Orbit Room. 
(By the way, if you do make it up to his bar don't go on a Monday -it's 
closed.)

Subject: re: Rush/Iron Maiden

Being a fan of both Rush and Maiden (although we all know who the better 
band is, IMHO), I can see a few similarities. Steve Harris is a great 
bass player and although no particular tracks come to mind, I can 
remember lots of bassists wanting to have his chops.  Also, IM did dabble 
in time signatures other than 4/4; check out albums like "Somewhere in 
Time" and "Seventh Son of a Seventh Son" and see what I mean.  Lyrically, 
after their first few albums and Bruce Dickenson joined the band as 
vocalist, they began to do a lot of fantasy/sci. fi. type songs, like 
Rush's mid to late 70's stuff.  IM is definitely more of "metal" band 
than Rush, but they do have strong musicianship and progressive 
sensibilities so I could see a comparison.
I'm sure other NMSers can bring out some similarities as well.

I think it's very unlikely that a session violinist would have been
used.  I don't have my copy of FBN here in NY, so I can't listen to
it but I remain sceptical.  Alex was clearly a big fan of Jimmy Page
back in 1975, and Pagey used to play his Les Paul with a violin bow,
so maybe Alex was doing the same thing.  But my personal guess is
that it's just a guitar being played with a pick - Alex used to get
a vioilin-esque scraping attack by scraping his pick along a string,
sometimes - Something For Nothing has an example of this.

I'll listen to it carefully when I get back to London, though.

Even if your beloved Sabres can manage two more wins from Washington,  They

with 5 more wins, Detroit will repeat as the Stanley Cup Chapions.  With

Last year at Rush's concert in Detroit, Geddy congradulated the Red Wings,
receiving a HUGE roar of cheers.  Also, I saw Beck Last night at Pine Knob.
 My friends and I got the place doing the "Let's Go Redwings!!" chant.
That was very cool.

Redwings and Dallas tonight, so I think I will crack me a Rolling Rock, and

Hey gang..
In the last issue, Dean stated..:
<<<On Thursday, May 28th, some desperate fool broke into my car and stole 
every CD I had.  I took them with me that night to the computer lab at 
school to work on my webpage.  The next morning, I discovered that all

what can be done? >>>>>>>>

Man, what can I say, I've been there, and my thoughts are with you. The only

Take care, and I hope things look bighter soon..

Someone just sent a post about the low attendance figures at the T4E shows.
I have to agree with the rush.mgr on the fact that it was not promoted at
all!!!!!

If it was'nt for my friend who lives in Milwaukee I would have never known
about the show at the Bradley Center!!
He got his information over the internet but not through radio stations or
newspapers!!!
I never even heard about the show at the (Marcus or the Mecca I don't
remember which one).
I did'nt go because I heard about the show about 2 days before (could'nt
get off work).

The radio stations up here in Stevens Point have concert updates for all
over the Madison-Milwaukee area but not once did they mention this Rush tour!!!

Someone discussed the comparison of the two bands.

When I was younger, before I discovered Rush, I absolutely loved Maiden.
Was my favorite band, by far.  Really cool complex music, and interesting
lyrics.  Love that Steve Harris "gallop", and those harmonious guitars.

Anyway, I figure if I dug 'em both, there must be some similarities.  There
are some, like I said, good music/lyrics.  Complexity in the music, lyrics
about fantasy stuff, etc.

I own my own version of a Red Barchetta too! Okay, so its not red. Its blue. 
And its not a barchetta, its a Hurricane. And it doesn't have four wheels, 
only two. But hey! It "runs the deadly race" quite well, and those little 
ear-bud headphones fit  quite nicely while wearing a helmet, so I can listen 
to RB while I ride....(it used to have red wheels, does that count??) After 
all, its the spirit of the thing that counts, no?

On the Ayn Rand-South Park thing:

C'mon. Its not that hard to figure out. Primus does the music for the show. 
Primus are Rush fans, to some degree. Ayn Rand is an oblique reference to 
rush, at best, but if you were going to infer that it was a Rush reference 
at all, I would think that Matt Stone and Trey Parker have probably listened 
to Rush at some point, if they like Primus enough to ask them to do the music 
for their show.....mm'kay???  [drugs ur baaad, um'kay?]

More FYI stuff . . . I wonder how Andrew got te job ;-)

Andrew MacNaughton

                 D i r e c t o r

In eight short years Andrew MacNaughtan has established himself as one of
Canada's premier rock photographers. Self-taught and consistently innovative,
over the years he has shot personal portraits, album art , press publicity and
material for Innumerable artists, from domestic stars including Tom Cochrane,
Jane Sibbery, Holly Cole and 54 40. to international artists such as Robert 
Plant, The Cult, Lou Reed and Primus. Since 1989 MacNaughtan has been the
exclusive photographer for RUSH which included all of their tours, promotional
material and album art.

Andrew has created album art for over 35 releases which include "Naveed" by
Our Lady Peace for which he won the 1994 Juno for Best Album design. Most
recently Andrew has designed sleeve work for The Skydiggers' "Road Radio",
Great Big Sea's "Up" and for Alex Lifeson's first solo album "Victor".

In 1994 MacNaughtan began exploring another creative outlet--VIDEO
DIRECTION. His eclectic sensibilities made him a natural choice for alternative
acts, particularly after his colourful clip for the Ghandarvas' debut track 
"The First Day Of Spring" was given heavy rotation on Much Music.  That video 
and the video for the Rainbow Butt Monkeys' "Circles" earned MacNaughtan his 
two CMVA nominations in the Best Alternative Video Category. Some of the many
videos Andrew has directed include Sara Craig's "Thank You Very Much", The
Skydiggers' "You've Got A Lot Of Nerve" and "What Do You See" , Great Big
Sea's "Run Runaway" and "When I'm Up" and also Amy Sky's "Till You Love
Somebody".

Subject: Hold Your Fire through Power Windows

I, just yesterday, purchased the remastered HYF CD, and it holds one of my (now)
favorite Rush songs, "Time Stand Still."  Anyway, I couldn't help getting a kick
out of the pun "hold your fire" (which would usually mean "don't shoot"), and
the picture of the man juggling the flaming balls inside the CD liner.  Then I
noticed that the far left window on the building behind the man was open and had
a couple of televisions, just like the room the kid on Power Windows is sitting
in.  At least now we know what he was looking at, but I really don't think he
needed the binoculars.  So I want to know, does Rush do this a lot?   Have
connections between different album's covers/CD liners?

Not only that (and you thought I was done), but the songs on HYF all might be
connected somehow, I'm just not sure on all of them.  I'll get you started.

The line "I turn my back to the wind," in "Time Stand Still," effectively leaves
behind the "Force Ten" winds.

"It went right by me, at the time it went over my head. I was looking out the
window..." (at the guy juggling the flaming balls, no doubt) in "Open Secrets"
implies that attention was not being paid, much like when you get nostalgic as
in "Time Stand Still."

Then there's "setting the clouds in motion" in Prime Mover, only to see them
"suddenly parted" in Tai Shan, and there's the constant fire theme that pops up.
What does everyone think?  Have I lost my mind yet, or am I just well on my way
there?

Underated rush album "greg".

Well i think that COS is the most
underated, for me its one o f the best.
It has the most dynamic Rush songs,
with the spectra of...beaty...mysty...aggressive..
dirty....punky....slick....dreamy.....melankolic..
sadness.....positivly......etc..etc...zzzzongs!

Fun memory! (some memory last for ever..)

I will second COS as the most underrated Rush album.  I would also like
to add that I think COS is the definition of alternative rock.  Not that
canned 'alternative' crap they play on stations around the country
today; true alternative rock.  Release that album in 1992 and it's all
over the college stations.

possibly, but Al is known to change guitars in the middle of a song
without missing much if anything.  As soon as one goes out of tune or
blows a string, he has a tech run out another one.

Hey gang..
Neat thread too... My own little Rush-mobile was a 1981, cherry red, in
great shape Toyota Celica. She was my pride and joy. Nothing like speeding
down the highway with the radio blasting my favorite Rush tunes. I finally
gave her up in 1995, when I got a job that required me to travel about 40
miles a day. I knew that constant strain would require me to do some work on
her that, in the long run I wouldn't be able to afford. So I sold her to a
friend of my wife's. About a year later, we learned the girl's boyfriend,
who had wrecked two of her cars already, wrapped my Celica around a tree.
Not drunk, just a lousy driver. I kid you not, I openly wept at the passing
of my beloved car. I still miss her....
Now I'm all depressed again.. Thanks guys...

Subject: New World Order 4 life! 

Attention!!!  
The United States Constitution has been suspended! 
Martial Law has been Imposed! 

Not really.... or should I say, not yet... now that I have your
attention, a few things I thought about.

1) Aaron Calder has had the best idea yet for issue #2112. Nothing else
will come close, so don't waste your time and my time.

2) Ayn Rand.... I highly recommend anything & everything one can get on
her or by her to read. "Among the living" is my favorite book of hers.
It is an awesome snapshot of revolutionary St. Petersburg, Russia from
someone who lived it, saw it & smelled it. If you have ever been on a
Soviet train, you will KNOW what I type of. The whole thing with
SouthPark, I am sure, was not so much that the 2 chaps that write and do
the show (Parker & Stone) were advancing their political agenda, far
from it. 

The whole point was that "Atlas Shrugged" is a very long, and at times,
can be a difficult book to read. My earliest memory of that book is
seeing a ragged / dog- eared copy on a Teacher's shelf. It resembled a
Phone book, more than a fun book. The Policeman had learned to read just
that day, and was jumping headlong into that book. And "In the End", if
you remember, he rejected reading and all its worth as a waste of time,
based on that book. So in summation, I highly, highly doubt those 2
(Parker & Stone) were trying to shove any conservative ideology down our
throat. Just illustrating a humorous point using a large book.

3) P/G has the most reds on it?!? Never noticed, probably why it is
their best album, and they know it, too!

4) Iron Maiden....here, here my friend. I could not agree with you more.
I always liked Maiden, ALOT, not only for the edge they had to their
music, but for the progressive nature of the music as well. I highly
recommend "Piece of Mind", "Number of the Beast" & "Killers" as well.
Loud & aggressive...and progressive, just like Rush on gems like
"Bastille Day" & "Anthem" to name 2. Metallica's "...and Justice for
All" is very similar in its approach & execution. 
WARNING....you girls might not dig this stuff, you see, it's a boy
thing, you wouldn't understand. Girls have "Ally McBeal" & "Melrose
Place" and us guys have Professional Wrestling (it's a soap opera for
Men).

5) went to see Page/Plant last Friday night here in Atlanta. More on
that later, but if you get a chance to see them, GO! 

Jimmy Page has not played guitar like this since 1975. He is back to how
he was in his prime. I saw The Firm tours and his "Outrider" tour, and I
walked away convinced he could not play anymore. Now, he looks better
and has regained his Heavyweight title as The Guitar God. He is sober &
drug free, plus, I think Robert is making him "work", ya know?
