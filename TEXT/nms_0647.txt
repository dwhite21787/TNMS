Why would that be a reference to Rush?  The saying "The more things change,
the more they stay the same" is about as old as "Why did the chicken cross
the road?"  I'm not sure why people seem to feel that since Neil used an
old line, anyone who uses it later must of necessity be making a reference
to him.

And actually, the line from BLTW is "The more it stays the same, the less
it changes"...

But anyway.

To whomever posted about the Alex Van Halex flame-
Why do you care what someone else thinks? I personally like Van Halen as
well as Van Hagar, but I like Rush more, but what someone else thinks is his
OWN opinion, which should be accepted as well as everyone acceptinf yours.
ALL musicians produce something worthwhile in their own rite, it just so
happens that everyone on this list seem sto enjoy the music of Rush more.
The bottom line is why can't you respect someone's opinion instead of
flaming? If someone likes Frank Beard more than Neil, LET THEM!!! I like
Neil more than any other drummer out there, but I'm not prepared to start a
flame war over it because IT'S NOT WORTH THE EFFORT!

&gt;
&gt;And by the way, Sting IS a good bassist!  What are you basing your
&gt;assesment of his talent on?  Have you heard all of his material?

Well, I don't mean to say that Sting is a _bad_ bass player, because he
definitely isn't.  I really enjoy a lot of his stuff.  He's really solid,
and writes some catchy stuff.  But, (IMHO, of course) in general he doesn't
come up with as interesting bass parts as Geddy does.  And Jaco Pastorius
is (IMHO again) another level or two above Geddy.

Just trying to put everything in perspective.

Hello everyone....i would like to get your opinion on something.  With all
the talk of Rush coming out with a new album in the near future, one
question pops into my head..Who would be a great opening act for the greatest
band of all time???? Of course, i have my own personal opinion upon the subject
(dream theater) but thats not important right now..What do you think?  send
your ideas(hopes) to bill at:

In about a week or two, i will hopefully(depending upon the response) post

First of all this is my first post and have been a huge RUSH fan since
PoW came out.  I was recently in St. Catherine's (Ont.) and noticed RUSH
CD'S on the Anthem label.  Also, on the last couple (Few) albums here
in the US I noticed Atlantic/Anthem onas the label.  Could anybody give
me more specifics on why RUSH's material in Canada is on a different
label?  Is Anthem subsidiary of another record company (Mercury or Atlantic)
etc.?????  Additionally, I heard that one of the reasons RUSH switched to 
Atlantic is because of the Time Stand Still video.  Is this true and if so is 
this the only reason???

I did not say anything in my post about Michael Anthony being an amazing

backbone of Van Halen.  I also did not say that Alex Van Halen was a better
drummer than Neil Peart.

And as for your statement about Eddie being the only musically talented person
in Van Halen, please listen to the bass lines on Van Halen II, and Woman and 
Children First, and open your ears.

Oh man.. thanks for the report.. I am spinnin' my wheels here

YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES..just what the Doctor order.
I hope they do a song or two like Ghost of Dance though.. A little
bluze sprinkled in is always nice..

I CAN'T WAIT..

BTW - just a little comparison.. On the DT song pull me under, there
is a riff/drum part that sounds exactly like the end of 2112 where
they jam a few seconds before "Attention all planets" and peart
plays those snare hits.. I'll try for a more complete analysis

&gt;and i do, has a better rock voice than anyone), and it caused me to wonder

&gt;i can think of "Best I Can" by queensryche, and if you really want to
&gt;stretch it, "Overture" from _Tommy_ (and about one hundred musicals).
&gt;and i seem to remember olivia newton-john having a song either titled
&gt;"Xanadu" or about it.  anyone else know songs with Rush titles?

	I can add the song 'Jacob's Ladder' by Hughy Luis and the News, and
'In the Mood' (the lounge lizard tune).

As for the Juno Awards:

	Rush did not play, were not even there, and were not even mentioned.
Yeah, I was pissed off too!

Just to clear up the mention of the connection between Gasworks
and Wayne's World, The Gasworks is a very fine establishment on
Younge Street in Toronto that I had the honour of being thrown
out of while visiting there one day.
It does not look like the one in Wayne's World (flaming letters)
but IS a cool bar (although a bit scummy, which isn't necessarily
a bad thing).

&gt;And, apropos of nothing, here's John Rutsey on page 8 of *Visions*: "I
&gt;remember the first bar gig ... It was really something else.  We were
&gt;suburban kids.  None of us had really gone out drinking in bars.  Ray got
&gt;us a job at the Gasworks."  The Gasworks!  Excellent!  I'm referring to
&gt;Wayne's World, where the excellent heavy metal bar (it even has a pool
&gt;table) is called The Gasworks!  A coincidence?  I think not.

Just a quick note.
1) In a Rolling Stone interview (the one with Wayne & Garth on the cover)
   Mike Myers says "once Rush mentioned Ayn Rand I'd go out and read it"

2) Look at the GUP album photography and think what if 1001001 was Morse code.

Subject: Rush on the radio in MA. (come for a visit)

Here in lovely eastern Massachusetts, we have a radio station called WCGY (93.7)
The play Rush like they are going out of style...  They have this thing at
5pm called the five at 5.  They pick an artist and play five songs.  I dunno if
they have done rush yet, but here are some of the more obscure songs I have
heard on this station.

Circumstances
Cinderella Man
Xanadu (The whole thing)
Working Man
Twilight Zone
The Trees (they play this a lot)
La Vila Stragiato
Natural Science
Entre Nous (sp?)
The Camera Eye
Witch Hunt
The Analog Kid
Digital Man (usually as a dbl shot with analog kid, depends on the dj)
Red Sector A
Between the Wheels
Countdown
The Mission
Prime Mover
Turn the Page
Where's My Thing

That's about all I have on the list that I keep, I find it interesting that
only one radio station in the Boston area will play this much Rush.  As a side
note, this station is rapidly becoming the #1 AOR station in the area!!!

So, if you are ever in the Boston area, tune your radio to 93.7 (wcgy) and do me
a favor...rip the dial off of the radio, and request lots of RUSH!!!!!!!

Subject: Spinal Tap and Radio play

Goood morning Rushians,

	On a note about Spinal Tap.  Fisrt off, I am a big fan, and saw
them on their limited tour this past summer.  Secondly, after repeated
poorly attended concerts by mostly piss-poor musicians; SPA (student
program association) here at U of D got Michael McKean (aka Lenny or
David St. Hubbins) as a guest speaker last term, so Ghost (my roommate)
and I went to see him.  He spoke for a while, and then came out in
character and played a short accoustic set as David St. Hubbins.  To make a
long story short:  Most of the movie "This is Spinal Tap" was completely
off-the cuff.  As a matter of fact, there was only ONE scripted line in
the whole movie "Tap into America".  The movie was done by the cast (Rob
Reiner, Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, etc.) setting up situations,
and just taking off in character.  They never intended to poke fun at any
specific bands (I don't really believe this, some things are just too
obvious), but rather made up outlandish and hillariously impossible
scenarios.  He did say that on numerous occasions, somewhat irate band
members have accosted him for making fun of them, when it was completely
unintentional.  I could go on but I won't, this is getting long.

	As far as Rush on the radio:  See post by Ghost a day or two back,
but I will add that I get one station at my home (only about 25 miles away
from his) that he does not.  The station is 95.1 WZZO out of
Bethlehem/Allentown.  I won't go into any detail, but this staion breaks
the rules.  They play songs before they are released, songs that were
never released, and in general are very unpredictable.  As evidence, last
time I was home, I heard this playlist: Locomotive Breath(Jethro Tull),
Shinny Happy Peopple (REM), Bastille Day (gee, I wonder), Freebird
(Skynyrd), Enter Sandman (Metallica), and I changed stations during People
are People (Depeche caMode).  True, you never know wat you'll here, but
often times its great--and there's no lack of variety.  They still do not
compare to Buffallo/Toronto stations though (although I have heard them
play Rik Emmett/Triumph too).  You're all sick of reading my ramblings, so
I'll spare you any more eye-strain.

Subject: Rush Radio Poll

G'day, everyone!  My second and last announcement on this subject:
I'm conducting a poll to find out what kind of airplay each Rush song gets.
So far, I'm getting a good amount of responses.  Keep it up!  I think it
would be easiest for you to just send me each song when you hear it --
don't worry about keeping track of them all and sending me one big list --
I'll take care of that.  Someone wrote to me with a good suggestion -
if you can, tell me which station you heard the song on.  That way, I can
let you all know what stations out there are playing rush, so when you
have to travel, you'll know where to tune your radio.  (Obviously, if you
do send the station, let me know the city & state, too!)  Just keep sending
those radio reports -- the more you send, the more accurate the poll will be.
Participate!  Later!

While cruising the local record shop in the University Mall, I found an
interesting CD.  It was an interview titled "Rush--The Story of Kings."  While
I abhor interview CD's this WAS Rush, so I broke down and bought it.  Turns out
to be an interview with Alex after HYF.  Pretty interesting stuff.  Nothing too
new.  Sounds like it was recorded while someone was doing the dishes (?).
Anyway, nothing that really isn't answered anywhere else.  A couple of things
about Alex's oldest son...history...lack of "bad boy" image associated with most
groups.  I was surprised how euphoneous (sp) Alex was.  Hmmm, so why can't he
sing?  Anyway, I thought it interesting that an import would find its way to
remote, yet spunky, Tuscaloosa.  Should I be like offering to copy this for
people?  Or is this something everyone has?

   [ This appears to be a widely distributed CD, the transcription to this
     interview in on syrinx via anonymous ftp, in the rush/special directory,
     called "alex.hyf.int.Z"					: rush-mgr ]

In response to the post by Will Geeslin which mentioned the song, "Time To Make
The Dough Nutz" by Young Black Teenagers (who aren't even black, BTW), I did
find it slightly interesting because of teh sample from Tom Sawyer, but other
than that, there is not a whole lot to it.  IMHO, it is just plain a bad song
and I wouldn't advise anyone to go out of their way to hear it.  Even my
suitemates, who listen to a lot of rap, thought it sucked.  Just my two cents.
