A few things...

First, yes, that post by B-Man WAS REALLY him.

Second, I didn't intend the lawyer thing to stir up a lot of argument here
in the NMS, I simply wanted everyone to know where the NMS web pages had
gone and why. The less said about it in the digest, the better.

And finally, some REAL RUSH NEWS! Check out Rushme's (Douglas Maher) 
post a few posts down.  Looks like the live album is set for release in 
late September!

Subject: Wow, Blockbuster *is* pretty cool!

Hey all...

*** This is sorta boring, but DOES have Rush content :-) ***

I was feelin' a little bored the other night, and decided to head on over
to Blockbuster to rent a video.  Well, after looking around awhile, no
really finding anything I wanted to watch, I went over to the "Special
Interest" section.  I noticed a lot of old music video tapes there, such as
Pink Floyd's "The Wall", and many other things. I just wanted to see if
there were any Rush videos...and low and behold, there was the "Grace Under
Pressure Tour" video.  I had never seen it before, so of COURSE I had to
rent it.  It was pretty cool to see!  At the end of the tape, they had the
original verison of "The Big Money", instead of the shortened eMpTVy
version, another cool thing to see.

Also, when I went to pay for the tape, the guy at the counter goes, "Rush!
Alright!!"  I have a little more respect for those people at Blockbuster
now...I wonder if they'd mind if I kept it a few days longer, and just
forget about that extra late charge?  hehe

Well, sorry for the long boring post...just wanted to share this little
tidbit with all of ya.  Blockbuster did surprise me by having this tape
available to rent, so if any of you are looking for old "out of print" Rush
videos, try your local Blockbuster.  You never know what you'll find!

Cheers!
 Tom

Subject: another RUSH inpired musician dies

I just want to add another "High 5"  to RUSH's  honors. Another 
artist, JEFF BUCKLEY" which I have seen in Boston and met had died 
last year on May 29 (ironically my birthday) but in the new 
"unmastered" release of his last album that he never quite finished, 
it has a RUSH kinda feeling. Searching more into his background, RUSH 
was one of his inspirations for writing music. I suggest you grab a 
copy of his new or past "Grace" (Hmmm...what did you think of right 
there? GUP?)album and see what you think. Also, listening to the last 
CD that the friends of RUSH put out, the band TRIUMPH, Terry Brown had 
done some work with the band and produced a fine recording. Has any 
one seen TRIUMPH? I have and being a sincere RUSH fan and joining RUSH 
in concert since 83, I think that TRIUMPH's light shows were a bit 
better that what SEE FACTOR, the lighting co. for Rush can produce. I 
met 2 of the lighting guys from SEE FACTOR one year and they were 
"trying new things".....but I have to say TRIUMPH had always topped 
the "light effects" Sorry fellow RUSH fans but if you are a true fan , 
we go to hear and see the BOYS, not to watch the lights, right? 
Although one year in Worcester MA, in think it was the GUP tour, the 
show started out with a laser shot from the stage to the middle of the 
arena center rafters where a rotating ball of red soon emerged a face 
like figure that actually spoke to the crowd. Did this happen in other 
cities or does anyone remember this? Also, I think that was the year 
Mountain opened up for RUSH and after 2 songs, the RUSH crowd booed 
their hillbilly asses off stage and brought RUSH out ½ hour early. WAY 
TO GO RUSH FANS!!!!
 One more foot note, a radio station in Nashua NH who plays only top 
40 hits was playing played Nobodys Hero when COUNTERPARTS came out. I 
think it was more of the message within the song that made that 
station play it, and who says RUSH can't play the the TOP 40 kids?

At The Palace of Aurburn Hills 3/22/94 leading
into Al's "meet the orchestra" jam, Ged fades out
the vocal CTTH chorus and Alex picks it up and
changes it. On the Critical Mass CD it sounds
like he sings "closer to your house, a spider's

Hey Rushians out there,

Just wanted ya to know that I am covering
"Limelight" with a trio I will be jamming with
down In Charlottesville, VA.  We're trying to get
on the weekend college bar circuit there and play
something different instead of "dave matthews wannabe"
stuff!!!  I think Limelight is one of Rush's all time
greatest.....do you guys agree??  Well, for me,
that song is what really turned me into a Rush fanatic.  Wonderful
song, and it's very reproducible.......Gedd's vocals aren't too
high......not even for me on that one!

Well, just thought I'd blab my mouth about "what we're doin'.".....

Subject: San Antonio Rush giveaway

Most of you may remember a few months ago when several people reported that
KISS 99.5 in San Antonio was advertising a trip giveaway to Toronto for a Rush
concert.  This promotion included five other trips (Pearl Jam in Seattle,
Page/Plant in New York, Metallica in Japan, etc...) that have been given away
in the last ten weeks.  Chances to win the Rush trip were supposed to start
this past Monday and run for the next two weeks with the prize given away next
Friday.  Well it turns out (big surprise) that there is no Rush concert -
another Metallica concert (this time in LA) is taking its place.  I e-mailed
the program director yesterday to get an explanation -- here is his response:

> Kevin:
> What happened to the Rush in Toronto giveaway? 

The tenative (the big "wildcard" here) concert was replaced with another
Metallica flyaway due to:

1)  The Rush situation.
2)  The incredible positive response to our first Metallica flyaway.  

> Did your information about a Rush concert not pan out?

Originally we had discussed (with Rush's label and management) doing the
flyaway for a show that was to be scheduled for the end of this year in
conjunction to the end of Maple Leaf Gardens/the opening of the new
Toronto arena.  No details were known except that it was in the works. 
Then came the incident with the death of Neil's daughter, that has since
left the status of the band in limbo.  Neil is MIA.  Talk of the band
getting back together is uncertain.  We did not want to give a trip away
for a concert that may never happen.  Thus, the switch.

It seems that KISS's current info is just as bad as their original "facts"!

P.S. - At least they partially made this up in my mind by playing all of
Signals last Sunday night.  I caught the last half of it after hitting a
bucket at the driving range  -- at first I thought it was my CD player playing
Digital Man until I realized that the radio was on.  Hearing Losing It and
Countdown on the airwaves was awesome!

Subject: THE FIRE THAT LIGHTS ITSELF

Well where do i start here?the response to my post has been overwhelming.id
say about 70/30 in favor of what i said.anyways i happen to work in the
industry and if you looked at some of the things i was addressing were for
good reason.lets just go with these.
1.if Rush wasnt inducted this next year into the hall of fame would not most
of you bitch and rage about this?my answer=yes

2.if you went to see Rush at your local arena that sat 19,000 people and there
were only 6,500 people there would you not feel embarrased?pissed? my
answer=yes

3.if a new Rush album was being released in september which it is of sorts and
say it was a studio album and the local radio station in your market didnt
play the first cut off of it,would you not call then to the station and rage
and be pissed because you wanted to hear it? my answer =yes

i think you know where i am going with this.radio is a product.it is here for
a reason.whether you want to hear it or not i must respond to this issue yet
again.Rush is very much indeed on the chopping block in major radio markets.

fact:aprox.14 rock AOR format radio stations nationwide have gone down and
or switched formats and do not play Rush anymore.this might seem marginal to
most considering the size of the united states but i can assure you this much
it is a growing trend.radio has its head up its ass right now.they dont know
really where music is heading and it is a coin toss.why do you think pop is so
huge right now?because,it is safe.pop never fails.top 100 listeners dont care
about the bands they are listening to because most likely the song they are
listening to will be the only one they ever will and i know i dont need to
start listing one hit wonders.

what i am getting at here is this.rock radio is different.Rush has the fan
base yes.but Rush has a fan base that gets older and older,and now Rush
releases come few and far between.the avg.wait for a Rush release is about 2
yrs since they have joined forces with val azzoli the bands personal mate from
mercury records.with the tragic death of selena peart time is now going to be
longer.

this is an eternity in the rock world.trends come and go,styles and themes
have thier time in the light,BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS,Rush will not be as
received as they were for test for echo tour.that is why i posted what i
did.not to just make it seem we should do all we can for our "little secret"of
a band.im saying this because we need to let the programmers and the people at
mtv and vh-1 and radio etc...that there is still a massive market for Rush.if
we do not call in and tell them once and awhile about this i hope you enjoyed
seeing Rush and listening to new Rush when it comes out because it wont happen
ever again if we dont.

the last thing i want to see is Rush wind up like queensryche or YES.having
the nerve to play arenas of 15,000 to 20,000 seats and think people are going
to show up.mind you the last 2 queensryche shows i saw had around 6,500 people
in a 20,000 seat arena,unbelieveably 7,000 on the hear in the now frontier
tour.YES that was a joke .they had 3,600 people in a 14,700 person arena.i
have been to a ton of Rush shows and have noticed a downtrend yes in
attendence.not a really huge one but big enough to notice.i dont want to see
Rush in a 4,000 seat theater.no thank you.and to the guy or girl who posted
that Rush doesnt need the lazers or screen show to make the show.i have one
word : BULLSHIT.the lazers and the screen make Rush ,RUSH!.do you really think
people would file in and out stadiums to see pink floyd for just the
music?HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.no way.NO WAY!people know damn well what to expect at a
Rush show.they pay thier hard earned $$$$ to see a show.im sick of people
putting down the big production shows.i pay alot of money to see these shows i
want the works while im being moved emotinaly to the music and lyrics.thats
why Rush sells tickets,thats why PINK FLOYD sells tickets.

bottom line:test for echo tour was a better tour by 100% because of the
show.counterparts lacked it live.the sound wasnt as good live for that tour
and the lighting wasnt.why?howard wasnt there!!!!!! he came back and did an
incredible job.hey yes i know the setlist was amazing but the lights and
lazers were a welcome sight.Rush is an experience,not just a trend of players
who have no clue how to put on a show so lets just go out there and play and
say good night.hell no!!! i want the film!!!!! i want the fire!!!!! i want the
lazers!!!!! i want the smoke!!!!!! i want the crowd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! call me
old fashioned,call me an asshole i dont care,its just my opinion.

i will have another seperate post not to take away from this one that is very
important if you want to know info on the live cd that i have.

Subject: IMPORTANT RUSH RELEASE DATE

ok now that i have spoken my half on the Rush fans thing here is the news.this
is from a RADIO AND RECORDS release sheet that was handed to me while i was
doing commercial work the other day.it reads as follows:

Rush radio cut pressing-august 12

Rush radio downlink through ATLANTIC-monday morning august 31,1998 7:30 am.

Rush single released to radio:august 31,1998,september 1,1998

Atlantic album cut: Animate -running time:6:52

Atlantic album radio edit:Animate-running time 5:50
Release date:September 22,1998

so there it is .this was pretty awesome to see if you ask me.so the first
track relesed from the live album will be Animate and we have a release date
of some sorts at least for now.my $$ is on this.they are right about all of
the release info about 90% of the time.

Subject: B-man??

Howdy fellow TNMS'ers...

You know, I've been on this list off and on for almost 7 years now, and I've 
seen several attempts by people to cast themselves as Geddy, Neil, Alex,
someone of official-type stature in emails to this list.  After about 8.6 
seconds or so, of looking and reading...I get the idea that this is a really 
lame prank and should pay it no mind.  Then later laugh at other mindless 
fools who think it is real and start having an aneurysms over what was said.

Fast forward to TNMS #2053 and this letter by someone claiming to be the
B-man.  In my heart, I still think this letter was not really from the 
B-man...  I can't imagine why he would have such a beef with the content of 
TNMS.  But yet, if it was a prank, the author did a whole lot better job of 
trying to convince us that it was really the B-man.  (I keep saying B-man, 
'cuz I can't spell Baniasckewicsz or whatever...)  

So, I ask humbly...do you really think dat was him?  If so...what the hell 
was HIS problem?  If not, what the hell was the problem with the person who DID
write it??

Yeah, I am one of those guys who is supposed to be far to old to care about
video games.  At 27, I should be more concerned with my 401k so I can retire
early, I guess.  Whatever.  I had to chime in, tho, about Tempest.
There was a time in the early 80's when video games required THOUGHT.  There
was more to them than just 2 guys standing there fighting (Kung-Fu Master by
Data East was the first me thinks.  Any input?). 
The early 80's signaled (pun) the birth of the video revoloution.  Were it not
for the Space Invaders, Pac Mans, Defenders (my fav) or Tempests, there would
be no damn Mortal Kombat 18 or whatever the hell they are churning out in
arcades now.

Hey Russ, thanks for pointing out the cover of Xanadu by UK band Silver
Sun.I went out yesterday and got it and it is a really great cover
version.For those of you interested it is on their cd ep titled Too
Much, Too Little, Too Late on Polydor Records.It features four cover
songs.The Xanadu cover is cut down to about four minutes and it really
rocks.

I think the B-man is absolutely right when he says that a lot of

with someone bitching about something I just skip right over it and only
read the things of value.I love reading things that make me learn more
about the band and related stuff.If it weren't for this newsgroup I
would have never know about Rachel Barton's cover of TSOR or Silver

just be happy that Rush is still together and still very relevant in the

Subject: Xanadu Speed - BLASPHEMY!!

I don't know if this applies, but there is a studio trick used in the days 
of reel-to-reel analog recording that may be relevant. Often after repeated 
takes, wear and tear on the pipes can make it hard to hit those extra high 
or low notes. One method is to record the instruments, then dub in the 
vocals while playing the track at a slower speed. You sing along with the 
track, taking advantage of the now-slightly-lower pitch, then when the 
recording is played back at speed, the high note comes off fine. The same 
procedure could be done in reverse if a note was too low (for a prime 
example of *this*, listen to the end of "A Death In The Family" by Type O 
Negative). Of course, if they wanted, they could have just sped it up 
during the mix to get it to a certain pitch. Who knows.

Its too bad that the first NMS posting I should ever see by the b-man would 
be so disappointing.  I would have been much more impressed if he could 
have made a positive contribution instead of complaining about what the NMS 
contains.  Perhaps regaling us with a first hand experience from his time 
in the Rush camp.  I guess if I had a "fall from grace" as he had, I would 
become bitter too.

In the year I've been reading the NMS, however, I haven't seen much of what 
he complained about.  I'm talking about the my sister's boyfriend's brother 
part.  He also says there is slander about him, but I thought he said he 
"did" play the promo tape?  Anyway...

I agree with the b-man though that Rush has given us so much to celebrate 
that it is surprising how much people complain about them.  No other band 
that I know of has sixteen studio albums, three live ones plus one in the 
hopper.  Its hard to complain about that!  Me, I'm a glass is half full kind 
of guy.  If you don't like a disk or era of Rush, don't try so hard to dwell 
on it.  Instead of posting what you don't like about Rush, post about 
something inspiring you may have recently found in an old Rush tune you've 
heard 111 times.;)  Celebrate what they have done that has made such an 
impact on you.  Also, people change, issues change and musical tastes change.  
What you don't like today may become very important to you tomorrow (I'm 
saying this from experience).

And now back to more slander from the other 5,000+ Rush fans who combined 
don't know as much about Rush as the b-man!

Not necessarily.  It's *quite* possible to increase the speed, and then
drop the pitch to make it sound like the song is in it's normal register.
 Anyone with the right programs on their PC can do it (though you can't
really affect the speed, unless you simply double it).  I know, because I
did it once with "...And the Cradle Will Rock" by Van Halen.  Recorded it
as a .wav, saved it at double speed, and then opened it using a
sound-board-type-thing I have which lets you adjust the pitch, volume,
and balance of sounds, and dropped the pitch to the point where it was in
it's normal register.  Then, you have Van Halen as a punk band.  :)

Bill,

By now I'm sure you've gotten a thousand or more replies to your offering
in the "national midnight slander" as you call it. In fact, you probably
don't even read them anymore. But I'm going to write this anyway. It is not
a flame, just a reply.

I don't speak for the entire "slander" list by any means. But I would like
to say that most of the people that I've come into contact with on the NMS
are fans much like yourself. (that's not intended as an insult, although it
sounds like you might take it as one) For me, I ***LOVE*** Rush with
abandon. I have for many, many years. There are no "bad" Rush songs, I
agree with you there. But one thing I love about the NMS is its
informality; most of the fans are willing to talk about or debate
_anything_ to do with the band. Although you seem to believe otherwise
based on NMS postings, most Rush fans are an intelligent lot. But as
humans, we are all prone to occasional lapses, in this case in these lapses
often take the form of lazy writing. I would hazard to guess that when
someone on the NMS says a particular song is "bad," they mean "bad for Rush
song," which still, in the minds of most Rush fans, means that said song is
still 1000% better than mainstream pop music.

As for your attitude, I, for one, wish that your arrogance was not so
evident. Many fans used to regard you as a "fallen angel" of Rushdom. As
you said, you made a mistake. Now you live with the consequences. Us fans
realized this, and actually at one time (some of us, anyway) wished,
however much in vain, that you and the band might at some point reconcile
so that you could write more about them without trampling their wishes.
(which I commend you for) However, now that you have unmasked yourself as
being so completely arrogant and full of yourself, its NO WONDER the band
shuns you! I wouldn't read your books now if you published them WITH the
band's blessing. Your attitude in "MEMO FROM A HIGHER OFFICE" is appalling!!

I wonder why, if you knew/know so much about the band you love with all
your musical heart, why would you deliberately do what you did? Well, the
only thing I can think of is that you DID know, and said to yourself, "f*ck
'em if they can't take a joke." Well, Bill, the joke is on you. 

Write your books. They won't sell. You've slandered yourself more
completely now on the NMS than we who read it could ever have done. Because
we realize that most of the postings there are rumour. You have now
dispelled all rumour about your character. Thank you.

Subject: Re: "Draft" for the 2112 edition

There is a quote in "Good Morning Vietnam" that fits my view of this situation
(please pardon if it's not the exact wording):
"I used to stick up for you, Dick, because I thought you were a little bit
crazy. But you're not crazy. You're mean. And this is just radio."

After the sick and threatening emails I've gotten from this bbbman character,
I had to respond to his post. This is completely ridiculous. He writes in NMS
#2053:

<<I subscribe to lists of many different 
bands, and it's really "sad" that the Rush list 
has the worst content of any of them, by far! It's nice to know that 
Black Sabbath fans are so much nicer. Their list (for the most part) 
concentrates on the positive elements of the band, while the NMS dwells 
on the negative, SAD!... Look to the 
POSITIVE, PEOPLE. Don't dwell on the negative! I know for some of you, 
this will be a hard concept to grasp, but give it a try! Who knows, you 
might even like it!>>

But this is *after* he called me a slut, a FAT, ignorant slut in fact, in an
email he decided to send me after a friend mistakenly made a post in my name.
The situation was explained to him, be he obviously didn't care. We even
offered to meet him in a chat room somewhere at the same time to prove we are
different people. But he just continued to deride me in increasingly nasty
emails. 

He insists he's seen me... but I wonder: *how* has he seen me? I've never seen
*him*. This bothers me. A lot. And I'd like to set the record straight right
here that yes, I am fat, I have always been fat, and by golly, that's just
something I have to live with. I also have great legs and a pretty face, but
hey. I'm fat, and by god, that's just the most horrible thing a person can be.
I am also, however, an adult, and this is the first time in perhaps 10 years
that someone has stooped to the level of making fun of my weight. Amazing
maturity, there.

He insisted I take all pictures from his book off my site since I didn't care
for the way it was written. So I did. All three of the pictures scanned from
Visions (of a total of nearly 30 on the site) are now gone. I guess being
called a fat, pathetic bitch isn't particularly conducive to the free
advertising he was getting on my site. 

Not too long after, he sent me email informing me of a conspiracy being
planned by his friends to harm me physically. The actual mail was, by special
request (and not Bill's request, btw), deleted from this post. But I think the
gist of it is clear now.

So much for kindness and harmony. Of course, you must realize that his *own
post* can be applied to all of that "NMS posters dwell on the negative" stuff,
not to mention the lovely mail he sent to me. And all this over a critical
comment of his book that was unintentionally sent under my name by a good
friend of mine who helps me with my mail. But even if I *did* write that
criticism, I think this is going a bit too far. Maybe that's just me, though.
And what if I *do* like the band Boston? Is that any call for obscene and
insulting email? I think not.

Oh, yes. He also insisted, in a crass and obscene manner, that I was
slandering him by mentioning that he had advance copies of HYF and played them
on the radio -- hence, his separation from the band. Basically, he told me
that nothing of the sort ever happened, he never had any advance of anything,
and that I was a fat (again) slanderous pig. But in the NMS post, he writes:

<<Now, as far as the rumors are concerned, YES, I did play a demo on 
the radio before it's release. And I've NEVER denied such a fact. It 
would be awfully hard to deny something which thousands of people heard!>>

Is it just me, or is there a discrepancy here? But bravo, Bill, for finally
admitting your mistake publicly rather than slamming others for doing the
same.

I "know" this is the same person who has written to me because of the "very"
distinctive way in which he writes (notice the quotes for emphasis), even
though his email address doesn't show up on the list. I've avoided getting
into this publicly until now, but this has got to stop. 

I used to stick up for you, Bill, because I thought you were a nice guy, if a
little bit crazy. But unlike the guy in GMV, I still think you're crazy.
However, I also think you're mean. And this is just a fan newsletter.

I love Rush's music -- even the few songs I don't care for personally are,
from a musician's point of view, extremely well-constructed lyrically and
musically sound. I love what they stand for -- the songs *and* the band. And
I, like a good many people on this list, am having a hard time waiting for the
new live album to be released. Whatever personal problems you have that made
you such a bitter person are more than likely no fault of anyone's on this
list. Including me. I will continue to enjoy Rush's music, regardless of what
you have to say about me or anyone else. I will do so until the band decides
to call it quits -- and even then, I will continue to enjoy the music they put
out during their career. A nutbar like you won't change that. 

BTW... if you want to get published again, I'd suggest working on your grammar
and spelling. I know a lot of editors (I myself edit manuscripts for a
living), and I don't know of a single one who would go through the effort of
fixing every incorrect *apostrophe*, much less the spelling and  structural
problems, before publication. And that is *constructive* criticism, something
I hope you can take like a man. Though given your prior correspondence with
me, I'm not sure that's possible. 

And one other thing: "Only fags give other men their ponytails." That's a
direct quote from someone who thinks you should remember it.

Yes, that stuff was the "real" Rush.  I think COS & 2112 count too.
Difficult for me to discount those two because I was a fan before
Hemispheres was recorded.

Although I enjoy one or two of the post-Signals albums, they don't
have the indefinable magic that makes great Rush great.  Even 
Moving Pictures contains a hint or two of the -relative- 
mediocrity to come.

If they hadn't released AFTK, which was rather poor IMO, they
would have released FOUR incredible albums in a row, starting from
2112.

Subject: Rush and Boston- the band

To me, Rush is a far more substantial rock band than Boston since Rush
have spent the past twenty-plus years creating awesome songs and
performing.  However, Boston's first two albums are quality pieces which
served to alter the course of rock music.  Tom Scholz and his crew had put
a considerable amount of effort in getting those songs to sound great-
just consider the rolling, catchy melodies, multiple-layered guitar
harmonies, and the nondescript but solid rhythm section. 
	While it is true that, in 1976, Queen were already established
pioneers in the art of multi-tracking, Genesis and others were raising
rock songwriting to new standards, and Rush were making tracks in the
music business on their own terms, Boston succeeded in making big sounding
rock albums that appealed to a great number of people.  In other words,
those albums were artistic without being artsy.  Moreover, one can hear a
song by Boston from that period and _know_ that it's Boston, even twenty
years later.  Are those reasons to begrudge Boston?  I don't think so. 
	
	If you are a Rush fan who digs rock music with melody and/or
structure, definitely check out Boston's self titled album or "Don't Look
Back".

Subject: Lawyers, copyrights, and expression..

I know how most of you must feel about Rush's lawyers objections, but at one
level I have to agree with them; property is property. It should have
nothing to do with the demand for the item, its popularity, or its
producer's ability to afford its loss. I'm not saying Rush is "losing" real
$$$, but by turning a blind eye to unauthorized use of copyrighted material
which *they* made, they are definitely losing something...

And actually, the Ayn Rand crew should b against piracy. She had very clear
views on the matter of intellectual property.

I don't claim to have never obtained or sanctioned "piracy" of copywritten
material, but I also don't believe that it is justified. Don't make the
rookie mistake in logical discourse of using my lack of purity as an
argument to refute my assertions.

I think that people who feel that they can do anything they want with a
celebrity's property, i.e. music recordings, video clips, etc. because they
feel "entitled" to its use as a fan would feel very different if they were
the producer of the work.

I have a feeling also that if Rush's legal apparatus had been asked in
advance for permission to use the material for the non-commercial benefit of
loyal fans that they might have been (somewhat) accomodating. Some may feel
this is a naive expectation, but it's just my opinion. Rush's legal group is
no doubt accustomed to dealing with people who are blatently making profits
using unauthorized merchandise.
