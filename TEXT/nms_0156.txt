Just a couple of quick things:  first, the list is up to about 590
subscribers - sooo close to that 600 mark!  This is, of course, not
counting all the people that I don't who get the re-distributions.

I've received mail from a couple of you regarding help with the 'awk'
problem.  Thanks, I'll be contacting you in the next day or two.

For those of you who have submitted image files to me, thanks, and I'll
be looking through them  and getting them out into the images area
in the next day or two.

Lastly, there was NO digest for Monday, 1/21/91.

That's about it for now!

There was a very interesting interview on local TV here last night, where
a commentator was discussing the anti-war demonstrations with a former
green beret marine commander.  (Yes, I'll start discussing Rush eventually)

After the green beret expressed his disgust for anybody who'd even consider
demonstrating against our great country's policies the commentator said
something like "..but aren't they just practicing their right to free speech
and freedom of expression which is one of the things that the US is supposed
to be fighting for?"  The green beret shot back "that's just a bunch of
intellectual masturbation!"  He continued on to say that the demonstrators
added as much to the community as does the litter in the streets.

Now back to Rush:  What would our green beret commander think of Rush's
lyrics?  Is our love affair with the group merely desire to practice
intellectual masturbation?

Congratulations to David Gordon, who managed, in a single post,
to make feel ashamed to be a Rush fan (in his intolerant remarks about rock
music) AND to be an American (in completely missing the point of Territories).

&gt; 	The invasion was definitely international, involving four different
&gt; countries in the air attack--U.S., Britain, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. (Notice
&gt; how the French are sitting on their butts again?)
&gt;
&gt; [ I hate to nitpick, but the French had 4 aircraft sustain damage on the
&gt;   first day of the attacks.                                     :rush-mgr ]

I hope this doesn't start another "sampling" fiasco, but:  there are
7 nations participating in the bombings (8 if Israel has retaliated
yet):  the 5 mentioned above, as well as Italy and CANADA!!!!  That's
right, the homeland of Rush is in the thick of it.  Do you think The
Boyz are ashamed of you for not knowing this?

Subject: King Biscuit

Did anyone out there in computer-ville catch the Rush show on King Biscuit
a few weeks ago??  I managed to tape this, and I was wondering about a few songon the show.  One song I didn't know was between "The Enemy Within" and "New
World Man."  I don't have the tape with me so I can't post lyrics...
The last song they did was a melody...  The first part was "Finding my Way,"
but they worked in another song I haven't heard...  It might have been from
_Rush_ the first album, but I know it wasn't "Working Man."  Since the only
Rush albums I have are _Chronicles_ and _Presto_, I can't figure them out, and
I don't have ftp at my site to access the lyric server.

					Thanx in advance,
					Joshua Vaughn.

	P.S., I'll try to post the lyrics next week if no one has heard this
						concert.

I have a small question, does anyone on the rush-net know any places
to get original copies of rush albums before All the World's a Stage?
Preferrably by mail. (oh, sorry for the long signature if it offends
you, just a little artistic impression, but some people get upset)

[ Well, it's nice, but could you try to edit it out of future postings?
  It does take up a bit of room...  Thanks!                      :rush-mgr ]

Hi,
	This may stray a little from a RUSH discussion but
I wanted to post it anyway.  Granted Depeche Mode are no RUSH
but that doesn't mean that their music is meaningless crap.  I
happen to like a lot of their lyrics.  As for synth music,
their was a time when similar comments were made about the
guitar.

In the last edition of TNMS, I asked a question about "Broon's Bane",
if it had been an "issue" before the final recording of the
_A Farewell to Kings_ album.  Whoops, I should have said _Hemispheres_.

I'm appropriately embarrassed  ;)

Just finished up reading about 2 weeks worth of digests and I have just
two comments:

Does anyone know how and where I can get my hands on a copy of the "Prime
Mover" CD?

I am also a bit surprised that there was not more comment about the Pursian
Gulf crisis (now war).  Granted, this is a "Rush List" and not a "Middle East
List".  Personally, I hate to see any loss of life and hope that this conflict
will soon come to a close.  Just think, this is history.  My (our) children
will read about this in text books some day in school.  I hope everyone joins
me in extending our hearts, prayers, and hope to those who are serving our
country and their loved ones.  Don't worry folks, they'll be home soon...

&gt;	This, as does the rest of the song, applies to Iraq alone and not to

&gt;Territories is not anti-war, it is anti-pettiness. Go Team USA!

Yeah, right.  I remind you that Neil wrote those lyrics.  The same Neil
who dedicated (with the Alex and Geddy) the album 2112 to Ayn Rand.  The
same Neil who in other places has noted himself to be objectivist.  (Not
necessarily Big-O objectivist, but certainly, I think, little-o
objectivist.)  Lastly, I complete the syllogism by noting that Ayn Rand and
her philosophy would be/is disgusted by the United States' actions.  I
hardly think Neil is chanting "Go Team."

Secondly, keep in mind that it was the Americans who shot first "in the
name of a piece of dirt."

hey, great news RUSH HEADS! spoke to a friend of mine this weekend who got
a call from John Colfield (the projectionist) for RUSH. He's leaving on a
safari trip w/ howard ungerleider. Anyways, John told my friend that the
album is 90% complete. Thats right! So hopefully it should be out by March.
Probably a tour by the fall of 91. ROCK ON DUDES!

   On my disk versions of cos and 2112, there is no indication as to
which member of the band wrote the lyrics to which song.  Could anyone
tell me?

[ What I have for CoS: "Words and music by Lee, Lifeson, and Peart".  For
  2112, I have "Lyrics by Neil Peart; With acknowledgement to the genius
  of Ayn Rand", except for "Lessons", by Alex. and "Tears", by Geddy.

   Also, has anyone written out the words on "Diadects and Narpets"?  I
did it once but I don't remember what I did with them.

A friend of mine (my bassist, in fact) has a "Big Money" 12", with
a live version of "Red Sector A" on the B-side. Does anyone know
when/where it was recorded, since it isn't the version that's on
the "Grace Under Pressure Tour" video.

&gt;To me, "Broon's Bane" would pass the test of "most-likely-to-be-
&gt;an-intro-to-'The Trees'".  It just sounds so "Treesy".  Was there some
&gt;dispute over this bit of music, perhaps between Rush and then-producer
&gt;Terry Brown (Broon)?  Hence the name "Broons *Bane*".

And why, if it's named after Terry Brown, do the sleeve notes say
"Broon's Bane is dedicated to Elliot"?

signature.... I've always felt it would be a great personal victory to
get a song that was in another time signature onto pop radio." He laughs
and adds half-ironically, "a great moral victory."'
