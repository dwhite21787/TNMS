Notes:
          Most CD track times were found using a Sony Discman D555 CD player and
          the time on your CD player may vary slightly (+- 5-8 seconds) due to
          the way different machines calculate track times.

          Additional information is welcomed, especially Singles, videos,
          bootlegs and instrumentation information on the albums.

          Information with Question Marks is not positive, more exact
          information would be appreciated.

          Exact release dates would be nice....
