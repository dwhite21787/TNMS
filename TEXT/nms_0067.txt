Subject: "A Nice Morning Drive"

             _A Nice Morning Drive_ by Richard S. Foster
                 Road & Track  Nov,1973  pp.148-150
                 ( Reproduced without permission...)

  It was a fine morning in March 1982. The warm weather and clear
sky gave promise of an early spring. Buzz had arisen early that morning,
impatiently eaten breakfast and .gone to the garage. Opening the door, he
saw the sunshine bounce off the gleaming hood of his I5-year-old MGB
roadster. After carefully checking the fluid levels, tire pressures and
ignition wires, Buzz slid behind the wheel and cranked the engine, which
immediately fired to life. He thought happily of the next few hours he would
spend with the car, but his happiness was clouded - it was not as easy as it
used to be.
  A dozen years ago things had begun changing. First there were a few
modest safety and emission improvements required on new cars; gradually
these became more comprehensive. The governmental requirements reached
an adequate level, but they didn't stop; they continued and became more
and more stringent. Now there were very few of the older models left,
through natural deterioration and . . . other reasons.
  The MG was warmed up now and Buzz left the garage, hoping that this
early in the morning there would be no trouble. He kept an eye on the
instruments as he made his way down into the valley. The valley roads were
no longer used very much: the small farms were all owned by doctors and
the roads were somewhat narrow for the MSVs (Modern Safety Vehicles).
  The safety crusade had been well done at first. The few harebrained
schemes were quickly ruled out and a sense of rationality developed. But in
the late Seventies, with no major wars, cancer cured and social welfare
straightened out. the politicians needed a new cause and once again they
turned toward the automobile. The regulations concerning safety became
tougher. Cars became larger, heavier, less efficient. They consumed gasoline
so voraciously that the United States had had to become a major ally with
the Arabian countries. The new cars were hard to stop or maneuver quickly.
but they would save your life (usually) in a 5O-mph crash. With 200 million
cars on the road, however, few people ever drove that fast anymore.
  Buzz zipped quickly to the valley floor, dodging the frequent potholes
which had developed from neglect of the seldom-used roads. The engine
sounded spot-on and the entire car had a tight, good feeling about it. He
negotiated several quick S-curves and reached 6000 in third gear before
backing off for the next turn. He didn't worry about the police down here.
No, not the cops . . .
  Despite the extent of the safety program. it was essentially a good
idea. But unforeseen complications had arisen. People became accustomed to
cars which went undamaged in lO-mph collisions. They gave even less
thought than before to the possibility of being injured in a crash. As a
result, they tended to worry less about clearances and rights-of-way, so that
the accident rate went up a steady six percent every year. But the damages and
injuries actually decreased, so the government was happy, the insurance
industry was happy and most of the car owners were happy. Most of the car
ownersi-the owners of the non-MSV cars were kept busy dodging the less
careful MSV drivers, and the result of this mismatch left very few of the
older cars in existence. If they weren't crushed between two 6000-pound
sleds on the highway they were quietly priced into the junkyard by the
insurance peddlers. And worst of all, they became targets . . .
  Buzz was well into his act now, speeding through the twisting valley
roads with all the skill he could muster, to the extent that he had forgotten
his earlier worries. Where the road was unbroken he would power around
the turns in well controlled oversteer, and where the sections were potholed
he saw them as devious chicanes to be mastered. He left the ground briefly
going over one of the old wooden bridges and later ascertained that the MG
would still hit 110 on the long stretch between the old Hanlin and Grove
farms. He was just beginning to wind down when he saw it, there in his
mirror, a late-model MSV with hand-painted designs covering most of its
body (one of the few modifications allowed on post-1980 cars). Buzz hoped it
was a tourist or a wayward driver who got lost looking for a gas station. But
now the MSV driver had spotted the MG, and with a whoosh of a well
muffled, well cleansed exhaust he started the chase . . .
  It hadn't taken long for the less responsible element among drivers to
discover that their new MSVs could inflict great damage on an older car and
go unscathed themselves. As a result some drivers would go looking for the
older cars in secluded areas, bounce them off the road or into a bridge
abutment, and then speed off undamaged, relieved of whatever frustrations
cause this kind of behavior. Police seldom patrolled these out-of-the-way
places, their attentions being required more urgently elsewhere, and so it
became a great sport for some drivers.
  Buzz wasn't too worried yet. This had happened a few times before,
and unless the MSV driver was an exceptionally good one, the MG could be
called upon to elude the other driver without too much difficulty. Yet
something bothered him about this gaudy MSV in his mirror, but what was
it? Planning carefully, Buzz let the other driver catch up to within a dozen
yards or so, and then suddenly shot off down a road to the right. The MSV
driver stood on his brakes, skidding 400 feet down the road, made a
lumbering U-turn and set off once again after the roadster. The MG had
gained a quarter mile in this manner and Buzz was thankful for the radial
tires and front and rear anti-roll bars he had put on the car a few years
back. He was flying along the twisting road, downshifting, cornering,
accelerating and all the while planning his route ahead. He was confident
that if he couldn't outrun the MSV then he could at least hold it off for
another hour or more, at which time the MSV would be quite low on gas. But
what was it that kept bothering him about the other car?
  They reached a straight section of the road and Buzz opened it up all the way
and held it. The MSV was quite a way back but not so far that Buzz couldn't
distinguish the tall antenna standing up from the back bumper. Antenna! Not
police, but perhaps a Citizen's Band radio in the MSV? He quaked slightly
and hoped it was not. The straight stretch was coming to an end now and
Buzz put off braking to the last fraction of a second and then sped through a
75-mph right-hander, gaining ten more yards on the MSV. But less than a
quarter mile ahead another huge MSV was slowly pulling across the road
and to a stop. It was a CB set. The other driver had a cohort in the chase.
Now Buzz was in trouble. He stayed on the gas until within a few hundred
feet when he banked hard and feinted passing to the left. The MSV crawled
in that direction and Buzz slipped by on the right. bouncing heavily over a
stone on the shoulder. The two MSVs set off in hot pursuit, almost colliding
in the process. Buzz turned right at the first crossroad and then made a quick
left, hoping to be out of sight of his pursuers, and in fact he traveled
several
minutes before spotting one of them on the main road parallel to his lane. At
the same time the other appeared in the mirror from around the last comer.
By now they were beginning to climb the hills on the far side of the valley
and Buzz pressed on for all he was worth, praying that the straining engine
would stand up. He lost track of one MSV when the main road turned away,
but could see the other one behind him on occasion. Climbing the old
Monument Road, Buzz hoped to have time to get over the top and down the
old dirt road to the right, which would be too narrow for his pursuers.
Climbing, straining, the water temperature rising, using the entire road,
flailing the shift lever back and forth from 3rd to 4th, not touching the
brakes but scrubbing off the necessary speed in the corners, reaching the
peak of the mountain where the lane to the old fire tower went off to the left
. . . but coming up the other side of the hill was the second MSV he had lost
track of! No time to get to his dirt road. He made a panicked turn left onto
the fire tower road but spun on some loose gravel and struck a tree a
glancing blow with his right fender. He came to a stop on the opposite side of
the road. the engine stalled. Hurriedly he pushed the starter while the
overheated engine slowly came back into life. He engaged 1st gear and sped
off up the road, just as the first MSV turned the corner. Dazed though he
was, Buzz had the advantage of a very narrow road lined on both sides with
trees, and he made the most of it. The road twisted constantly and he stayed
in 2nd with the engine between 5000 and 5500. The crash hadn't seemed to
hurt anything and he was pulling away from the MSV. But to where? It hit
him suddenly that the road dead-ended at the fire tower, no place to go but
back . . .
  Still he pushed on and at the top of the hill drove quickly to the far end of
the clearing, turned the MG around and waited. The first MSV came flying
into the clearing and aimed itself at the sitting MG. Buzz grabbed reverse
gear, backed up slightly to feint, stopped, and then backed up at full speed.
The MSV, expecting the MG to change direction, veered the wrong way and
slid to a stop up against a tree. Buzz was off again, down the fire tower road,
and the undamaged MSV set off in pursuit. Buzz's predicament was
unenviable. He was going full tilt down the twisting blacktop with a solid
MSV coming up at him. and an equally solid MSV coming down after him. On
he went, however, braking hard before each turn and then accelerating back
up to 45 in between. Coming down to a particularly tight turn, he saw the
MSV coming around it from the other direction and stood on the brakes. The
sudden extreme pressure in the brake lines was too much for the rear brake
line which had been twisted somewhat in his spin, and it broke. robbing Buzz
of his brakes. In sheer desperation he pulled the handbrake as tightly as it
would go and rammed the gear lever into 1st, popping the clutch as he did
so. The back end locked solid and broke away, spinning him off the side of
the road and miraculously into some bushes, which brought the car to a halt.
As he was collecting his senses, Buzz saw the two MSVs, unable to stop in
time, ram each other head on at over 40 mph.
  It was a long time before Buzz had the MG rebuilt to its original
pristine condition of before the chase. It was an even longer time before he
went back into the valley for a drive. Now it was only in the very early
hours of the day when most people were still sleeping off the effects of the
good life. And when he saw in the papers that the government would soon
be requiring cars to be capable of withstanding 75-mph headon collisions, he
stopped driving the MG altogether.

Subject: Some comments on the latest newsletter:

&gt; the Rush "Get A Life" Digest.

Yes, The Rush "What time is it on Neil's watch?" Digest,
unfortunately, says a lot about the mailing list.

My suggestion for the digest name:  The Camera Eye
Makes sense.

&gt; He's right, it is the 1812 overture melody, played at about 20 beats
&gt; per minute faster.
Either your CD player is busted, or you were playing your LP of the
1812 Overture at 16 rpm, or you are in a symphony with a very bad
conductor.

One song I think is great for solo acoustic guitar and vocal is
Different Strings.  It has been experimentally proven by myself to be
able to win a girl's affection when played and sung properly.
(Seranading with Rush?  Hey, it worked.)

&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know how tall Neil, Geddy and Alex are?
&gt;Or their shoe size?
&gt;

Well, Meg, I'm afraid I don't know the specific answers to your questions, but
rumor has it that if you knew their penis sizes, you could infer the other
two measurements... ;-) ;-) ;-)

[ And at the risk of being crass (in continuation), you can tell that size
  by looking at a fellows hands, and .... nose!  ;-)  Wait, then Geddy should
  be 10 feet tall, and ... well, never mind!                      :rush-mgr ]

I that other peoples' interpretations of intentions vs. effect explain the
purpose of these lyrics.  As to the effectiveness of the image, I'd like to
also point out that heat often goes hand-in-hand with light.  As one knows
who has ever sat under a hot, incandescent bulb at a writing desk, it always
feels like you're getting more heat than light out of the thing.

Just a small question, what does Ahsolom (sp?) mean in the song Distant
Early Warning?

[ I think this is 'Absolom', and it's answered in the latest Backstage Club
  newsletter!  (Which of course I don't have here...              :rush-mgr ]

Second question: Who else thinks that the version of Distant Early Warning
was better done in _A Show of Hands_ than the original album?

  just a few questions for anyone out there who might have a few answers:

   why were ATWAS and ESL shortened by on song on the CD when both of them
 are under 79 minutes long and would easily fit on a single disc with no
 problem?

   why is p/g aad when the two albums before it, MP and signals are add?

   why does Fear appear III,II,I on the albums when it is played I,II,III?

[ That's just the way Neil wrote it...                         :rush-mgr ]

   any answers to these questions would be greatly appreciated.

   Greetings- there IS a CD bootleg out and about called 'Red Star of
The Solar Federation.'  It was taken directly from the 'Exit...'album.
(Same tracks, song order, sound, etc.)
   In case people missed my posting in the recent special edition,
I have heard that the boyz did some instrumental music for the movie
'Darkman,' out this summer.  I doubt this is true, but could someone
confirm or deny this?
   Does anyone know where I can get a poster of the boyz from the
'Presto' tour...The Backstage Club (last time I got something from
them) didn't have anything for it.  If anyone has info, please post
or e-mail to me.

Sorry I haven't been as active in the worship of the "four horsemen" (Neil,
Alex, Geddy and Mongo), but work has kept me very busy.  I have a few
suggestions for some name changes:

         I would first like to suggest that we bestow are brave leader with
a befitting title:      *Prime_Mover*

[ Oh, no, I don't want to let this go to my head!  I'll settle for all those
  beers I've been offered!  :-)                                  :rush-mgr ]

After all he is the one who "...sets the wheels in motion.
                             Turn(s) up all the machines.
                             Activates the programs.
                             And runs behind the scenes."
         The second suggestion is for the Mailing list it self how about....
            RUSH Chronicles ;) &lt;grin&gt;

[ No, I can't abide by this one, as this list (with almost 450 people that
  I *know* of, may eventually come to their attention.  (I know, I know,
  but Neil may have been having a bad day...)  I don't think they  would 
  approve of "Chronicles"!  Luckily you did include the smiley!  :rush-mgr ]

         As for the mailing address anything with 'Cygnus' in it will do. :)

_____________________________________________________________________________

      Hey ":rush-mgr ]"   I'm going to be in Annapolis MD on Saturday for
the Festival, any chances of bumping into you there?

[ Geez, sorry dude, I'll be up just north-east of Philadelphia, PA this
  weekend...  Otherwise I'd probably have been there!           :rush-mgr ]

&gt;From: "Meakin, William James"
&lt;WMEAKIN%DREW.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU&gt;
&gt;        It's been awhile since I posted, but I just discovered
something
&gt;that really blew me away! To make it more exciting for everyone
else,
&gt;listen to the first part of 2112. Concentrate on the last
guitar solo.
&gt;

Could it be one of the major 'motifs' from the Overture 1812 by
Tchaikovsky??  Of course it is.  I noticed that listening to the
record (now disc) soon after getting it.  My major interest in
is classical music, but I like some jazz (Pat Metheny, Stanley
Clarke, Jean-Luc Ponty) and various rock-n-roll (Rush, Yes,
Dixie Dregs, Moody Blues, and a host of others).  In rush (and
Yes) I like the full sound made from several instruments.  Tales
from Topographic Oceans is symphonic in nature as is 2112.  I
always have liked concept albums (I by Patric Moraz).

Subject: Rush Guitar Stuff: Count me In!

Just a note about a couple of things regarding Rush Guitar stuff that might
happen to go on on this mailing list.

1) Rush, more so than most other bands, has written such a wide variety o types
   of music that it is very difficult to listen to an entire album by them
   without hearing many beautiful acoustic guitar parts. It seems to me that
   Alex's inspiration for many songs comes from classical lines, if not, at
   least, to some degree, classical theory. "Broon's Bane," is a perfect 
   example.  Even Alex's non-acoustic parts, including many of his long solo 
   runs, use classical mixolydian, lydian or aeolian mode scales.  It seems 
   that in a band with as much technical prowess as Rush, it's hard to think 
   of the guitarist limiting himself to power chords with the distortion 
   turned all the way up. (Not to say distortion is bad. Personally, I love 
   it.)
2) I, probably like many other readers on this list, also play guitar, and any
   solo trading or tips that happens to go on on this list I would love to be
   involved in. I guess a little background might be worth it. I play a Kramer
   Striker with a Floyd Rose Licensed Tremolo, on a Peavey Amplifier. I love to
   play stuff by Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Alex Lifeson, Eric Clapton,
   Jimi Hendrix, and pretty much most anything that I can challenge myself with.
   I'm even starting to listen to some Michael Hedges now, (big concert here
   at Stanford this Friday) and he's phenomenal. Anyone interested in guitar
   should check out any of his albums. Also, tomorrow is Joe Satriani/Eric
   Johnson in San Jose. I'm there. Rock on!
3) Sorry about that. Getting back to Rush related stuff...I was wondering if
   any of the other guitarists out there noticed this about Alex's playing.
   Personally, I love to play Alex's parts from earlier albums, because it
   seems that he was more involved in making the song move then than he is
   now. I'm not saying that he's any less talented or taking it easy even.
   But previously, his guitar parts seemed more involved. Not having too much
   money to spend on equipment (I'm a starving student.) like digital delays,
   reverbs, I have a hard time imitating Alex's heavily effects-based sound
   on later albums with the distortion built into my amp. His parts now, as
   always have been, are integral to the song, but I sort of miss jams like
   the one all through "La Villa Strangiato" and even those crunching guitar
   riffs on things like, "I Think I'm Going Bald." ;)
4) As for solo trading and stuff over the net, I figure someone did a reasonable
   ASCII representation of a musical staff, so it couldn't be too hard to
   represent tab. Rhythm could be figured out independently. It would take a
   heck of a long time to type in though. Oh, well. Who knows? Just a thought.
   Anyway, to close this out here, let me say, anybody who lives in the Stanford
   area and wants to jam, feel free to e-mail me and we'll try to arrange
   something.
	Later for now.
