I know this is a weird place to ask this but...

Does anyone out there have any Smith's bootlegs.  I've been looking high
and low and can't seem to find them anywhere.  I've got good stuff (incl. lots
of Rush to trade).

Del Gordon posed an interesting question regarding sales figures of Rush
albums. Just the other day I was thumbing through a book at the local
mall, I forget the title, but the book listed all albums released in the
U.S. that had achieved gold or platinum status. I can't remember what
these reflected as far as sales, I think that in the U.S. gold means
sales of 1 million copies and platinum means 2 million.. correct me if I
am wrong...maybe gold means 500,000 copies and platinum means 1 mill?
Anyway, this book did not give an actual number of records sold, just if
the album had achieved gold or platinum. ALL Rush albums beginning with
and including 2112 have achieved at least gold status, and about half
of those went platinum. Not bad for a band that gets very little radio
airplay and only one (I think) Top-40 hit. All three live albums also
went gold too.

As far as I know, New World Man had been the only Rush Top-40 hit.
I don't listen to American Top 40, but has any song from Presto,
maybe The Pass, made the Top 40???

Another question for you geography buffs? Where the heck is Beamsville??
Many songs on both Fly By NIght and CoS were either entirely written or
partially written there while Rush was touring. Must be a very thought
inspiring place for Neil. Maybe in the Midwest or Canada? Inquiring
minds want to know. Thanks.

Cheers....

Several people mentioned the Rush vs Zeppelin radio airplay.  A possible
reason for this can be the fact that Zeppelin broke up 10 years ago.  This
adds to their legend status.  Also, one of their members is dead.  RUSH is
still together.  Therefore, they don't have the mystical attraction that
Zeppelin does.

    In yesterday's Digest, Scott Kisting asked about the level of RUSH
    airplay in Chicago. Up here at the Univ. Of Illinois's Chicago campus,
    we get great reception from every station in the area. Unfortunately,
    the only station up here that I've ever heard play RUSH is WLUP,
    affectionately known as "The Loop" 97.9FM. I'm sorry to say that even
    on The Loop, RUSH isn't played very often at all. Chicago has 4 thriving
    "classic rock" station on the FM, and these stations sadly spend much of
    their time recycling tunes by The Beatles, The Who, etc... So I count
    myself among those who bring their tapes/CD's around with them. I did
    have a happy encounter with a Wisconsin station that played a block of
    RUSH when I randomly tuned in. I was with the girlfriend, skiing with other
    friends in Lake Geneva, and it made my vacation complete. "Lazer 102" is
    the station, I believe. Anywho, happy RUSHing to all, and have oodles of
    fun down there in Country Club Campus, Scott!

I too am stuck here at the University of Illinois, but, in response
to your question about Chicago radio/RUSH/ and WCKG, I have, in fact
heard them play RUSH on more than one occasion, and I don't even listen
to the radio all that much.  As a matter of fact, they accidentally
played the same song (I think it was "Spirit of Radio", but that's not
important to this story) twice in one day (something they promise never
to do, or else they will pay $105 if you catch them), but I was in the
car at the time, so I couldn't collect.

Actually, some friends of mine in a local band down here that does RUSH
covers (they did ALL of _Moving Pictures_ in their last concert!!)
likes WCKG for the specific reason that they do play RUSH more than most.

Subject: Battlescar and Chronicles

Hello All!

This is my first posting of the semester and I'd like to say that
it is great to be back! Now on to the comments-

My first question is:

Does anybody have the lyrics to "Battlescar?" This is obviously a song
that Rush did with Max Webster in the early eighties. I have heard the
song and am curious about the lyrics. I know that Pye Dubois has written
lyrics for Max Webster as well as with Neil (Tom Sawyer, Force Ten , etc).
I'm not really sure who wrote the lyrics to Battlescar, but I am still
curious about them. So if anybody has the lyrics please mail them to me
or post them- it would be greatly appreciated!

I do have one comment on Chronicles. This is not really a "Rush"
album. It's more of a marketing ploy. If you notice by  looking at
the booklet, the band evidently had nothing to do with it. No where
on the CD do I find any credits given to the band such as song selection
and the like. I am comparing this album to Archives, which was another
marketing ploy. On the other hand the release of this Cd set does have
some advantages. For those casual listeners who have only got into the
last couple of albums, this set would show them the depth that the band
has, and might spur further interest. Also the album contains the two
live songs that were left off ESL and ATWAS. This is only small consolation
and a cheesy marketing move to get us faithful listeners to buy the set.

Anyway that's all I have to say and remember-

Never turn your back on a monster!

I'm very sorry to have to post non-Rush material to the list, but
one of the readers needed some info from me, but I lost his address.

[ There's no problem with posting this sort of information here - he's
  tangentially related to RUSH, via Max Webster/Universal Juveniles.

I might as well add something Rush Related...  I won a CD copy
of Chronicles from the local radio station...  This thing is excellent
if for nothing else but the live version of 'Passage to Bangkok'..
I haven't heard it in years since I got a CD player and my 'Exit...'
vinyl was retired.

Has anyone found any Rush symbols on the 'Hold Your Fire' inside
picture?? (besides the obvious ones like the fire hydrant).  I
noticed the clock shows 9:12, and since it's dark out, this would
be written as 21:12 in military time...
