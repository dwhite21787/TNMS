About the NMS "star" shirts - count me in. I kinda thought it'd be
appropriate if they were _red_ shirts with black star & text. Is
that do-able? (aqua, fuchia, etc. colors don't fit my primary color
lifestyle :)  How about the "rush@syrinx.umd.edu" down the sleeves
if we get sweats or baseball shirts done?  Comments, Meg?

2nd - am I naive, or did I sleep thru sex-ed? I just recently
realized that the "rhythm method" is a form of contraception.
How long have you all known this without telling me?? :(
should this be in the FAQL or the "song list"?

Subject: Neil Peart gay?
Date: Wed, 18 Nov 92 18:11:11 CST

Why all the self-righteous aspersion casting on those
pour souls who would find it somewhat interesting
if Neil Peart were  gay?  That Peart is in fact
gay, we have no real evidence for thinking (most have
recognized this); and even if we did we would
have no reason to think that his homosexuality is a bad thing.
None of which commits us to denying that Peart's possible homosexuality
is *interesting*.  The admission that such a fact is interesting does not
entail that homosexuality is somehow the defining fact about Neil Peart
or that it is the key which unlocks the door standing between us and
the true meaning or inspiration of his lyrics.
I repeat, the evidence presented so far for Peart's being gay is
slight.  I think it's much more likely that, in the phrase of a
previous contributor, Peart is as straight as one of Alex's
E-strings.  But spare us the litany of "Who cares if Peart is gay?"
Of course we care, a little bit anyway.  This doesn't mean we
should invade his privacy or do whatever else it takes to find
out.  I don't think it would be inconsistent for Peart himself
to hold the views 1) "Information about my sexuality is available
on a need-to-know basis, and not a single reader of the NMS needs
to know"; 2) "But if somehow, maybe through a slip on my part, an NMS
reader found out that I was gay (assuming I was gay), he would be
entitled to find that a little bit interesting, although he would
be silly if he used that fact, say,  as the basis for an entire theory about
my lyrics."
We don't have good evidence for believing that Peart is gay; indeed
most evidence points in the opposite direction.  But, if someone really did
have good evidence for Peart's being gay, it would be much more natural to
think "Hmm ... that's interesting" rather than indignantly repeat a mantra,
"I don't care ... I don't care ... I don't care."

  I just joined this list the other day, and I am amazed (disgusted,
  perhaps) at how much attention is given to the Peart/Gay bar issue.

  How much more must I scroll off the screen?

  I guess I look at it in this respect -- I still listen to Pete

Hiya fellow NMSers

	To start things off...Bury the meaning-of-Xanadu stuff, or
at least take it to Email!!  Also, enough about "Neil is gay; Neil
is not gay"...who cares??  He could be vegisexual for all I care,
and it wouldn't bother me in the slightest.  He's an incredible
drummer/songwriter, and that's how people should see him.

	Now onto something that hasn't been rehashed a million times.

	NMS CDs; GREAT idea!!  You could put stuff like "Take Off" and
the such on it.  But hey, regardless of what'd be on it, I'd buy it
just to have a new Rush-related item!

	NMS Tshirts; another great idea!  I'd buy at least 3 (great
Xmas gifts :) ).  Tho I do have a question: whatever happened to
the original NMS shirt idea?  You know, the Tabloid idea?  I thought
that was such a cool idea!  But hey again, I'd buy a shirt regardless
what was on it too :).

	Well, enough from me.  Long live the NMS!

First... I know you this isn't in your signature anymore Mike, but am I the

Sorry... I just had to point this out, eh...

Also.. Nick actually (gasp) responded to one of my posts....  The face in
the guy's shoulder is on Hemispheres and ATWAS, not ESL (probably just a
mistake, since there's no nude guy on ESL...)  Anyway, I don't think I really
_can_ be any more specific than that... I guess it just looks, umm, kinda like
a face is trying to push its way through from the other side (?)...  Well,
can anyone back me up with this??

Subject: shirt quote

I like Meg's idea for the quote on the shirt. Especially if we add the line
*after* "...says the National Midnight Star..."! And I'll add my voice to those
asking that we be spared any further posts concerning Neil's sexual
orientation. They're pointless. Plus, living in Colorado I heard enough of that
bullshit *before* the election.

Finally, I would only be interested in the TNMS CD if it was rare stuff.
Personally, I want the return of the live version of "Vital Signs" from the
???? EP(something from the _Signals_ era, though I can't remember which). For
me the CD would be worth it for that alone.

Ahh, well. Back to writing my *&^!@#@! thesis.

Rushians,

Listening to RTB earlier this evening, I noticed something *very* peculiar
in
the graphics on the back cover of the booklet (you know, the cool
wishbone-over
water thing)...

If you rotate the booklet's picture such that the bottom of the picture is
now
on the right (counterclockwise), and look at the clouds at the (now side)
(but
the former) top of the picture, there is a mass of darker clouds that can
be
percieved (sp?) as a hand and thumb hitching a ride/ thumbing a ride...

Let me know what you think.

Dear Rush fans,

I agree and would like to pose the question, what does it mean?
My personal opinion is that it represents hitchhiking though lives and
"Rolling the Bones" as the song suggests.

Hola!

Hey I think the T-shirt idea is a great one and support it all the
way.  I also like the TNMS CD idea.  I agree with whoever said that
live stuff is ok if it's unusual or really rare, but I'd prefer the
non-live rare stuff more (ex.-Battlescar, Pieces of Eight, Not Fade
Away/You Can't Fight It, etc.).  I, like most of you, already own
cassette copies of this stuff, but would be more than willing to
shell out the usual CD price $12-$15ish for it all on CD.

That's all---

For the guy who asked about how Neil is playing the solo.

It seems kind of odd that you couldn't pick up how he was playing it
if you were watching the video.  The horn flares are triggered by
synth pads that he has on his right and left side (you can see him hit
them) and the same with the xylophone-like parts, he has a synth pad
with several seperate pads that he uses.  Wood blocks: he hits the
same wood blocks as in Xanadu.  I think that's about it.  If you watch
the video more closely you can pick out everything.

A few words:
	No more about Neil
	TAKE XANADU TALK TO EMIAL YOU COPULANT BASTARDS!!!
	T-shirt is excellent idea
	CD is great idea...watch for legalities

I heard that Rush tapes all of their sound-checks and that mostly they
just jam.  Them I read that Geddy came up with the bass line for "Turn
the Page" in one of those jams.  If so, someone has to have these jams
on tape.  If "Turn the Page" is any indication of what it sounds
like... I need to get them in a bad way!

Peace, y'all.

Subject: Wave Permanence

Greetings Rushfans!

Drop yer jaw, I am NOT going to talk about Xanadu... (guess I shot my Xanadu
wad)   Instead I'll cover what I feel is an equally pressing matter.

I think the NMS is great, but I have one major complaint.

When my issue arrives, I hurriedly tear away the protective plastic wrapper,
admire the glossy cover with glowing title print, and begin reading.  Yet in
dismay, I am quickly confronted by the following line:

"----------------------------------------------------------------------"

I find this line deeply disturbing.  Worse, as I venture on, I am
continually alarmed by lines such as:

"----------------------------------------------------------"

This is simply appalling!  There is _certainly_ an implied meaning here, no
doubt having to do with DEATH, like the "flat-line" of an electrocardiogram.

I cannot stand for this any more.  This straight-line approach has got to go.
So what am I suggesting?  &lt;deep breath&gt;  OK, here goes...

Hmmm.  This newsletter is about Rush, right?  And it's title came from some
P/G album, right?  Well, why let that album have all the glory.  I think
that PeW can make an equally significant contribution.  What's that?

ITS LIFE-CELEBRATING *PERMANENT WAVE*!!  That is, this thing:

       |         |         |         |         |         |         |
-------'-^-------'-^-------'-^-------'-^-------'-^-------'-^-------'-^-------

(true to the original?  Looked good with *my* font)  or perhaps this design:

_______/\  _______/\  _______/\  _______/\  _______/\  _______/\  _______
         \/         \/         \/         \/         \/         \/

(AARRGGHH! Can someone come up with a decent character-combination for this??)

BOTTOM LINE:  I vote that rush-mgr replace all these sickeningly-dead flat
lines with a newly designed permanent-wave-systolic-type-of-line.  IMO, not
only would it be an embellishment, adding further "Rush-feel" to the Star,
but it would be a tribute to an equally worthy album.  We can't be favoritists
here...  plus ya know, P/G was starting to grow a wee bit too smug.

So whaddaya'll say?

Flat-line supporter's flames won't make it out of the most shallow of graves.

P.S. - About getting the best concert tickets:  a story:  Megadeth is coming
  to Dallas next month.  Mein froind and I wanted to go with 4 other guys, so
  we went to the Sears ticket counter shortly before sale time.  After waiting
  in a short line we asked for 6 tix in a block and they told us they could
  only give us 4 and 2, which was OK I guess.  But get this: the 4 were in
  row G, and the 2 were in row K, 4 rows back!  What a drag!  My friend and I
  kinda bummed.  If the 2 seats were the closer ones, that would make a little
  bit more sense, but this seemed pretty dern weird!  Oh well...  See ya!

Subject: CD NMS Boot

Let's get this project off the ground!

Step 1:  compilation
rare tracks that not many people have ( a+B sides of 1st single, any demos
people may have [highly unlikely], figures of eight, Battle scar, etc.).
Then, songs that are rarely played live, or live versions that are
significantly different [such as the stripped doen versions of Big Money and
Territories [?] that were plaeyed on the pre-PoW tour Flotida dates.  Aldo,
Bad Boy and other songs only played on early dates.  By compiling a 'rarest-
of-the-rare,' we could fill the 74 minute max. on a CD easily.\

The rush-mgr. could (should) compile a list of songs; those people w/ the
best copies available (those who know what generation their copies are--
chances are if you don't, they are binferior copies) should send email to the
rush mgr. or whoever choses to head this.

Step 2: mastering
Copies should be sent to the person who has access to a DAT deck (if worse
comes to worse, contact me through email if no one can--I may be able to).

Copie ofsource material should be sent, taped on a preferable a metal tape, w/
 a decent recording level [no boombox copies!] w/ no dolby to the person who
is mastering.

Person who masters this should transfer these "analogue masters" directly to
DAT, inserting track end/begin codes, etc [I have no idea how to do this, but
I've heard it's really easy}

Step 3:pressing
This is the trickey part.  They compiled DAT would have to be sent to a CD
plant, probably overseas (i've heard that some in Korea, germany, and Italy
are pretty loose w/ copyright laws).  the money would have to be given
upfron; this may require a pre-collection of monies from interested NMS
subscribers.

once the CDs are pressed (of course, a massive time lag will probably ensue),
the person in charge of the mastering should receive all pressings of the CD
and mail them out to those who paid.

This is just a preliminary outline; I sincerely hope that this doesn't fall
apart and just become a topic of conversation likethe NMS convention did.

If anyone out there knos remotely how to do this, don't be afraid to take
charge!

Greets folks. The voice is Subdivisions (if memory serves) is Neil on the
album, Alex live. Superconductor, no idea.
And HEY! Number of Zs, The Body Electric has 1-0-0-1-0-0-1. This is binary,
even though Ged sings one zero zero etc. I could *say* it one nought nought
so ner. The actual lyric sheet leaves this undefined. Besides that, I was
just spoofing the wildly trivial stuff you tend to get talked about when
nothing Really Big e.g. a Rush album, is about to happen. It's great fun,
for sure, but some weird ideas come to light (I can talk, eh ;-) )
And in ref. to banana story Jeremy (cheers for the mention BTW) - ged's nose
doesn't fit into the story stoooopid, it's too big and bananas don't have
noses! It's all a PR trick! :-)
Can I just say I think that Neil would kill himself laughing at the sheer
amount of *text* that has written (interesting though it is) about what is
after all, about a 10 minute track. You know the one. It's kinda Coleridge
orientated recently, though guys, *nearly* running out of steam eh!
Long may go on (and on, and on).

&gt;(1st of all, Gregg, consult your dictionary on the meanings of metaphor and
&gt; simile.  For the rest of you folks, if you know this, please ignore.)

First of all, the difference between you and me is that I've been giving
_you_ the benefit of the doubt whereas you have been denying me the same
(it really is pathetic to basically call someone an idiot and then say
"peace"):
I don't need to consult a dictionary as I _know_ what the two are --
my only error was presuming your statement about poetic devices was
a _sensible_ one. The device that would plausibly make the woman or
lover here purely figurative is _metaphor_ -- that is for the woman or
lover to be _representing_ something. Your theory that construing the
woman and lover as part of a _simile_ that makes them _purely_ figurative
is simply not sensible. Coleridge uses a simile but _that_ is not
sufficient grounds to hold the woman and lover as purely figurative.

To wit,

&gt;   "A savage place! as holy and enchanted As ever beneath ... demon-lover!"
&gt;                    ^^                    ^^
&gt;was a simile.  (Note the telltale placement of subject, adjective(s), etc.)

written fully is: "A savage place! as holy and enchanted As ever beneath
a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover!"

In the most plausible reading the simile does not include the woman and
lover, and furthermore even if it _is_ taken to include the woman and
lover that is no reason to understand the woman and lover and _purely_
figurative:

The simile can be read in four ways: (i) the place as holy and
enchanted as ever, (ii) the place as holy and enchanted as ever [was]
beneath a waning moon, and (iv) the place as holy and enchanted
as ever (was haunted) beneath a waning moon by woman wailing for her
demon-lover. IMO (i) is the proper reading, as it is most tasteful:
the place was as holy and enchanted as ever, and happened to be
haunted by the woman calling for her lover. Presumably you reading is
(iv), which has the simile less tastefully consuming the entire line.
But more importantly even if (iv) _is_ the reading Coleridge intended
it is no reason to believe that the woman and lover are purely
figurative, because the very nature of this simile suggests that
the woman _is there_ calling for her lover. For example, I enter
a football stadium and say "this is as big a place as I've ever
seen." In this case I am _seeing_ a _big_ place. In either reading
there is more reason to view (at the literal level of the poem)
the woman and lover as real than there is to view them as purely
figurative. Unless of course you see the entire poem figuratively,
in which case the dome and caves are purely figurative as well
(as I mentioned before in my initial response).

BTW, I was listening to a recording of the Pensacola RtB show last
evening and I must say, Neil's bass drums in the intro were
_incredible_, truly fitting such epic scenery...

Or, lotsa weird stuff (I'll get this neural interface keyboard to work
someday....).

For the NMS shirts , how about the quote "For a change of accent... or
the colour of your shirt"? We could perhaps even use an obnoxious shade
of blue for the shirt. I just hope noone shoots us "without shame"...
(oh, I'm sorry for the bad humour).

Kurt Loder actually said "Alex Lifeson is not an interesting guitarist"?!?
Well, Ol' Kurt gives the MTV news all the appeal of a lecture on "Comparative
Geometry of the fins of the Atlantic Tuna Fish". Of course we are talking
about "Rolling Stone". I thought I could write a pretty accurate "Rolling
Stone Issue" generator program. Here's  the code for it:

latest_cool_counterculture_slop_punk_group:="NIRVANA";

if (artist = "RUSH") then bash(max_intensity);
if (artist = latest_cool_counterculture_slop_punk_group) then
   acclaim(most_inventive_group_ever);
if (artist = "MADONNA") then
   do
     sex(in_videos);
     sex(with_other_women);
     sex(pictures);
     sex(books);
   loop ad_nauseum;

I can't get it to work though, cause my compiler only supports variable names
up to 31 characters in length.  I think Rolling Stone could use this program,
and just change the first line and recompile every six months or so. It
would save them lots of money they pay to third rate music critics who
can't tell the difference between a  six-string guitar and a bass.

Oh, well.... so much for my lunatic ravings... I've got to finish  mapping
my left temporal lobe at the 9th intrerconnect level before the Thanksgiving
break. Now, where was I?

Subject: Subject: Neil & gay bars - final words?

I think it's safe to say that the general feeling here is that
this is Neil's private life, and not our concern. (I bet this
is not the only msg saying this!)

Speaking for myself (just one more opinion!), it would change
nothing, as I've never assumed anything about any band member,
beyond what I hear on their albums, and what I've seen live.

I think of a person's sexuality as something like their religion,
or politics (except these are choices). It means nothing much to me,
but may just be of minor interest if it has any impact on the thing
which *does* interest me, which in this case is Neil's lyrics.

Someone refered to a 10% gay content in their country. What % of
the NMS readership would that suggest could be gay? I won't even
accept that gays like Rush any less that staights.

On a similar note, I once read that 1 in 5 people become depressed
at some point in their life. That suggests that about 300 people
reading this are, will become, or have been depressed. If "nervous
breakdowns" are just as common, it wouldn't be so hard to believe
that Neil (or anyone else) might suffer a breakdown. To suggest
that this is a reason to "lose faith" in Rush or any individual
is pure hypocrisy! They should consider themselves well and truly
flamed.

&gt; P.S.  Would it worry you more if:
&gt;         1) Neil was dating your daughter or
&gt;         2) Neil was dating your son?

I'd worry more if someone was dating my cat. :-)))

Oh yeah, valium is also used as a painkiller. My grandmother was
given it for a hip operation. Now we'll see rumours that Neil has
a dodgy hip! :-)

   Dear N.M.S readers,

   This question goes out to all you rush merchandise collectors, and
rare rush memorabilia holders....
   Is there a video tape, that contains the scenes and videos that rush
shows during their concerts.... I mean everything on the big screen
that they play during their concerts.... Like, the cartoon segment
of the little girl growing up at jumping into the expolded picture frame
from moving pictures right before rush plays Tom Sawyer... The cartoon
segment of the magician with the cards and rabbits from presto, the vide
for Manhatten Project, The weapon, Superconductor...... all the stuff on
the big screen that they play in concert.....
       all info and postings welcome , i really would love to get it
       if it exists.....    please post it for others who might be
       interested in this info, or mail my account (pl911141@pacevm)

Subject: NMS T-shirt/CD

First off, to echo what others have said, concering Neil's sexual preference,
who cares? It's his own business. This is the NMS, not the national enquirer.

Second, an NMS cd of rare rush stuff would be great - someone should check
into the legality of it, but we can always have it done in Italy, where
we wouldn't have any problems with getting copies of bootlegs :-)

Third, I'm all for an NMS t-shirt. Suggestions for the quote:
   "Life is just the candle, and the dream must give it flame"
or..
                " Let the truth of Love be lighted
                  Let the love of Truth shine clear
                  Sensibility
                  Armed with sense and liberty
                  With the Heart and Mind united

From: Scott David Daly &lt;skipdaly@wam.umd.edu&gt;
Subject: NMS Cd, Geddy plays on another album!, etc.

Hello all!

1)About the NMS Cd idea:  I LIKE IT!

	Has anyone thought of CALLING Anthem/SRO and talking to
someone there about it?  Maybe someone could talk to Andrew
Macnaughton (he seemed to have the fans' perspective (kinda) in that
interview a while back...and he IS the keeper of the tape vault!).  I
guess this next part is a little farfetched...but if we approach this
real nice-like and explain VERY carefully that we are a SMALL group
of DEDICATED fans who are trying to put a VERY LIMITED PRESSING of a
rarities CD together for NO PROFIT (but rather just to be able to
listen to the rarities on CD), perhaps the band would not only give
their blessing, but might even contribute some stuff from the tape
vault!!??  This way, they'd at least know it would be a QUALITY CD
and not a junk representation of their old stuff!

	We'd have to be careful in calling them to make sure we come
across as a definate "FAN CLUB" ...and not just a bunch of loosers
trying to mooch off of them!  At least by calling, we can check out
how upset they'd be by the idea and perhaps save ourselves a bunch of
(legal?) hassle later!

	WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK OF THIS?  Is it at least a feasible
suggestion?  Anyone want to take responsibility for calling?  I would
be willing to call...but if there is anyone out there with a contact
of some kind (anyone who KNOWS Andrew Macnaughton or Alex Lifeson,
etc.), it might help us if YOU called!

	If this CD thing is going to fly, we've got to get ORGANIZED
on it...and I strongly recommend feeling out the band's reaction
BEFOREHAND!!

2) On a different note...I just found out about a 10 song Canadian
Indie release on cassette by Joe Mendelson where Geddy plays bass on
the whole album!  I just sent away for it today.  The guy I ordered
it from says that it says Gary Lee Weinrib in the liner notes...so
it's obvious Geddy didn't want people to know it was him!  It is
supposed to be an acoustic folksy kind of music and supposedly
features Ben Mink (of FM and Losing It fame) as well...I'll let ya'll
know more after I hear it!  Just wondering if any of ya'll had heard
of it...

3)I've seen alot of Dream Theater posts here, and I STILL haven't
heard any of their stuff yet, but I thought you guys (and gals) would
be interested in hearing that I bumped into their guitarist Monday
night at the Bayou here in D.C.!  He was handing out flyers at the
door before the Asia show...I only talked to him for a minute or so,
but he was pretty cool.  I told him that I'd heard alot about them,
and to hang in there, cause their name was definately getting around!

	By the way, the Asia gig was pretty good...with all due
respect to Alex, Steve Howe has got to be the BEST guitarist I've
ever (personally) seen!  He's even better when you're two feet away
and at a free concert...

Subject: A suggestion on the rarities collection
Date: Thu, 19 Nov 92 16:27:48 EST

While I'm all for a disc full of rarities, wouldn't it be cheaper to
make the master on a DAT, and then distribute high-quality second- and
third- generation copies duplicated from that master?  You'd lose some
sound quality and the "neatness" of the CD format, but it would be easier,
IMHO.  And in any case it would still be an NMS production.  :-)

Subject: One last tidbit on Neil being gay
Date: Thu, 19 Nov 92 16:49:25 -0500
From: David Arnold &lt;davida&gt;

I just thought it was interesting that the only two posts reporting
"positive evidence" of Neil being gay *came from the same sight*?

I would guess that:

  Eric Krauss (krauss@ac.grin.edu)
    and
  14A2C28C &lt;DFB3B0BE&gt;

are playing a little game at our expense.

  [ Also Gordon, James A. &lt;gordon@ac.grin.edu&gt; contributed the story about
    valium and sex-changed ladies.. 				: rush-mgr ]

Interesting how one statement of "anybody else got any rush encounters to
tell?" elicit only one supporting response, FROM THE SAME SITE?  This list
reaches over 1400 people; interesting how nobody but these two people can
support each others' statements.

Nice try guys, but notice all the responses are "who cares, it's his life
to live as he wants" ?  It would seem that Rush fans are not too impressed
(or turned off) by the sexual orientation of the band members.  I'm proud
of the responses from non-ac.grin.edu folks!

Try it in rec.music.misc guys, you'll get more of the response you're
looking for.  They're known for flaming without thinking there.

Have a day.
David

Thursday, November 19, 1992  5:14pm

I don't know if many of you guys are Tom Robbins (not to be confused with
Anthony Robbins, the self-motivation guy) fans or not, but I thought I'd
give you an interesting snippet of information.  In his book, _Skinny Legs
and All_ there is a word of praise from our favorite drummer and lyricist,
Neil Peart!

	"Writing that is funny, sexy, imaginative and playful, yet
	 has an underlying texture both beautiful and profound."
				Neil Peart, lyricist, Rush

My husband discovered this quote upon his completion of the book, and I read
it soon after he did.  Cool, huh?  Neil's evaluation of the book is right on
target, too.  It is fabulous, and I recommend it for all to read.  Robbins
has an authentic writing style, unlike anyone else I've ever read.  He isn't
afraid of offending anybody either!  He is the king of original metaphors.

Later!

Hi Folks
	Just a few things:
1) Would it be possible to determine what the royalties would be and
    include them in the price of the CD....Then send a check to SRO
    Management to divvy up?  Or maybe get the band's consent to
    donate the fee to charity?
2) Anyone knowing what Aimee Mann's / 'til tuesday's future plans are,
    please e-mail me....I hope they don't start putting out one album
    every six or seven years like another band out of BOSTON. ;&gt;
3) Does anyone remember a gum called Chu-Bops? It was bubblre,oops
    bubble gum shaped like an album, that came in a reproduction of
    an album cover (about 3X3 inches) Does anyone else still have their
    "copy" of Permanent Waves?  Does anyone remember if MP was ever
    "released" in this "format"?  Wonder what this thing is worth...
    still has the shrink wrap on it :)
