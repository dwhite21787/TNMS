	Listen fellas,
		I know every one of you, no matter what you say,
would love it if Rush published a book with the 'official' meanings
of every song that they have written and performed.  That way, you
could mosey into your local bookstore, pick up the book, find your
favorite song and tear the page out, drop the book and leave.  Well,
you can forget it.  If Neil were to sit here and spoon-feed symbolism
to you, you would appreciate the quality of the lyrics much much
less, I assure you.  Although it I agree that it would be cool to
know what exactly the band was thinking when they wrote the songs,
you people simply can't crucify Neil for being a little fed up.  I
mean, twenty years of the same questions for new fans would piss  me
off too.  (Sorry if this came off like a flame)

	p.s.  if anyone has ANY info for ANY boots from the 2112
tour, PLEASE write me, so I can, uh, promptly arrest you and
confiscate the boots. :)

I haven't noticed any other posts about this, but here goes.
I was partying with some friends, and they were playing Bare Naked Ladies
'Grade Nine', or whatever its called, and in the middle comes a
thundering clip from Tom Sawyer!  A bit later, there is a small chunk of Spirit
of Radio, and an even smaller bit of La Villa Strangiato and one more at the
very end that I can't recognize (I wish I had my tapes with me!)

Has anyone else heard this?  Unfortunately, the people I were with didn't seem
to appreciate the significance of this, and were actually surprised that those
pieces were from another group.  Sigh.

     Hello to everyone in computerland!!!   I've only had a computer account
for a short time and I have greatly been enjoying NMS!!  I am very interested
in finding out how to use GIF files.  All this talk of digitized RUSH photos
has gotten me quite enthralled with the idea.  I have no idea as to how I
would go about using GIF files in General.  Anyone who can send me any info
to get me started with them so that I may call up some of these 'real keen'
files would be doing me a great service.  It seems as though the UNIX
operating system is about as user friendly as a locked door with no keyhole.
(sorry for the poor attempt at a metaphor).  Thanks a lot!!!

Subject: Sign of Eth

I replied on this, but maybe it didn't get through.  When I heard this, I
looked it up in a dictionary so that I could try to find out who By-Tor was.
This was about 12 years ago, so I'm not guaranteeing acuracy.
	Eth (AKA edh - look them both up for more info...) is an older
designation for the 'th' sound.  I seem to remember reading that Edh was the
symbol of a god which was used as a battle standard way-way-back-when.
Therefore the 'sign of eth' rising in the air is a battle standard to rally
'round.

Subject: Who DAT?

Hi all,

	I just thought I'd comment on a few things from yesterday's issue.  You
can all stop worrying about albums ever being mastered on dcc or MD, since these
formats are basically crud compared to DAT, ADAT, CD, or any of the others 
which are currently used.  On the other hand, don't go off and buy yourself a 
DAT deck unless you're willing to spend a fortune on making your own high 
quality boots(or master your own band. . .).  There are several reasons why 
DAT will never reach the price level of the other formats.  For one thing, the 
mechanics of the system are too expensive to produce.  There is a point at 
which they can't lower production costs any more and the price level gets 
stuck.  They have pretty much conceded the death of DAT as a consumer format 
and are concentrating on marketing it to the professional sound industry, 
where they can get away withthe high price level.  Don't worry, we've got 
until the fall to choose a favorite format before we have to buy the next Rush 
album!
	And about vinyl sounding better than CD, you can't beat a good record
on a good system. . .the first couple of times you play it.  Of course, each
time that needle scrapes away at the recording information, whereas a CD has a
rather lengthy lifespan.  Everything electronic will be obsolete in 5 years
anyway, so let's all move to a cave and sing Rush songs to each other while
foraging for food.

Hey all.  It has been a long time since my last post (sounds like
a confessional).  I think that it is great that a Dream Theater list
is being set up.  They are a good band who should become very popular.
I was wondering what the status of the new album is thus far.  Anyone
know?  Another thing, do you think that I should tell my friend to
piss off because I won't change my message on my answering machine.
It says, " Hi this Alex Lifeson of Rush and this is Geddy Lee of
Rush."  I taped their voices off of Rockline or In The Studio.  One
of those two.  I like it.  Finally, (unrelated to rush) are there
any Phi Tau's reading this list?  Or, if any of you know any Phi
Tau's addresses, could you give them to me.  Thanks a lot.

Subject: Caress of Steel Tour...the unknown?

	Why is the Caress of Steel tour such a mystery? On the boot
list, or in the complete Rush tour listing, or anywhere for that
matter, there is no information on the CoS tour. I know it was a failure,
and in Visions it says the band called it the "Down the Tubes" tour,
so it probably didn't last too long, but they still must have played
at least a couple dozen shows...somebody must know where they were, even
for a couple nights of the tour...did any NMS readers go to a CoS
show? The FBN tour is well documented, and so is the 2112 tour..dates
are known, and boots exist...but neither existed for the CoS tour.
Is this tour just wiped out of history....George Orwell couldn't have
done better with this '1984'-style erasing of history :-)

  [ If you check with the tour list, it says that only 40 shows were played
    over the course of 3 and a half months. I also remember reading that most 
    were in the MIDWEST area, although no exact places.  	 : rush-mgr ]

Does anyone know anything about the CoS tour...this mystery has been
bugging me since I first got into Rush!

Subject: My supposed statement

I gotta think of a new way to say hello,

I just read that one of my (supposed) friends [ :) ] at Iowa State, Bing,
has said that I said that Rush did their own sound at the shows. Hmmm,
well, I just can't seem to remember what I was talking about, so suspend
your flames until I find out what I was referring to! Uh... unless I'm
correct, then you may compliment me all you want!!! BTW on the 4th issue,
Bing told me that his MOM was a fourth member for the Show of Hands tour.
She actually played drums. Neil was only FAKING his drum lines. He was
having a real bout with that bone cancer of his, and she filled in for
him!!!!! :) I heard this from the Dali Llama, or whoever took that
picture for the GUP album, (or was it Itzhak Perlman?) :) Take that, Bing. Oh
ya, for all you guys starting the DT newsgroup, I thought of a good name
for it. How about "I DREAM of a good band"?? HeHeHe. No offense intended,
none taken I hope. I'm not flaming here, just playing around! On the
question yesterday about the 2112 banner. I've got one, and so so about 3
of my friends. We all got them in the Midwest. Mine in KC and the others
were in Omaha and Minneapolis, I think. But mine was from some kinda
banner stand in the middle of a mall in KC!!! I was amazed. It only cost
me about 10 bucks I think. BTW it looks cool if you get some of that glow
in the dark paint, and outline the entire star, man and 2112 logo with a
thin line of it. I did this and put it on my wall. Way cool. I think I've
said enough stupid stuff for today.

I suppose it's time to fess up...

Gregg Jaeger writes:
&gt; If I recall correctly, the comment "That was fifteen years ago -- get a
&gt; life" which has been attributed to Neil as a response to a question
&gt; about the meaning of some fifteen-year-old lyrics, was someone's
&gt; _attempt_ to recall the _actual_ comment Neil made...

I've been reading the lengthy discussion centering on Neil's
"fifteen years ago!" response to an interview question about "the
inspiration of the Fountains of Lamneth" with some chagrin and
discomfort, since that particular interview question happened to
be one which I proposed to the interviewer.  (Actually, I believe
I added "only ask this if he seems to be in a *really* forthcoming
mood".  So much for that idea.  B-)

Anyway, when I saw that it had been asked and read Neil's
response to it, I have to admit that I was more than a little
shook and embarrassed.  I felt like I had been slapped down by
someone for whom I had a great deal of respect, and to this day I
regret having proposed that question.  I also have to admit it
has slightly affected my perception of Mr. Peart, in that as much
as I love the band's music, I would not care to meet the guy
anymore.  In fact I wouldn't want to meet Geddy or Alex either,
for fear of being similarly upbraided for saying something they
might perceive as stupid or irrelevant.

By the way, although I don't have the interview online at the
moment, I approximately recall the wording of his response to
have been this: "Oh, come on!  That was fifteen years ago!"
There was no "get a life", at least; that would have really
stung, particularly since I like to think I do have a life of
sorts.  B-/

&gt; ...................................... It is hardly rude in itself
&gt; simply to decline comment on something written fifteen years ago.

I've never understood what the time frame has to do with it.
It's fine if someone doesn't care to explain their lyrics... a
response along the lines of "it was inspired by whatever you
think it was inspired by", or even a simple "I don't remember
anymore", would have been great.  But just because something is
fifteen years old doesn't mean that it loses it's worth in the
ears of a listener.  Whereas to me the actual response sounded
like Neil was virtually saying "I can't believe you're still
listening to that old crap!", rather than being flattered that
someone still found much of the old music worthy of continued
appreciation.

(As a final note, about three other questions of mine also were
posed to Mr. Peart in the same interview, and a couple of them
did get reasonably nice responses, which at least made me feel a
bit better about my contribution to the interview as a whole.)

Subject: Re: The Sign of Eth

   I remember looking up "eth" in the dictionary after I found my
brother's FBN album in '74 or '75. In fact, I looked up a LOT of words
from that album back then. :D  From American Heritage:

eth   n.  Variant of edh.

edh   n.  1. A letter appearling in Old English, Old Saxon, Old Norse, and
modern Icelandic to represent an interdental fricative.  2. The symbol in
the International Phonetic Alphabet representing the interdental voiced
fricative, as in /the/, /with/.

An edh looks like:     \_--~\
                           \
                        -~~-
                       /    \
                       {     }
                        \   /
                         ~-~
Well, sorta. Like a lower-case "o" with a wavy propellor. What symbolism
an edh has in By-Tor's tale, I have no idea.

     In yesterday's NMS, I had referred to the "cubsfan's" previous posting

I accidently misquoted him as saying that Neil was only an entertainer, which

this grave and irresponsible reference to his ideas.  However, I do not take
back the spirit of my argument, which still remains in disagreement with his.

So hey, everyone. This is not my first post to TNMS.

For those wondering about the set list of the Rush laser show now
playing in Cincinnati, it is (or at least was as of Feb. 13):

Cygnus X-1 (spoken intro only)
Fly By Night
2112 (Overture/Temples of Syrinx)
The Trees (cool laser animation with this one!)
Closer to the Heart
Tom Sawyer
Subdivisions
Distant Early Warning
Time Stand Still
Presto
(encore:) The Spirit of Radio

The show is one hour and is well worth the six bucks. 
Info: (513) 345-8505. 
Tickets: (513) 749-4949.

And now for something completely different.

I must say I couldn't remember ever having a Rush dream - until
this ridiculous thread got going. The other night I dreamed I
went to a Rush concert, and there were *five* people in the band.
Not only that, but Geddy was the only one of our heroes still in
it. (Presumably Alex died of excessive belching, and Neil became
so disgusted with people asking him what "Lamneth" means, he quit
to become a corps drummer.)

So stop it, you people. (And OK, now I will too.)

Subject: Tour dates listing

Hi there!

	It seems in this lull between albums and tours everyone
starts grasping for Rush related topics to argue (discuss?)
about...this can be tedious and many times annoying to some of us
readers (SOME of you people really should work for The Enquirer).
Anyway, the idea presented yesterday for everyone to help out with
making the tour dates listing even more updated, more accurate, and
all around better sounds like a damn good one to me!

	I find this listing to be an invaluable aid as a cross
reference in collecting tapes and even if you don't do that, it's
cool just to browse through for curiosity's sake.  Someone mentioned
yesterday about the St. Louis 2/14/80 or 3/16/80 confusion...well,
that particular error has made me wonder quite a bit!  It seems there
are 2 bootleg lPs out there (Xanadu and The Temples of Syrinx) and
now a couple bootleg cds (La Villa Strangiato and The Spirit Of St.
Louis) that are all copies of the same show , but ALL OF THEM LIST
DIFFERENT DATES!!!  It has GOT to be either 2/14/80 or
3/16/80...Jimmy's list has those two dates on it...the question is :
which one!?

  [ The 3/16/80 show is most likely wrong.  I think it was a bootlegger's 
    mistake that has perpetuated into the list. If you look at the show the 
    day before, they were in San Francisco, and three days later in 
    Washington??  I don't think that date is correct.  The change will be 
    made.						:rush-mgr ]

	Since nobody seems to have anything better to do than argue
(endlessly) about what Neil owes us or Rush's new horn section, maybe
we could all pitch in and help Jimmy out with his list!  It would
benefit all of us as a reference.   Perhaps someone could talk to
Anthem about getting tour schedules...if we told them it was for a
kind of fan club and we kept a listing, they MIGHT be willing to help
us out.   Also, talk to anyone you know that saw RUSH and try to get
the date/venue/city of the show!

	I just thought this might be a semi-CONSTRUCTIVE thing to do
(great...now I sound like Mr. Rogers.).

	Anyway, thanks to Jimmy for all the hard work in keeping the
tour dates list going (once again...it's been an AWESOME
REFERENCE...it's AMAZING how people can screw up show dates,

Subject: Permanent Waves cover

Ron Wiseman noted that the Anthem release of _Permanent Waves_ had the Freewill
lyrics printed correctly, and asked about any other differences between
the Mercury release and others.  I don't have "Visions" with me, but if I
remember correctly, there are several differences among the cover.  In
addition to the well-known missing headline, the billboards and signs are
different in the background.  The American Mercury release show billboards
with the guys names on them (Peart written similar to the Coca-Cola wave (tm)
and such), but other countries releases have actual advertisement names on the
signs.  Am I remembering this correctly? I don't know, but I am sure there
are those who can verify or correct this, so please do.  As far as I know,
the cover was changed in these respects because of problems with U.S.
trademark laws and not having permissions to use some trademarks.

Subject:      Re: The Sign of Eth

Hopefully I can shed some light on the meaning of "the Sign of Eth"...
    "Eth" is a letter in the Old English alphabet that was dropped from
the alphabet as it evolved into Middle and Modern English.  It repre-
sented the sound /th/, as in "cloth" for example.  It looked like a lower-
case "o" with a cross on top. Capitalized, it was like a "D" with a horiz-
ontal line through the straight part.  This was also the symbol used for
a capitalized "Thorn", another Old English letter representing /th/.
    "Thorn" was adapted into the Old English alphabet from a Germanic rune
of the same name.  The rune, in its turn, was associated with the Gothic
(as in the tribe of the Goths, not cathedrals) word "thurisaz", which meant
"demon".
    So "Eth" itself has some historical background in representing demons
and hell, obviously appropriate in the context of the song.  I suppose
I see "The sign of Eth is rising in the air..." in two ways: first, that it
represents simply the demonic power in the Tobes of Hades, and secondly,
that it represents By-Tor himself and that when the sign is, rising, By-Tor
is coming forth from Hades to do battle with the Snow Dog (don't we  assume
usually that Hades is underground?  By-Tor would have to rise to get out of
there to most anyplace?)
    Just my thoughts.  Maybe it's a coincidence.

I agree with Mr. Davis, in that Rush SHOULD have a rockumentary,
although I'll chew on my shoelaces for an hour if MTV ever actually
does one.
  Even if we do send them a lot of letters.  It would take a huge
amount of letters to get that done, and someone would most definitely
have to spearhead that effort.  I might be interested in it if we feel
MTV is worthy of our attention, and you guys are interested.  Enough
said...more later.
