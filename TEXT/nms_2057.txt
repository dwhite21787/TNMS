Well, the NMS site is back up. The mp3's are gone, as well as the RV 
full-length videos. All the other RV files should still be there.

And I can tell you definitively that on the new live album: Disc 2, Track 1
is "Test For Echo".

Umm....let's see..."Without You" could give a beginning drummer problems.
 ;)

No, really though...there's his drum solo on 'LIVE: Right here, right
now', there's "Pleasure Dome" from the F.U.C.K. album (hey, that's the
acronym, folks...and that's how Eddie refers to it, plus it's just easier
to type...), umm..."I'm The One" (unless you happen to own a double-bass
peddle  ;) ) (YOU try playin' that puppy with one foot...Neil might be
the only person on the face of the earth who could actually play that
thing with only one foot...)

That's about all I can come with.  That's embarrassing.  Roger Taylor has
more difficult stuff than that, and *he* doesn't steal drum solos!!  :)

<<While it is true that, in 1976, Queen were already established pioneers
in the art of multi-tracking>>

Anyone who doesn't believe that should check out their 1975 album (and
probably the most popular) 'A Night At The Opera'.  On top of Brian May's
*fantastic* guitar harmonies, multi-layered vocals abound in this album
(particularly the acapella section of "The Prophet Song"), sometimes with
mind-blowing spectacualrity (is that a word?  ;) ).  This isn't an album
that you can adjust the balance and have an instant-intrumental...you
*always* have vocals coming out of BOTH speakers, and the vocals coming
out of one speaker are oftentimes *completely* different than the vocals
coming out of the other.  While not exactly the all-time most
musically-complex album, this should be checked out by *anyone* who can
appreciate multi-tracking (or even wants to hear just how complex you can
get with it...)

Subject: Flamewars, anyone?

Guys, I don't know how much my opinion matters, but...do you suppose we
could STOP FIGHTING and maybe try for a bit of PEACE for once???  I'm
starting to get REALLY sick of unsubscribing from lists about my favorite
bands just because people simply can't stay on topic and talk about THE
BAND, *NOT* themselves.  Is it too much to ask that, even though we're in
the midst of legal troubles, we stop fighting with eachother?  I've left
the Van Halen Mailing List (the offical list) because of huge flamewars,
and I've left People of the SouthWind (the Kansas mailing list to which
at least one member of the band *was* subscribed, until *he* left because
of flamewars, and then about half the list followed).  Please, stop
fighting, everyone, so I don't have to add NMS to the list.  I love
Queen, but I don't want the Queen Mail Server to be my *only* mailing
list I subscribe to...

Thank you, if anyone actually listened...

Subject: To The Fire That Lit itself...

Not sure where Doug get's his figures (70/30 in favor of  his original
emotionally negative multi-faceted post about the egotism, laziness and
arrogance of RUSH fans) but I think that the main idea(s) of his original
post (nothing like the points made in the last issue of TNMS) that I last
addressed  was (were):

1) RUSH as a band is in danger of declining in popularity and this is
partially due to, if not mainly attributed to, their play on Radio.

2) That we as RUSH fans don't do enough to support the band in the fast
paced highly competitive super-media markets of today.

Now it seems, past offenses are in attempt of being smoothed over by a
"requalifying" post (which didn't even mention the original statements, but
tried to back them up.

Really, I could not care less normally, but so many people are so worried
about whether or not RUSH gets enough radio play and I think that no matter
where you live (save a few precious exceptions, Seattle, San Antonio) we
would all like to hear more RUSH on the Radio that we hear now, but you
can't force taste on the mindless massive media machine or the masses that
it serves. I understand that Doug is somehow involved in radio, and can see
how they could permeate the airwaves as well as they used to, and I think
we all agree...but they are not as hungry to promote, just as we are (most
of us) a few years older and have better things to do than argue with some
dj about why WE think they should play RUSH instead of BUSH this time
around. I also think (MHO) that more than ever before the band knows they
can continue their career on their terms (still) and enjoy success making
music they can be proud of...and even rest on their laurels with one of the
most devoted fan bases ever. Radio did alot for RUSH in the earlier days,
but I doubt if they want to keep up pace with all the new band's and their
desire to be over-promoted into the limelight....living or dying via mass
radio/mtv exposure. What would they truly have to gain?

So if the questions are....

A) Do I think that RUSH deserves to be in the hall of fame?
my answer=YES

B) Would I be pissed if it didn't happen?
I'd be disappointed for the band, 'cause they deserve every bit of
recognition they get, but it would kinda be like Jethro Tull beating
Metallica out at the Grammy's for the first ever heavy metal
grammy...."Yeah, well, what do the masses/establishments know about good
music anyway, especially rock music."
<sub-point: isn't "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame" kind of an oxymoron, I mean,
rock and roll has always stood against establishment for the most part?>:

C) Would I be mad if the local radio station weren't playing the "new cut"?
I wouldn't even know, because the one thing from either of the earlier
posts from Doug that I agree with is..."radio has its head up its ass..."
So I don't listen to the commercialized media machine that is radio,
especially to get MY music because if I had waited to hear my RUSH on the
radio, I'd still be wating for 2/3 of the songs to get played...and most of
those as we know are the good ones.  But I tell you what...I'd have the
album the day it was out, tell all my fellow RUSH fans to get it, and then
get my tickets to the show the minute they went on sale.

Lazy? Arrogant? Egotistical? I beg to differ, though Doug retracted those
claws for the second letter (I guess to boost the 70/30 ratio he had
recorded from the first lame post.)

As far as selling shows and albums....they may not command the audience in
some towns that they used to (don't understand the posts as they usually
sell out here in Houston) but they don't promote that way anymore and I
don't think that they want to promote the rest of their lives away. They
seem to have done very well (Better than they could've imagined?) in the
music business and you know we got what we wanted....and we'll be there to
get whatever they offer as they continue. But we can't live vicariously
through them. They can't tour forever and we should cherish what we have.

RUSH will never become queensryche (was a fan while they were around) as
they are infinitely more original,more talented and have stood the test of
time. They will never be YES as that band could never keep it together with
a consistent lineup (though I still see every show, which are mostly sold
out as well, and the shows are still some of the best musicianship around
to be seen....coming soon too, yahoo! regardless of lineup) and to think
that Radio play in the late nineties can save them from this fate more
readily than the years of great albums, hard work and the dedicated (though
sometimes cynical and silent) fan base seems absurd...though once again, a
good rush tune on the radio is a good thing.

Big show? Lasers? Screens? Yeah, that stuff was really important to me when
I was like 13, and I'm not knocking it bacause I know a lot of people go
for that...but hearing the music and seeing the boys in person is what I
think the concert is about. And their fan base is a little more mature now,
not to mention the albums they put out. I can go see that other crap at the
planetarium light shows....(which have a laser RUSH show I might add, or
they did not long ago)
Personally, I would love to go and see them at a venue that holds 4,000 as
you stated, or even less....the more personal the better. I'd pay more to
see a smaller, more personal performance from the boys, probably a lot
more.

And Pink Floyd? Yeah, the show was good, but all the fanfare seems like
kind of an old comfortable crutch to fill the void of the missing
watters.....I think they are hoping the little mtvidiots won't know the
difference so they won't mind paying for the nostalgic super-expensive
lesser product without watters....like I said, the show was good, but
doesn't compare to say, the show when "Animals" came out. Sure they had
lights and films and stuff then too, but it wasn't the main focus...more
complimentary.<<<<<all in reference to PF

Maybe I am the one who is just old fashioned, but I think RUSH has earned
our respect and the respect of millions (look at the record sales even to
this day) and whatever happens happens....radio/mtv/tv/hall of fame
rock'n'roll paraphrenalia vendors.....none of that is as necessary as it
once was. They HAVE our attention. So whatever happens I don't think they
will be disappointed and neither will we....they have given us everything.

This is my last lengthy post, at least this lengthy. Just a lot of ground
to cover. Hope some of this is as appropriate as the post warranted...

I guess I just see a lot of the negativity that everyone is talking about
and between "B-man" and Doug I just couldn't let it go. I love RUSH, you
love RUSH, I'm OK, You're OK, that there's how it is. Complain about
support for the band and ticket sales in a place that's not full of people
who can prove you wrong...like ON THE RADIO, or in the BUSH
newsletter....but not here....

PS Doug, differences aside, your "THE FIRE..." post was much better stated
than the first...

I am an avid Red Wings fan, but I must say, the management of the
Washington Capitals must be cool, during game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals
at the MCI center they played "Freewill" and during game 4 they played it
again , then later played "TOM Saywer"  The Linesman dropping the puck
must be a fan too because he waited longer than normal to drop it and the
songs played longer.

Congrats to the Wings on 2 consecutive Stanley Cups, way to go!

Subject: Afterimage - music supporting the lyrics

The Mystic S wrote: "have you ever heard another song that conveyed an
image(that ran along a theme with the lyrics)so well?"

Many, many moons ago, someone posted how the guitar solo of Limelight works
itself to a cresendo then fades away, similar to how a rockers career brings
him into the limelight, then he doesn't want to be in the limelight, then he
fades away, etc. (it was better when he told it!).

Although there are many, one song has made an impact on me as having music
which I feel tremendously adds to the lyrics is Afterimage.  The instrumental
break in the song is pure emotion and makes you FEEL what the singer (the
survivor) is feeling.  After the initial vocals and the beginning of the
instrumental break (2:25), the survivor is trying to come to terms with his
friend's death, represented by the almost melancholy, plodding, pulsating
keyboards.  After being unable to come to terms with the death, the person
feels denial, and after failing a few times to control itself (as it "barks"),
we hear the guitar finally break out in anger (3:16).  After this initial
outburst, the guitar continues in a aggressive stance, and is joined by what
are now aggressive keyboards (3:46), representing the frustation over a
sensless tragedy and the inability to come to terms with it.  The music
provides the mood to fully appreciate the words "try to believe, but you know
its no good; this is something that just can't be understood."

IMHO,
Hanstones

Subject: Old and New (again)

I've actually given this a lot of thought, and I think a big part of
whether or not we prefer the new or old is related to our musical
prowess.  Personally, I couldn't play chopsticks.  Never picked up any
instrument except for a trumpet in Junior High.  And then, there's this
guy who lived across the hall from me at school who plays guitar and
bass.  

My favs - Power Windows, Test for Echo, Grace Under Pressure, Presto

His, going by the ones he owned/played - AFTK, Permanent Waves, MP, COS,
FBN

Anyone else seen this happen?

By the way, I like/own all the albums.  Still, FBN is a slow mover in my
listening.

I never thought I'd post a Rush sighting but I've had 2 (of sorts) =
recently and since nobody I know would really give a damn I figured I'd =
force them on you good people.  First, I've got the Rush 95 screensaver =
on my machine at work.  Well I'm in the next cubicle over and I'm =
hearing my director talk to my manager and out of the blue my director =
says "hey, that's Neil Peart".  Well of course I had to make sure I =
heard him correctly, and I had, so I walk back over to my desk and say =
"Len, I'm impressed."  Then he proceeds to tell me what a cool show 2112 =
was.  Amazing.  Second, we moved recently (so I'm about a month behind =
in reading TNMS) and one of our neighbors has plates that say "SYRINX".  =
Is the driver on this list perchance - MO plates in Parkview?  That =
would just kill me.  By the way, to Douglas Maher, I really enjoyed your =
post on the sad state of radio.

Personally, Id rather pay my money to go see a band whose music I enjoy. =
One thing about Stevie Ray Vaughan that I always thought was so very =
cool was the total lack of a show. It was him, his band, a few amps, and =
his guitar on stage. But when he started playing, you didnt care about =
lasers or smoke or whatever. Now, that might be a little like comparing =
apples to oranges, but I would rather pay to see someone play and watch =
them play and listen to the music rather than look at the effects. =
Heaven for me would be to see Rush or Genesis or whoever else play in a =
small club. Or get as close to the stage as I can. Because I find Alex's =
fretwork and Neil's drumming and Ged's playing to be far superior than =
any lighting effect. Maybe thats because Im a musician (trying anyway). =
But to an extent I think that too much effects and razzle-dazzle take =
away from the music

Subject: The sorry state of radio.

Hey, all!

First of all, sorry for the crossposting, but there has been talk
of the lousy state of commercial radio on both the Rush and
Sarah McLachlan mailing lists.  As someone who has worked
in radio for almost 9 years, I'm probably even more ashamed 
of this than most.

I just wanted to say that I'm trying to do something about it.
As a part of my master's thesis at the University of Florida,
I will be studying the effectiveness of ownership consolidation
and widespread programming consultation within the radio field.
(My apologies to the likes of Donna Halper, but I don't think
either is quite effective, especially as of late.)

The background to my study and research can be found at the
following URL:
http://gdn.net/~freds/thesis/proposal.htm .

Any feedback and other comments sent privately would be 
much appreciated.  Thanks for listening.

Subject: Rush in small arenas, Doug's message, etc.

I do agree that Queensryche and Yes selling only 4,000 seats in a 20k seat
area is a joke, HOWEVER, call me old fashion but Rush can stick the smoke,
the lazers, the films up their Canadian rear-ends and I would STILL go see
a show.  It's simple - the music is just that good - period.  Rush doesn't
need all that crap to put on a good show musically.  Sure it adds to the
theatric-type atmosphere that people have come to expect when you spend
$30+ to go see a show.  Maybe this is the reason that shows DO cost 30 or
more dollars.  That's too bad cause put them in a 5,000 seat theater, bag
all that other crap, and lower the price to $10-$15 I would see them
everytime.  What Doug is saying is that the fans are *expecting* to see
this other stuff else they will be disappointed and not go the next time.
Not this fan and these really aren't the true fans that appreciate Rush
musically.  Doug is saying that this is needed for the fair-weather fan to
show up.  I do agree that it is nice to see something other than the music
for high cost of the ticket.  Like I said, lower the ticket price, put them
in a small theater where there is NO bad seat in the house, and I would
prefer this over a crowed 20K+ seat arena where you have to stand on your
6' tall friend's shoulders to see anything any day of the week.  Guess it's
"all show or no go" for most folks and it's too bad that rock music has to
be an attraction because of "the show" instead of the music.  Guess the
music really *IS* that bad for some of these newer bands ... but not
Rush's!

Chow for now.

I really only skim TNMS most of the time, so I don't know if this was said
anywhere or not, but there is going to be a remix of "Tom Sawyer" on the
"Small Soldiers" soundtrack.  It's being done by some guy named Z Trip from
out here in Tempe, AZ.  I'm surprised no one has ever covered this song
before.  Why does it have to be a DJ remixing it?  Just thought I'd share.

hi y'all,

just got back from a week-long school drama trip to london... awesome! i
picked up five marillion cds, a magma cd (weird), hawkwind (just as wind),
and, to top off the progressive stuff, the beastie boys' "licensed to ill"
:-)

anyway,

before i left, i posted a note to the NMS about ayn rand. in that post i
said that rand was basically equivalent to nietzsche (sp?) and she had gone
from libertarianism to near-fascism. i was wrong. my knowledge of rand was
spotty at best, and i, having never read anything by rand except for
_anthem_, had a false conception about her ideas. thus, i take back that
message and issue an apology to all you randians out there in cyberland.

sorry.

someone mentioned favorite TV shows. here are mine:

none (i don't watch tv anymore. i used to love seinfeld, simpsons, south
park, x-files, star trek, et al, but i've just gotten really sick of tv in
general)

i'm going to write a movie one day about my teenage life (which is still
going on!), and i'm trying to think of a good soundtrack. here are the
tracks so far:

marillion-forgotten sons
rush-subdivisions
rem-leave
stones-satisfaction
toasters-freedom
metallica-one
ozzy-crazy train
dream theater-pull me under
live-selling the drama
beethoven-ninth symphony choral
new order-true faith
pop will eat itself-cape connection

finally some questions:

1. are there any new order fans out there? i know rush and new order are
about as far apart as you can get in the spectrum, but i think new order is
pretty cool!
2. anyone heard of pop will eat itself? i love them!
3. has anyone ever made audio recordings onto VHS tape? tell me about it,
because i'm thinking of making some *very* long mix tapes!

making a marillion mix tape. current track: assassing

Okay I'll bite.  My favorite TV program is the Larry Sanders show.  "Do you
think Iggus could say, 'Hey now!'?"

A lot of people don't get -- or care for -- the sardonic humor, the wry
wit, and the Hollywood in-jokes, but I totally dig it.

There's nothing like Ryan O'Neal getting bitched out by Farrah Fawcett, or
Noah Wylie and Mandy Patinkin trading verbal jabs about E.R. & Chicago
Hope.   Where else could you see former Men-At-Work singer Colin Hay
laughing it up about his lazy eye?  What other show has a main character
whose primary concern is whether his ass is too wide?  Not to mention David
Duchovny being sexually attracted to Larry, Ellen DeGeneres frenching
Larry, or George Segal as a washed-up actor trying to squeeze himself onto
the anniversary show final segment (paralleling real life, before Segal hit
it big with Just Shoot Me).

Segal, wanting to jump on stage: "Now Artie?"
Arthur points one finger up in the air, testing the wind.   Uh huh.

I'm sorry Hank, you're not doing the voice of Hercules, that part went to
Tate Donovan.
Hank: "What?  I take a shit bigger than Tate Donovan."

Sadly, the final episode was broadcast last week.  From now on, only
re-runs.  Then again:

I always thought that Geddy's voice DID sound different on Xanadu.
It does seem to be pitched higher than his normal voice. Compare it to the
version on ESL ,and you'll see what I mean.

Nothing is impossible. Yes if you speed up the music, you increase the
frequency, but
you can adjust the two independantly with digital audio tools. You can
certainly increase
the pitch of something, and stretch the note out to last the same amount of
time. The note
doesn't sound the same though (I think the term is aliasing, if I remember
correctly).

The only reason I can think of is that the song needed to be speeded up to
fit on the album,
although I don't think AFTK is particularly long, even for a vinyl album.

Cheers
James

Subject: One of many, I'm sure....

     I'm sure many, many NMSers have opinions on that "Visions" guy based 
     on his recent posting. I could go into how offensive & pretentious the 
     post was. I could "bring" up the, well, sloppy speling. punctuation & 
     rather odd "use" of quo"tat"ion marks. But, instead of picking apart 
     his post, I will say this: at one time, I really wanted to find a copy 
     of his book. I've never read it. Now, I'm sure I don't want to.
     
     Is the NMS as bad as that "Visions" guy thinks? I'm not sure. Yes, 
     it's catty, but I've found frequent use & entertainment in it. For me, 
     it is serving its purpose. For him, it is not, but that is no concern 
     of mine.
     
     I, along w/ the majority of the NMSers, support the band by buying 
     their shit & going to their concerts (multiple times). If a band (any 
     band) expects more than that out of their fanbase, that's too damn 
     bad. From what I've read about Rush, THEY don't expect anything more 
     out of us. Why should I care if a fellow fan thinks what I do for Rush 
     isn't enough? It is NOT our implicit job to market Rush. They have 
     people that do that for them. If these people aren't doing their job, 
     Rush ought fire their lame asses. I am not a radio programmer. I might 
     call a station to request a song because I HAPPEN TO WANT TO HEAR IT. 
     But, why would I make a fool of myself by telling the radio station 
     how it should be run? That would be, in a word, stupid.
     
     So, I'm sorry "Visions" guy. Your rally rings hollow with me. Your 
     fiery accusations are all bluster. Rush, whose music I truly do love, 
     does not give life. My job, my personal relationships, MY LIFE all 
     deserve care & attention. Rush is but a small, albeit quite enjoyable, 
     part of it all. Different strokes for different folks....
     
     Sincerely, 
     Chad

Hello, all...

I don't know whether or not the tempo of live "Xanadu" was altered, but I can
offer some information about the feasability.

>>>>>>You'd think with all the digital technology available today, >>>>>>they
could speed up the tempo >of the track without changing >>>>>>the pitch of the
song.

 --This, I'd say, is COMPLETELY impossible.  I don't claim to know ---about
today's technology, but dealing with sound reproduction ---seems to be a
fairly simple concept--you have music which contains ---notes at a certain
frequency.  If you change the speed of the music ---you change the frequency
of the notes (thus changing the # of waves ---per second), and finally the
pitch is affected.

Not so anymore.  In the old days, when tape was used to accomplish this
(Strawberry Fields Forever, anyone?), the above paragraph holds true.  It even
holds true when dealing with newer digital equipment, as long as it is the
sample playback rate that is being altered.  Anyone with a digital delay has
surely had many countless hours of brainless fun playing with that
characteristic.  Heh.  But, with digital technology, it is possible to alter
pitch or tempo without directly affecting the other.  Instead of altering the
playback rate, the computer actually alters the wave itself.  A shareware
Windows program that does this is Cool Edit, by Syntrillium Software.  It's
fun to play with, and comes in useful when recording with my band.

I doubt this type of processing could be effectively used on Xanadu, though,
because it gives the wave a bizarre character--it's not very realistic.
However, speeding it up sounds much better than slowing it down.  :)

Take care,
Chris

Subject: Re:  Can there be an intrinsically "best" band?

Al, I agreed with you before but now I will have to disagree with you.  I 
still think that no matter how good a band may be technically in musicianship, 
imagery, symbolism, and story-telling ability or whatever else you named in 
your response, it still is only a matter of opinion how good a band is 
relative to another band.  

First of all, most of the things you mentioned above are themselves nothing 
more than opinion.  Sure, Rush has received many awards for their outstanding 
musicianship, but how do you rate style?  A painter may have technically 
flawless paintings, but that does not mean that I will go out and pay $36 
million for one, like people are doing for Van Gogh paintings.  When he first 
started doing his paintings, I am sure people were quite shocked and were 
wondering just who let this retarded boy get ahold of the paintbrushes.

>>and it is clear he is a better lyricist

To you and me he is a better lyricist.  Others may not like his particular 
style of writing those songs that we have come to love.

>>Musicianship:  Well, just look at the number of awards Neil, Alex and Geddy 
have received for musicianship vs. how many the >>members of Bryan Adams band 
have received and, IMO, my point is made.

If you are going to bring up a question like this, then you better be able to 
answer a question that Bryan Adams lovers will ask you:  How many albums has 
Rush sold, and how many has Bryan Adams sold?  Or better yet- you brought up 
Bryan Adams, but let me ask how many albums has Rush sold, and how many has 
Michael Jackson sold?  Don't get me wrong, I don't believe this to be a fair 
estimate of a band's skill, but you have to admit that when someone says that 
MJ's album Thriller sells 34 million copies that this is still some pretty 
strong ammo for their side of the argument.

This kinda reminds me of my brother-in-law and his friend.  They both love 
single-malt whiskey and go to tastings all the time.  I would consider both 
of them to be experts on this important field.  Yet they never agree on 
which whiskey is better.  If brand X was made the technically perfect way, 
with computers controlling just the right amount of humidity for storage 
and fermentation or whatever you call all of that liquor-making terminology, 
it does not mean that it is automatically better that the stuff that was made 
in my basement that I used a dirty sock to strain all the excess crap from.  
It is probably more likely, but not automatic.

Anyway,  I still believe that Rush is, by far, the best band in the world.  
Possible the universe-that remains to be seen.  I just think, though, that 
I am stating my opinion when I say that.

Aaaaannnndd now, to commemorate the B-Man's posting to the list with all

something that monsignor franklin insipred me to key......

Baking Nature
 ----- ------
An eclair from a bakery office
Cream-filled letter to the fans-that-see
To a God, a king, a B-man's plate
A captain of Pastry
To the sprinkles and the glazing --
Can't everybody see?

It ought to be Baking nature --
I mean, the digests where we write!
Let's mock about this senseless freak --
We all site slanderous trite
I know delivery guys have no patients --
But the Breadman's got no right

I know you're haughty --
You know I've no shame
We're both too crusty
To be calling out names
I'd like some maple-bars
But you don't have a clue
We shan't go on thinking
Your denial was true
Donuts are blameless
But not when they're glazed
We light the pilots -- while we're kneading the dough

Folks have got they're opinions --
And opinions got to have minions
Wheat is basically healthy
Conventional writers eat clay
Well, we read about the exceptions
In the NMS one fine day

It ought to be Baking nature --
At least, that's why I love the heel
"Now I lay me down in Bread-land" --
I know B-Man's not for real
I thought we might get closer --
But I'm ready to bake with corn-meal

To say you're different, and to say we're to blame
It's hard to bite day-old bread the way that it came
Too many vapid fans keep us feeling so mighty
Too many editors keep sending back our writing
It's hard to take the heat --
It's hard to eat bread
To slight the writer -- while we're frosting the cakes.

 I would certainly be upset, but I wouldn't be raging.  Rush is important to

 I agree with you, but I'm quite cynical when it comes to MTV people.  I 
think we should form some kind of movement of "good" music, encouraging fans 
to go out and try other things and prevent MTV and the like from telling 
them what they like.  I'm 19 years old, and that's what I did.  I went out 
and listened to different things to find my own thing.  I was one of a few 
kids in school who liked Rush.  I'm just rambling here, but I think a good 
target audience for Rush to go for is the 18 to 24 group.  People here in 
college seem more open to new things.  College is said to be the time when 
people you know....discover stuff and think.  I'm either right, sorta right, 
or a complete moron.

 I'm sort of in the middle of this.  I go to see Rush because I want to hear 
the music.  When I first got into Rush, it wasn't the special effects or 
lasers that got me into it.  It was the music.  Only.  On the other hand, I 
would miss the lasers because I think Rush uses them so well.  Some bands 
go a little overboard with them.  Special effects should be used solely to 
enhance either the music itself or the artist's message, which I think Rush 
does especially well.

Music affects each of us in a different way.  I think everyone is entitled 
to their own opinion, and this is mine.  I think as long as everyone is 
given the proper chance to hear Rush, they will.  Great music will always 
survive and find new fans.  I'll stop here before I take up a whole issue.
