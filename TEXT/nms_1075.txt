Subject: YYZ - Intro Percussion

Saw your question about the beginning of YYZ in NMS 1071:

> At the beginning of YYZ, Is neil using a triangle or a ride cymbol????
> I have an ongoing debate to settle!!!

It's neither a triangle or a ride.  It's a set of crotales.  (Check the
liner notes in MP, they're mentioned next to Neil's name.)
Crotales are a complete octave (or two) of small, flat, resonant
discs (approx. 2" - 5" in diameter).  You should be able to see them in
some older pictures of his kit.  I'm pretty sure he had them mounted
up high on either side of him.  I guess they're made of brass or
something.  The drummer I used to jam with in high school bought
a full two octaves of them (We used to play YYZ in it's entirety
[BTW, I play bass]).  I beleive the note that Neil is hitting in YYZ is
a "C".

Hope this clears thing up.

Subject: Death of a Rumor

O.K., It's time to kill a rumor

To all of those guys and gals who said they had
friends in record stores and claimed that a
new album was to be released in Feb.95,
it ain't gonna happen. (duh).

Heres how I think that got started.  Bush
released an album in Feb. 95.  An easy
mistake to make especially if your just
glancing at a list of new releases.  In fact, I was
watching eMpTy V the other day and a Bush vid.
came on.  From across the room I swore
a was a new Rush vid.  You can imagine
my disappointment when the music started
playing.  Not that Bush sucks or anything
but I'll take an "R" over a "B" any day.

Hey Rush fans
I just got an idea when I read those surveys about Rush's greatest songs etc.
Being a beginning guitarist, I love Alex Lifeson's mastery of guitar music;
I am curious as to what people consider his greatest solo or piece.  So, I
would like to create a survey of sorts as to Rush's greatest guitar solo.  If
you'd like to participate, send me email at mraillard@colgate.edu and I'll
tabulate and post the results when I get enough entries.  Thanks!!!!

Subject: Cinderella Man and Rand

As of late many Randians seem to be popping out of the woodwork and arguing
the objectivist nature of Neil's lyrics.  First of all, let me state
clearly that I'm no Rand-expert, but that I have a general idea of what
she's all about from an interview I read which was published in some
objectivist propoganda.  I will be the first to agree that Anthem in
particular and 2112 to a lesser extent speak the philosophy of Rand to a
fairly fanatical level.

However, many Rand-supporters have brought up the
song "Cinderella Man" as another good example of the Rand-Peart connection.
Let's not forget that this cool song is based upon Frank Capra's
brilliant film  Mr. Deeds Goes To Town.  Furthermore, as a
film-student/buff/Frank-Capra-Fan I'd like to stress that if one
were to classify Capra's political stance in a pre-defined category it would
have to be as a populist.  I prefer to classify him as a Capraist, but
in any event, IMHO, Capra is pretty darn far away from Rand as for
oppinions on people and politics and what the-right-thing-to-do-in-society
is.  The most perfect example of this (along with Deeds and Mr.Smith
Goes To Washington) is It's A Wondeful Life,
(which I presume you've all seen) whose central protagonist
George Bailey is pretty much the least self-centered person you'll ever
see anywhere.  He forsakes his entire life for the sake of continuing
on his father's "Building And Loan" which he runs, not to make a profit,
but rather to help the most people he possibly can, while himself living
in an ancient house on the edge of town.  George Bailey is no Randian-hero.

But I digress...  Mr. Deeds is no Randian-hero either, nor is the film
a Rand-promoting film.  For those of you unfamiliar with the plot,
Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper), from the small town of Mandrake Falls,
inherits several million dollars (which, in 1936, was a LOT of moeny) from
a dead uncle.  The self-interested bankers who had been handling the
estate until Deeds inherited it, make every attempt to get Deeds to
sign its trust over to them, but he eventually sees through their motivations.
An innocent in the big city (where the bankers have brought him), Deeds
is "seduced" by a self-interested reporter (played by Jean Arthur) who
befriends him in order to write him up in the newspaper (but she's not
doing this for journalism's sake - she's been promised a two-week
vacation if she can bring the story in).  She nick-names him "The
Cinderella Man", a name that reflects his inocense in the big city.
Further complicating matters is a distant relative of the uncle
who wants the money for himself.

For a time, Deeds lives high-on-the-hog in New York, as a millionaire would
be expected to:  at one instance he galavants, drunk, about the streets feeding
donuts to a horse.  But then Deeds is confronted by a poor-man who
questions why he feeds donunts when he could be feeding the hungry around
him.  This, then, is the turning point in the film, the point at which
Deeds sees the good he can do with the money.  He sets up a program
where all those who are without work (and there are many of them, this
was the great depression after all) can come to him and be granted
several acres of land, some farming equippment, and some livestock to
start a new life with.  If they work the land for a year, they then own
it.

This is the section of the song which every Randian likes to misquote:
"And a look in the eyes of the hungry/ Awakened him to what he could do/
He held up his riches/ To challenge the hungry."  Now, from Neil's phrasing
it may seem that Deeds challenges the poor merely by being rich, a
Randian notion of "look how rich I am, you could be this rich if you tried
hard too."  But this is not what Deeds does.  He GIVES his property
away to those in need, those who are eager to work but cannot because
of the depressed economic climate.  In fact Deeds changes from a
self-interested Rand-hero (he at first challenges the poor man who
confronts him with the line "you're just a loafer") into a virtual
socialist, and it is this transformation for which Deeds is branded insane
(by the self interested lawyers and relatives).  It is VERY clear from
the film that Deeds' transformation is to be viewed as a positive one.

This brings us to another section of the song, specifically:
"Because he was human/ Because he had goodness/ Because he was moral/
They called him insane."  Neil clearly states that he finds Deeds' actions
to be morally correct.  But what sort of morality is this?
Deeds is called insane by those who wish that he would not give his money
to those who need it, but rather to themselves.  In the famous trial
sequence at the end (at which point Deeds, disilutioned by the reporter
who he had fallen in love with only to discover she had been writting
exploitive stories in the newspapers, and called insane by those who
seek to stop him) Deeds refuses to defend himself against charges of
insantiy until the poor, in attendence in full force, start to shout
"What about us Mr. Deeds?  What will happen to us?"  For without Mr.
Deeds' generosity, these people will be lost.  At this point in the
film Deeds has lost all sense of self, and it is only through his
caring for others above himself (that sure ain't what Rand's all about)
that he decides to defend himself.  So, if Neil believes in
Deeds' moral righteousness, he sure isn't as hard-boiled a Randian
as one might think.

Well, that was awfully long winded, but I hope all you Randists get
the point.  Perhaps Neil is a Rand-supporter, but it sure is not possible
to say he is using "Cinderella Man" for your support.  Personally,
I'm happy to conclude that Neil, along with myself, is a Capraist.

I've been hearing about all these Rush coverbands, but none anywhere near
the Baltimore/DC area.  Anyone know of any around here?

Also, I didn't get to vote on my 2nd favorite band/artist behind Rush,
but I noticed that John Mellencamp received 5% of the votes.  I couldn't
believe it!  Exactly how many votes did that 5% make up?

Well, add another for me, because IMHO, he is phenomenal!  BUT of course,

Well because size of the instrument and what equipment it was recorded
on makes a difference in answering this question, and I'm not sure
anyone knows this- to my knowledge, he actually is hitting an ice-bell.

Also, I have to support Kevin Butler with the notion that Geddy wrote
the lyrics for Cinderella Man, so throw away the Rand connections, you
cannot then imply that maby Lee even is making the connection.

	My own personal favorite live tunes would be side 3 of _Exit...Stage
	Left_ (Broon's Bane, Trees, Xanadu), along with La Villa Strangiato,
	also of _ESL_.  Never listen to the other live albums much.

	While we're on the subject, it always seemed to me that the sound qual-
	ity of _ESL_ was never on a par with other live albums.  Seemed kinda
	muddy, just a little higher quality than early boots.  Just my opinion.
	I didn't say the musical quality was lacking; that's what keeps me
	listening to it!

	Off the subject, I broke down and bought the MFSL edition of _Moving
	Pictures_; the price wasn't too bad, and it sounds pretty good, too.
	Of course, the original artwork intact may be worth it in itself.  My
	advice...if you have a really good stereo and have a really good ear
	_AND_ you don't already have _MP_ on disc, buy the MFSL disc.  Again,
	my opinion only.  Kinda wish _Hemispheres_ and _Permanent Waves_ was
	similarly available.  Someday, I suppose (sigh).

Hi Guys,

I was out record shopping today, and I found a promo copy

it has a unique sleeve with lyrics and pictures of roadies.
The lyrics appear are written out on pages, and each page

Subject: Geddy - A quality bassist?

Hi guys, this is a general call for support i guess.

Recently i was eating lunch w/ a fellow human being who proceeded to
suggest something like "i respect Geddy's musicianship al all, but he's
technically not that good of a bassist." This statement, IMHO, is absurd
and i'd like to ask the bassists out there to email me (or post if this is
going to become a thread) the Rush songs you feel best demonstrate Geddy's
superior technical ability.

I am a guitarist, and thought i could collect the best reply to my friend
by asking all you bassists out there. If you've got the time, maybe
including parts of the song that are particurarly indicative of Geddy's
prowess.

Off the top of my head i mentioned YYZed,The Analog Kid, La Villa,
Marathon, and Where's My Thing, but these were a) just off the top of my
head at the spur of the moment b) not put into any organized argument and
c) not nearly comprehensive i'm sure.

So, please send me your opinions!

thanks a lot

Aaron

hello, I don't get to post much but i'd like to react to a RUSH fan in
the air-force...kim@scilan   etc...

RUSH is not and will never be in financial trouble...each of their
releases has gone a MINIMUM of gold and typically go platinum in time.
it is too bad that they don't play more in europe but it actually works
to our advantage here in the states...so get home soon bubba.

hey, exciting news here in tampa/st. pete (warm florida)!  with the
addition of the devil rays, RUSH will likely be even more enticed to
visit here on their next tour.  by the way, i still think i'm right in
saying that the empty stadium pictured in the front of the CP tour book
is the THUNDERDOME (in st. pete)...write and tell me what you think!

one more thing...to all you critically insane folks who seem to be fans
but keep saying things such as RUSH is losing there edge or RUSH is on
their way out or can't last forever...have a little faith...and remember,
GEDDY ALEX NEIL still set the standard in music that is neither rock,
pop, jazz or classical (or country, ha!).  it can't be classified if you
really think about it.  it's music that can effect (and does) your every
sense.  there will NEVER be another band like this.  i feel priveledged
to have lived in the wonderful RUSH era.  tha't my thoughts, feel free to

Well,

	"We have assumed control..."

That, I know for a fact, is said by the "men of old," not the Priests.  Beside
common interpetation, the 2112 tourbook continues the story of 2112 the song.
It goes something to the effect of the Priests sitting around realizing their

Priests along with them.  The masses break in and, well, you can imagine the

Well howdy, Rush fans,

	I just discovered this amazing e-mail thing a month ago (yes, I know,
I was resistant but finally realized that "Constant change is here to stay"),
and finding Syrinx was by far the greatest thrill of my existence to date(it
even beat getting into to UCSF med school). That being said...
	Does anyone share my extreme love and fascination with the Power
Windows album? Mind you, I love all of Rush's brilliant works, but this one
stands out in my mind as quite simply a perfect album. From the top notch
production to the incredible songs, it never ceases to blow my mind. Middletown
Dreams is the perfect union of lyrical connotation and musical expression.
(didn't that sound artsy?)
	Anyways, if anyone wants to discuss the album, or any other, feel
free to write me!

Just between us
I think it's time we learned to recognize
The differences we sometimes fear to show
Just between us
I think it's time we learned to realize
The spaces in-between
Leave room
For you and I to grow...

Subject: Re: bibblings & scribblings

cool, its nice to know that there are a few other people like me out
there who like both rush and living colour.  i saw them in boston when
they were touring right after their _stain_ album.  it seems to me that
they changed quite a bit after muzz skillings left the band and doug
wimbish came in...  i guess muzz was important to the band, as they
didn't last long after he left.  well, anyways its cool that living
colour likes rush a lot, which i didn't know, though it stinks that they
broke up.  okay, enough non-rush content, here are my "obscure" but
excellent songs.
1) PRIME MOVER- (Hold Your Fire) if anyone remembers me, they know i always
harp on this song.  it is my favorite rush song, i love the combination of
bass and keyboards and the lyrics are tear jerking, (well, they are to me,
anyways).  drums are pretty cool in the song too, but what by peart
isn't.  i think i really fell in love with this song when i heard/saw it
on the ASOH video, though was heartbroken when i found it wasn't on the
album, as well.
2) TERRITORIES- (Power Windows) okay, what can i say, i absolutely love
the drum beat in this song, its just so cool.  the historical
significance of this song makes it very interesting as well, as i am
somewhat of a chinese history buff.
3) LESSONS- (2112) i know a lot of people rip this song, but i think it
is a cool song.  alex wrote the lyrics and it is very different from
neil's lyrics.  it think it also is a fairly deep song, and deals with
the individual versus authority.
4) CIRCUMSTANCES- (Hemispheres) okay, so the last guy who wrote said this
one as well, but i think its an integral part of the album.  it really
rocks!  i think the french language works well with rock and roll,
another example being "a tout le monde," by megadeth.  yes, i like
megadeth too!
5) PRESTO- (???-what do you think?) well, i guess i've heard this once or
twice on the readio, but i don't think the boys ever play it live.  it is
an excellent song and deals with things that are important to my life,
i.e. leaving bad relationships behind.
6) IN THE END- (Fly By Night) i fell in love with this song when i heard
it on _all the world's a stage_  i love the studio version as well.  i
think this was also sort of a preview of "new" rush, during the old rush
period.  does anyone understand what i'm talking about?

7) KID GLOVES- (Grace Under Pressure) okay, i think this is the best song
on the album, though "red sector a" is close.  it deals with what i think
is a sad, but true, (yes, metallica), state that youths experience, i.e.
that they have to be tough and get in fights, to get by.  i found this to
be true in my life.  i had to use bravado to get me through high school :)
8) CINDERELLA MAN- (A Farewell to Kings) yup, people rip this song and
geddy's "cheesy" lyrics, as well.  i like it because the subject it deals
with, a person who is philanthropic in a world of greed, is an important
subject and more people should do that.  it's part of the reason i don't
sympathize at all with the baseball players on their strike.  i think
they really need to give more back to their communities than they do,
though there are exceptions, (kirby puckett, to name one).

okay, that's it for me, i know it was really long but i got on a roll.

Well, let me take a stab at this. . .

Let's say, just for the sake of argument, that the "cross of Holy
Fire" really IS that tableau that those crazy KKK boys love so much.
The hero (or anti-hero) of our little story seems to be an undercover
agent of some sort.  Perhaps he's a Fed infiltrating the KKK, and his
sense of honor is compromised by having to participate in a Klan cross
burning.  He feels his honor is not an adequate shield against the
hatred.

The whole song seems to be the tale of this poor conflicted man whose
job compromises his soul.

Just a thought.

Hi everyone,
I'm still getting a kick out of all the You know you are... things, because
so many of them relate to me too.  I've given many an ex-boyfriend near
coronaries in their cars because they flipped past a Rush song.  It is
interesting that you can tell instantly, I mean only a seconds worth of
lyric or drum or whatever, if its Rush.  I've gotten yelled at a few times,
"Stop screaming while I'm driving! Its only a song!"  Oh well, they never
had any taste!
I really liked the one, "You cut down all the trees in your yard to stop
them from fighting." Maybe its just me, maybe its just that I'm so tired,
but I thought that was soooooo cute.
I'm sure we computer "nerds" have all done Rush things to our computers,
like when I log on to my schools system, it says "WELCOME TO THE TEMPLES OF
SYRINX" DON'T ask how many times I've had to explain THAT to onlookers.

As for the concerts, nothing can compare to seeing the Boys up on stage,
live and wondering what they'll pull out of their hats this time. (OK, 30
foot bunnies, I know...)  But my favorite part of the show, which is totally
unique from any other concert I've ever been to, is after the show.
The best time I have is going with my best friend to a rest stop near the
stadium and seeing how many people come in at like 1 am wearing their Rush
shirts.  No, we don't HAVE to stop and get a bite, but then we'd miss out
talking,(or should I say screaming!) to all the other fans. We always get
along and I've never met a mean Rush fan.  That's the best part for me.
I've probably met some of you but didn't know it, if you've seen them at the
Spectrum in Philly or the MEadowlands the last three tours.

Ok.  This is my first posting on the NMS, so I have to extend a hearty
"Hi there!" to all fellow Rushians.

A little about myself:  I'm a 18 year old college freshman at the Florida
Institute of Technology and a relatively new Rush fan (wasn't converted
until my senior year in High School).  The song "Cold Fire" made me a
fan, because it compelled me to buy a copy of Counterparts.  Shortly
thereafter, with the insistence of a friend of mine who was also a BIIIG
Rush fan, I decided to try Chronicles.  Well, now I have every studio
album except Fly By Night and Power Windows, and I expect to have those
within a month...

Well, I don't really have anything to contribute except my life story,
but I do want to say that I've been reading the TNMS for a few weeks and
haven't noticed much flaming until the last few issues.  Some of the
flaming has been the result of someone mentioning that they like a
certain band and someone else trashing that band.  I don't know about
you, but if I was posting a message somewhere, mentioned my affinity for
Rush, and someone said something like "arrggh, Rush sucks!" I would be
offended.  So try to show some respect for varying musical tastes.

Other than that, hope to be a contributing member to the group here!

Subject: Rushology

This is the fourth and final night of my rollercoaster-ride-of-a-week,
seeing Rush and The Firm.  It was a Friday night and Rush was playing in
Long Island's Nassau Colesium.  I had been here the previous night to see
The Firm and had my car malfunction--involving a steam leak in a
pipe near the radiator (naturally, I thought the car was going to explode).
	For this show, I would met with my friend Kenny who got us front row
seats for a lot of money (probably under $100--but this was 1986).  I
can't remember how I got my Dad to let me drive that same 1970 Dodge Dart
from the previous night after three concerts worth of bad luck with
automobiles.
	I got to the show early, armed with 1,000 business cards for
Rushology, my fanzine/newsletter.  I had a box of 500 cards in each of
the two outside pockets of my jacket.  After what had happened before
the second Meadowlands show several days before, I was nervous when I
passed through security.  However, I learned quickly that security was
going to be a joke this evening.
	Anyway, my plan was to give out all 1,000 cards before Rush
performed.  As soon as that eerie keyboard that opens the album Misplaced
Childhood from Marillion began, I headed to the upper level of the
Colesium.
	The Nassau Colesium is about 2/3 underground.  It is (sub)divided
into three sections in an oval shape (or like an olive).  Above the floor
level is section 100, above this is section 200 and above that is 300.
The intersection between the top of 200 and the bottom of 300 is the
street level.  Get the idea?  So the upper level was a mere climb of one
flight of stairs to get to the nose-bleed section.
	For each set of stairs, which divided the 300s to Subdivisions, I
handed a bunch of business cards to the Rush fan sitting in the seat
closest to the aisle and yelled into his/her ear "Take one and pass them
on!"  And it worked!
	I kept going up and down stairs, shouting in anonymous ears, and
watched Rushology spread from row to row.  It felt
good to be doing this after having this plan sabotaged a few nights ago
in New Jersey.  This card-passing was fun because I enjoyed watching the
expressions of my fellow comrades' faces.  Some of them grabbed me for
more details, but I couldn't talk much because I had to keep moving and
keep a casual eye on security just in case.
	My Mission was accomplished.  So I raced back to the car and
brought back a cardboard sign that read "It's Big Al Day."  I met Ken in
the front row on Ged's side.  I had a few more cards left so I gave some
out to people surrounding me.
	Needless to write, I had a great time, watching our heroes do
their stuff several feet away from me.
	Then something happened.
	The main set was ending.  Alex spontaneously threw his guitar
pick into the audience.  From my point of view, it was lobbed over my
head.  Along with other first-rowers, we got down on our knees and
started feeling the floor with our hands in the direction where we
thought the pick had landed.  My adrenaline pumped as I watched hands
gingerly tap the ground, so I put my hands on the floor away from others
and made large, swooping motions, skimming my hands on the floor,
covering a lot more area with my hands and, holy shit, I got Alex's pick.
	I got up while others were still on their knees and just nodded
to Kenny when he looked at me.  I placed it in my front pocket until Rush
took their break before the encore.  In the dark, I showed that white,
priceless piece of plastic to Ken.
	When Rush got back on stage, I remember the house lights got turned
up.  I lifted my "Big Al" sign over my head and Alex pointed to it,
laughing.  I made contact with the blonde guy!  With reckless abandon, I
flung the sign on stage but since it was cardboard, it did not go very
far.  It ended up at the edge of the stage, caught in some lighting
contraption.
	When the encore set was over, Alex threw his pick into the crowd
again, farther away from me, and picked up my sign and used IT as a pick
for the last crunching note.
	That was an incredible ending.
	Now for the bad news.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I lost
the PICK.  I was trotting up all those stairs to get to the street level
from the floor after the show.  The steps were steep and my knees were
bobbing up and down as I climbed them and I think it popped out of my
pockets which were baggy and loose.
	I realized I lost the PICK when I got to the car.  I nearly took
off all my clothes in search of it.
	There are no poetic words to conclude that week or that night for me,
but I'm open for suggestions.
	In regards to the car that night, I made it back home in one
piece but the next morning it had a flat.  I guess this could symbolize
that week in some ways.  Good-bye for now.

Just a thought, maybe this is the cross he is referring to.  If he's
protecting his honor agains chaos and this cross, maybe he is referring
metaphorically to defending himself against prejudice.  That would be

Subject: The Cross of Holy Fire

Greetings,
	Recently somebody asked about the significance/origin of "The
Cross of Holy Fire" from "*Double Agent*.  Well, here's my 2 cents (American).

TCOHF is being used by the Ku Klux Klan and other racist groups who
believe they're on a "holy crusade" against anybody with more melanin than
they.  It does, however, have *much* earlier meaning.

In the later days of the Roman Empire, there was a minor leader named
Constantine.  He was not particularly great (yet), and he wasn't
particularly religious either (he was a marginal believer in Rome's
polyteistic religion, which the philosophers of the time had determined to
be fiction).  He was crossing a bridge when he looked into the sky and had
a vision of a cross made of fire.  He saw/heard the words "By this sign
you shall conquer" (although I'm sure he heard them in Latin :).  He
immediately became a Christian and eventually became emperor, founding the
city of Constantinople and legalizing Christianity, ending the process of
burning Christians alive (a tradition started by the mad emperor Nero).
Interestingly enough, this process was resurrected (ahem) during the
Inquisition (no comment).

What the heck this has to do with Double Agent I don't know.

Subject: With respect to:

In response to a couple of posting in TNMS 1072 I would first like to
address one Steven Horowitz (a.k.a. The Professor).  You wrote that you
believed that 2112 ended with the "good guys" winning.  First of all, I would
have to say that I don't believe the song is a subject of good versus evil or
anything of the sort.  I believe it's all about the individual against the
establishment.  I haven't read Rand, so I can't give a comparison on that, but
I can speak on 2112 since it was written without her writings in mind, but
rather credit was given to her as an afterthought after Neil noticed the
similarities between the stories.  Anyhow, my point is that this person found
his individuality and free thought in the discovery of the guitar.  The
priests, upon his presentation of it tell him that his discovery was a tool
which destroyed the society that existed before the priests took control.  In
his dream he envisions that world that existed before and upon waking to his
reality muses at what a marvelous world it was that he'd seen, with freedom and
joy for all without the overlooking eye of the priests.  The ending of the song
is really indeterminate, but I would say that one of two things happened:  1.
the man left his dream as just that, a passing thought, and went on with his
life; or 2. he became so distraught at having seen a world appearing to be a
paradise to him that he couldn't bear living under the control of the priests.
I'm sure we've all mused over this before, and someone's probably said just as
much as I have but I had to throw in my interpretation.  I promise next time I
decide to go analyzing a song I'll go do something different.

Secondly, I would like to address Arvid Hokanson who commented on Neil's
writing about their success in life and in their music.  You may note that
songs like "Limelight" were written in Rush's earlier days.  I believe that
since then Neil, and perhaps all the Boys have become a little disillusioned
with fame.  In the song "Mission" Neil writes:
if their lives were
exotic and strange
they would likely have
gladly exchanged them
for something a little more plain
maybe something a little more sane
These do not look to me like the lyrics of someone enamoured with fame or
money.  Perhaps he's matured, grown personally, or become tired of the
lifestyle of a celebrity.  Those are questions for Neil, but I'd venture to say
he's not the same man today as he was when he wrote "Limelight".  I wouldn't
say he's bitter, per se, but I think he's more realistic about fame and it's
impact on his life than when he was a wide-eyed youth with a drum kit and a
notebook.

Subject: Hatchet, ax and saw

Somebody said that the "powerless" are the "oppressors" in The Trees; I
see it differently.  For me, that song is about the necessity of facing
pain in the name of fair play.  You may not like being kept equal by what
seems like arbitrary and ruthless means, but were you any better when you
hogged the light like the oaks did to the maples?  A forest becomes a
dark and gloomy place if only one species of tree is allowed to
flourish.  It also becomes one-sided and ecologically unbalanced.  A wise
forester knows when to do some trimming.  Just a thought.

A funny little piece of synchronicity...I read a quote, the "let 'em eat
cake" one, and just then Bastille Day started playing on my Chronicles
CD!  Now is that a cool coincidence or what?

Plus, a really cool place to see Canada Day fireworks (July 1, for
south-of-the-border Rushniks) is the lakeshore at Cobourg.  I'm sure
that's the "Lakeside Park" with willows in the breeze that the song tells
of.  It's supposedly the nation's biggest C.D. celebration, and what's
more, it's my home town.  Be there, and wear a Rush shirt!

See ya...

Hello all,
I haven't seen this topic discussed recently. . .so here goes-
It's about Rush fans jumping onstage during concerts...During the RTB
tour, at a Forum/Los Angeles show, the lights went out at some point in
the show and when they came back on, this guy ran to centre stage and
raised his hands in victory...soon to be taken out by security...Neil
actually stood(partially) and looked as if he was yelling to Alex or Ged
to watchout. During a Forum show for the CP tour (I had excellent seats
btw) the lights went out and Rush starts YYZ..the lights come on and Alex
is at the front of the stage (alone) when some guy races on stage and
jumps on Alex's back. Alex keeps playing while security tries to get him
off. The guy eluded them long enough to grab onto Neil's bass drum.
Security then dragged him offstage...I think that has got to be the
biggest rush (pun not intended) for a Rush fan...to be onstage (albeit
briefly) with them in front of screaming, cheering fans....but I don't
condone it in that 1) people pay to see Rush and not some fanatic 2) some
serious damage could occur to equipment or <insert your deity here>
forbid! to one of guys.
At any rate- does anyone have any similar stories they would like to share?
