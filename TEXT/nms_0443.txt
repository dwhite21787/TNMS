Ok, I was hoping that a casual mention would be enough, but it looks
like I'll have to Invoke Policy.  The practive of having lengthy
signature files has gotten out of hand!  This is to announce that I
do not want to see these in NMS postings, and I shall be imposing a
limit of five (5) lines for a .sig.  This should be plenty, and it's
more than some Usenet sites allow in posts (ours limits to 4 lines).
I will not be enforcing this strongly at first; I will send mail to
any offenders asking them to trim their .sig files.  If this fails, I
will manually edit them, and what is left is up to my discretion.  Also,
this policy will extend to include those who post lengthy pieces of lyric
text, unless it is inculded in a discussion.  Most of us know the words
by now, so please don't lengthen an already-large digest with extra padding,
please!  A line or two in a .sig is ok, but a paragraph is just too much.

The FAQL part 1 will come out this evening as a special edition, and I'll
try to arrange it so part 2 comes out in the next 12 hours or so...

Subject: Rush in New Mexico

After reading the NMS for a few weeks,  I thought I would share some gossip my
friends and I heard at the RTB concert in Las Cruces, NM.  We talked to some
guys that had followed RUSH's tour bus back to the hotel the night before the
concert and they went to the hotel bar and Geddy and Alex came down for a
drink
and they talked to them for a couple of hours.

	They talked about their music of course, but Alex also told them that
he really likes Santa Fe, New Mexico and is thinking about moving there
sometime in the future!  We live 30 minutes from Santa Fe, so we thought
that was pretty cool.  Of course, Alex is known for saying crazy things... how
many times has he said he was going to quit RUSH !?!

Enough with the gossip...

The RTB concert in Las Cruces was incredible.  Primus sucked! (of course),
it was there first appearance for the RTB tour and we thought they were pretty
good, although we would have loved to have seen Eric Johnson.  As to the boyz,
they were having a great time.  The audience was incredibly energetic
(at the Presto tour, most of the audience in Phoenix sat during the concert);
in Cruces, everyone was dancing, singing, and screaming the whole time.
It was great!  I agree, I think Neil's bandana is to keep the sweat out of his
eyes...

We were able to tape the ABC In Concert from last Friday, and I plan to
transcribe the interviews sometime this weekend when I get a chance.  As far
as copies of the tape for people, we don't have a second VCR to tape to and
the tape is in Super-VHS format.

Some of you might have noticed that my posts regarding singles
yesterday showed up as being from "nautilus@acm.rpi.edu".  This was
due to a bug in the system software whih is hopefully fixed.

From: Ron Braun &lt;braun@cs.ucdavis.edu&gt;

Hey all!

First, kudos to Mr. Rush-Mgr for making this a list worthy of 1300+!

I was interested to see so many other postings in support of CoS.  I
remember that I walked through a raging blizzard for a couple of miles one
late winter's eve in Germany to buy the album (having seen it at the local
base exchange earlier in the day, while penniless).   [Aside: what is the
most trouble any of you have gone to to buy a Rush album?]   Strangely, I
was rather disappointed when I got home and played it (of course, my
musical tastes weren't quite mature 10 years ago!).  It then sat on my
shelf for a few years, until I "rediscovered" it back in '86.  It blew me away
when I listened to it again!  It has since become possibly my favorite
long-term Rush album (I say long-term, because my favorite seems to
change from week to week...).  The mood that is established on that album
is incredible.  The background  guitar on part one of the Necromancer (not
to mention the other parts) still sends shivers down my spine!  I wonder if
a lot of people just haven't given the album a chance, having heard that it
is "their worst album"?  I can certainly lose myself in that album, moreso
than in most others.

BTW, someone asked a *long* time ago about what the back cover of CoS
represented.  I always thought it was fairly obviously the Fountain of
Lamneth itself, perched high atop Bacchus Plateau...

Re: Rush "childhood" experiences.  Long before I ever got into rock in
general and Rush in particular, my older brother (by 4 years) used to taunt
me by playing Rush at full volume on his stereo when our folks were out of
the house.  I *hated* Geddy's high voice and the sheer noise that they
could generate at the time, and so I'd get even by cranking out my mom's
Kenny Roger's records on the living room stereo at the same time!  Major
noise wars.  We musta sounded real interesting to the neighbors!
Fortunately, he redeemed himself when he moved out to go to college,
since he left behind a tape of songs from a bunch of different groups, one
of which was "Red Barchetta".  I loved that one song; used to play it ad
infinitum.  Finally went out and bought 2112 (since that was all the store
had by Rush), and the rest is history...

Subject: Rush - A "Giant of Rock"

The other day, I heard an add on WGN (Chicago TV). Some record store
was having a big slae, and the announcer was talking about how the
store was selling discounted CD of all the "Giants of Rock." He blabbed
on ..."Led Zeppelin, Guns and Roses (ugh!), Rush, Metallica" ...
Well, I guess there is one record store in Chicago which knows something
we've known all along....

Oh, well.

Subject: CoS

Hi Everyone,

I'm glad to hear all the positive reaction about CoS. I had the same
experience as most, way back in `81. It was the last Rush album that
existed at the time (!) that I hadn't bought. And _man_ what a pleasant
surprise I had! I love listening to CoS at night in the dark...what
an atmosphere it creates in headphones. The boys really got the raw
end on that little jewel. But clearly the hard times payed off in the
long run, and _we_ now appreciate the then underappreciated effort.

On another note, I don't at all see expressing the belief that a
band is the very best in something they do constitutes worshipping.
Even thinking in terms of worship seems to me warped. No one in America
even _conceives_ of worshipping a band, as far as I know. For more on
this subject see Neil's comments in the two-part interview with Neil
which appeared in Kerrrang during the Signals tour entitled ``This
(oops) ``The Spirit of Peart.''

Breaking news, I just heard the following:  Rush will be coming back to the NY
area on June 19th to play at the Meadowlands Arena AND June 20th at Jones
Beach on Long Island with an option for June 22.  Meadowlands is confirmed
Jones Beach is almost confirmed.

Mr. Big is confirmed to support on all dates this summer.

Later.

Subject: Title for Boxset and CoS

Thanks to all who participated in the Cassette/Boxset poll.  The results will
be released next week.  However, a title is still needed for the boxset.
Does anyone have any ideas?

I wish they would play songs from CoS more, I love "Lakeside Park" (Next time
I'm in Toronto I want to pay a visit).  It is a underrated album as well as
a stepping stone to greater success  2112, their next album, was a huge 
success)
In their history Rush has made albums which fall into this category

 Pernament Waves was a stepping stone for Moving Pictures
Signals broke ground for PoW and HYF and Presto became a stepping stone for
the success of RTB. I wonder if their next album will be a stepping stone
for another album or if RTB was a stepping stone for their next album.

Hmmm....

Sorry I flamed last issue (TNMS442) but sometimes what
people say (when not informed )	really annoy me.  'Nuff said.

Now for some handy-dandy trivia:

1) Geedy Lee's real name is Gary Lee Weinrib.  (Found that
at my library, after months and months of wondering.)

[ This is in the FAQL.                                         :rush-mgr ]

2) Alex Lifeson is the only member of Rush NOT to come from
Ontario (he comes from Fernie in N British Columbia.)

3) They once opened for Kiss and Aerosmith in the 1970's.

4) Willowdale (where Ged was born) is not on any map...it's
a suburb of Toronto (I think...)

5) Neil Peart used to sell tractor equipment when he was
playing for Rush.  (Chronicles insert said that.)

Well, that's all for now....Keep Rushing :)

&gt;	Interesting Responses to the oldies tour question(2112!!!); but too

&gt;band?  Or, would anyone in the Northeast like to START ONE (attn. bassists &
&gt;drummers!!!)

I know of a KICKASS Rush tribute band...They are called Freewill
and sound GREAT!! They have their own album too which
sounds a lot like the boyz. Their drummer is fat and sloppy
looking but can play those drumz(John Rutesy?).  He does
the rhythm method as good as Neil....you can flame me for that
but its true....anyone else out there heard Freewill?

From: "Hg" &lt;clxdo4c@BUACCA.BU.EDU&gt;
Subject: First Contact

Greetings and salutations, fellow followers.  This is my first post,
despite the fact that I've been on for a month or so, so I have a lot
to say.  For the sake of expediency:

1) SPINAL TAP: Give that man a BOX of cigars!  With Tap's new album due
out, what, March 17, what a beautifully twisted marriage--Tap opens for
Rush...never thought I'd see it in my lifetime!

2)Greg Johnson--DEFINITELY put Hold Your Fire on that list of yours.

3) There's a boot out here entitled "Temples of Syrinx"; all of
the somewhat meager liner notes are in italian.  The inside has a
few pix of the band, and interestingly enough, Geddy wielding a
double-neck.  My questions are these: Does Geddy's use of a double-necked
guitar somehow date the era of the recording?  Also, does anyone know
if its any good?  (I obviously refer here to the recording quality!)
If you could answer either question, private email me.  Thanks.

[ The double-neck bass puts that picture in the 78-81 time-frame; it was
  used in Xanadu & Hemispheres, others?                         :rush-mgr ]

4) What is "A Show of Fans", besides a pun?  A newsletter or something?

[ It's a fanzine subscribable through US mail.  See the FAQL for details.
                                                                :rush-mgr ]

5) I too missed the ABC program with Rush, and would be willing to
reimburse anyone who could get me a videotape of it.  Private email again.

6) Nose size to bass ability ratio:  Well Tim, I've been fooling around
with a bass for just under a year now, and I'm also in possession of
quite a Bergerac-ian schnozzola; my personal research shows no correllation
betwixt the two.  Too Bad!  (And I was working on the ponytail, too...)

7) I forget who mentioned it, but about Rush on the radio being better
than Rush on some prerecorded media--It's way-cool because no effort is
involved; it's like a gift from the Big Guy Upstairs, dig?

8) Lastly (he said, as the readers grew restless):  RUSH on MTV.
As people recently considered seeing no Rush on MTV, I began to think,
hey, there are what, 1100 of us 'servers out there?  What if, by some
freak of chance, ALL OF US CALLED MTV AND DEMANDED ONE SPECIFIC SONG?
All it would take is one person to name a date and a song.  Here is
what I propose:
Each of us would call up and request, say, Roll the Bones, maybe twice
if you're an out-of-control fanatic. (Remember, the request line is
open for what, two hours, and is TOLL-FREE!)  The only forseeable
problem is that some folks have no access to cable TV at school (not me,
but many others, I'm sure.).  This is why I also suggest that this be a
summer operation, since most of the younger folk will be at home.  We
are in the enviable position of being able to coordinate a vast number
of peoples' efforts quite cheaply and efficiently--why don't we capitalize
upon it?
Shall we give it a try?  Let's say Friday Mar 20, 1992.  We can consider
this a test-run, I guess.  I'd love to see the fans of Rush make such a
united effort...it's good for us; it's good for Rush; and it's also good
for all those unenlightened folk who have yet to be dazzled by the boys
from the Great White North.

We can walk our road together
If our goals are all the same
We can run alone and free
If we pursue a different aim
Let the truth of love be lighted
Let the love of truth shine clear
Sensibility
Armed with sense and liberty
With the heart and mind united
In a single
Perfect
Sphere....

Didn't Yes win a grammie for best instumental in 1982, with 'Cinema' ? Someone
told me so ages ago.

Oh yeah, and who is Eric Johnstone? He's totally unknown here in the UK.
Are his albums even available here?

Hey,
	Well, since Rush didn't come to Vegas, I have will have to come to
grips with the fact that as long as I live in this sweltering hell-hole of a
musical wasteland, where no-talent hacks like new kids on the block, boys to
men, and other musical losers sell out every time, I will never get to see
them live(in case you're missing it,this is an open cry for pity!)
	As to there being a correlation to Rush, and sci-fiction, it could be.
Though in this town the only people who listen to Rush, or groups similar in
any way(Pink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson) are musicians. Go figure!
	And another thing! I think the cancer crap is gone on far enough!
Neil obviously doesn't have cancer.  If he did he'd be dead by now! And as
for the bandana, maybe he is going bald, after all, none of them are exactl
young men any more( I came to the shocking realization yesterday that my dad 
is only 5 years older that Alex!) Or maybe he wears it because he likes it.

					So There!

Hi everyone!

A couple o' things concerning Neil:

1) There's a new CD single out for RTB, the song.  It's got 4 tracks on it.
	First is RTB, then WMT, then Superconductor (don't ask!), and then
track 4 is a 5 minute interview with Neil (interlaced with RTB).  He talks
a bit about RTB and Dreamline -- a little background behind the songs (my
favourite kind of stuff) -- it's pretty funny.  I'll try to get it trans-
cribed soon.  BTW, if ANYONE STILL has any doubts as to whothe mystery voice
is on RTB, it is GEDDY.  Now that the horse is seriously dead...
Anyway, I bought it for $11 at a used record shop, tho it wasn't used (CD,
not the shop).  I think it's a British import -- there's a bunch of British
concert dates on it.  (I'll list them for you Brits, altho I'm sure you
already know what they are...)

	10 April  Sheffield
	12 april  Birmingham NEC
	13 April     "
	15 April  Glasgow SECC
	17 April London Wembley Arena
	18 April     "

2) PLEASE.. someone tell me they taped Neil on "Off the Record"!!!!  I can't
BELIEVE I missed it!!  Damn!  I had a feeling I should've turned on the radio
but like an idiot, I didn't listen to my intuition.  I managed to get the
last 15 min of it, but if ANYONE managed to be luckier than I, I WOULD LIKE
A COPY, PLEASE!!!! (e-mail only, please)   {I hope this doesn't constitute
bootlegs...}.  anyway, for those that missed it completely and had no idea
it was going to be on (like moi), I know that they tend to repeat them
every once in a while so I WILL BE LISTENING!!!  Perhaps in the next couple
of months or so... Again, if anyone did tape it, I would love to have a copy.
if possible.

That's all for this week's Neil interview highlights (film at 11).

Until next time...

Subject: UK RTB singles... (where to get)

        For anyone looking for the UK RTB singles, my dealer got them for
me from Phantom records.  They have a large number of imports/rare stuff
that are hard to find anywhere (including Max Webster's BattleScar and even
tthe Japanese laserdisc of Marillion's Live from Loreley!).  Sorry,
but I don't have the 800 number for direct ordering.  Perhaps someone else
does??

Hey everybody.  Just got a call(at 7 a.m.) from my local Oneonta radio station.
Last week, I qualified to win a pair of tickets to the Rush show in Binghamton
this Thursday night.  Well they called me this morning to inform me that I WILL
BE GOING!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh my G-d, if I hadn't been woken out of a dead sleep i
think I would have probably made the woman on the other end deaf.  Should be a
great week ahead; Thursday night Rush in Binghamton, and then it's downstate
Sunday night for the Nassau Coliseum show.  Well take care all, and keep
rocking.

&gt;   Could somebody tell me if any Boston radio station plays Rush? The most
&gt;I've ever heard was Dreamline and Fly by Night each once and on different
&gt;stations. (Oh, and an interview with Alex before the concert.)

WBCN has been play a lot of Rush lately.  I have been hearing Ghost of
a Chance, Bravado, and Roll the Bones.

In answer to someone's question about Rush on Boston radio stations:
WBCN has been playing stuff from RTB a _lot_, in fact "Ghost" was one of
their most played songs for a long time.  They'll occasionally pull an
old one out of the vault, and they're better than the other stations about
playing something obscure.

WZLX plays the "hits" up through _Moving Pictures_, but is less inclined to
play the more obscure songs.

And, of course, WAAF plays Rush to death for a few months before any concert
in Worcester.
