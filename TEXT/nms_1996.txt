Subject: From a small town pub in.... Toronto

So I'm backpacking across Canada.  In the dead of winter.  Naked.   Without
a backpack.   
& I figure, "Hey...it's gettin a little cold.  How about I drag my necrotic
& frostbitten torso into this fine looking establishment."

The Orbit Room.  Seems nice enough.

"Guiness Extra Stout, please."
"Hey asshole!  Stop bleeding all over the floor!  We keep a clean place
here!"
"Sorry.  Can I drink it outside?"
"Yeah.  That'll be $300."

I drag myself outside, and proceed to try to enjoy my stout in peace. 
Until I remember that my lips froze & fell off a couple days ago.  How am I
going to drink this?  Then....
"Hey asshole!  Stop bleeding all over the entrance to my club!"
I look up.  Wow, cool.  It's Alex Lifeson!
"Hi Alex!"

WHACK!   Alex kicks me in the face with his Doc Martens.
"Ooh, thcuk!  My teef!  You kictt my teef out!"
"That'll teach you to bleed all over my..."
"Alex!"
"Oh, hey Ged."
"Alex, I think that's the guy posting those bullshit stories on the NMS."
"Crap!  I think you're right!"

So Alex pulls out his trusty 357 magnum & shoots me between the eyes with 3
rounds of hollow-point, armor-piercing teflon cop-killers.   Boy, did that
hurt.

Almost as much as all these flames I'm getting over a stupid piece of
3-minute fiction.
Lighten up, everybody.  Your poor backs are gonna break from carrying all
that fucking baggage.

Went to Bingo the other night, wearing a Rush t-shirt and met someone who
liked Rush, due to my shirt.  I thought this was a pretty cool place to meet a
Rush fan.  Anyone else meet a Rush fan at an unexpected place?
Oh yeah, one of my bingo cards had 21 AND 12 on it and I won 13  bucks.

 Point well taken. I think that the obvious is that Nobody is jumping up
and down over a live album, and everyone realizes that we won't be
seeing Rush live again until at least the year 2000. (Excuse me one
second...
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!.. Ok
I'm back). It seems as though everyone has dredged up every possible
Rush Thread , and everyone is getting a little bored with the same old
stuff. (at least that's my take on it), so I "guess" it's an attempt to
"deviate from the
norm".........................................................

Hello everyone,

Does anyone out there know of any "Rush Sites" in toronto?  I am going
vacationing there this summer and am just curious.  One I know of is the
danforth and pape intersection.  If anyone knows of any others, I would
greatly appreciate it if you would let me know.  Thank you.

Re Presto.
Yeah, I get the same problem regarding sound quality.  I can't even 
remember what War Paint sounds like tho'.  Must have really made an 
impression.  Every band has an album everyone forgets about.  Guess 
that must be the one.

Re: Chris =Sadlers' greatest hits enquiry
Archives was not a greatest hits package, but a promotional package 
of the first three albums, in a grey cover with the star logo.  
Before Chronicles, the Mercury severance payment deal, there was a 
single album sampler called Rush Through Tme.  By the way, the 
interview with Alex cd, something with the king, is easily available 
here in the UK.  There are two in my local Virgin Megastore (that's a 
record shop for the uninitiated)

I think that what we all need to do is go to WWW.JAMTV.COM, go to 
"Artists", find Rush, and listen to the Neil interview.  After 
hearing this interview I am convinced that we can expect plenty more 
from Rush.  In a nutshell, the band is very happy with the way that 
they are playing live and excited about the future...

Gidday fellow Rushians,

On the NMS homepage, one can download *.rm (real movie) files. No problem.
Downloading oocnews1.rm, size 2643212, no problem.
Downloading oocnews2.rm, size 2587047, no problem, BUT NO SOUND ! ! !
I tried it over and over again, but there's still no sound to be heared !
Am I the only one who experienced this hick-up, or are there 
more fans out there, who are "loosing it" ?

   [ Part two has no sound. I have yet to find the tape I made it from to
     replace it. I have no idea why the sound didn't come through that
     part...                                                  : rush-mgr ]

On the lighter side, I'd like to tell you how I became a Rush
fan. Way back in 1980, I was still living at home with mom, my
brother came to visit us for the weekend. When he left, he
accidently forgot a couple of tapes. I couldn't resist playing
them, and was shocked by it. It was Hemispheres, 2112, and Fly
by Night. Never in my live, I heared such music being performed.
Thrilled by the increddible bass, the thunderous drums, and
weeping guitar. At that time I was "into" Status Quo, AC/DC,
Iron Maiden, Picture, etc., so finally I found out what real
music was. Now, 18 years later, (I'm 32 now) still have seen them
just once ! (the RTB concert at Rotterdam) And that's only because
the guys hate to leave North America (I think)Got all their records
and cd's, and a couple of video's. Can't wait for the new live
album !

And now, Ladies and Gents, the totally unavoidable fav non-Rush
top 10 albums !:

1 - Quadrophenia - The Who
2 - Tommy - The Who
3 - B'sides themselves - Marillion
4 - The southern harmony and musical companion - The Black Crowes
5 - Ten - Pearl Jam
6 - Jagged little pill - Alanis Morissette
7 - The ultimate experience - Jimi Hendrix
8 - Woodface - Crowded House
9 - Corroboree - Split Enz
10 - Collective Soul - Collective Soul

Sorry for any spelling mistakes, and if it does bother you,
I'll write it in Dutch next time ! ;-)

See ya, Dirk

Here is a letter that I just e-mailed to VH1.  I don't know who had this
original idea but I think it is great, I encourage everyone to do the
same.  The Rush content is generic because I don't want to get too
fanatical with these guys.  I'll post a response if I ever get one.
Tell me what you think...

btw their address is request@VH1.com

What I really enjoy about your station, is the specials that you put on
about specific artist or groups.  i.e. Behind the Music, Storytellers,
Legends....
What I'd really like to see are some of the specials done on some cult
favorites such as Rush, Kiss, Black Sabbath.
Or maybe some mainstream artist that have gone through troubles such as
The Police or Van Halen.

I'm not all hard rock, the pieces that you did on Andy Gibb, Billy Joel
and Rick James were Fabulous!

VH1 represents what the music industry lacks, and that its information
about music!  

Rush is coming out with a double live album at the end of the year and
their 25 year reign looks like it *may* be coming to a close soon with a
recent tragedy that one of the member's family has just endured.  They
will also be eligible for the R&R hall of fame next year (great
coverage...loved the Mamas and Papas special!)  This would be a great
time to honor the band and it's fans with one of your specials.  This is
a group that has been underrated and almost ignored by the music
industry for way too long.  I'm sure you would get wonderful responses
from the fanatical fan base that the group quietly carries.

Also, in the tradition of the Rock and Roll picture show, have you guys
ever thought about airing concert videos much like MTV used to in the
early days?

Please think about it, and thanks for the music.

Subject: Golden age 

I had a reply to my regrets about never seeing Three Men of 
Williowdale on this side of the pond, telling me how lucky I was that 
I could get to see Marilliion easily or Fish doing a tour of pubs and 
similar small venues(English pub theme here, but I think 
this missed the point.  Talk of using recordings from the Hammersmith Odeon 
gigs in 1979 
brought back some sweet memories. I first saw Rush at the Hammy Odeon 
(as it then was, now the Apollo) in 1979 and 1980.  Then they 
switched to doing venues the size of barns (though I guess in North 
America these would qualify as small venues).  We got a Moving 
Pictures/Exit... tour combined in 1981- not bad really, because the sound 
quality at Wembley Arena was about as good as on Exit...  In 1983 
there was the Signals tour, then 1987, Hold Your Fire.  Five years 
later we got to Roll the Bones, and nothing since.  I guess we were 
spoiled around the turn of the seventies/eighties.  For us, that was 
the Golden Age.  Spirit of Radio (single version) went into the 
charts (!!!), and Sounds (which no longer exists) treated Rush as the 
house band (see Geoff Barton for details).  But the writing was on 
the wall in an interview I read with Neil Peart (the syntax of this 
sentence is all over the shop) around 1981/1982, which was one of Dr 
Braino's outpourings about privacy (cf Limelight) and British fans.  
Reading between the lines, it more or less read "fuck off, our 
British fans".  Then you read the sleeve notes in I don't remember 
which album, all about not asking to get bigger and not being able to 
spread themselves.  We have been a long, long time in Babylon
Digital Man

'Fuck off, our British fans',  How do you like that for an NP 
quotation?

Subject: Re: Drummers

Hey Rushians,

Does anyone else out there like Rod Morgenstein (Dixie Dregs, Winger, 
Rudess-Morgenstein Project)?  I listened to some Dixie Dregs, and this guy 
can really play some skins.  Just haven't seen his name mentioned among 
all the great drummers, because there are quite a few of them.  As for the 
Peart-Portnoy debate, it is still up in the air for me, because I like both
bands so much and they are both extremely talented drummers and percussionists.
So I think the jury is still out on that case.  I want to drum so bad, so I 
am going to be taking lessons next semester (I don't expect to be great, but 
maybe I can have some fun playing and maybe have a band for fun).

Later,
Kevin

Subject: hidden 2112 in RTB cover!!

Anyone ever noticed that there are exactly 21 1/2 dice
across the CD cover of Roll the Bones?  Count 'em and weep!!
Coincidence?  You decide.  Anyone wanna nominate me for a
Syrinx award?  No?  I'm taking my dice and going home then
(thru silent streets of course).  

Fun with numbers:
No, rush are NOT satan worshipers, but things that make
the paranoid go HMMMMM:
Cover of RTB again, BLACK dice spelling RUSH:
    9 twos:   2+2+2 = 6 three times = 666
    6 threes: 3+3 = 6 three times = 666
    9 fours:  4*9 = 36 is 6*6    getting spooky, huh?
    5 fives:  one word: pentagram
    9 sixes:  3 666's one for each member.

    White dice in RUSH block:
	 6 threes in bottom, middle & top row:
        666's galore mix 'n match at will!
    10 threes in row with 5's:  3*10 = 30 divided by 5 = 6
        or enough for two more pentagrams (a total of three,
        one for each member!
    9 threes in row with 3's:  a total of 15 threes in this
        row, 3 pentagrams!

Isn't THAT special?
Not satan worshippers, INDEED!! Anyone reconsidering?
MOO HA HA HA AH HA HA HAAAaaa!

Doh!  There went my shot at a syrinx.

Subject: Favorite era

Why is everyone so stuck on arguing which Rush music is better? Do you like
the old or the new? Where the hell is the dividing line? Does anyone out
there see Rush like I do? In my opinion, Rush's music is an ongoing epic,
and ALL their music is noteworthy. Sure I have my favorite tunes, but I see
the band as a constantly evolving group of musicians who refuse to be held
back by what the Popular Genre says is the good stuff. The lyrics, as well
as the music, are TIMELESS. I  have a friend who said he only listens to
CLASSIC Rush. I asked him what the hell that means. He said,"You know, only
the older Rush". I said "Don't you get it? Rush is older NOW than they were

then, and their personal tastes have changed to encompass their life
experiences. With lives like they have led, ANYONES outlook is sure to
change, especially with a career that spans TWO DECADES!" Therefore, their
music will also change. But the fact remains: RUSH has yet to create
tasteless music, and the integrity of their music and lyrics will surely be
classic in time. So stop worrying about when is better, and focus on the
fact that such interesting music holds its own even today. The guys are
merely writing what feels good to them, and THAT is proof that they haven't
"SOLD OUT".
I personaly am looking forward to the next direction they will take. After
all, haven't they just about covered everything you can tastefully think? I
am dead-sure they will surprise us again.
OK, I'm off the soapbox now.

Subject: Silver lining, part 2....Rush Saved my studio.

I went to a company Christmas party this last year where I work. There was
a bad storm going on in my area and the power went off. Therefore, so did
my alarm system, wich I hadn't set up to run through a power outage yet. I
have a great little recording studio on the property with all kinds of
killer gear set up inside... MIDI equipment out the ying-yang, a couple of
Jackson guitars, an Ibanez 5-string bass, MY Computer, keyboards, mixers
and adat recording decks... you get the picture. Anyway, all this stuff is
set up and ready to run, 'cause I use it every day. So, I leave the house
for the party, the power goes off, and I've got no protection. At least,
not at home.(I DID have some in my wallet, tho.)  Two punks break into the
studio, and root around inside for awhile. What the hell are the chances
that some kids decide to break into someones "shed", there is an alarm that
is temporarily knocked out, IN THE MIDDLE OF A FREAKIN' SNOWSTORM? Well, it
happened. I caught them on their way out and was ready to kill them. I made
them go back into the studio so I could look around while my girlfriend
called the cops. BUT NOTHING WAS MISSING!  When my girlfriend came out, I
asked her if they'd been in the house. She said no. Finally I asked them
why they would risk their lives breaking into my studio, and they said they
thought it was just a shed. I asked them why they didn't take anything,
'cause I thought, MAN, ALL THAT STUFF HAD TO BE TEMPTING!!!!

They said they saw my rush tape and CD collection, wich is in a display
case on the wall, and is complete with EVERY tape and CD rush has so far
made, and decided not to take anything 'Cause of their own respect for the
band!
Then the cops got there and took them away. How could I have gotten luckier?
THANKS, RUSH, Your music saved my studio.
Bye.

Well, it's usually been the same with most Rush albums hasn't it?  The
thing is that probably most people were expecting a straight ahead
party-rock-band type of album, and with Rush we're always wondering what
the hell are they going to come up with the next time, which is, imho,
great.

Every album is a new direction for Rush.  They are true to themselves and
their music.  Isn't Rush's constant Evolution one of the primary reasons we
love this band?.  Why is it such a big deal for somebody else to change and
evolve?.  The way I see it, they're not trying to be Rush, they're being
true to themselves and their music, and maybe, as Hector put it, it might
be a step in the right direction, but not to be like Rush, but to be an
true integral band.

What the f@#k are you talking about?!?  They've just released a new album
for God's sake, what the hell do you expect?!?

Rush, on the other hand, is on what probably will be their longest hiatus
between studio albums (hopefully, it will be just that, a break).

Chill out dude, and in the mean time, LEARN TO F@#KING WRITE!!!

TOP 5 DRUMMERS:

1. NEIL PEART - 'nuff said.
2. CARTER BEUFORD - blows my mind how all over the place he is but still
manages to be musical.
3. STEWART COPELAND - Mr. Odd-placed accents himself.  Is it possible to play
a Police song EXACTLY the same way as he did on an album, even for him???
Also, anyone remember "Don't Box Me In" from the film Rumble Fish.  He did
this with Stan Ridgeway (Wall of Voodoo frontman) in the early 80's.  Another
kickin' Stew' tune. . .
4.KENNY ARNOFF - John Cougar's drummer, currently with John Fogarty (sp?).
Solid and professional.
5. NICKO McBRAIN - No, not the limited time special sandwich @ McDonald's -
the drummer for Iron Maiden.  If you don't give him credit, you haven't REALLY
listened to him.

 HONORABLE MENTIONS-
ZACHARY ALFORD - Did some of the drumming on Billy Joel's "River of Dreams"
(some of the best modern studio drumming I have heard) and is currently with
touring with David Bowie.
LIBERTY DEVITO - I just like him and can't justify me reasons.  I WON'T, DAMN
IT!!!  I WON'T!!!
PHIL COLLINS - ditto.

TOP 5 NON-RUSH ALBUMS (no particular order):
For me, these are based upon the # of really good tunes on an album.  No
"Greatest Hits" albums are included for obvious reasons.

Behavior/Please - PET SHOP BOYS
Wish You Were Here/Momentary Lapse. . . - PINK FLOYD
Abbey Road/Sgt. Pepper's. . . - BEATLES
Synchronicity - THE POLICE
Face Value - PHIL COLLINS

Very good.  Carry on. . .

Well, both my husband & I like Madrigal, so there is no problem there.
It's one of the more likely choices if I'm trying to play music that
won't offend three generations of my family.  Would Cygnus X-1 be more
appropriate?

The problem is that according to you if I did choose Madrigal to be
played at my wedding, the union (in this case) of man and woman, people
would think I was gay?  Hmmm...logic?  Anyone?  Buehler?  ;)

Subject: Adding to the din

Hey Rushians!

How's it going?

Well, I think it's time to send a word to the newer NMSers:

Don't unsubscribe yet!!  This whole secret society/k.a.r. thing is not
the normal M.O. of the NMS.  It will die down with time and heavy
drinking, so don't think all NMSers are in a bizarro world.

Remember:  Many people listen to Rush and go on to lead normal lives.

That said, I think I understand a little of what's going on here (except
the weapons talk).  When I was a college freshman, lo those many years
ago, a friend and I had a storyline going on where we played different
people or would pretend like we encountered musicians or characters from
TV or movies.  It was fun, helped us be creative, and passed the time.
Kind of like D&D without the graph paper.  Anyone who didn't know what
we were doing would, of course, think we were crazy.  Knowing this, we
didn't share our little playacting with the whole, damn world.

Time hasn't stood still, and my friend & I drifted apart.  That little
fantasy is done, just like the storyline I had with another friend in
6th grade.  Harmless fun for young girls.

Now, finally, to my point.  I think this is Julien's and others' way of
being creative and mysterious.  They get NMSers talking about what
they're doing, who they are, etc..  They are getting the attention they
desire, so they keep on.  I don't know the core reason they have a
fetish for the band and look to them in an extreme way for inspiration,
but we all have to find our way, and this apparently is the path they've
chosen.  Or, they're full of shit and like to stir things up.  Now,
that's annoying.

I know this post is just adding fuel to the fire, but I like to do my
part.  Burn Baby Burn!

Thanks for reading.

Hi gang --

The 98 Rock station here has a "Guest Chef" every Friday.  People can
fax in their "picks" and play guest DJ during the station's "Flashback
Cafe" hour.  Naturally, I came up with a list (not great) which
includes Rush, or course.  :)  I haven't sent it yet, so we'll see what
they think.... 

I decided to put in "Distant Early Warning", for various reasons.
But when I played it to get a feel for the song in context with the 
other songs, I realized with a heartache that I miss Rush.  I mean I 
MISS Rush.  I MISS being over-the-top, gung-ho, nutzoid to the hilt,
angst-ridden, animalistic GIMME ALBUM NOW passionately mento over  
them.  The Year of _Grace Under Pressure_ was simply THE most FUN I  
ever had with regards to Rush.  That January, I discovered/realized 
who Rush was.  Instant loyalty.  The next several months were filled 
with discovering that RUSH played all these songs I loved:  Limelight,
Subdivisions, Freewill, Fly By Night, 2112, the list goes on.   
	And then, like I'd been rewarded for digging for treasure: a 
new Rush album, _Grace Under Pressure_!  Hunkered down by the radio, I
soaked up DEW and "The Body Electric".  To hell with Cloud 9 -- I'm 
in the VIRGO CLUSTER!!  That summer found myself in Muncie, IN, New
York and San Fran for a drama class trip and visiting family.  My Rush
tape was all I needed.  I prayed to every deity known to let Rush come
to Hawaii on a tour.     
	In September, while on the bus to school, coming out of the
tunnel, I hear "Tom Sawyer"!  Difficult to hear with the bus and the
kids in my ears.  Strain...but the song changes.  ?  Put 'Tom Sawyer'
back!  Wait, sounds like... New World Man.  But it changes to 
Subdivisions.  What is this!  Can't decide what song ya want?!  And
then a voice, deep and dramatic, rings out over all the noise and
chaos -- "For the first time in Hawaii, RUSH in concert!" 
	AHHH!!  I have to cup my hand over my mouth to keep from
screaming.  The girl sitting next to me looks askance at me like I'm a
lunatic.  MMMM!  MMMMMMMM!  I squirm in my seat, screaming in silence.
I am bouncing off the walls for the next 3 months....  
	November...and THEY arrive.  Glued to my radio the entire week, 
I wanted to catch every mention of their name.  The first concert had
sold out, so they added a second.  I almost didn't get to either one.
But my brother offered to take me  -- and it was the most glorious 2
hours I'd witnessed.  98 Rock had been going crazy over them, except
they didn't seem to know Neil's name.  He was always, "the other guy".
And altho I've seen better shows, both technically and energy-wise, 
that 2nd show at the NBC Arena in Honolulu will always be the first
one I think of.  The lasers weren't working, couldn't understand a
*thing* Count Floyd said, Geddy missed a cue during "Vital Signs" 
leaving the stage completely SILENT for a few seconds, and Neil almost
killed himself trying to retrieve a delinquent stick he'd thrown.  
	But I couldn't get the grin off my face.  RUSH was here.
We're in the *same building*.  Ecstacy didn't come close.... 

	Since then, I've been on a handful of roadtrips to see Rush,
squealing with excitement; I've met them; seen them almost get killed
on the freeway trying to outrun fans; I've seen good shows, fantastic
shows, and not-so-great shows.  But I still MISS them -- miss that
glorious year in 1984 when I fell in love with a band I knew all my
life; MISS the sheer joy of discovering older songs I'd never heard
before.  I miss being a Rush fan without the angst of wondering if 
'this is their last tour' or if 'this is their last album'.  I miss
Rush the way they were when I disovered them.  

Sometimes, the passage of time just plain *sucks*.... :|  

puanani   "Why am I here?" my mom, forgetting why she walked into the room.
	  "Because we're here...,"  me.

Subject: idle ramblings

I thought I might chime in with a list of my own personal non rush-relaited
music that I have been listining to recently.

1. Yes - Keys to Accension II - The 20 minute opus "Mind Drive" is worth the
price of the entire CD. IMHO as good as anything they've ever done. 

2. Mike Keneally - Sluggo - Sent away for it and got it about a week ago.
Some great stuff. Better than "Hat" but I think I still like "Boil That Dust
Speck" better.  This will require more listenings.

3. Radiohead - OK Computer - I don't know if it's the haunting ballad type
melodies, the awesome insturmental power or both but I can't stop listening
to it.

4. King's X - Ear Candy - This CD came out last year but I'm still hooked.
Great straight-ahead rock but tastefully done.

5. Queen - Queen II - My favorite Queen album, highly underated. Very
dynamic with songs melding into each other and beautiful melodies. I think
this album could actually be called progressive if not a concept album.

6. Yes - Relayer - This to me is like the album from Mars.  All the songs
are typical of nothing and still sound ahead of their time today. "Sound
Chaser" is a bizarre charging locomotive type of a song that breaks into an
electric flamenco guitar instrumental section followed up by a wierd
multi-tempo bass/drums/keyboard bit. And not to mention "Gates of Delirium".
In terms of lyrics and musicality "Gates" rates easily with "Hemispheres" as
my favorite non-rush concept-type story song. 

Rush related material - Last week I happened to be in a local used cd/video
store. I perused the rush section finding nothing of interest. As I was
leaving I glanced down to see a video cassette box with  the word Rush on
it. I stopped for closer examination. It was non other than the "Through The
Camera Eye"  video. And for $5 bucks yet!  The clerk was not nearly excited
as I was when I tried to explain to him how difficult it was to find this
out of print rarity.
 
I remain,
Bill
