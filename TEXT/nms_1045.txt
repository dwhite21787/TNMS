should be able to automate everything (kinda like majordomo).

If you haven't checked out the Rush Web pages lately, do so! We've added a
Rush "guest log", add yourself & see who else is there! The Web site will also
probably be moving from its cerf.net home to here on syrinx, now that httpd is

I don't think Neil considers himself an objectivist.  I don't.  BTW,
anyone who  is an objectivist necessarily is politically a libertarian.
"Libertarian" refers to a political ideology, while objectivism is a
complete philosophy  which also happens to be the proper foundation of
libertarianism.  If you're not already subscribed, a couple lists you

Well it's been a while since I posted to the NMS, probably since the last tour.
But I have decided that computers are a necessary evil and use them only when
I absolutely have to.  Hell, I haven't logged on since Oct. 4.  For some of you
that might seem incomprehensible, but alot of your lives revolve around
computers; mine does not!  But I was actually reading the last issue and felt
compelled to answer a fellow subscriber's question, as I know I have asked many
myself.  I believe I have answered this question before, and I think it might
be in the FAQL, but I will answer it anyway.

Before I answer it I do have to give credit to my sister an NMS subscriber
Amy Moseley Rupp for deciphering those whispering voices...

Thery are as follows:

"Hello?"
"Good morning Guv."

This would be an English type of greeting, guv being of course short for
governor.

Hope this helps.
Until next time!

That's fancy, inventive, fun to listen to.  Probably the most underused talent

     I agree.  the art rock "progressive" music was the best movement Rock and

                        This one is so good that it equals a Rush album!

Subject: Tour technical question

Hey guys,
     Saw your counterparts tour in Dallas, Texas and was just wondering if
there was a technical problem with the sound amps at the beginning of the
show.  Usually, your concerts have had unsurpassed acoustical quality but I
noticed that the last one started out with a little too much tweak or treble.
 Was this something you noticed?
    About fifteen minutes into the performance, all was well (actually
excellent).  Just curious.  Hope you all have a nice holiday.

In NMS #1043, Heinz Reiske <reiske@eden.rutgers.edu> supposes:

I always took this song as a commentary on the overall "deterioration" of
this planet, and its "higher species" (us?).  This naturally includes
the sorry state of the environment.  I don't think the environmental overtones
are allegorical at all.  The lyrics say it pretty plainly, and literally,
as does Neil himself.

	"Stay out of the sun
	 It only burns my skin
	 Sky full of poison
	 And the atmosphere's too thin"

Seems pretty straight forward in its intent to me.  Then, there's:

	"River running like an open sore"

or the line that includes the title itself...

	"and the red tide washes ashore"

Now, this doesn't make him pro-environmentalist in the sense that he joins
Green Peace and goes out sinking whaling boats or tuna fishing boats.  But
it does mean he cares about the environment he lives in.  Neil says in
reference to the song:

	"It's a bit of a selfish concern, really. I really love
	 wildlife, and I spend a lot of my time in the
	 outdoors when I'm not working, so that's important to me.
	 One of my main hobbies is cycling, so air quality kind of
	 becomes of critical importance."  -- Neil Peart

Does that sound like the environmental message of the song was allegorical?

The first verse of the song provides insight into another scourge that is
symbolic of the deterioration of life.

	"Fugitives at the bedroom door
	 Lovers pause to find an open store"

	"...in the first verse, when I'm talking about 'Nature's new
	 plague' and then 'Lovers pausing at the bedroom door to
	 find an open store' and all that, to me that was obviously
	 referring to AIDS ...  irony of modern life, you know, where
	 spontaneous love still certainly does occur, but here are
	 two lovers who have just met in the middle of the night, and
	 they have to go find a store before they can consummate their new
	 relationship"  -- Neil Peart

Again, I don't think this means he's necessarily an activist on either
side of that (t)horny issue, but rather is just citing it as an example
of how life and the way we live have changed.  There was once a time when
you didn't have to think so much about the safety of the air you breathe,
or the sex you have.  Those days are sadly gone.

  Subject: Question on Manhattan Project
  **stuff deleted**
  The above discussion prompted me to ask a question about Manhattan
  Project.
  If this has been covered before, please ignore my posting. Is this song
  just
  a commentary about the creation of the first A-bomb?

  "All the powers that be and the course of history will be
  changed for evermore"

  Or, is Neil trying to make a statement for or against the project.
  I know this is a debatable topic. Some feel the two bombs dropped on
  Japan
  helped in ending the war sooner, while others think such weapons are too
  harmful and their use can never be justified.

  Any comments?

  *******
  True, the song itself does describe the creation of the A-bomb.  But it
  also
  gives an example of how throughtout time man has used certain inventions
  to gain control of others.  If you had seen the song performed in
  concert, a
  cartoon was shown while they played the song, illustrating other
  inventions
  man had created to gain advantages in warfare: a sling shot, bow and
  arrow,
  gun, etc.  Also in the concept of the album Power Windows, to obtain an
  advantage in war via creating weapons, is one window showing an abuse
  of power...which in turn lead to Territories :-)  The problem lies in
  man's
  application, ie when and to what extent it is used, of the invention and
  not the
   invention itself.

  I listen to *many* kinds of music, I have about 300 CDs.  Other groups I
  listen
  to include:  The Brand New Heavies, Sade, Steely Dan, Prince (*b4* he
  changed
  his name), Police, Iron Maiden, Gangstarr, Acoustic Alchemy...just to
  name a few :-)

Subject: RED TIDE . . . Yes, it's pro-environmental!!!

To Heinz Reiske and his "right" company ("Mr. Ambrose," etc.):

	"Digital Man" wants to proudly inform us all that "RED TIDE is NOT
a pro-environmentalist song."  Sorry, Heinz, but why don't you check your
facts--AND REALLY LISTEN TO THIS BEAUTIFUL SONG--before you do throw
around any more one-sided political elitism!  By blindly wielding your
right-wing propaganda, you show yourself to be extremely ignorant to the
political and philosophical background--not to mention the
well-documented outdoor lifestyle--of the lyricist of our favorite band.

	In a detailed explication of the song found on the promotional
interview CD for PRESTO entitled "Rush - Profiled!", Neil himself
answers the question "What is 'Red Tide' about?" as follows:
	"It's a bit of a selfish concern, really.  [Lookey here, Heinz!!!]
_I really love wildlife, and I spend a lot of my time in the outdoors when
I'm not working, so that's important to me._  One of my main hobbies is
cycling, so air quality kind of becomes of critical importance.  So it is a
selfish thing, [Did you know this, Heinz?] _and it's something I've written
about before, on the previous album - the song 'Second Nature'._ . . .
[And how about this for "anti-environmentalism"!!!] So, with 'Red Tide'  it
was a little more adamant, because I think the time is a little more critical,
and I had to be firmer about it . . ."

	Neil then continues, "but still there are ways of getting at it, and
to me there are jokes in there, too, that probably no one in the world will
ever get, but in the first verse, when I'm talking about 'Nature's new plague'
and then 'Lovers pausing at the bedroom door to find an open store' and all
that, to me that was obviously referring to AIDS, but it was the irony of
modern life, you know, where spontaneous love still certainly does occur, but
here are two lovers who have just met in the middle of the night, and they have
to go find a store before they can consummate their new relationship, you
know, and to me, when I put those things down, I have a smile, but I know
that it's one that will never be shared."
	So rather than being a pivotal image of the song--the nexus of an an
extended conceit in which a seeming pro-environmentalism is merely a mask
for a song about relationships (as Mr. Reiske writes, "Environmental
overtones are used as an allegory for the difficulties facing romantic
relationships)--the lovers running to 7-11 for a pack of
trojans is merely this: a cleverly conceived joke!!!  (Neil does have a
sense of humor, you know.)  But significantly, it is a joke that is couched
in a very serious issue, the AIDS crisis--which we know Neil has also
addressed in the first verse of CP's "Nobody's Hero." (No, Mr. Reiske, I DON'T
want to know what language your extreme right-wing P.O.V. will couch this issue
in!)  While certainly NOT a specifically envirnomental issue (though you
MAY want to read Richard Preston's besteller "The Hot Zone" for more on that
possibility), the AIDS crisis is surely another signifcant concern for this
very socially conscious lyricist!

	And NO, I do NOT come from the extreme left!  In today's world (fast
self-destructing, despite Mr. Reiske's pseudo-scientific pulpit), it
seems hard than ever to make up own's mind in relation to the global
platforms of our two political parties. On the contrary, I am a FREE &
INDEPENDENT THINKER (Remember, I AM a lifelong Rush fan--"Anthem" an all that)
>. . . but YES, I am also very much in favor of saving what precious little 
remains of unadultered land and wildlife on our planet.

	Sorry to waffle on so much, but as someone else mentioned-- BIG
issues seem to demand verbosity!  Before I depart, however, as further
proof of the strong "PRO- ENVIRONMENTAL" ideology behind this wonderful song,
it is helpful to consult a March 1990 interview from "Guitar World"
magazine, where Alex speaks about his solo in "RED TIDE":
	"I wanted to get a lot of tension in that solo because the song is quite
intense.  There's a kind of disturbing feeling about that solo, which I think
ties it all together well.  The song is angry.  Neil is basically a very
ecology-minded person, and he wrote this song dealing with the destruction of
our environment.  So I wanted the music, and especially my solo, to reflect
that anger."

Hey "DIGITAL MAN,"
Enough said.

Howdy!

There was talk about why double albums were labeled A/D B/C.  Well, my
own theory goes like this:  back in the stone age when there were
turntables, many models came with an extended center post that you could
load up with as many as 6 albums at a time.  When the turntable was
turned on, one ablum would drop from the stack and then play.  At the end
of that album, the needle would move to its starting position, and the
next album in the stack would drop.  If you label a double album set
A/D,B/C and put it on that type of turntable, it would play in the
correct order.  First A, next ablum drop would be side B, you flip the
stack over then C and D.

Next item:  My very own NMS T-Shirt for the Anniversary Gift.  I ordered two
and have only received one so far but the one I have I love!!  It's the
Mars on the Horizon shirt and I think it's pretty darn peachy, it fits
AND I haven't washed it with a red sock yet so it's still white!!  It's
going to a good cause and in celebration of a great band so guys, order
yours today!!

Next item: Concerning the Red Barchetta possibly being made by Ferrari(?)
 - do you think the dealership will take an '86 beat-up Toyota truck as a
trade-in??

Nest item:  Concerning bands/concerts I'd like to see:  I was fortunate
to catch the Yes orchestra tour (that was the tour that had most of the
past and present Yes members in it).  What I would LOVE to see would be a
concert with Rush and Yes on the stage together.  The creative forces of
both bands combined would be astounding!!  I think it would even be
better than the concert I went to where Stevie Ray Vaughan, B.B. King and
Joe Cocker just had a free-for-all jam.  Talk about awesome...

Last item:  Before the Time of the Dark (when the NMS was otherwise
indisposed) there was a thread concerning the artwork inside the 2112
album.  Speaking as a female Rush fan, all I can say is, "What red star?"

Subject: That Nutty Alex Guy

Hi, y'all,

There was a post last week about Alex's bizzare "introductions" on the last
tour.  I caught two shows, in Pensacola and Atlanta.  There were no intros in
Pensacola (and hey, the sound was so bad there, it's a good thing too.  Can
you figure that one out?  Two weeks rehersal, and the actual show sounds like
they set up in ten minutes), but in Atlanta a couple of months later, Lerxt
was on the loose.

Early in the show, Alex steps up and tells some (really bad) bar jokes (and
the crowd loved them all).  Geddy made a few cracks about the Braves and the
World Series (and the crowd from the home of the Braves booed the hell out of
him--but in good humor).  But the capper came during the break on "Closer to
the Heart."  Alex runs over to Geddy's mike and starts doing a lounge-lizard
patter while thrashing away on the three chords.  Geddy and Neil are looking
at him like he's nuts (and they were right).

So finally, Alex says, "I'd like to introduce the combo!  On the bass and
piano, it's . . . Jamie Farr!"  (crowd loves it)  "On the drum kit, it's . .
>. Karen Carpenter!  Doesn't she look great!"  (crowd loves this even more)
 "And me . . . " (long pause) " . . . I'm RICHARD GERE!"  (crowd goes
berzerk)

Sorry if you've heard this a zillion times already, but it was a hoot.

The biggest secret of Geddy's tone is to PLAY VERY HARD.  Watch him in
concert sometime, he WHANGS on those strings, often using more than one
finger at a time to really get it moving.  My theory is that he had a
wimpy amp when he started playing, and had to do that to be heard above
the drums and guitar.

  the album?
    I always felt that it shows the aftermath (or Afterimage) of a nuclear

  of chaos.  There

Hello all,

Everyone knows how difficult it is to see Rush Videos anywhere in the US. MTV
and VHI do not dare to.

Well I was in Hechts department store with my wife and while we were waiting in
line in the ladies cloths dept. on the video screens all of a sudden came the
video for NOBODY'S HERO. I was SHOCKED.

I had heard about the video but was not sure if I would ever be able to see it!

So anyone in the DC/MD/VA area go to Hechts in the ladies section, they should
have the monitors showing videos. I think NH came on after a version of 'Red Red
Wine' (not UB40 though).

I was shocked!!!!
Good luck

Excuse me?  Do you think the Pentagon has this giant slot machine that turns
out B-2 bombers if you insert a couple billion?  Defense spending DOES create
jobs, pal, and cuts in the DOD budget take them away.  Trust me, I'm an
aerospace engineer, and I was laid off in October.  Get a clue before you say
something that stupid again.  I quote Neil:

"I mean, it's not people's fault that it [the USA] became the most successful
country and the richest country and the most powerful country, it just
happened, you know, because people worked and people were into it, and they
did it.  So, you can't fault them for being the most powerful and having that
incredible responsibility.  I mean, it's easy to point fingers at figures in
government and so on and blame the government for a lot of things, and of
course, there's a tremendous amount of Reaganitis about, but really, it's a
bit facile to do that.  Anyone who thinks about it a little more and learns a
little more about the history of the country and why things are the way they
are knows that America didn't go out and buy a bunch of nuclear bombs just so
they could be the big guys on the block, you know?  It was strictly a
historical imperative that they--it's a hysterical imperative.  They had to,
you know.  There was no choice and there is no choice."
(from _Innerview_, 1984)

Got a news flash for you, bud, the folks working in defense (most especially
the people in uniform) do a lot more productive work in a month than every
sociology department (to take one soft-psuedo-science example) put together
in ten years (including protecting your right to say that we all ought to be
out of work).  Sheesh, I bet you didn't complain when we invaded Haiti to
install a damn anti-American Marxist.

Subject: RE:  Red Wax Hemispheres
Date: Fri, 30 Dec 94 15:24:00 CST

Hello all!

Way back in Issue 1024, Arvid Hokanson asked for information about the red
vinyl edition of Hemispheres.  I was going to respond to him personally, but
I thought that others might be interested as well.  Here's the little that I
know:

The red vinyl version is certainly a nice collectable.  It's pretty rare.
 In all my days of searching out the Boys' stuff, I've only seen one copy.
 By comparison, I've run across maybe four or five copies of the Hemispheres
picture disc (which I believe was released at the same time, during the
initial promo period for that album, and is still pretty hard to find).

I think that $28 is a fair price.  But you should know that this version was
released containing a Rush poster.  If the poster is missing, you might be
able to talk the price down a few dollars.  You should also know that the
red vinyl is not going to have a superior sound.  In fact, it might not
sound as good because colored vinyl was often more brittle than regular
black vinyl.  But you don't want to play it anyway (that's what CDs are
for!).  This is just something cool to add to your Rush collection.

BTW, the poster was not exclusive to the red vinyl version.  The first (I
don't know how many) pressings of the regular album also contained it.  So
those who are interested in such things should check out any Hemispheres
albums they might see at record stores, shows, etc.  The poster is live
shots of the band in concert and will be found in the sleeve holding the
album.  It's also something cool to have (if for no other reason than that
it's more pictures of our favorite musicians)!

I hope this wasn't too boring, and I apologize if someone's already covered
this stuff in Issues 1035-1043.  Sometimes I allow my work to interfere with
the more important things, like keeping up with TNMS.  I've got to stop
doing that....

I don't get cable, so I didn't see "Beavis and Butthead."  Oh well.  I
find it interesting that people are surprised to see Rush on their show.
Remember, Neil did give them some exposure on the "Burning for Buddy"
album.  Just look at one of his pictures and you'll see what I mean.  Zoinks!

In response to a "Rush Christmas album," uh, I don't think so.  Geddy is
Jewish, so singing "Oh Come All Ye Faithful" would be sort of two-faced.
That could be bad.

I am trying to figure out which UltraDisk I should get first.  I am torn,
because I only can afford one per paycheck.  I think I will get Signals,
because I like New World Man and Analog Kid, but I also like the other
two.  Realize, I like RUSH, so the choice is difficult.  Any opinions?
You can reply to me personally, because it would be crazy to do it here.

Not too much else to say, so I will sit back and relax.

Sorry to burst your bubble...but it just isn't in the realm of

Is Neil Peart an Objectivist?
This discussion is interesting, but I would doubt that he considers himself
an Objectivist.  Rand is a definite influence, but so are many other authors
from very diverse backgrounds.  Whether he is a left wing libertarian, a
logical positivist, or just "cool", I don't think his "ism" is as important
as what he has to say.

Personally, I find Neil Peart's lyrics as important as Rand's writing,
especially if someone wants to look at something from a different point of
view.  I agree with the person who suggested that when you read Rand to read
the Branden biographies.  These bios and Peart's writings help one understand

Fellow RUSH fans,

I recently found the NMS Web home page while tinkering
with a newly acquired Mosaic for Windows.  To say I was
ecstatic would be a severe understatement.  I used to
monitor (sadly, never post to) the various messages
regading RUSH in rec.music.misc while I was still
attending Hope College in Michigan, between HYF and
Chronicles.  Now, I am working at Ft. Monmouth, NJ, and
the powers that be are very stingy with their E-Mail
accounts.  So much so, that myself and 4 others have to
share a single "organizational" account (one other is an
RUSH-an, named John who might also be posting - just keep
checking the signature).

Anyways...just what is all this rambling about?  I read
Digest.1043 and there was a reference to an 800 # for
acquiring "Burning for Buddy"  What is the number?  Is is
still active?

Funny enough, I was going to start looking in the music
stores for the disc after seeing a piece on CNN.  They had
a segment on all the "Tribute" albums in 1994.  At one point
they showed an excerpt of an interview with Neil and mentioned
the album's title.  You'll forgive me for not having an exact
transcription, but, it was Sat, December 31st at around 11pm,
get it?  It took me by suprise and I was in no condition to
dive for the  VCR.  I'll just say that I remember him refering
to himself as a "mere mortal" in comparison to the late, great
Mr Rich.

So, if anybody knows the number, and if they're still taking
orders... PLEASE let me know.
