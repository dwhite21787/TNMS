&gt;From: SMITH@EPVAX.MSFC.NASA.GOV (The Ice-9-man Cometh)

&gt;Last night I discovered something interesting.  I was listening to "Rush"
&gt;(the first album) on tape, when my tape player began to crap out.  The
&gt;tape slowed down to maybe 60% of normal speed.  I reached for Stop but
&gt;then listened for a moment...then I listened to the first three songs
&gt;that way.  Very enlightening.  You can hear every place where Alex screws
&gt;up, you can hear every crack in Ged's voice, and the overall effect is one
&gt;of almost Seattlish grunge metal.  The vocals even sound a bit like the
&gt;guy in Pearl Jam.  :)

This reminds me of what I did with my record player a long time ago..
I had Van Halen II on the turntable, (side 2 to be exact) and played
it on 45 RPM.  It sounded exactly like 2112-era RUSH to me!
(At the time, 2112 was the only Rush album I had.)
The vocals, the tempo, the guitar sound, it was a perfect imitation.

Hi Rushees,

   Does Rush Limbaugh know how privledged he is to have such a first name?
Oh well, I love him anyway.

   Well, we have a new subscriber to the NMS namely Randy Bugge (R.B./ Red
Barchetta).  In his post yesterday, he discussed Neil and his drumming while
listing favorite drummers.  He has asked me to add one that he forgot because
it was a biggie - Bill Bruford.  He also happens to be one of my roommates.
We will keep you informed if we have any revelations about the honorable trio
known as Rush.

   Just thought of something, you know how the Fear Trilogy chronologically
begins with Part III?  Well, why did they decide to do it that way?  It's cool
and all, but I was just wondering.

   All you Rush fans that somehow got into Dream Theater:  What's the link?
I mean, I picked up a copy of Images and Words today and I heard them for the
first time.  They have no distinct similarities to Rush if you ask me.  Don't
get me wrong, it's pretty good stuff.  They sound like Queensryche with talent
(sorry if any of you really like Queensryche, I happen not to).  In the liner
notes to Images and Words, they thank the Spirit of Rush.  That's the UK fan
magazine, right?  I think I have their address on my German CD single of
Ghost of a Chance.  If any of you want it, contact me.  One more thing, what'
is the name of Dream Theater's other album(s) and does it/they sound like
Images and Words?

  [ PLEASE use e-mail for this reply; do not post to the list!	: rush-mgr ]

   When I got RTB (religiously on the release date), I was instantly surprised
with the great cover.  I noticed and I'm sure a lot of you also have, that all
the background dice are 3's except the bottom 3 or 4 rows.  To date I have
failed to see any sort of pattern in these few rows.  Does anyone have a clue
or it is a lost cause?  Probably the latter, eh?

   Here's a question to the masses?  What's your favorite album cover?  My is
without a doubt Grace Under Pressure.  Beauty.

   Another question:  Does anyone else out there have a personalized license
plate that refers to Rush?  Mine happens to be 2112-AD.  So if you're ever in
SE Pennsylvania and you see the plate, you know it's "The Ghost".

   In Exit..Stage Left, they printed the "loose translation of the new lyrics
for La Villa.  They are definately nothing like what's printed in the booklet.
What the hell is Geddy screaming?  (Monsters, monsters.....?)

   Well, I've exhausted my thoughts for the evening and I have paper to write.

I thought this was old news?? :-)

Oh well, guess not....and no, it was NOT a wig. We were close enough to see
stubble on the side of his head. I guess he wanted to do something "special"
for the last show. It was pretty damn funny. What I'D like to know is if
ANYONE got a picture of this. It's worth a lot if you do.

Anyway this was a kickass way to end the tour. Those last two shows, (Alpine
Valley and Chicago), were absolutely incredible.

Openers for the next tour?? Dream Theatre....no other choice... :-)

Howdy to all the #p/g!ers and to Tessa.

Subject: The Professor

"Muff" says that minimalistic drumming is boring --
The only point that I wanted to address was that we should not let devotion
to a single band in any way narrow our views of other drummers. I mean,
Neil's real good at what he does... and he certainly has evolved.

Charlie Watts is a VERY diverse drummer. He has his own jazz group, and he
prefers this style nowadays. As for the Stones, their music CALLS for that
type of drumming... You may think personally that it is boring, but you
must look at the whole picture.

As a musician, most of my acquaintences eventually come to the realization
that it is not always how fast you (computer screwed up) ... how fast you can 
play, but the notes you choose and the mood you evoke. (Not that Neil; does 
not achieve this)

Do not misinterpret me ... I can practically hear every fill Neil does...
(I am a big fan) but sometimes I can only +isten to that ride-cymbal
rhythm that Neil plays so many times... then I give another experienced
drummer a listen for a while...

Subject: Fav's and such

Greetings fellow Rushians!

	1st off, to whoever asked (sorry, I forgot), Part 3 of Natural
Science is "Permanent Waves".  Gee, I wonder where they got that from?? :)

	Next...My 5 fav bands are:

1) Rush (of course :) )
2) Metallica
3) Queen
4) Queensryche
5) Iron Maiden / Faith No More / Guns 'n Roses (depending on the mood).

	I'd have to say my favorite guitarist is either Lerxst or Steve
Vai...they're both equally impressive.  Favorite bassist: either Geddy
or Steve Harris from Iron Maiden.  Drummer: Neil or Lars Ulrich (Metallica).
I don't think there's any way I could choose a favorite singer :).

	I gotta question: Anyone got any speculation on what the idea (maybe
even title) of Rush's new album is gonna be?

	There's no way that is gonna be their last album...as Rush-Mgr
said, they seem to be having a great time, and it's not like their too
old..

	As to their albums, I'd have to say my favorite Rush album is
Presto (now, be nice! :) ).  My favorite song's pretty much an even 50/50
tie between The Pass and Time Stand Still.

	Well, until later...keep rowin' dem boats!

Subject: Bootlegs Set Lists

Greetings all.  I've been debating whether to buy a Rush boot with my next
paycheck.  I've decided to definitely buy one, but, problem is, I can't decide
which one to get.  I don't want to spend $50 of my hard earned, hard to come
by cash (insert poor college student bit here) on a crappy cd with lame
sound quality or boring set lists.  I've pretty much narrowed it down to a boot
from the RTB tour, but I still want to see a set list before I buy one.  I hear
that _Over The Europe_ is pretty good, but I have also heard that _Run From The
Fans_ is pretty ballsy, too.  I would really like to own a whole concert, not
just bits and pieces of one, as I'm sure the one-disc RFTF is.  So, if anyone
can post a few set lists from RTB boots, I'd sure get all smiley. :)  Actually,
E-mail would not be a bad idea, since I sometimes have problems reading my
daily NMS.  I'm sure some alt.music.rush readers would appreciate seeing one,
too.  Later, RUSHiots.

To: Russell Marks (Zgedneil) &lt;mr1cy1@greenwich.ac.uk&gt;

Record quality has little to do with length, and I have some LPs
with 30 mins to a side, perfect sound quality. You must have been
unlucky with some bad pressings. Buy enough LPs and this is bound
to happen. It could be that as the LP format is less popular now,
corners are being cut finer.

For those who're really interested, there's a trade-off between
sound quality and how many times an LP can be played. The better
the quality, the fewer times it can be played.

As for tone controls: any setting other than neutral degrades the
signal, so leave them in the centre position, or use the defeat
switch. If the music sounds too bright (as on PeW which has too
little mid-range - ha! You'd need to get a stereo parametric
equalizer to fix *that*), then the mix was wrong in the studio,
or it was badly mastered by an engineer, or your speakers are too
bright. Only the last problem can be easy to correct, you just
choose a pair that sounds good. Most shops let you listen before
you buy, so take a copy of your fav Rush album.

Trying to correct it with the tone controls only makes it worse.
I like the advise of an American hi-fi journo best: set the tone
controls to neutral for a week, then set them how ever you like.
Apparently, all his students go for the neutral position after
this little exercise, as they realise how much better the music
can sound that way.

If you want more bass, get a speaker that can deliver it. There's
no such beast as the tone control that gives you more bass than
the speaker was designed for. I also advise a solid floor - I use
a 50 watt bassbin, but I'm on the 2nd floor and the bass is just
absorbed into the rest of the house. I get very little of it.

Enough about hi-fi!

To: gstead@mprg1.mprg.ee.vt.edu (Graham Stead)

Chad Wakerman is one of my favourite drummers, and most of them
are Jazz drummers. This could apply in general, as there're more
Jazz singers that impress me than Rock, and the same with guitar
and bass players.

Bill Bruford is another fav drummer, as is Pierre Moerlen. Both
play Jazz and Rock, sometimes fusing the two. I should mention
Phill Collins, esp while in Brand X. I only started listening
to Omar Hakim a few years ago, but any musician from Weather
Report has got to be good.

Allan Holdsworth, Robert Fripp and Steve Hackett are amoung my
fav guitarists. Steve Vai's solo work is noteworthy. Adrian Belew
turns up all over the place, for good reasons IMHO.

ELP deserve a section of their own, as each member stands out,
even within the same group. Rather like Rush! I recently saw
ELP live, and the encore was something to kill for. I was with
some friends, sitting behind Carl Palmer's kit (he was partially
obscured be one of the giant gongs). We got an excellent view of
the encore, once the row in front of us cleared a little. Palmer's
kit was on a rotating stage, and at one point this spun around to
give us an even better view. We were right below the bass speaker
stack, which is either the best or the worst place to be at an
ELP concert! Let's just say I saw some shirts moving!!!

I don't place them in any kind of order. The members of Rush are
in the list, natch. I guess if they played more Jazz, that would
put them at the top, but I may never know. At least there's an
influence at work.

What I don't get from Rush is made up for by many other groups.
Like Matthew Joseph Desantis, I don't "worship" Peart or any
other musician. I enjoy the music and the musicianship, period.
When I can, I see them live. This is all too rare tho.

Oddly, I know more bass players than any other kind of musician.
I wonder that's significant? :-)

I have to agree with you. Zappa musicians *have* to be good. Have

Subject: Tom Sawyer

&gt;&gt;Tom Sawyer
&gt;&gt;  "His mind is not for rent to any god or government"  I would also be
&gt;&gt;  interested to hear other opinions on the lines "Catch the witness--Catch
&gt;&gt;  the wit / Catch the spirit--Catch the spit".  I assumed that this
&gt;&gt;  meant that TS would laugh at those that witnessed and spit on "the
&gt;&gt; spirit".

&gt;IMO, this interpretation is colored by anti-religious prejudice.
&gt;I think the `spirit' is the spirit of Tom Sawyer, the `The Holy Spirit.'
&gt;I mean, `catch the Holy Spirit'? I don't think so. `Catch Tom Sawyer's
&gt;spirit,' i.e. notice TS's sense of life, is far more plausible.

	I agree . . . Tom Sawyer is being over-analyzed!!  There's no reason to
continue speculation as to the (religious) significance of this song; it is
explained fully in this excerpt from the FAQ:

What is "Tom Sawyer" about?

   "I've been avoiding most of the question that ask for explanations for
   different songs, as really the song is meant to do the explaining for
   me!  But since you ask so nicely... "Tom Sawyer" was a collaboration
   between myself and Pye Dubois, an excellent lyricist who wrote the
   lyrics for Max Webster.  His original lyrics were kind of a portrait
   of a modern day rebel, a free-spirited individualist striding through
   the world wide-eyed and purposeful.  I added the themes of reconciling
   the boy and man in myself, and the difference between what people are
   and what others perceive them to be - namely me I guess."

	Neil doesn't say ANYTHING about religion or spirituality!  How does one
derive 'spitting on the spirit' from this song???

Subject: Royal Drums

Come to think of it, Alex was using his nose on the keyboard at the RTB
concert I went to. Actually I think his keyboard had died, he was certainly
implying that. Kept on headbutting it, though. (Whoops I mean playing it
with his nose.)

Just quickly about the next album, etc. They are FOR SURE doing at least one
more. I expect, quite frankly, that they will do it until circumstances make
it totally impossible. Like Alex's zimmerframe gives out, or Neil's arms
fall off. Or Ged's nose shrinks (which one though!? :-) ). What would they
do if they (horrors) stopped doing Rush, though? Ged would probably be a
producer, Neil an author, and Alex.... a test pilot. Or royalty. Yeah, King
Lerxst the fighter pilot. That's the ticket. Hmmmm.

I suppose I ought to say; I think my second fave band is really Primus. Max
Webster sound quite interesting too, but I haven't got any albums (e.g.
Universal Juveniles) yet. Third is probably Faith No More. Or maybe 2nd. I
dunno. It changes. Rush always #1 by miles though.

About "The Story of Kings" (very good name that!). I think that's the same
as a baktobak interview I've got. A quick aside to UK readers... I got it
from *"Our Price"*! Can you believe that! Some guy had decorated the Rush
section too. Still, if it is that one (must be, right) that is a great
interview. You get to hear Alex say Zinojinovic, and all that. I say, if you
can't hear it, download it from Syrinx or summink. Rush-mgr said where in
NMS #580. Rush/special probably. Alex.hyf.int.Z I'd imagine.

The third part of Natural Science is called... Permanent Waves. Bit obvious
from the lyrics really. Did you, er, "lose the inlay" or something!? Say no
more (in true Python trad) Oh BTW, (switches subject) nice to see another
Douggie Adams fan. Does Mr. Adams like Rush, I wonder, well I guess not.
Oh well.

I must say something that I think is kind of important. All these drummers
talking about Neil's playing, how he's not the best, "hey *I* can play
*that*", etc. That isn't the point. As Puanani said, he has "got what it
takes to be an artist". I agree completely. The idea of the NMS, as I see
it, is to bring together Rush fans, right? Rush fans tend to think Rush is
the best band there is. I certainly do. Am I right? Who cares - it's only my
opinion. And I expect many Rush fans (like me) will not have heard a *lot*
of varied and different drummers and bassists, but will have heard many
different guitarists. So they'll say something like, "Neil's the best" or
"Ged's the best", but probably not "Alex is a real fast/cool guitarist" (I
think he's rather good, really) without knowing for sure. It doesn't *really*
mean they're the best at all. It just means that that person thinks they are
extremely talented and capable, and above all entertaining. That is
fundamentally what it's all about, IMHO.

Sorry everybody this really was going to be a quick one about concerts.
Well, I may be able to infest the NMS even over December. Worrying, huh?

Subject: postcard from Neil

Hello all!

	About eight months ago, I sent a letter to Neil (insert "get
a life" here!).  I just said the usual crap: "I really like your
writing, blah blah blah...basically, I just wanted to see if the
stuff was true about him responding to ALL his fan mail.  I wrote
stuff about being a Geology major and that I liked the use of
scientific stuff in his writing.  I closed by saying that if he
wanted to correspond, maybe we could discuss Geology or something,
and gave my address.  Well I had pretty much forgotten about this.
Then, when I opened the mailbox yesterday, there was a postcard from
Neil!  It has a picture of him at his drumset on one side (the PoW or
HYF shot with the white-pink drums) and a typed letter on the other
side.  It said:

	"Hello Scott,

	Thank you for your good letter, and I can certainly
understand your passion for Geology--it's great that you found it.
Unfortunately, it's all I can do to keep up a correspondence with my
&lt;existing&gt; friends (if you call every three months or longer a
correspondence), and there's no way I can invite anyone else to join.
As you surmised, I get a lot of letters from people, some of them
from very &lt;interesting&gt; people, and it's not so much my &lt;privacy&gt;
that's short as my &lt;time&gt;.  So, I can't do more than wish you well,
and a long, happy life.

					Yours Truly,

					Neil Peart

					(signature)"

	As I said, this was TYPED.  The question I have is:  did he
really write this?  Anyone else get any postcards in response to a
letter?  I mean, this is really grasping for straws here, but I think
it SOUNDS like something he'd say (from what little we've heard from
intervies and articles, etc.).  Something about it just sounds like
his style.  I don't know...it doesn't really metter....I was just
wondering if anyone KNEW how they work his mail...maybe he dictates
it to a secretary, or records his response for someone to type later
or something.  In any event, it was a neat little thing to happen to
kind of make you go "Hhhhmmmmmm..."

	The signature is DEFINITELY in pen...and I assume at least
THAT is his!...

						Skip

	[ Skip, yes, it's real.  I've known quite a few people who have
	  received postcards from Neil in the same fashion as yours
          (typed reply on a postcard, but handwritten signature) and
	  like you, it did take a while for the letter to be answered, but
	  Neil does eventually get around to it.	: rush-mgr ]

I was talking to a co-worker a while ago, and he told me that he saw Rush
a few times while Rutsey was still playing with them.  He told of some
funny stories.....

He said that during a Niaga Falls show (in a bar the size of a small house),
Geddy was surronded by women, and everyone thought that he was a fag, because
his high heels, and high pitch of voice!  He told me that they really
jammed and during the break Alex would be by himself in a corner, while
Rutsey kicked someones ass (they took that guy to the hospital, and Rutsey
continued the show).  This was happening at a Ladies Night!

is that funny or what?

Subject: Neil and Drumming

Greetings!

I guess it's my turn to throw in my 2 cents worth on this subject.

First, out of all of the drummers that I've listened to, Neil is by far
the one I've listened to the most.  I've learned more from listening to
and watching him than any other drummer that I like.  I've been playing
for a little over 20 years now.  I've been following Neil (and RUSH)
since around 1977 (first tour was Hemispheres).

Neil helped me become a little more ambidextrous than I used to be.  I
used to take the easy way out and double-stroke everything.  I single-
stroke a lot more and I'm much happier with that.  I do realize, though,
that I could just have easily picked that up from other drummers.  Neil     
was the first drummer that I was exposed to that branched out into other
percussion instruments besides drums (tympani included).  I hope some
day to have more percussion instruments myself.  Not because Neil has
them, but because that's what I had dreamed about before I ever saw Neil
and his drumset.  This helped spark my interest in him to begin with.
Neil is a great musician in all respects.  His drumming in odd time
signatures seems almost effortless.  I love "elevating from the norm" ;)

However, I have found (as someone previously mentioned) that if I'm in
good enough shape and if I work at it, I can play anything Neil has
done.  This, IMO, doesn't take away from my opinion of Neil.  If I'm
in that good of shape, I can do just about anything.  Playing along
with RUSH tunes is a great workout.  I thank Neil for who he is and
his abilities and what they've meant to me.

I don't, however, consider him the best drummer in the world, though.
Some of you have been mentioning drummers whose style is a little/lot
more difficult to master: Stewart Copeland, Bill Bruford, and the like.
I've listened to them and like their styles.  I also think that drum-
mers like Simon Phillips fit into that same category.  Anyone else care
to state their opinion on Simon?  Neil, IMO, is capable of just about
any style.  Someone once told me that a mark of a good drummer is one
that can play any style, on any drumset, with enough emotion to capture
the interest of others.  Neil, IMO, fits into that category.  But, Neil
(like anyone else) has to have to the desire to learn a particular
style.  Neil has mentioned dislikes of some styles before in Modern
Drummer interviews and radio interviews.  One in particular is the dis-
like of continuous double-bass 16th notes.  Neil only uses them for
fills (special effects).

My favorite drummers are (in no particular order):

  Neil Peart            Rush
  John Bonham           Led Zeppelin
  Simon Phillips        Jeff Beck, Pete Townsend
  Stewart Copeland      Police
  Buddy Rich            Buddy Rich
  Danny Seraphine       Chicago
  Michael Derosier      Heart
  Tommy Aldridge        Pat Travers, Whitesnake
  Jeff Pocaro           Toto
  Cozy Powell           Blackmore's Rainbow

I agree with Neil as far as anyone's particular style being made up of
a combination of all of the styles that a person listens to.  There's
probably a little of each of these in me.

Overall, though, Neil will continue to be my favorite.  Mostly because
I've kinda grown up and evolved with him.

Someone had mentioned hearing "Bravado" during a commercial a few
days ago (while watching a basketball game). This reminded me of
the time I heard some of their music a couple of years ago. I was
watching an Arnold Schwarznegger special (they were interviewing
him on television because "Total Recall" was about to come
out...showing scenes from the movie, talking to him about the
filming). Everytime they went to a commercial, they would sign off
with the beginning of Show Don't Tell (the first 4-5 seconds, where
the guitars just come in...not the barely audible drum
introduction). The first couple of commercial breaks I couldn't
pick up on it, but I knew it sounded familiar. Finally, it became
obvious.

Someone asked about the three parts to Natural Science....wasn't
Permanent Waves the name of one of the parts? I am not too sure.

Subject: RUSH's new label, etc.

Someone mentioned last time that RUSH almost broke up after Presto, etc.
Well, this is not quite true.  Apparently Mercury had been treating them
poorly for sometime, and after HYF, they had fulfilled their latest contract
with Mercury.  Finding thwemselves free of hassle and deadlines, they were
suddenly unsure of their future, sort of a hiatus.  That is why their was
such a long break between HYF and Presto (also, of course, it took time to
make ASoH).  They finally decided that they still loved to make music, and
make music together, do they signed a new deal with Atlantic, and made
Presto.  They making of this album went really well, and they found themselves
ready to keep going, and then came RTB.  They really enjoyed this album, and
they were really excited about the future.  They went off on a long tour, cut
their holidays short so they could finish it sooner, and get back to the 
studio.  I have no doubt that RUSH will be around as long as those 3 guys 
still feel
they can make satisfactory music together, which could be a long time.  After
all, after 20some yrs, they haven't lost any creative spirit (unless one wants
to drag up the old/new debate, please no, ugh!).
BTW:  The main source for this info comes from Neil's essay in the RTB tourbook

Boots: I was windering if anyone out there has a RUSH boot with a soundcheck
   jam. Its so rare to hear them really improvise in concert, definitely
  interested in getting a copy!
  Also, speaking of boot CD's with misprints, I was loooking at some in the
store yesterday, (sorry, I forgot then names of the boots), and two of them
said "Ghost of a Dance" and "Ghost of a Change"! gimme a break, but that's
not the least of it: "Hamadu" !?!?! my god.  Actually, I was pretty excited
to find a record store I hadn't been to in years and discover all those RUSH
boots on CD, including The Fly, Run from the Fans, Mardi Gras, Over the 
Europe, Ghost of a Chance, some others I forgot.

A plea:

When you post, _please_ use a title which describes the content
of the post.  People do use titles to decide whether or not to
read the post.  (And no fair using "RUSH tour sneek preview" to
get our attention)

A curiosity:

After reading the NMS from home at 2400 baud for a while, I got
frustrated and wrote a small curses-based tool which can do a
little parsing, and present an issue with an index/author format
somewhat similar to notes/news readers.  This is especially handy
when you want to skip out of a very long post without having to
scroll through the whole thing.  It's also handy when you don't
have much free time (who, me?), and you need to glance at the titles
to just read what's of personal interest.

Since this is still in the "something I threw together" stage, it's
not really ready for a distribution, but I plan to put some work into
it in the near future.  I'd be interested in seeing what non-HP
modifications I'd have to make (including what other vendors have
fixed some of the numerous curses bugs), and what features y'all would
consider important.  If you are running something UX-like, can compile
C with the curses library, and are interested, I'd like your input.  Send
me a note with your wish list (dickermn@cup.hp.com), and I'll try to
make something available soon.  If you're interested in testing what
I already have, let me know -- I'd love your feedback.

Then again if nobody cares, I won't bother.

Subject: rush bootlegs and radio shows
Date: Fri, 11 Dec 92 19:08:35 GMT

Coming from northern ireland rush bootlegs can be hard to come by
however every now and again some can be found.The best bootleg that
i have is a 1980 permanent waves concert and is called TEMPLES OF
SYRINX . The recording quality is excellent, unfortunately there is
only one track that is not on other live albums , namely natural
science, and as for the other songs they are 2112 (a totally amazing
version, far better than on ATWAS - with bass pedals, tubular
bells and echo on geddy,s voice being used to great effect). The
next song is in the mood with a different drum solo at the end-an
interesting alternative to the ESL drum solo in YYZ. On the reverse
side la villa strangiato can be found, (again the sound quality is
almost equal to any of the live records, although a much rawer type
of sound) which is always a good song to hear,and last (but by no
means least) natural science . A totally brillant song and is great
live however i must confess to prefering the studio version as(imo)
it just sounds better! .
            As for radio shows i have 2 ,the pink pop show in holland
1979 and a RTB concert from wembley arena 1992 both courtesy of (for
the uk readers) radio 1.The pink pop concert was performed at a
slower pace (perhaps because alex had injured his finger?) and has
all the songs you might expect at the time eg Xanadu , the Trees ,
a passage to bangkok etc.... . The roll the bones concert sounds
really good esp the wal bass on the older songs eg limelight,
freewill, tom sawyer but Xanadu (for me any way) needs the sound of
the gibson and rickenbacker and doesnt quite sound as good as on ESL
and its cut in half so missing out on one of my all time favourite
guitar solos (which id love to know how to play, tab would be
welcome !). As for the newer songs they also sound good with force
ten, TSS, RTB and superconducter being the song broadcast.I know
that the pink pop is now a bootleg and im sure the wembley concert
will soon be, so hopefully anyone who is interested can listen to
them as well ! .
   sorry for going on!
bye

Jello --

alright, at the risk of assisting the development of a drum war here
on the NMS (but, damn, isn't it fun?!! :-), I'd like to comment on
a few comments (!) made recently about Neil's style.

(why is it always *Neil* who stirs up the controversy??  :-)

Some folks have said that Neil's style doesn't reflect any musical
style other than rock.  This is the first time I've ever heard such
claims!  It is amazing to me how people can hear such differences in
a *musical* style...  (I mean that in an amusing way   :-)

Personally, I think Neil exhibits much more *drumming styles* (as
opposed to /*influences* from other drummers and the type of music
they play/ -- am I making sense?) than most other rock drummers.
Although, now, rock drummers today are beginning to really use
other styles as influences (e.g. Greg Bissonette).  I think the
reason why Neil doesn't sound like he's using, say, a tribal beat,
a jazz pattern, or a mamba pattern is because he isn't *trying* to.
What I mean by that is that Neil himself has said (sorry, don't
recall the souce) that he doesn't try to *imitate* the part and
have it sound like the source.  He takes that influence, puts it
thru the mill, so to speak, and turns it into something that has
the influence as the *foundation*, but it comes out sounding
like it belongs in a rock format.

He's not trying to be like a Paul Simon or Peter Gabriel where
they may take the influence *directly* and revolve their music
around that.  He takes that influence and makes *it* revolve
around *him* and his style -- and it results in a drumming
source that sounds something like what it should, but with
a Peart fingerprint on it.

And I think that's what people are hearing -- so it sounds like
he's not being very creative when in fact he's being the epitome
of *using one's influences*.  No, he's not the greatest drummer
in the world, but he understands rhythm in an extremely artistic
and creative way.  And he's damn fun to watch! :-)

I wasn't going to post this because I hate printing anything that
is hearsay (-&gt; Show me Don't Tell Me), but you can all  take it for
what it is worth.  Here goes:

Had my 10th year high school reunion a week or so ago and came across
an old friend who was a Rush fanatic around  1982-1983.  I asked him if he
was still into them and he said he had actually met Alex and Neil during
his college years.  He had a friend he went to school with who lived
somewhere in the outskirts of Toronto (Hamilton perhaps?) and the kid
lived fairly close to Alex (back in the early 80's mind you).
Well he thought Alex was really weird when they went to his house.  He
was talking about strange things, my old friend said, the "stars" or
astronomy or something of the like he said.  (I do not think this is
wierd).
The weirdest thing was that Alex was working on this old shitbox
chevy nova and they saw Neil go over and start working with Alex on the
car.  By now they were back at his friends house "spying" on the two.
They decided to take a walk over again and meet Neil.
My old friend said that as soon as Neil saw them coming his way,
he started bolting down the street in blind terror. (sounds like
something Michael Jackson would do).  -- Just thought I'd pass a story
along.  (belive it or not)

Does anyone out there know where I can pick up "Over The Europe" in the
Greater Boston area, or Southern New Hampshire?  It would make a
great Christmas present for myself.  Please E-mail me.  What is the
price on an item like this?  -Thanks!

Subject: On-stage antics and favourite bands

Hello all.
	It's been a while since I've written, so I thought I'd write again.
Some people have recently been discussing Rush's antics at their shows.  I was
lucky enough to get to see three shows very near the end of the tour
(Pittsburg, Dayton, and Indianapolis).  They seemed to be having enormous
amounts of fun at all of their shows, including a nerf arrow fight between Alex
and some of the people off-stage.  One thing that seemed a bit unusual to me
was in Indianapolis when a guy came on-stage with what appeared to be a stuffed
armadillo.  Geddy and Alex seemed to ignore him for the most part, but he put
the animal down on stage and started to simulate having anal sex with it.  Most
of the people around me seemed to be asking themselves "where did this
character come from?"  Also, in Pittsburg, Geddy and Alex had a fake brawl
complete with punches galore.  They were fabulous concerts.
	As far as people's favourite bands (other than Rush, naturally), I
would have to say Queensryche.  At least their two latest albums, bacause I
have not heard too much from before, but _Operation:Mindcrime_ and _Empire_ are
two of the best albums I've heard from anybody in a long time.  Also, I am
impressed with Mr. Big. I had not payed much attention to them before seeing
them open for Rush on the Presto tour (in Columbus), but they had a great sound
live.  I also say them open for Rush on the three shows mentioned above this
year.  I really like their album _Lean_Into_It_.  ZZTop is always good, and if
you want to really relax, Enya's new age music is very good.

Scott  s116193 wrote:

&gt;I've played for around 12 to 13 years
&gt;and I can play just about all of Neil's work.  If (and when) I have to, I can
&gt;play some of the "power drum" tunes like Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, and
&gt;Limelight note for note.  On an impromptu, I can imitate the styles.  Ask any
&gt;drummer, Peart is not truly hard to play like.

   I started playing drums 19 years ago and found Rush in '74. Any good
drummer can duplicate most of Neil's stuff, as I've heard around 3 bands
doing Rush covers in the last few years. The stuff that IS hard to play
without some studying are the songs from the later albums where Neil hits
6" tom, a bunch of triggers, china's, ride, splash, snare, Gong Bass, etc
all in one bar. You can't just listen to the song once and play it in its
entirety like you can with other stuff.
   Which brings me to the point of saying that Neil is *among* the best
drummers in the world. Nobody could replace Neil and still let Rush be
Rush (lyrics aside). Anybody worth anything can duplicate him, but it'd be
mighty hard to find someone who can BE Neil.
