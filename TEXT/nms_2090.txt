Subject: Federation star, my new video, CD-ROM, live album.

I've been shopping on the net and am bringing back
some pretty good booty--so far the Rush "Chronicles" video, and coming
next, two Rush CDs: AFTK and p/g, which I don't have in my collection so
far.&nbsp; I'm hoping also to get the remasters when I can, as my dumbutt
brother talked me into letting one of his old girlfriends 'borrow' all
my jewel-case inserts to commit insurance fraud (see, she was.... well,
whatever, nevermind...long story).

About the Federation star--let's see... First, I
think it represents evil, as much as the opressive society in 2112 is evil.
Secondly, the nude guy is mankind attempting to avoid evil in this form.
As I said in my last post, I read Ayn Rand's 'Anthem' (good read); however,
I haven't read 'The Fountainhead', the novel that inspired 2112.
I have studied icons in art. It's interesting that Rush chose that
symbol, and the logic circuits inside the album cover; this may represent
the ultimate futility in 'cold' logic--remember 'superior cynics', 'the
most endangered species, the honest man', 'all this machinery making modern
music' (pretty darn good alliteration there), 'circuits get shorted by
internal incoherence', 'glittering prizes and endless compromises shatter
the illusion of integrity'... Rush has lots of allegorical allusions to
mindless machinery as mankind's possible demise... Evidently cold, opressive
logic can also suppress musical and artistic integrity. This is something
with which Rush's band members may have had experience.
 I've been busy for awhile, so somebody be nice and
email or post one for me detailing the cd-rom? I think the guys who
did Myst and Riven could do stuff for it--wouldn't it be..cool?

Thanks to Tom Mueller <krynndm@execpc.com> for
showing me my new idiom on the net>>> :D.

In my not-so-conspicuous absence I've missed
info on the live album, too. Where is everybody getting the list
of songs?

 Anyway, I'll go watch my video now. See my

Subject: UK Tennis Sighting

NMS readers might be interested in the following, which appears in the
September issue of "Ace", the magazine of the Lawn Tennis Association.
Despite being the official magazine of the governing body of tennis in
Britain, it's a populist publication, written in a somewhat flippant style.
The article concerned is titled "Tennis and Music" and reviews a number of
songs which had tennis-related themes. One of them is "Conchita Martinez" by
Saint Etienne, which has previously been discussed in this digest. I quote:

"Elderly readers may recognise the backing as a sample from Spirit of Radio
by ancient Canadian rockers Rush."

Pretty disparaging then, but good to see my two main interests brought
together in this way. Remember the mention for tennis in the credits to
ATWAS?

Subject: Signals & Y2K

Hey All!

Many have expressed opinions of Signals as a weak album... production
wise and because of the heavy keyboard slant.  I was disappointed with
it when it came out, but it grew on me.  I know that Alex says he hates
it, and the generally smaller role that the guitar played in the Signals
  Hold Your Fire era.  I think that he learned a lot by having to play
in that role.  If you listen to some of those albums, especially Power
Windows and Hold Your Fire, Alex was doing things in the background that
were quite inspired, and more complex than some of the 'in your face'
stuff that we've had lately.  I think Rush tend to get stuck in a mode
of thought and then pursue it with 'tunnel vision'.  They've grown a lot
as musicians, and are surely more mature and subtle in some of their
arrangements, but they've lost something in the area of dynamics.  Why
not have a quiet song, or a song with a keyboard lead?  I don't want an
album full of it, but it would add variety.  Resist was, I think, an
attempt to add dynamics, but I don't think it was a very successful
attempt. Musicians of their calibre should have the freedom to stretch
out and really play, to allow a piece to develop. We don't need to force
20 minute 'epics', but surely they must be forcing themselves to stick
to the 4-6 minute range now.  Listen to a good jazz album, and you'll
find that the time required to explore various musical ideas varies.

On to the Y2K problem.  There could be a problem of inequity in sales if
some stores are open while others are closed on Jan 1, 2000, but the Y2K
problem should not be an issue.  If the CD is to be released then, the
record stores will have it a few days in advance, but will not be
allowed to sell it.  Any problems related to the Y2K issue would have to
do with individual stores losing their computerized sales system... and
since the problem has been known for so long... those stores deserve to
lose business for not preparing.  Y2K will not be an issue!

I'm guessing it's because Geddy can't hit the high notes after the guitar 
break.  "Each of us, a cell of awareness" gets pretty high.  This is the 
same reason that they played 2112 at a lower pitch on the TFE tour.

Subject: Presto on Live Album

Perhaps, the lack of Presto on the live album was caused by poor record sales?
The reasoning was that "Show Don't Tell", and "The Pass" were not popular
enough, maybe?

 To the guy who thought that TNMS should end because it's getting "too stale", 
you stink.  If the manager is getting tired, maybe he could send the list
out once week or do it when he's refreshed.  If you don't like the newsletter,
sign off after the 2112 issue.  I like the newsletter, especially when someone 
writes cool parodies like "The Piss."  Man, that was funny. 

So, don't pee on the TNMS and say that it's raining.

Subject: Rush, the Beasties and musical genius

The Beastie Boys have come a long way since License to Ill.  They definitely
are great musicians, and while I do not put them as high on my list as Rush,
comparing the two is like apples and oranges.  

The Beasties play some of the best neo-funk, hip-hop, punk, sample-rich music
around.  They're the best (I think) at what they do.  Rush play the best
progressive, intelligent rock around.  They are the best (unquestionably) at
what they do.

Also, you have people like Bjork, who is a genius at what she does - expanding
the boundaries of popular music into realms unknown, and Van Morrison - a guy
who plays the guitar, bass, sax, drums, and has one of the greatest voices in
music- plays jazz, R&B, rock, Celtic, and blues better than 99.9 % of anyone
else.  

Rush are still my favorite band, but there are a few geniuses that,in my
opinion, rival, if not, surpass the boys.

Can't wait till November (assuming the release date isn't pushed back).

I would die 5 trillion deaths to get a copy of that promo sampler with

such a chance. I guess I'll have to wait 'til I reach heaven, where no one
gets discriminated.  But I do have hope that somebody will make this
available in some format or another. I mean, it's just a promo, who cares
if it gets copied? Of course that is up to all of the elitists who have the
promo. Unfortunately, most of those who will get it don't care for Rush. I
guess the odds of me getting analog kid live is equivalent to winning the
lottery a million times in a row.

Subject: Thank You Mr. PEART !

Hi Rushians ,
This is my first letter , a big Hearty hello to you all. I had decided
sometime back that the day I subscribe for TNMS, this one would be
my first posting.An outline of how I was lyrically influenced by RUSH.
Here goes.....

This is a letter I had wanted to write to Mr.Peart , but 
somehow it got postponed for a quite sometime ...

I know the chances of this letter reaching him are bleak(hope!),
but, I owe him this one.

Dear Mr Peart,

Sub : religious Hindu ---> Rationalist
        socialist  ---> capitalist
        	     
Well Mr.Peart ,I am sure you would have guessed from the sub.
what this letter might say , here are the details.....
Born to a very religiously orthodox Indian Hindu family , I had forced
myself , when I was around 12 years , to keep within myself any doubts
I had about the existance of the immortal power. Seemed strange to me
then at that age, "why is it that only I had these uncommon thoughts ?"

Lived in doubt for the next five years. It was around the age of 17 my
thinking meandered along the wrong course. I had a very bad year at
school 'cos I was dreaming about a pretty girl all day long , after which 
I forced myself not to live with this doubt & thrust upon myself, to
blindly follow traditional values etc.
Every now & then when the doubt grew in my mind I turned it down,
ignoring it intentionally & forcefully.

It was always annoying to me then, that I had share my happiness which was
a result of solely my efforts, with the immortal power, but uncertainity
drove me crazy.

Around the age of 21 when I first started listining to RUSH, the songs like
Freewill , Anthem ( ' selfishness was wrong, yet....), The Pass ,
Tom Sawyer ( 'Though his mind is ....) ,woke up the RATIONALIST in me &
the song 'Territories' killed the Nationalist spirit.(I didn't have an iota
of idea of the evilness it meant & the freedom of thought it could deny)
A little push was all I needed & you gave it to me in as little words 
& probably most artistically.Reasoning quelled the remanents of mysticism
that still clouded my thinking.

After that life's been a sweet song fine tuned by AYN RAND, relishing every
molecule of clean air in my lungs & sucking in every bit happiness I richly
deserve. The word Morality has clear cut meaning. Working hard has been
a pleasure .The evilness of socialism stands exposed & a feeling that I'm
restricted only by my efforts , makes me want to live life & not just
exist.I feel unfettered & free to dream , what a gift you've given me .

I am 23yr old man now & I happy I met you  Mr.Peart (through RUSH ), for
the change it has brought  on me , well you know it. It is rather natural
that I want perfect my rather amateur drumming skills. Awsome inspiration
you are to me.

I wish you would ..........hmmmm......write back.......( there is no
stopping a dreamer)
why I will not deny I have dreamt this scene " Neil & I meeting " several
times over.

THANK YOU
YOURS SELFISHLY
A STRANGER & A LONG AWAITED FRIEND

 Very interesting..and cool of course. :)  Listening to my 'PC jukebox'

For some, it's an unchartered territory well worth exploring.

Hi all,

Replying to:

Slim Jim said:

funny.  that's what they said about Rush in '75.  Of course, the same
people raved about Buns n' Poses.

   [ Read the late '74 article from the Los Angeles Times about Rush for
     a good laugh.                                              : rush-mgr ]

Rush manager: first time poster.  Die hard fan since I had enough money to
buy my own vinyl (way back in 1981)  The first album I ever bought was MP.
When I finally bought a CD player in the mid to late eighties, the first
disc I bought was PW.  Anyway I put a link in for the 1974 article you
mentioned because it took me about ten minutes to find it and I figured
maybe I'd save someone else some time.  Favorite songs:  Red Barchetta, The
Necromancer, Chemistry.  They all have awesome memories.

   [ When I checked the nms web site, I noticed that I had never put in
     the link for it under the articles & interviews index page! That's 
     been corrected ;-)                                       : rush-mgr ]

"Ches," which I understand was a lame movie, but the music is a hoot.

==================
Just a point of clarification, Chess was a musical production on Broadway
and also nation-wide, not a movie. The broadway production was based
ratherly loosely on the London Production and/or the album released there
and here in the US.

Chess is one of my favorite albums (Benny Henderson played the American) and
I just wanted to clear that up.

>>Made me think.  I've read Hit Men and if you're a musician, you may want
>>to read it.  It explains how hit songs really happen.

Hit Men is a really great book and read it for enjoyment...  however,
that was a very, very long time ago and how songs get played today is
very different than it was then.  Things have changed dramatically
over the years and the payola schemes of 20 years ago are long gone.

Yes it is true that record companies pay radio stations and now they
are indeed "buying" commercial time..  however, record companies are
really just large corporations.  They use focus groups, market
testing, and as always, their connections.  A tool of the last 4 years
has been the "radio" shows that radio stations hold.  Record companies
lead their artists to these shows for reduced prices in exchange for
radio airplay.

In terms of Rush, none of the above applies.  If there were more
people who wanted to hear Rush on the radio, they would play it more.
I love Rush, I love it when they play it on the radio... but it has
always been a cult following.  When stations play it, they do not get
nearly the response of say.. Matchbox 20.

I dont make the rules, I just play by them.

Hey! Is that the tabcon in chitown? I've been
cranking out that sound on my kazoo so *I*
could play at the tabcon!!! ;-)

ya gotta admit, it does *sound* like a kazoo...

Anyway 'bout a month ago I bought a Washburn
D-17CE (acoustic/elec.). Probably not the most
desired guitar out there, but I'm happy. This
doesn't mean I *play* guitar! I try. It's been
about 12 years since my last guitar got stolen,
(Martin) at that time I only had it two years.
The only song I can play complete is "Is there
anybody out there" from side three of "The
Wall" (duh). I can however play the first four
bars of "rivendell", "fbn", "ctth", "the trees"
and the harmonics to "red barchetta". hehe,
told you I can't play.

Rocky (the goldmine man - Ya!) could not have put a better spin on this whole
debate. You guys and gals need to wake up. I see alot of selfishness on this
list and alt.music.rush and its sad. Everyone has been bitching mostly about
CTTH and TS and the fact that TAK and The Pass did not make it. Well, it looks
like they did make the promo so I'm sure we will all be able to get a hold of
those versions soon (either on the Animate single - not likely - or in bootleg
copies of the promo). Now, I know this is not the way some of us wanted it but
its a FACT. Please read on.

My gut told me that the order was wrong. CTTH should be before 2112 and LTTA
should be before the Drum solo. Other than that, the track listings looked
pretty accurate. My other gut tells me that NO changes in the songlist will
happen now. The boys are done with the album and NO-ONE is going to get Alex
off the golf course or away from Victor II or Geddy away from the Maris
"homerun" chase to consider the BITCHINGS of about 100 people on the internet.
(give or take-not many). And right they shouldn't. They don't owe us a FUCKING
THING. Remember that. I've spent as much US$ or more than most of you and
that's the way it is. I am fine with this.

>2. should we be ticked off?

Ok, it seems that me and Rocky are the only ones that are pissed that HTW did
not make it AT ALL. This is the ONLY bitch I have and let me further say it is
NOT A BIG DEAL TO ME. I can live with it. Like I said on alt.music.rush, 2112
and Natural Science are worth the price of these discs (with the new songs and
the 1978 show as GRAVY). Some of you may disagree and that is fine. But don't
think that writing Anthem is going to do anything other than kill a few more
trees and frustrate the staff there all the more.

Subject: Hits on the New Live Album

Like many other TNMS'ers, I'd like the band to put more songs on the live
discs that haven't been released live before.  That said, I'd like to offer
some reasons why the band may have the hits on the album:

1.  The band may be trying to make the live disc sound like a real
concert-- ATWAS has this kind of sound and feel.  The songs transition from
one to another like a real show.  Perhaps on the new disc they will follow
the setlists somewhat and arrange the songs like the real shows.  This
would require that some of the hits be present to make the disc
representative of a real show.

2.  The live discs have always been the bands' version of greatest hits
collections.  Yes it's nice to have live versions of the newest songs, but
these live albums are a way for hardcore fans, casual fans and new
listeners to get a chance to hear a variety of Rush material, from numerous
albums, in a single compilation.

3.  The big one:  Atlantic, Anthem and/or Rush have done this for marketing
or contractual reasons.  Face it, Atlantic signed the band after ASOH was
made.  The band had a string of platinum albums, with the exception of HYF.
The results from ASOH probably weren't in by the time the deal was inked.
During their time with Atlantic, they've yet to score a Platinum album.
Meanwhile, after they left Mercury, that label enjoyed the Multi-Platinum
success of Chronicles and they've gone back to mine their old catalog again
with the remasters and Retrospectives.  Atlantic is probably dying for a
payoff hit from the band.  And the band's contract may be coming up for
extension or renegotiation.  This will be the fifth album with Atlantic;
how many are they under contract for?

I don't mind the hits; I enjoy them too.  I just wish for MORE OVERALL!
Let's see the final setlist and how "special" the '78 recordings are.

Tonight, as I was flipping through the channels after Polictically

heard a *very* familiar intro...The Spirit Of Radio!  I can't believe how
much Rush this guy uses!  It's almost worth watching, just for the amount
of Rush sightings you can rack up...  :)  (Coming back from the

It's just a matter of taste.  Keyboards, for me too, are 
less of an instrument than stringed instruments like bass 
or (particularly) guitar - because the manner in which the 
note is made on a guitar allows for much more personal 
character to come through.  You can mute in much more 
creative ways, you can bend, add vibrato, and the same note 
can be played in different places on the fretboard to give 
different voices.  You can also pick the string in 
different places.  You can slur the note.  You can add
harmonics.

The player is responsible for creating the note on a guitar
(or bass) in a much more intimate way, with much more 
control than on a keyboard where the notes are essentially
'typed'.

One other point - undoubtedly Alex's & Geddy's guitar * 
bass skills are massively superior to Geddy's keyboard 
skills.

>Does anyone know what education Neil, Alex, and Geddy have?

I know all of this is well documented in the FAQs and all the swag
little Rush books you can buy, but for the newcomers or young people I
will reiterate some infermation:

    If the universe is indeed not simply a bad dream ( I was reminded
that it may very well be when I saw a clip of Ronald Regan on the TV
last night ) as some philosophers have suggested, at least three people
know what education Neil, Alex, and Geddy have.  They would be Neil,
Alex, and Geddy.

Also, I cut and pasted this from the Rush FAQ available at:
http://www.sdrawkcabdellepskcufsisiht.com/louie/geocities/helpme/spock/rush

    Alex Lifeson Dropped out of Kindergarten when he was 14 and studied
to be a television meteorologist.  He actually invented a system where
the weather guy doesn't need to say anything or show any maps: he simply
plays his guitar at the news desk, and based on his facial expressions
juxtaposed with the feel of the song you would know the weather.
Because the world doesn't catch on to new ideas very well, he failed at
all his TV auditions miserably, but there is one very important
vestige:  If you watch Exit Stage Left video the severity of every El
Nino and La Nina for the next 256 years is accurately predicted.

    After working on the Manhattan Project, Geddy Lee abandoned his
career as an infant particle physicist to become a Tantric auto
mechanic.  (If you think that being an infant particle physicist is
impossible because you need someone to feed you, you are wrong.  Look at
Stephen Hawking.)  After about two years at the International Tantric
Auto Mechanic School in Sri Lanka, he wanted to become a chef, but
couldn't because nobody had thought up South Park yet.  So, returning to
Toronto, he took a course at the Adult Learning Annex called "How to
think really, really creatively and subsequently cause your fingers and
hands to move along a bass guitar in a manner that will reflect same and
how to meet someone called Alex Lifeson and write songs."

    Curiously enough, Neil Peart was the teacher of this course at the
Toronto Adult Learning Annex.  He introduced a course entitled "Go out
into the world by yourself and experience a huge variety of things and
become very, very good at thinking about them and acting upon them in a
fashion congruent with your soul", but nobody attended that, so he was
forced to teach the bass thing.  After the huge disillusion that his
theories on education would probably not be widely accepted, he obtained
the following degrees at the following colleges/universities:

Doctorate of English / Oxford University
Doctorate of English Tea / Eaton
Master's Degree, Writing Meaningful Lyrics / Rosedale Community College
Master's Degree, Playing The Drums Very Well / Ned's MegaDrum Study
Center and Cineplex, B.C.
Graduate Degree, Don't Ever Drink Kool Aid Again / Jim Jones Memorial
College, NYC
Certificate of Completion / International Tantric Auto Mechanic School,
Sri Lanka
Certificate of Completion / Louie's House of Deep Fried Donuts and
Tantric Training Center, NYC

I went to Mars 2112 for dinner last night.  The place is really cool.
You arrive in the lobby of the restaurant and it is a spaceport.  You
get a boarding pass and then when your ship arrives, you get in and go
on a 4 minute virtual ride to mars.  The space ship rocks and shakes...
its pretty wild.  And then you arrive and the seat you for dinner.
There are aliens walking around acting weird and the whole decor is like
a big space rock.  The food was pretty damned good too and the prices
weren't too bad.   I highly suggest checking it out if you are ever in
NYC.

     Anybody got a Neil Diamond or Hanson CD? ;) 
     
     Mike Williamson said: "I have early ABBA...."
     
     ==> I don't know about other Rush fans, but it seems like we on TNMS 
     tend to come from the same era, coming of age so-to-speak in the 80's, 
     when Rush was ALL we would play.  
     
     Now that I have aged (some might say "matured"?), my musical tastes 
     have widened somewhat.  My personal collection of 500 cd's covers 
     literally everything from ABBA to Zappa.  Yes, I have Neil Diamond and 
     Hanson; I also have Johnny Mathis, Vivaldi, Miles Davis, Benny 
     Goodman, Deep Purple, Neil Young, Bay City Rollers, CCR, Partridge 
     Family, Midnight Oil.... I'm all over the map.  I guess I like to have 
     a good selection whenever friends come over.
     
     Even the boys in the band are showing their outside interests, what 
     with Alex's 'Victor' project, and Neil's 'Buddy Rich' tributes, and 
     Geddy's assorted productions (eg. 'Boys Brigade').  Before some of you 
     point me to the nearest site for the 'musically challenged', I'll just 
     say that Rush remains one of my biggest influences, and is still music 
     that I hold 'closer to my heart'.

     ps.  New thread?  Did anyone use a Rush quote in their high school

     I've reached a signpost, it's really not the end; like old Sol behind 
     the mountain, I'll be coming up again."  I thought it was quite
