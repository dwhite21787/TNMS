&gt;Subject: First Time/Comment about Jimmy
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, after just reading the last NMS, and having my prediction of Jimmy
&gt;getting in the last post turn up correct, I've gotta ask:  How/Why?  Are you
&gt;doing that on purpose, or do you just happen to send in your mail right
&gt;before the cutoff?

The cron job on syrinx runs at 18:30 EDT, the 2nd cron job if there are
more than one issue runs at 21:30 EDT.  Meg and I start working on the
digest at about 16:00-16:30 EDT every day.  After all the admin stuff
of subscribing new users and unsubscribing old users and changing email
address requests, I do a reply to the previous day's digest, and finish
around 18:00-18:30 EDT.  Then I just mail it in.  Then Meg (or I) run a
script that clears out all the queue, and edit the digest, clear out
flames, shorten long .sigs, etc..etc.  The final product then is the
digest, which then gets picked up and distributed by the cron job.  So
yes, because of the scheduling and the way the digest is run, my post is
usually the last one to come in the queue.  But of course, during the
editing, I could really just stick the post in any order really.  I just
usually leave the order up to the script that runs which puts articles
in chronological order in which they appear in the mail queue.  But now
that you know what time the cron jobs run, if you want your post to be
last, make sure and mail it in before the cron runs at 18:30 EDT.

&gt;I don't really care WHAT they put in the set list, since anything would
&gt;please me.  I must say that Jimmy and others wouldn't be *QUITE* so bored
&gt;of Tom Sawyer and Closer To The Heart if they didn't manage to go to so
&gt;many concerts!  Lucky dogs!

Yes, you are correct.  I am just thinking that maybe it's time we hear
other material in concert?  The band always talks about not wanting to
play a song where they are not 100% committed to the way it fits.  If
they can't put 100% into a song or not enjoy it anymore, then it's time
to move on.  Geddy and Alex have said time and again that this is the
main reason why set list changes occur, on top of wanting to play new
material.  They simply get tired of playing them and don't feel they
give the fans the 100% conviction if they do play those songs.  Looking
through the older tours and the countless bootlegs out there, Tom Sawyer
has been performed on every tour since its inception, as well as Closer
to the Heart.  With this in mind, I just wonder how much longer they can
continue to carry those songs live and still retain the 100% conviction
they talk about.  On top of the whole thing, I think that the radio play
of those songs really kills any enjoyment left.  "Tom Sawyer" has become
Rush's "Stairway to Heaven" where FM waves are concerned.   So when next
tour comes around, I wouldn't be surprised if Tom Sawyer or Closer to
the Heart comes up as possible candidates to "get the axe".  The
question is really, how many more tours will it survive, and can Rush
play those songs with 100% conviction?  Maybe they won't be gone this
next tour but as the tours come and go, I'm sure songs like TS and CttH
will prop up again.

You're probably right, I'd be less bored (if you can call it that, I'm
never bored at a Rush show) if I saw them less.  Lucky dogs, yes, but
then you've probably got even more money in the bank now that the tour is
over than I ever did, *especially* now that the tour is over.  I wasn't
in too good a shape that's for sure.  :)

After reading what I still consider a suprising number of responses to the
first time thing (a great idea, though I'm afraid I've forgotten whose it was)
I can no longer stand feeling left out.

The first time I heard Rush was in eighth grade.  A couple of my friends
picked me up and we were headed out to find something (anything) to do.  We
ended up cruising back to someone's house who had 2112 and Moving Pictures on
eight-track (if I'm not mistaken, because my car still had an eight track
player in it at the time).  And, just as someone else was quoted as saying on
the issue, the first chord of Tom Sawyer absolutely blew me away.  I've never
been one to listen to the radio, unless by force, so I had heard maybe a
couple times before.  I saved up my lunch money for a week and a half and
purchased Moving Pictures on LP and wore it out.

Another first was a truly touching momemt for my mother and me.  I walked into
the kithcen ( I was home for the weekend ) after taking a shower (where I
always ... sing???) and I was still humming the chords to "Cry Me a River",
one of my mom'm favs, when I overheard familiar strains coming from the
kitchen.  I turned the corner just in time to hear mom singing "We are the
priests of the Temples of Syrinx..." and almost died.

As far as Jimmy's request for predictions...I'm sure that it won't be played,
but has anyone ever had the privilege to hear "In the End" performed live in
concert.  I love the ATWAS version, but I've always always always wanted to
hear them perform it.  I don't ever plan on it, but there's that little part
inside of me that can't help but dream.

Later,

Subject: First Rush Experience

Hullos all!

	Well, with all the talk of 1st Rush listening experiences,
I thought I'd share mine.

	The first time I ever heard Rush was the first time I went
over to my now-best-friend's house.  He had Temples of Syrinx playing,
and I immediately loved the song!  I asked him who the group was, and
he simply said it was Rush, and the album was 2112.  I had never
even HEARD of Rush (I know...what a sin!), so I thought they were a
new group.  So I went out that very night and got 2112.  When I looked
on the back of the tape, it said (c)1976!!  Let's just say I was a bit
surprised!!!

	Now, nearly 3 years later, I have all of their CDs, several
bootlegs, posters and other neat Rush stuff all over my walls, and
a near-mint Archives on LP.

	It was Alex Lifeson's style that convinced me to play guitar,
and the 1st song I learned was Closer to the Heart.  Now I can play
many, many of their songs, and my group "TimeLapse" is a Rush-inspired
group (though we're also a garage-Rush-tribute band when we're not
working on original material).  Who knows, maybe we'll open for
Rush someday :)

	Keep on rockin' and rollin' dem bones!!!

Subject: First Rush, Next Setlist, etc

The first time I heard Rush was in the car with a friend of mine when I was a
soph. in HS.  The radio station played "Presto" and "Superconductor" and I
was instantly in awe (cliche tho it sounds :).  Right after that I ran out
and got Presto, and then HYF, and so on and now I have all the CDs and the
ASOH and Chronicles videos, plus the B-Man's great book.  I finally got to
see the boys in concert for the first time this summer at the St. Louis show
June 12.  I was completely blown away all over again...I couldn't hear anything
'wrong' with the songs vs the studio versions.  And "Analog Kid"...one of my
favorite songs (as an album I -love- Signals!).

Songs I'd like to hear on the next tour: The Weapon, AFTK, Kid Gloves,
In The End, Tears, and Avalible Light.  (no, I'm not really expecting any
of these to turn up, this is a wish list! :)

'ello again...

Let's see...The first time I heard Rush?  Well, I must have been early 80's
Tom Sawyer was fairly big on the radio.  I never thought much about the band,
just that I thought it was a cool tune.  Then, in 12th grade (1989), I was
going out to lunch with a friend and he put MP on the tape deck in his car
(I could go on for hours about this car, but that's another story).  As soon
as Tom Sawyer came on, I was instantly hooked, screaming "That's Rush isn't
it??!??!?!?!?"  Later that week, I went and bought 2112 on tape and fell in
love.  Before I got 2112 on CD, I played the tape so much that its quality has
deteriorated to the point that it's hard to listn to.  :)

Someone mentioned their favorite albums.  I'd have to say that my top five
are #1 2112, #2 MP, #3 PeR, #4 HYF, and #5 PoW.  My least favorite album still
has to be FBN and not the over-critcized Cos.  Sorry folks, I LIKE CoS.  The
Fountain of Lamanth (sp?) is a very well-written song.  I'd even go so far as
to say that it's better than Hemispheres.

To whoever said it:  I think you're right, By-Tor will be the song to be
revived next tour.  Personally, I'd like to see In the End brought back...

This is getting a bit long.  I was going to spit out a tour story, but I've
gone on long enough.  Perhaps next time.  Roll 'em...

I'll try to keep this short...

Back in the summer of 1978, I was spending a few weeks with my good
friend Tom, in LA.  One night, were both going to sleep, and at about
1AM in the morning we hear 2112 on the radio (KMAX I think.)  My
friend exclaimed "It's a song about a guitar."  I thought what a
stupid thing to sing about, though I did like the song.  But being the
first time, I didn't really understand the full story.

About the time of Signals, several years later, I met a new friend,
Greg, who was into Rush and had the 2112 album.  I remembered the song
from that night several years ago, so I decided to read the lyrics.
After reading them, I became a dedicated fan.

Date: Thu, 10 Sep 92 21:07:44 EDT

I discovered a few things obscure rush trivia facts that I think
could be safely added to the FAQ (Dan, are you reading this?)

1. In the Woody Allen movie "Everything you you wanted to know
about sex but were afraid to ask" there is a sketch that parodies
Italian films in which Woody is married to a women who can only have orgasms
if she has sex in public. One of the last lines in the sequence is where
Woody says in italian "... something something villa strangiato" which is
translated in the subtitles as "...my wife,  she is weird city"
So there you have it folks. I beleive the film was released several
years before "Hemispheres".

2. The National Midnight Star is a sketch in an episode of the TV show SCTV.
I saw an old rerun of it just a few weeks ago. I pretty sure the episode
predates the release of p/g so I'm guessing Neil borrowed the title
from the show. The sketch is obviously a television parody of
the National Enquirer. The television host wears a loud obnoxious
plaid suit and interviews "friends" of famous stars.
There are, of course, a number of other connections between Rush and
SCTV. Geddy  in sang "Take Off", the Bob and Doug song which came about
because Geddy went to high school with one of the fellows who played
Bob or Doug and subsequently stayed in contact with him over the years.
Someone with _Visions_ can fill us in on who it is that Ged knew (?).

Hi all,

This is my first post and is also regarding my first time hearing
rush.  I have a sister who is now 30, that got me into "hard rock"
back in 4th and 5th grade.  By 6th grade I was listening to
Rush.  My first album was Hemispheres.  I liked La Villa
Stragiato (sp?) right out, but wasn't too thrilled with the
rest of the album at first.  Now (a few years later :) ) I
really like the entire album.  I also like alot of the older
rush.  Oh, Hemispheres was my first album owned.  My first
album I ever heard was 2112.  I liked the entire album. :)
I also like how Rush has evolved.  My sister, on the other hand,
doesn't like how their sound has mellowed a little bit.  She's
more into Heavy Metal now, and has her own band, and she's
pretty good on guitar (if I don't say so myself :) ), so I guess
she can criticize. :)  But overall there is very few Rush songs
I don't like.  Well there is Caress of Steel, but I still like
Lakeside Park, and I Think I'm Going Bald is pretty funny. :)

See ya!

Subject: Tour Gripes and Hopes

I was extremely pleased to see Subdivisions and The Pass retired in favor of
The Trees, The Analog Kid, and Vital Signs on this past leg of the tour.
That was only my 3rd time seeing the band, and already I was getting tired of
some songs and ready for new ones.  I'd love to see Tom Sawyer, Closer to the
Heart, and Time Stand Still retired--they're about due.  What to replace them
with?  Well, I'd love to see Natural Science!  To keep it fair to HYF, I'd
have them play Prime Mover.  And to round things out...I'll predict they'll
dredge up A Passage to Bankok.  Oh, I almost forgot to get rid of Show Don't
Tell (IMHO the weakest song on Presto).  I'd love to hear War Paint again or
Red Tide would be great.

As for the opener, Force Ten is dead.  I'd move it towards the end of the set
(although I wouldn't make it an encore) and open with either something from
the next album or Dreamline.  I'm partial to openers with weird intros, such
as the "ratchet" sound in FT, the car in Dreamline, etc.  Another good opener
would be Ghost of a Chance if they speed it up a bit.  Here's hoping they come
to North Carolina...

Sorry for the non-Rush content, but this is the only place I could possibly

My roommate bought the Dream Theater album _Images and Words_ that was
recommended by a fellow NMSer.  At the end of the first song, "Pull Me
Under", the song ends abrubtly.  He thinks that it's the way it's
supposed to be, but I think it's a skip.  The CD player also says that
2 seconds still remain when this occurs.  Anyone who has the album know
if their copy does that?  Thanks.

Subject: Re: First times

Oh boy!  My first submission as an NMS neophyte!  As far as the
first-time thing goes, I actually really started to kick off on Rush
about 2 years ago, but my first serious exposure was about 5 years ago
when one of my friends was getting into ASOH.  He insisted that I
sit down and listen while he played Marathon and a few other tracks
(now one of my favorites on that album).  I was heavily into Jethro
Tull at the time--had all the albums, etc. etc.  Decided that Rush was
comparatively worthless, and promptly disregarded it until my Junior
Year when I was finally Tull Fried.  I bought ASOH and was hooked.
Gee, this was almost better than "Thick as a Brick."  ESL, Chronicles,
and 2112 followed (I had to see what the Rand thing was about).  What
totally blew me away was seeing them live in Worchester last
winter/spring.  Now it's an Album a month whether I can afford it or
not (not easy on a grad student budget).  The NMS has definitely
helped shape my "wish list."

Yo,

This is my first time breaking the energy barrier
of posting to this group (pop!) after reading it awhile.

I just want to say that RUSH used to be my favorite
band for about four or five years.  Their [older] material
was so much more bold, imaginative, refreshing, original, etc.
than 99% of the stuff out there, and more rocking than
99% of the progressive/interesting stuff I had heard up to
that point (Yes, Floyd, Crimson, etc.)...

&gt;..I had no choice but to listen to RUSH non-stop.

My love for RUSH was borne from listening to 2112, Permanent
Waves, MP, FtK, CoS - essentially just about everything from MP and before.

Eager for more RUSH, I went out and bought their 'later' material:
Signals, Power Windows, etc.  I was severely disappointed.  It is my
contention that there is not much original music after Moving Pictures.
They have become a different band, with not much to offer besides good
musicianship.  They've lost:

	- original rhythms/ odd time signatures (with one or 2 exceptions)
	- original chord progressions.
	- thematic development
	- epic length touch
	- lyrical/emotional range
	- the free time to compose (they're family men now)

- basically everything I listened to them for.  Now that I've heard all
their pre-1982 stuff about 5000 times over, I listen to it only occasionally.
Well, sorry for the negativity, but I had to get some honest feeling
off my chest.

[now donning asbestos suit]

So rather than regret the lack of good RUSH, dammit, a couple of years
ago I formed my own band!

Come check us out - we've been called "bad-ass RUSH," and studio
musicians say that we "put RUSH to shame" (sorry, but that's not
hard to do nowadays, material-wise).

Send me your address, and I'll put you on our mailing list, e-mail
or snail mail.

Subject: 1st Rush in High School Drumline

Hey all,

	Along the lines of the first Rush experience, are there any of you
that were first exposed joining the drumline of your school band?  After
my first week of drum camp before ninth grade, I and just about every other
Freshman drummer were complete Rush fans.  This indoctrination almost had the
feel of ancient tribal wisdom being passed down to younger generations.  But
I guess I'm exaggerating a bit.  Anyway, it was definitely something you were
exposed to and 'taught' when you became a member of the drumline.
	We were quite devoted - even forced the Director to cancel the
rehearsal three days before a marching contest because the Rush concert
(Grace Under Pressure) was that night.  The whole drumline threatened to quit
when he said we couldn't go.  A very tense confrontation between the drum
captains and the Director ensued in his office, but he finally backed down,
we went to the concert, and won the contest (including the Percussion Trophy)
three days later!  It didn't hurt to have Neil's inspiration by example
pumping us up for the event.
	Well talk to you later,

Subject: Women & Rush

Since I'm a woman and a brand new Rush fan, maybe I'm qualified to talk
a bit about why women don't like Rush.

I think there's some truth to the line of thought that voice has a lot
to do with it.  Geddy's voice is the probably the #1 reason why I always
hated them.  I couldn't get past it to concentrate on the lyrics.  This,
plus the fact that their songs seemed to be repetitious.  Personally, I
find it difficult to get past an unpleasant voice.  I like a lot of
Chris Rea's lyrics, for instance, but I don't listen to him that often
because I don't like his voice.

I'm not sure about the harshness of Rush being a reason, though.  Heavy
metal is certainly harsh, and heavy metal bands seem to have large female
followings.  However, part of the attraction to heavy metal is not the
music but the whole aura of the guys in the bands.  There's a physical or
sexual attraction to these men.  Let's face it, not many women would want
to swoon over Geddy or throw their underwear at him!  I don't know what
Rush was like in the 70s but I just can't imagine them having the same
kind of female following as someone like Duran Duran, simply because
they don't look the part.

This is not meant to be a commentary on why women like rock music.  There's
more than one reason, and attraction to the guys in the band is certainly
one of them.  I admit that when I was in my 20s this was a big part of it
for me.  But this had nothing to do with Rush -- it was their sound I
didn't like.  I liked Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, et. al. (supposed "guy"
bands) -- without knowing what they looked like.  I should also point
out that in the early 70s both my brother and my boyfriend at the time
liked these bands and probably served to influence my musical tastes.
I was very into driving guitarists such as Jeff Beck and Rory Gallagher,
and still listen to them a lot today.  I can also remember my boyfriend's
friends telling him how envious they were that HIS girlfriend was into
this kind of music and THEIR girlfriends were off listening to Crosby,
Stills, and Nash.  (Interestingly, many of these girls quit listening to
CS&N when Neil Young joined them!)

I guess I just never knew anyone, guys included, who liked Rush enough
to try to turn me on to them.

As far as Roll the Bones being a record that attracts women, well, it
certainly worked for me.  I mentioned in my original post that "Ghost of
a Chance" is the song that did it for me.  However, I should note that
as much as I like RTB, it pales in comparison to 2112.

So there's my 2 cents on the subject.

Subject: Battlescar -&gt; Scars -&gt; War Paint

&gt;&gt;     In my mind, I can't think of a real explicit reference to a female until
&gt;&gt; we get the song Battlescars on Presto.

&gt; You mean ``Scars'' on Presto. Nope, not the first female persona.

Actually, he probably means "War Paint."  (You should have caught that
one, Gregg... :-)  "War Paint" is one of those songs for which I've always
wanted to produce a video, if I had the time and money.  Speaking of
videos, I don't like most of Rush's videos -- I think the concert footage
doesn't do justice to the energy in the live concerts, and I dislike
the blue-screen overlay stuff (e.g. "Distant Early Warning" and "Time
Stand Still").  I really liked the section of the RTB video they played
at the concerts, though.

Back to women and Rush, I think the main reason there are so few women
fans is that, due to lack of airplay, most non-Rush-listeners classify
them as "just another heavy metal band."  The airplay of RTB is changing
that, as people have noted at the concerts...

One more try:  I am interested in finding out which studio Rush videos are
cool (that are not on the Chronicles Video) and where one might find them.
Someone mentioned some cool vids on the Camera Eye, are any of them studio?
Are any of the Presto/RTB videos available? etc.  Thanks in advance.

     Dear RUSH fans,

     as i'm sure you all agree... you don't have to be an old RUSH fan to be a
RUSH fan at all....... Whether you first heard RUSH on the original RUSH albulm
or you were introduced to them after the release of Roll The Bones.... it 
really doesn't matter..... You like RUSH now... and that's all that counts!!!!!
   My first introduction to RUSH was the HEMISPHERES way back when it was 
originally released...... I was only 6 years old when my dad put on CYGNUS x-1 
Book II.... i heard intro, apallo, and dionysus... and that's all it took.....
   i listlened to that albulm so much i wore out the needle on the phonograph..
My favorite albulm has to be HEMISPHERES.... then i would say MOVING PICTURES...
and SIGNALS.... the older albulms such as Fly-By-NIGHT and CARRESS OF
STEEL being more along the storybook line are my favorites when i just want to
lie back and "zone out" (legaly or illegaly induced)... because of their 
transient fluid movement thoughout the songs......
     i honestly don't think i've ever seen a band more quoted by high school st
udents in their yearbooks as RUSH............ Neil certainly has the gift....
          oh well... gotta go now......... have to do work...
    all: thanx for the info that was sent on the cd recordings i sought and the
 exit stage left video...... by for now.....   Jim Foster.... ( roccinante )

Subject: First Time/Comment about Jimmy

The first time I ever heard Rush?  It was just after ESL came out, and my
older brother had a crappy copy of Tom Sawyer on tape.  I was instantly
hooked, and started getting all their albums.  A few months later, I had
just gotten Hemispheres and my eldest brother came into my room.  He goes,
"Oh, so you like Rush too.  Hemispheres would have been my first concert,
but Mom said, 'Rush?!?  Isn't that a drug?  I don't want you going to
that!' ".  What a bummer!

Anyway, after just reading the last NMS, and having my prediction of Jimmy
getting in the last post turn up correct, I've gotta ask:  How/Why?  Are you
doing that on purpose, or do you just happen to send in your mail right
before the cutoff?

   [ See Jimmy's post above...				: rush-mgr ]

I don't really care WHAT they put in the set list, since anything would
please me.  I must say that Jimmy and others wouldn't be *QUITE* so bored
of Tom Sawyer and Closer To The Heart if they didn't manage to go to so
many concerts!  Lucky dogs!
