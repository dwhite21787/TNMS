hey everybody,
I just found out today that Grammatrain is going to be an opening act for
this band(i forget the name) this Friday, April 3 up here at penn
state(main campus).  the concert is for FREE.  I've never heard any
grammatrain before, but I notice that they have some fans here on the NMS,
so I just thought you all  might be interested.

Subject: fave 5 non-Neil books

Yes, Mr. Peart is now an aspiring author. In the spirit of fave non-Rush
CD's I'd like to post 5 fave books Neil did not write.

1.Stephen Jay Gould _Ontogeny and Phylogeny_
2.Richard Dawkins _Cliimbing Mount Improbable_
3.Ernst Mayr _The Growth of Biiological Thought_
4.Rudolf Raff _The Shape of Life_
5.Daniel Dennett _Darwin's Dangerous Idea_

hono(u)orable mention: James Gleick _Chaos:Making a New Science_ (I'm
not thoroughly sold on the fractals thing)

I have a fuzzy memory of fractals and runes? being discussed back when
TFE came out. Actually, I just have a fuzzy memory. Whatever happened to
the deep intellectual debate? Now we have SexSocks, goofball Generals,
and Top Ten lists out the yin/yang (aka kazoo). Dave Letterman himself
would be impressed.

Five threads:
1.Free will vs. determinism- this one's always good
2.fractals
3.Apollo vs. Dionysus- battle of the century
4.Captain Morgan vs. Bacardi- gotta have some fun
5.TFE- what does it all mean?

Great Scott, you're right.  The studio tracks were 
most certainly recorded with his Steinberger though.
I don't remember why Geddy used his Rick in the videos,
though I do remember that there was some reason he did.

> I also believe he played his Ric

I can neither confirm nor deny this, but he didn't
play it at all in the Minneapolis show.

> As far as having to stand

So that's what that thing was for!  Seriously, I only
played one a few times in a store, and never owned one.
Thanks for the correction.

Subject: Singers that scream

Bryan Monroe posted about the best Rock/Metal music screamer, Rob Halford
formerly of Judas Priest. In a way, I agree, but I think there's others
quite good at it. I saw Deep Purple on the Perfect Strangers tour and Ian
Gillan can "scream" with the best of them. Another is Meat Loaf from Bat Out
of Hell. Maybe not as blood curdling as Halford, but very sustained.

Also, just to mention, Rob Halford (when he's not screaming) has one of the
best voices I've heard and can sound very "beautiful" when he sings. Just
check out some of the stuff he sings on Sad Wings of Destiny. I know however
that most people know him for his screaming....

I still think the scream Geddy does at the end of Cygnus X-1 (especially
live) takes the cake for best Rock scream. It sounds like the end of the
world is at hand when entering the Black Hole!!

Subject: On Rush breaking new ground

Hi gang --

Forgive me, I lost the original posting so I hope I paraphrase this
correctly; someone (was it you Slim Jim?) mentioned Rush breaking new
ground in their early work, but no longer doing so, now.

It's an interesting thing to consider, and I know it has been
mentioned in these pages before.  But I am sorta confused as to
how/why people consider Rush to have been/be a 'ground-breaking' band.

It's meant to be an honest question -- mostly cuz I have a difficult
time discerning what is 'ground breaking' and what isn't.  

But it confuses me in reference to Rush.  The band has never viewed
*themselves* as being ground-breaking.  Over the years, they have
always maintained the idea that they are influenced by things, which
they play with and spit out as their own music.  They've never -- in a
musical sense -- ever 'lead the pack' with innovative ideas.  They
simply listen, soak up, and react.  I'd be interested in hearing
people's opinions on this...... 

Anyway, I hope I didn't misread the intent of the original posting.

Ho-hoo!

Been reading what all of you have been posting about Caress of Steel - I
haven't listened to it in a LONG time. Have GUP in the tape player right
now (I love "Kid Gloves"!) - maybe I need to check this album out again,
you've all got me curious....

Subject: Audio Syncing & Ged's duffs

Greetings from Toronto!

All this talk of late about Ged's "Sync"ing has brought up a funny memory
about the 2nd Toronto date on the TFE tour....have a listen, although Geddy
wasn't synching to a tape or anything, it was a pretty funny mistake;

During the middle part of The Trees, right after "the oaks just shake their
heads", there is a nice guitar/bass solo break.  So Alex and Ged are both
jamming along, Alex is making faces at the people below the left side of
the stage, and Geddy is getting REALLY hyper, running around and doing a
lot of his hopping, circa 1979...anyway, coming back into the vocal part of
the song, geddy takes a run from alex's side back to his own mike, leaps,
makes it in time, and breaks back into verse one!  AHAHAHH!  Yes Geddy!
One quick glance at his teleprompter got him quickly back on track, but for
those of you not quick enough to pick it up, here's how it went.

guitar solo...building..builDING..BUILDING...
"THE TROUBLE WITH THE MAPLES,
AND THEY'RE QUITE CONVINCED THeyrrr..EQUAL RIGHTS!
THE OAKS ARE JUST TOO GREEDY!  WE WILL MAKE THEM GIVE US LIGHT!!!"

Anyways, Alex looked like he was just about to piss himself laughing and,
like our trusty rusty powerhouse trio always does, they played on without
skipping a beat.

I'll bet they laughed about that one backstage after the show.

 dw

P.S., On the topic of Syncing...saw Geddy attempt it for the Toronto show
#1 to the "yodeling" in resist (which we all know was recorded &
triggered)...I suspect it was because that show was being taped, and it
would look more seamless after editing...he was far from his mic at show #2.
Hmm..did he try to pretend he was yodeling at any of the other TFE shows?

Hallooo Rush Fans,

Had a strange thought this weekend, as I was watching my BOOTLEG copy of
opening night in Albany, NY of the TFE tour. If you were stranded on an
island (of Galapagos) and you could only have one Rush CD which one
would it be? And why that particular one? Mine would be GUP for a few
reasons. It was the 1st time seeing them live, it moves me like no other
Rush album, I think it the best album cover (ever)! Let the threads
go...

Oh and one more note, I nominate Eric Hanson a.k.a. Hanstones for Syrinx
Award too!!! Hope all is well in Denver Eric, how's the Retrospective
poster doing? Gotta love it...

	A couple of things....

	I don't know about lip-syncing but I definately know thay sample
a lot.  Try listening to any of a number of boots.... ahem, er, uh, I
mean, ....footware.  Check out "Stick It Out" (and by the way... "Thanks
for sticking it out"...) from Critical Mass to see what I mean.

	Pretty obvious...

	I bought the Rachel Barton CD....  Her version of "The Spirit of
Radio" is very good, once you stop giggling at hearing Rush played that
way.  Though I am not a.... wait.... let me just zip this abestos suit
on....... okay, now I'm ready..... as I was saying, though I am not a
real big fan of Metallica (wince), Rachel's version of "One" is really
cool.  Especially the adrenaline pumping
"tada-tada-tat,tada-tada-tat,tada-tada-tat" part.

	As for adding a 2nd guitarist / 4th member....

Dear fellow Rushians,

Hello all!  First, to "Catherine Brisette", I really liked your post so
I hope you don't mind that I forwarded a copy to a friend who wishes to
post it on Elephant Talk digest, the newsletter of our brothers and
sisters who are fans of King Crimson.  If that is a problem, please let
me know.  Second, my favorite song lyric comes from Hemispheres, Section
VI, "The Sphere" where Neil writes, "Let the Truth of Love be lighted.
Let the love of Truth shine clear." I am a pretty rational guy so I
really don't care much for matters of "love", but what would I be
without such a component?  I just have to work on that side of my
personality.  Third, my two roommates hated Rush when I started
listening to them three years ago.  They are not converts, but at least
they give them the respect they deserve.  One owns "Roll the Bones" the
other "2112." Yet, one of them will always throw in some snide remark
like this latest one," Rush never did anything that Sean 'Puffy' Combs
and a drum machine couldn't fix." Sacrelige!!!Well, I'm out of room
and material.  Stay cool everyone.

Palo

P.S.  Hey Julien.  I truly believe that I have been elevated to a more
mystical level thanks to the impact of Rush's music.  And I don't even
need to thank you for it.

Subject: Grace Under Pressure cover

        I read some posts about what the GUP cover means. To me it means
what the album title is. The top part of the cover is "pressure", while the
bottom part is "grace". Another reason I say that is that if you look to the
far right in the middle of the cover there's a p/g there and the / is where
the cover splits and the p is up top and the g is below. 

        Of course I could be totally wrong too! ;)

Greetings Rush Fans,

This is my first post, although I've been lurking for a while.  I am
writing in response to the thead someone wanted to start about the first
Rush song or lyric you heard that made you a fan for life.  For me it
was Tom Sawyer.  I first heard it when I was in third grade and Moving
Pictures had just come out.  I remember my brother playing it a lot
because he plays drums and was trying to learn to play it.  Needles to
say it blew my little mind.  I don't remember ever really being
interested in music at all until that time.  Rush has since been a
permanent part of my life and I believe they have helped influence the
direction of my life as I'm sure they have many of yours.  Well that's
all for now.

 Are a weapon to be held against us..."

Subject: First Rush song

        

        Kev asked about what Rush song we heard that got us hooked on Rush
(if the first song got you hooked I guess ;) ).

        Anyways, right around Christmas of '78 or the month before, I was up
late one night on a weekend listening to the famous (or is it infamous!?!)
Dr. Demento on WBCN or WAAF from Boston. After the Dr. is over, the DJ
decides he's gonna play something new that is kinda long as to piss people
off, but he likes it so he's gonna do it anyways. Well, needless to say, I
hear the first few notes of my first Rush song start....the slow picks of an
acoustic guitar....slowing leading into this guy shreading this amazing
little lead!! Namely, Alex's intro to LA VILLA STRANGIATO. By the end of the
song I was floored. First thing I did was to call the DJ and ask him what
the hell I was just listening to! The next day I was at the store with
Hemispheres in my hands :)

        From then on it's like an awesome dream. Being at the store the
first day EVERYTIME a new Rush album came out. Getting to see the most
awesome concerts I will ever see for many years at many venues meeting many
great fans. And to top it all of, getting to see them last summer in Toronto
front row! I'll never have another vacation like it. 

        Needless to say, they will always be my favorite band until I die,
and La Villa Strangiato will be my favorite song until I die.....

Countdown was played live, with a huge video screen behind it displaying
images of the space shuttle and the american flag.  I remember the chills
so vividly.  And the audience reaction was great.

So it was a disappointment to hear Geddy's comments a few years later about
how Countdown was a dry song, a failure.  Maybe in the band's eyes, but not
mine.

Subject: Caress O' Steel: it's a soap AND an album!

        I felt compelled to comment on Patrick Lyon's recent post about the
quality of COS.  It always kinda makes me laugh when people offer some good
constructive criticism about an album, and then someone else gets their
panties all bunched up and has to go all out and say that there's nothing to
complain about on the album whatsoever.  The only reason I feel the need to
state what I think about this topic right now is because I happened to have
been giving it and this album a lot of thought the past couple days.
        First off, anyone who can possibly stand up for 'I Think I'm Going
Bald' has some serious personal issues to deal with.  I have tried and tried
and TRIED to give that song a fair listening to, and I simply can't.  My
words the very first time I heard the opening riff were 'Is this In the Mood
part 2?'.  (i.e. it's totally devoid of musical originality. There, I said
it.  Flame away.) I mean come on folks, this song ranks up there with 'You
Bet Your Life' and 'Neurotica' (no flames please) and one of Rush's biggest
gag-me-with-a-spoon-and-scoop-my-eyeballs-out-with-it-while-you're-at-it
tunes of all time.  I challenge ANYONE to stand up for this song, as
actually I would like to know SOMETHING good about it so that I can stand to
listen to it for a change.
        All the band members have come out and said their share of criticism
of the album.  Geddy's been quoted as saying that Lakeside Park is a
'terrible song'.  And gee, why do you think they called the COS tour the
'Down the Tubes' tour?  I promise, it wasn't because people were listening
to I Think I'm Going Bald and saying 'Hey, that's a kinda funny song, and I
can relate to those witty bittersweet lyrics!'  It's because the album is
very dark and freaky, and the mass public can't deal with that.  I won't
even go into what explitives those radio station managers must have said
when approached with playing exerpts from The Necromancer.
        So, there's my basic negative criticism of the album.  On the flip
side of the coin, there are a good deal of positives.  I'll say first that
there's no other album I'd most like to hear SOMETHING off of at a Rush show
(aside from Bastille Day & Lakeside Park).  Like Neil has said, there IS a
good amount of strong, solid music on the album.  I personally think that In
the Valley, Didact & Narpets, and (stretching it a bit) No One At the Bridge
could go over pretty darn well in a medley at a show without too many people
getting up to use the bathroom.  This is a very emotionally strong album,
especially Fountain of Lamneth.  Listening to it on a dark, rainy day on max
volume on your headphones is awesome.  And to give Patrick some credit, I
too believe it helped pave the way for 2112.  After all, without COS failing
so badly, they wouldn't have had so much to be mad about when going all out
in writing 2112 and succeeding so greatly.
        So, I hope I've made my point, that being that it's easy to temper
your positive criticism with the negative and still be a devoted fan.  Thank
god I'm past the stage in my fandom when if someone said to me, 'Hey, Need
Some Love blows chunks!', I wouldn't have to hold back a fist to their face.
I can stand up proudly, and say 'Yes, and I Think I'm Going Bald blows
bigger chunks.'  Isn't freedom of speech great?!
        
        Oh yeah, check out my personal Rush collection website in case you
haven't yet.  Gotta get in those plugs when you can.

Hola fanaticos--
I was watching both ESL and Through the Camera Eye this past weekend, and
although I never really noticed, credit is given to Guy Charbonneau as the
"Tech Man".  Is this any spelling variation of Guy Carbonneau, who used to
play for the Montreal Canadians?  The concert is shot in Montreal, and the
band has mentioned other Montreal athletes in the liner notes.

I was also wondering if the inclusion of the Hammersmith Odeon (sp?) show is
in response to the "Live at the BBC" series that is being issued?  Did the
band appear in any of the shows? Are they beating them to the punch?  Just
wondering.

Subject: Unnecessary contributions to recent threads

High, everybody!

I think the Steinberger bass (used extensively on Grace Under Pressure and
possibly on Power Windows--Geddy wields on in the Mystic Rhythms video) is
the raddest thing I've ever seen.  I saw a 5-string version in a guitar shop
a couple weeks ago for $1000.  I would have bought it, but I didn't have that
kind of money to throw away on a toy. 

Rush's new direction?  Each record since Presto has taken on a more edgy
sound.  Stick It Out, Dog Years, Virtuality, Driven ... Sorry guys, I don't
think they're going to be using MORE synthesizers again any time soon.  So
what are they gonna do?  I would love to see them totally freak out and start
doing some tough-guy militant straight-edge vegan savage hardcore.... 
"Driven to the edge of a deep dark hoooolllle.. GO! [insert gratuitous 
open-E mosh section]" ... :D

Rush and Hum.  There's definately a connection.  Hum does like to use tricky
rhythms and odd time-signatures (well, that's not really unique to Rush, but
I can hear similarities).  And somewhere on the official Hum website
(http://www.prairienet.org/~hum), there's a list of Matt Talbot's
(guitarist/singer) top "ten" CD's, and Moving Pictures is on the list. 
"Downward is heavenward, and we are not alone." 

My sister thinks Rush is Glam Rock.  She won't be convinced otherwise.

Non-Rush content?  I don't think there is any such thing on this list.  We
are all to some degree Rush fans, and this is our digest.  We discuss what is
important to us or interesting to us, as it relates to Rush or Rush-related
interests.  I find it very interesting to see what other Rush fans have to
say about different things (which beat on different strings!) such as
favorite non-Rush music, opinions about philosophy and religion, and stuff
like that.  Seriously, if this list was ONLY Rush news and fanmail, it would
be very boring (to me, anyway).  Can you imagine digest after digest of stuff
like "When's the live album coming out?" or "I like Tom Sawyer!" everyday? 
The spectrum of Rush fans and their ideas (and being able to share mine!!!)
are what make this an interesting read for me.  And we must remember not to
take this so seriously!  Rush is a BAND, dammit! :)

Subject: Caress Of Steel + MTV

Caress of Steel is my favorite Rush album.  It was very ambitious and it
takes a certain type of ear to appreciate it, but that is what makes Rush a
great band - they recorded what they wanted - if people like it cool - if
not - cool.  The record company tells them its time to release a hit and
they come out with an album that forces the record company to cut four or
five minutes out of a much longer song (part of The Necromancer I think)
and release it as a single.  You have to love that.  It also solidifies
Alex Lifeson's position of my favorite musician.  There is something about
the way he plays that sounds so right and the album really gives him a
chance to perform some extended pieces. (Here Again would also have to be
on my list of guitar favorites).

It does seem that Presto and Caress of Steel would be runaway winners for
most mentions in the most and least favorite album category (Moving
Pictures aside).  They both seem to be listed very often at both ends. 
Presto is also my least favorite - I still like it and have grown to
appreciate it more, but it still doesn't do much for me when compared to
their other stuff.  Thanks to postings here I have given Anagram another
listen and like it a lot more than I previously did.

In regards to MTV and Rush videos I remember coming in from the farm and
getting stormed in "the city" at a friends place who had MTV after not
being old enough to get into a midnight showing of "Conan The Barbarian"
(ahhh 1983).  After spending the entire night getting stoked up on Mountain
Dew and playing Risk (as 13 or 14-year olds do) at about 3AM Subdivisions
started.  We all dived at the TV at the same time to crank it up.  Very
cool.  Growing up without cable my only other exposure would have been
waiting up to see "The Big Money" on Friday Night Videos.  The upside of
farm life I guess is I can drive a tractor and stuff if this software
consulting gig doesn't work out.  It also gave you a lot of time to listen
to albums while driving around... then there are the voices... the endless
voices...

I have seen Rush in concert 17 times in various places and consider them

Hi first time poster. This is not a flame, just something I always feel the
need to point out when it comes up.
The star in the star/man logo is NOT a Pentagram.  That is when the star is
upsidedown within the circle, popularly recognized as a symbol of Satanism.
When the star is rightside up it is a Pentacle, a symbol of harmony, five
elements being in their proper places - A *good* symbol.  That is one of the

That said, u can use this to nicely refute the next person who tells you Rush

Now, I like Andy's playing.  He's good.  But I'd never want to see him

1)  He's very minimalist, even at his wailing best.  The boyz are not
minimalists.
2)  Rush is the world's best power TRIO dammit, and should stay that way.
3)  I've met Andy (when he played Mabel's in Champaign), he's an
egotistical jerk.  If Neil is as some describe him, they'd be at each
other's throats in minutes.  A scrawny little Brit like Andy against a
burly, weight-lifiting, drumming, biking maniac like Neil?  Hey, they
can't tour if Neil is in jail for excessive force.  And even if they
weren't, 
4)  Andy is STILL an egotistical jerk.  Don't want him in Rush.

you can play a steinberger sitting--it has a folding leg rest.
The evenness of sound comes from it's graphite composite construction,
which is also why some people don't like the sound.

We were playing connections the other day--where you link two widley
different things through similarities they have to each other.  Someone
asked me to connect Rush and Pink Floyd--I came up with two ways and ver
easy.
1)  Lifeson and Gilmour both played Signature electrics and use Washburn
acoustics.
2)  For music, when in doubt, use "Yes."  Asia recorded Alpha at le
Studio, using Robbie whelan as recording engineer.  Steve Howe plays
with Yes.  Alan Parsons' guitarist Ian Bairnson has played with Jon
Anderson of Yes.  Alan Parsons recorded Dark Side of the Moon for Pink

All right!

Another fellow Rush fan who isn't interested in top ten"s"! Come on 
people, we all have our favourite songs, what's the point in listing 
them all the time? Don't we have anything better to discuss?

As for Julien's posts, I love them. He's a great writer and I enjoy 
reading them. He had recently written a post on death, and how we 
don't always understand why things happen. He continued by saying we 
should ask ourselves what we want out of life, and then, we should 
go get it! Carpe Diem! Well, prior to that NMS issue, someone I knew 
died, and that post made me feel better. It got me thinking about a 
lot of things. I know you guys don't care if Julien's posts helped 
me, but I do. And I'm going to continue reading his posts.

For those subscribers who left the NMS because of Julien's post, I 
guess you weren't committed to the band, if all it took to lose you 
was someones ideas.

Being a fan means more than listening to their music...
