Actually, what Neil wrote *is* gramatically correct.  It's easiest to
understand if you break down what he's writing here into parts:

'I don't want to face ... it in you.'
'I don't want to face ... it in me.'

If you were to use "I" instead of "me", here's what you would get:

'I don't want to face ... it in I'

And, to use another example, let's say you wanted a new Rush album as a
birthday gift.  Which of the following statements would you make?

"I wish someone would buy the new Rush album for me."
"I wish someone would buy the new Rush album for I."

Anyhow, maybe I'm taking this discussion way too far.  I was an English
major in college, so this kind of thing interests me.

Subject:      p/g - After Image

- This is my first post here after observing for a while -

Anyone out there who loves the song `After Image' as much as I do?
There is something about this song that makes me want to listen to it
again and again...and the video for it from the `Camera  Eye' video (if I
am not mistaken, has never been shown on MuchMusic or any other
video channel) is really good ... especially the pennyfarthing bicycle,
and the shot of Neil at the end of the song.

It is strange because when I first saw RUSH on the p/g tour (1984 - the
concert at Maple Leaf Gardens that everyone knows, the same one
that the `Red Sector A' video was taken from) I had hardly listened to
their music at all...but in the 10 years or so since!  I wish I was a fan at
that time, then maybe I could remember what songs they played (as I
read in another msg. they might have played `After Image' live...ugh!').
I just read in another msg. that someone else was there at MLG that
day (sorry I can't remember who it was)...I still have the program that
they left on all the floor chair seats (white with a red p/g logo) that
instructed all the patrons to put on their 3-D glasses at a certain point
in the show!

I agree with Meri (?) who said that it doesn't really matter what religion
the band members are, etc... but I think it is just because someone is
such a big RUSH fan that they want to find out everything about the
band, but I am sure that it will not affect their opinion of the band if
they are indeed true RUSH fans.

That's all from this boy from the home of Gordon Lightfoot (I'll be there
soon!)...BCNU, WL

Subject:      RUSH spottings (and Kim too!)

Has anyone ever spotted the guys in the band outside of concerts?

I have seen them on a few occasions...in 1987 I saw Alex & Geddy at
the York Tennis Centre during the Canadian Open in North York
(Toronto) one summer...when I went over to the other side of the
stadium to try and get an autograph (I was kinda excited) they were
gone.

A couple of years ago while here in Florida, we spotted Geddy at the
Blue Jays vs. Orioles game in Dunedin.  I didn't bother going over and
bothering him because there were enough 19 year old (supposedly)
RUSH fans scaring the hell out of him, so I just caught a good glimpse
of him when he walked by to leave the game ... leave early because of
all the people bothering him so much that he couldn't enjoy the game!
I have heard that Geddy isn't very accomodating to fans when they
surprise him in public...and I don't blame him the way these people
were treating him.

I talked to Kim Mitchell for a brief minute a few years ago when he was
here in Daytona for the MuchMusic spring break show and asked him
if he planned on ever doing another song with RUSH (for those of
you not familiar with `Universal Juveniles' by Max Webster check it
out ... probably have to find it in Canada though) ...he said that he
would love to someday (as he sipped his beer) but that he figures that
he will just worry about his solo career for now, just then some guy
saw Kim drinking his beer and said to him, "Might as well go for a soda
Kim!"  I groaned.  One of my friends from school (an American who had
no idea who RUSH, Max Webster, or Kim were) asked me who that guy
was...I told him it was my dad.

Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation...

	Regarding Ayn Rand's fabulous _Anthem_ quote : "I shall choose
friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters.  And I shall choose only
such as please me, and them I shall love and respect, but neither command nor
obey."

	A Neil Peart quote which I always thought expressed this sentiment
well was: "We can walk our road together if our goals are all the same.  We
can run alone and free if we pursue a different aim."  Hemispheres, of
course.

	I remember one time back in high school, I wrote this Hemispheres
quote on the blackboard.  An extremely liberal friend of mine immediately
said he loved it.  Isn't that ironic?  20th Century liberalism is about
subjugating the individual to society.  Liberalism says: "We can walk our
road together if our goals are all the same.  If your goals differ from mine,
I'll send the government to FORCE you to walk my road."

	However, I certainly agree that while Neil Peart was heavily
influenced by Ayn Rand, he does not subscribe to each and every word she has
written.  I'm the same way.  Ayn Rand is a heroine of mine, and my ideals
mirror hers closely, but not identically.

Subject: RUSH in Morocco

       While not being a citizen of Morocco, I bron and raised there (nice
beaches!).  I grew up listening to old Genesis and the Police.  The local
radios sucked and only played top 40 crap.  We prided ourselves (my buddies
and I) on being a minority with "better" musical taste.  One day back in
1983 ( I was only 14 then), my brother (big YES fan at the time) brought
home 2112 and AFTK.  Oh the religious experience!  Needless to say my
buddies and I were sold and became RUSH fanatics (still true to this day).
In high school we were looked upon as weirdos listening to bands that no one
had ever heard about. One day, in Morocco during the summer of 87 I was
casually listening to the radio, when this new DJ came on and said "and here
is something different for those open minded people,  the band's name is
RUSH".  And he proceeded into playing the entire 2112 album!  Needless to
say I called all my friends and we were aw struck.  You got to understand
that until then all we had heard from the radio was crap like MAdonna and
Michael Jackson.  Yes miracles do happen!
        Regarding RUSH radio play in the US I must say I have been pretty
lucky.  I went to grad school in the Chicago area (u. of I, chicago) and got
hear a lot of RUSH on the radio.  However, not nearly as much as here in
Oregon!  The local radio station (101.1) here must be run by avid RUSH fan.
I hear RUSH a lot!  There has been days where I hear RUSH four or five
times/day, while just listening to the radio on and off during the day.
Anyway, that's all! take care

 	Just a couple of comments about a couple of the comments:)
#1     I think  that some of us are getting just alittle compulsive with the
use of acronyms for the titles of rush tunes.  I can understand the use
of these for album titles, because in the FAQ they are clearly defined
and we use them all of the time.  But in this last posting about the
mystery tune LTTA being spliced in with a football broadcast, I am just
at a loss as to what LTTA is.  I am thinking from Rush--Rush...to
PeW(permanent waves)... toCP(counterparts).  So I know that LTTA is a
song.  Please for the sake of us with no photographic memory, write the
titles of songs out... or at least a partial title i.e.(B-t and the
S-dog, or a Pass to Bkok).

   [ LTTA stands for "leave that thing alone"			: rush-mgr ]

#2     The types of arguments that we are seeing over the weak albums and
weak songs and the weak 80's and the privacy of the band is good for 1 or
2 posts, if its juicy.  Mostly though it is becoming this thumping sound
of  many dead horses being beaten at once.

Now I still have an inquiry:  Yes, my cassette of ESL has the song Xanadu
spelled Zanadu on both the cassette and the liner thing.

P.S. thanks to those who answered the thing about Broone's Bane.
and also I don't mean to be a dweeb but What is LTTA.  Now you got me
wonderin.  oops, bad english.  ;)

Subject: On the subject of weak albums...

I would probably agree with the most loyal fans out there, that there is
not really a "weak" album out there.   However, a friend and I drove to
Florida last spring and listened to every song off of every studio album,
in order.   We found out one very interesting thing... everything was
fine from Finding my Way (Rush) until after Mission (HYF).  Then we had
to listen to Tai-Shan (sp) and High Water (i think that is the name of
the song) and we started to get annoyed.  Then, a respite w/Show Don't
Tell, but soon after the dullness of the majority of the Presto album.
Roll the Bones wasn't particulary tragic, but after Face Up and that cult
classic (You) Bet your Life, we were ready to drive off the road into the
Offekkkennnobbbeeee (yeah, like I spelled that right) Swamp and take our
chances with the Crocodiles.  Then Counterparts, we were saved... looking
back, most of the songs in that stretch didn't have the kind of energy
that we needed on our 15 hour drive, but in addition, they just didn't
hold up with the rest of the Rush reportiore (sp).  In short, I like
those albums, but not when they are compared against themselves.

Hey Will, In the video that you say Neil wearing the headgear, please take
note which songs he was using it in....they're all songs in which the group
uses sampling and where neil would have to play to a click track to keep on
time with the pre-recorded material.  I happen to be a drummer and I have
played to a click track before when my band was using samples in our show.
Playing with earphones on can be REALLY annoying since they tend to fall off
when I start to get into the song or when I have to play some heavy fills.
I think the "helmet" is Neil's answer to this.  It may be a bicycle helmet
that has been modified so that now, there are earphones in it and Neil can
play without losing his 'phones mid-song....hope this helped!  :)

Joe Morello spent a number of years with the Dave Brubeck Quartet (1955-1967), 
where he did the work for which he is best known (Take Five, though I 
personally prefer Blue Rondo a la Turk [9/4], The World's Fair [13/4!], and 
Unsquare Dance [7/4]).  If you enjoy jazz and non-standard time signatures, 
then Dave Brubeck's music is definitely worth a listen.

I happen to like the _Burnin'_ disc quite a bit.  Our jazz band at Boston 
College used to play Dancing Men, so that's great to hear.

 As I think we all know by now, the "B-Man" is an idiot. Alex Lifeson is all
over "Losing It."
 To wit:- He sits out the intro and 1st verse (5/8) (this is common,
especially in this era of Rush compositions)
	- After "He stares out the kitchen door", Lifeson plays quiet,
distorted power chords on the 1 and "and-of-2" of each bar. (The 5/8 is
subdivided 3-and-2). Before the next verse, the drums enter fully.
	- For the "Dancer" verse, Lifeson is playing a 3-note arpeggio every
two bars: dee-dee-deeee/ pregnant pause/ dee-dee-deeee/ etc. (This is a really
dumb way of describing it, but I don't know how else to). This is mixed to the
front. Rhythmically, he's playing "and-three-one/rest/and-three-one/etc." (if
this doesn't mean anything to you, I can describe it better)
	- For "and she limps across..", Alex plays distorted power chords on
1, and at "door", plays on 1 and the "and" of 2 again (twice), quickly
followed by...
	- A fast, eighth-note climb in 5/8, into...
	- Half-time 4/4 ("Some are born.."). Lifeson, as described above,
plays distorted triads on 1. They lend texture.
	- After the chorus, there's two bars of 5/8, which Alex plays the 1
and "and" of 2 on, as a transition into...
	- The solo, which is 11/8, subdivided 3-3-3-2 (triplets with a missing
eighth-note). Lifeson, I believe, sits this section out, and lets the
violin(s) take the spotlight. At the end of the solo...
	- Lifeson plays a run of eighth-notes over several bars of 12/8 (feels
like 4 triplets), then 4 bars of 5/8. The run ends, and Alex (still in 5/8)
plays the one and "end" of two 4 times, and then...
	- We're back at the 4/4 half-time ending again, with Alex playing
long, distorted chords on 1.

 Disclaimer: this was compiled from memory, so certain parts may be longer or
shorter than described (like 4 instead of 8 bars, or vice-versa).

I suppose this has been asked before, but; I haven't got MP or 2112 on
CD yet, is it worth trying to get hold of the Ultradisc versions? Are
they likely to be hard to get in the UK? I'll be getting them over the
holidays, so it'd be good to have some opinions on this...

Oh, but there are! Didn't you go to any of the concerts in the RTB
tour? Quite a few fans at those...

No. You're not even the only Rush fan over here called "Russell". :-)

1. 'Addicts and Parents', I believe. Candygrams.
2. That's an original idea. (Sorry, couldn't resist :^))
3. Neither. It's PEERT, and sounds quite like 'peer'.

In the last issue, there were two complaints about the content of the

READ SOMETHING, SKIP IT!  WHAT THE HELL WOULD THE POINT OF THIS

Subject:       Diversity in Taste

Hey all,
I've been a silent reader of NMS for a few months now and I just
thought I'd chime in about something-- in the 11/30 issue, someone
mentioned something about liking a band that would not be within the
range of the 'typical Rush fan's' taste... I've been a Rush fan for
as long as I can remember, and I'm well acquainted with the other
bands that Rush fans seem to like (King Crimson, et al.).   I'd just like
to register the fact that Rush does not prescribe any sort of 'taste'
in music.  I like everything from Pink Floyd to the Charlie Daniels
Band, from progressive to good ol' fashioned, groovey, funky, rauchy
rock n' roll...  I'm not making an argument here... it just got me to thinking 
about tastes in music and what's important to each of us as fans of the
music that these three talented men make...  thoughts??

Thanks for indulging my free-association.
See you 'round,

Subject: Could It be true? Gary or Geddy

Hi Rush Fans

In one of the readings of NMS I saw a question.  About Geddy Lee's real
name.  Well I have a friend who is Jewish, his name is Gary.  Of course
his mom is also Jewish, yet she has a real strong accent being from
Israil and all.  She calls him, get this, Geddy.  I read some where that
Geddy Lee's real name is Gary Weinrab or something. Could it  be?
	Since, Rush didn't officially make it to the Northwest for the
counterparts tour.  They secretly stayed in a hotel Seattle, only a true
Rush fan would dicover this; I bumped into Alex accidentally after a half
an hour drive once I found out.  Well anyway's if anyone has a extra
Counter parts tour shirt I could buy or trade I would be most happy.  I
don't want break my streak of shirts since 1980 do I.

So Email me if you have one and I'll get in Touch with you later.

Subject:       Re: Female fans and keyboards (TNMS #1027)

     A friend and I did some informal research on this topic
discussed by David Taubler.  We talked to some female friends of
ours and made some observations at the concert on the Cp tour and
came up with some conclusions about female Rush fans.  For any
die-hard lady fans, keep in mind that these opinions don't
necessarily fit you, but are meant to describe the casual fans
that Dave has mentioned.
     At the show my friend and I were keeping our eyes open for
any potentially eligable women (for my buddy only since I am
married myself) with similar tastes, particularly in music.  We
observed at the Rush concert itself that the majority of the
ladies attending the show were accompanied by a men.  I can only
remember seeing one group of girls without dates.  Afterwards we
talked to some women who we know that either like Rush or at
least aren't nausiated by them and the consensus seems to be that
most of them were turned-on to the band by a boyfriend, brother,
etc.
     I guess this goes to show that the perception of Rush as a
band for male, teenage, head-bangers is pretty prevalent among
the female population.  It seems that only when the male fans
expose their better halves to the music with any regularity that
the ladies begin to appreciate the quality of the artists as well
as the universal appeal of the music.  Furthermore, we figure
that most of the women who attend Rush concerts are there because
of their significant other.  In the end, though, we figure that
after they break-up with thier boyfriends most of these women
described above stop listening to Rush altogether.  This isn't
necessarily out of a dislike for the band but because of a lack
of positive stimulus.  Maybe this hypothesis sheds a little light
on the topic.  If there are any comments, criticisms, or other
responses I'd like to hear them.-tj

Hey Fellow RUSH Fans,

   My last post was right before syrinx disappeared.  My post went with it.
Oh well.  This is something different.  I sat down to listen to my "Signals"
CD.  I have not listened to it for awhile.  I noticed that the beginning of
"The Weapon" (the guitar riff) sounds suspiciously like the riff in "Gallows
Pole" from "No Quarter" the new "Unleaded" album.

    Now, I know precious little about guitar riffs, but I asked my roommate
(who knows a lot about guitar riffs) and he aggreed with me.

Boy the one thing that REALLY BUGS ME about Rush is that all the albums are

the same, ( format, length, concepts, etc. ).  We need more bands like that
in the world. Boston can't be the only one! :^)

Thank you to all that sent me messages regarding the lyrics in question in my

I would also like to mention something regarding my post in #1029. I mentioned
the fact that it took Meat Loaf 14 years to put out "Bat Out of Hell II", as
if he had no albums between BOOH and BOOH II. Well, it was brough to my
attention and I want to clear up that what I meant was it was the first he put
out in 14 years that has gotten any attention.  So, anyway, if anyone has any
more comments of interest, email me if you want to.

Subject: Revised thoughts on Presto

I'd like to amend a post I made previously.

>>The way I interpret the song, it is about a guy who made the
>>mistake of falling in love with the wrong person (...what a
>>fool I was for you...), and now he wants to make up for it
>>(...If I could wave my magic wand...).  I may be wrong, but
>>that is how I interpret the song.

After thinking about it some more, I now believe it is about a
guy who discovers his girl is cheating on him.  Obviously, he
is not with his girl for some reason.  (...I look down into a
million houses, and wonder what you're doing tonight...)
Obviously, he sees something that does not please him.  I don't
know about you, but I would not be pleased if my girlfriend(if
I had one) cheated on me.

After he finds this out, he remembers the dreams he had when
this relationship started(...I had a dream of a winter garden,
of midnight rendezvous...), and feels alone(...I had a dream of
the open water, I was swimming way out to sea...).

Right now, the guy feels very confused(...don't ask me, I'm
just improvising...).

This guy still wants to fix things(...if I could wave my magic
wand...), both with himself(...I'd make everything
allright...), and with the world(...I'd set everybody
free...).

Like last post, I am not claiming omniscience about Neil's
writing.  This is solely how I interpret this song.

Guitar ("Rhythmn")- Jimmy Page formerly of Led Zeppelin
Drums- (who do you think) Neil Peart of Rush

of course something like this probably wouldn't work as the music would
be too rich.  that's why alex lifeson is so good for rush, because he
usually doesn't always want to be in the spotlight.  while i'm not saying
he's bad or anything, he just usually sits in the background and lets

Hey,
	Just responding to one thing this time around.
	To the question about the title of Red Sector A... I personally
think that it stands for Auschwitz... one of the Nazi concentration camps in
World War II.  It seems to make sense to me since the songs is
(relatively obviously) about that... at least IMHO.
	Also, I second the request for good RUSH Ascii pic's... I think

Um, hi

I just have a little correction for the person who posted..

"The song RSA takes Nazi atrocities and makes them a metaphor for other,"

Neil has said that he wasn't writing about WWII spicifically, and he was
just writing about a holocaust situation. I think this is very intelligent
and typical of a guy like Neil remembering that there have been many many
holocausts in human history, and many worse than WWII. (i obviously don't
mean to suggest that the WWII atrocities were petty, so please don't make
it that) WWII is an instance of the thing he is referring to, but it's only
a recent example. Neil had a 'larger perspective' in mind.
