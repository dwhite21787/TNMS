	In yesterday's episode, David Conley provided info on FM,
who opened for Rush several times.  The violinist/mandolinist that
David saw with FM was Nash the Slash, who wears "mummy" style bandages
with sunglasses and a hat while he plays.  He quit FM for a while,
and Ben Mink replaced him.  Ben Mink is the man who did the "Losing It"
solo, is he not?  Nash the Slash is now back in FM, and Mink is now
with kd lang.  BTW, Nash successfully sued Pepsi for trading on his
image a few years ago (they actually settled out of court for an undisclosed
sum) when Pepsi ran a commercial on Canadian TV that featured a guy
dressed like Nash.

&gt;COUNTDOWN: I'd forgotten to post this before; Bob Joslin, have you
&gt;figured out that line from "Countdown" yet?  The one that sounded like
&gt;"she had it on us"?

Still haven't figured it out.  I am still kinda curious, but don't go
to too much trouble to find out.

By the way, seems to me something is wrong with the next quote "Columbia to
Houston, we have 40 seconds to LOS..."  It sound to me like Houston is
talking to Columbia!  What gives?  Have they been playing around with the
editing?  I know they have spliced up that transcript to compress out
portions of conversations.

Hi.
I've got this email address whwn i was asking a question in
the alt.rock-n-roll file.

The questions was if Neil has come out with a book with lyrics
and drumparts. The second question was who he was influensed by.
I've got an email and a guy told me that it was Anne Raynd but he
was not sure. Was he sure? If so, can you send me the right answer
and if you want, tell me wich book Neil is most influensed by.

Thank you very much.
Johan
