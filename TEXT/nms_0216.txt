I have finally collected (what I think is) all the interesting articles
posted to the NMS over the last year or so, and have put them out in the
anonymous ftp directory 'rush/special'.  There is a CONTENTS file in the
directory which describes all the files contained therein.  This should
help those of you trying to find a specific article or range of similar
topics.  I have removed the attributions as to who submitted them and left
just the informational text.  A couple of the files are ongoing processes
(the discography, the tour list, etc.); in these cases I have included the
addresses of the originator(s) for update purposes.

Thank you for all who have contributed so far, and I look forward to getting
more stuff from list-members in the future.

This collection will also help reduce panic when I remove the first 100
issues in the archive.  No, I haven't done it yet, but I shall soon!

Also, I've begun to recieve TAB files from various list members, and will
begin populating the directory 'rush/tab'.  As I am not musically technical,
I defer to the submitters for any questions.  Translation: don't ask me! :-)

Lastly, I've placed the latest list of names (current as of 4/17/91) in the
'rush/names' directory.

**I am just getting started on Rush. "Presto" is my fourth Rush
album after P/G (one of my all-time faves), show of hands and
chronicles. Just trying to make excuses for being a novice.
Anyway i love Rush and will start collecting the moment my
wallet starts feeling wider. If everyone promises not to
bite my head off....can the Rush-mgr please tell me why this
magazine is called "the national midnite star"? and not something
like "hemispheres" or something.

[ It's called "The National Midnight Star" because the group voted that to
  be the name.  (It beat out "Signals" by just a few votes, if I'm not mis-
  taken.  The reference is from the song on _Grace Under Pressure_, "red
  lenses":  "we've got mars on the horizon/says the national midnight star/
  (it's true).  I believe the original source of the name was from SCTV.
                                                                 :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Rush on radio...

   In regards to hearing Rush on the radio, I am also from Pittsburgh and I
haveto say that bigger does not mean better!  Our hard/classic rock stations
are more oriented to the "mass" market type appeal - sort of a "pop" version
of hard/classic rock.  Any Rush that is played is usually:

   1.  Extremely popular Rush songs from the past.

   2.  When the boyz come out with a new album.

   3.  Before the boyz come to town on tour.

   Although I have not heard alot of other radio stations outside of
Pittsburgh,I am sure there are many which are MUCH more flexible about what
to play.  So those of you from smaller cities/towns, having bigger stations
does NOT necessarily mean more Rush.  That is the main reason why I ditched
my receiver and only use tapes and CDs - they play what YOU want them to
play!  :-)

Subject: the trees revisited

thanks for the wonderful discussion on the song.
  it's nice to see people analyzing it.

i don't think it has to do with canada vs anyone, personally for
  the person who brought that up.

but what i was really hoping for was if anyone knew of a
  quote by the Boyz as to which way they really felt.
  my guess is that tehy think forced equality is awful....and
  that we all have a certain potential and that is what we should
  work for (the randian egoism and self responsibility, et al)
i was just hoping to have that justified.

and altho most of us seem to feel that the forced equality is
  terrible, there are those that feel it is a noble and good
  thing to hold some back so that others will feel like they
  are succeding...like ??'s view of school and holding back the
  kids who learned faster (i am sorry i don't remember names...i
  scroll through the list and then decide if i have anything to say)
it's kind of funny...i wonder how in the world anyone could think
  that hurting someone else for the better of others would be good.

i wonder if the Boyz gave up realizing mankind was hopeless in this
  respect.  i can't recall a recent (past 5 years) song that talks
  about this topic.

just my thoughts
and thanks again for all of yours

&gt;X-Mailer: Mail User's Shell (7.2.1 10/31/90)

	In our last episode of TNMS, someone #1 asked if anyone here
had heard of the Fixx.  Of course we have - the man who produced one
of their best albums, "Reach the Beach", went on to produce some
obscure Canadian band in the late 1980's.  (Is my humour too subtle? :-) )
Actually, I'd like to keep discussion in TNMS centred on Rush.
	Yesterday someone #2 (excuse my memory, but I didn't note
the names...) asked what the Oaks and Maples represented in "The Trees",
and supposed that Canada might be the maple.  My opinion is that
you're thinking too literally - I can't see Canada in the role played by
the Maples :-) :-).  No, as a comic, in all seriousness, the lyrics
probably work best along the lines of the rich and the poor, the
high and mighty versus the aspiring and yearning.  If you want to
think along national levels, fine, but I prefer a more personal level.
Use your imagination, after all, it was for you, not himself, that he
came to write this song.... :-)

Greetings,

  In #215, dangerous dave writes:

&gt;1) to the person who asked about funny stories involving concert events:
&gt;at the Miami Arena show on the "Presto" tour, Geddy's bass went *way* out
&gt;of tune, and at the opening of "The Pass", took it off and traded it for
&gt;his Rick.  the roadie re-tuned it during the song, and when Geddy turned
&gt;around to get his Steinberger back, he saw two Playboy Bunnies carrying
&gt;it out on stage.  he was shocked.  he retaliated though -- he stomped on
&gt;the sound board on that side during his next bass solo.

Hmmm....  Do you mean to say that Geddy was playing his Steinberger on the
Presto tour?  I thought he switched to the Wal after G\P.

When I saw the boyz in the Sunnyvale area on Presto, Gedd's wireless dropped
dead.  They had cameras and giant projection TV's so those of us in the cheap
seats (it's an outdoor amphitheatre) could see, and I could see his eyes look
off to stage left as he undid his strap and held his Wal out at arm's length.
A roadie made it mystically disappear and then replaced it with what looked
like another Wal (I could be wrong).  He played this bass for a couple of
tunes, then traded back for the other one...

AND, in that show, during Tom Sawyer, somebody set off a roman candle about
five feet away from me.  I would have probably enjoyed it if I wasn't trying
to avoid getting hit by the burning thing coming back down.  It's amazing how
concert security just appears from nowhere, innit?  The person was "escorted"
out.

Seeya,

some more answers (concerning The Trees)

i know a lot of people don't remember this, but Canada wasn't always
an independent country.  it used to belong to England -- you may have
heard of it.

hint:
Maples (note it is capitalized in the lyrics) == Canada
Oaks (see above comment) == England

this song was written just before the split.  think about it, and then
think about it some more.  you'll see i'm right.

&gt;... of course every chord is played twice... the x means to mute that string
with a finger, but don't fret it....  I'm not sure of the exact name of the
C chord.....

the ending flurry to 'The Trees' right before the G,D, and A in the solo
is just some furious hammers and pull-offs on the G string involving the
2nd fret, 4th fret, and the opening string

OK, there are 2 FM's.  One is from Canada, and has been around for over 10
years.  One in the UK started up recently, and when it was discovered that
there was already a band named FM, they changed to FM UK (at least here in
the states.)  They probably are still called FM in the UK because they are
the only FM in the UK.  Same thing with Yazoo - Here in the states they were
known as Yaz.

From: derek@leah.Albany.edu!

I think the basic message to The Trees is:  You can't legislate equality.
Because everyone will have a different viewpoint on where to start.

*Personal moral stance* (since everyone else seems to be going off on a
politically charged tangent).  The idea of laying down laws to manage
elements of society is repugnant to me.  However, I DO believe in freedom
of opportunity, of education, of choice; and as long as there exist sexism,
racism and classism to obstruct freedom, I want those "isms" proscribed as
_wrong_.  As long as civil rights are being violated, as long as women earn
less than men for the same work, as long as people are hired on some basis
other than merit, I want the power of government to forstall these wrongs.
This does not mean retroactive legislation like affirmative action.  But
other methods are possible (ERA, for example).

You know, Presto only just now started growing on me.  It took about the
same amount of time for Hold Your Fire as well (and I play that a hell of a
lot -- I LOVE "Tai Shan" and "Prime Mover").  For some reason it's usually
the B-side of an album (CD B-sides?) that gets to me; does anyone else
encounter that?  With Presto, and especially Grace Under Pressure, I really
love the second set of tracks.  "Hand Over Fist" "Available Light" "Red
Tide" are all great.

Some of the drum fills on "Superconductor" are incredible...

i thought RUSH opened with 2112(I AND II) on the MP tour? i am quite sure
they played all of 2112 first on the PW tour, and reduced it to parts 1 and
2 on MP, as i stated earlier. correct me, or kill me if i'm wrong.

[ They played *almost* all of side 1 of _2112_ on the Hemispheres tour;
  they may have opened the show with it.  Note:  they have never played
  part of _2112_ live - "Oracle: The Dream".  I believe this is mentioned

&gt;      Also, I have learned that "YYZ" is pronounced "YYZed"? can anyone

&gt; [ The Canadians and English (possibly others, Australian?) pronounce the
&gt;   letter "Z" as "Zed".  That's just the way they talk...         :rush-mgr ]

	'Zed' most likely stems from the French pronounciation of the
	letter in question...so, yeah, it is "just the way they
	talk..." (try saying that to some French Canadiens).  Perhaps
	it's also related to the Airport label (what's 'z' normally in
	"radio" talk - 'zebra'?).

&gt; From: ervan@rice.edu (Ervan Darnell)
&gt; 	At first I saw the song as an analogy for labor/management
&gt; relations.

	You're still quite right here.  In college economics (sniff!),
	we had a term called 'Pareto efficiency'.  A situation was
	Pareto efficient if you could not improve the lot of one group
	without hurting another.  Assuming that some maples were
	"limited" by one means or another, the "Noble" law is actually
	not very good for the group as a whole...only perhaps for
	those few maples that existed solely in the shade.

Subject: Re: The BEST drummer

&gt;Lastly, I won't flame back, Tom.  Opinions vary.  Until the HYF tour, I had
&gt;the opinion that Buddy had better chops than Neil.  But then Neil put
&gt;together his own big-band program on his Simmons for his solo, and it showed
&gt;me that he really DID have Buddy's capability. . . .
    .
&gt;Everybody picks their own "best"; I think Neil holds his own beside
&gt;anybody else I've ever seen or heard, and since I like his style most out of
&gt;the elite drummers, I choose him as the best.  (yeah - "period!"  ;-)

That's fine - if you love his style the best.  Neil definately has his
own style, and is the best at playing that style.  I can't imagine any
other drummer playing Rush in the same way Neil does.  I personally
love Neil's style from a musical standpoint, but not from a pure
drumming standpoint.  Does that make sense?  I mean, he's been playing
the same solo for 15 years, and everything he plays in Rush tunes
revolves around a 16th note or 16th note triplet pattern.  He
definately has precision, but his technique sucks - he's all arm.  The
only reason I responded in the first place was because I get really
tired of non-drummers (and some drummers) claiming Neil as the Drum
God.  Neil is a great drummer for Rush tunes, but not much else.  Now, when
people start saying he's "The best in the business, period"  meaning
the best professional drummer - I think that's a joke, and I think
Neil would think so too.

hello out there,
    i know that geddy has at least two Steinberger basses.  during the
last tour, i saw him bring out a white faced one (which leads me to
beliee he has 3 of them).  I would be deeply appreciative to anyone
who knows (or can find out), which # issued Steinberger's he has.
    Recently i found out i have the one made right after Sting's
I would be happier knowing that it was next to Geddy's.

Nick Pitfield asks what the significance is of the pin that
Alex wears on his guitar strap...  It's from the movie
Erasure Head.  A few years ago, on Rock Line, Geddy said that
it was one of their favourite "touring movies."

[ I believe it's spelled "Eraserhead"... Bizarre movie!        :rush-mgr ]

I thought that the story to 2112 was ovious? It's an irony where the main
character gets real depressed about life in the world run by the priests
and then finds a guitar/has a dream/etc. This makes him even more depressed as
the priests break his guitar and the guy realises that the world used to be a
nice place etc. So, he kills himself. Just after he dies, the Elder Race of
Man he dreamt about come back to reclaim the world and usurp the priests. What
a pisser!! 'We have assumed control' is the Elder Race telling the priests
that the're back. Quite obvious I thought. (and quite nice as a story)

I can unequivocally confirm that FM did indeed open for Rush, at least
at the Power Windows show at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens- I was there.
(Great show, buy the way!)

FM was one of the best opening bands I've seen at a Rush Concert {one of
the worse was Marrillion, at the Radio City Music Hall shows- they were
booed off the stage.}

I don't remember much about FM, but they had a techno-rock kind of
sound; lot's of effects and synth.  They played a neat version of "Good
Vibrations", the Beach Boys tune.  I would like to hear them again!

*
By the way, does anyone know about that ablum that Alex Lifeson played
guitar on (on all tracks??)?

[ I would suspect this is the Larry Gowan album "Lost Brotherhood".  See
  the FAQL for particulars.                                     :rush-mgr ]

Just a reminder that you have 2 weeks to submit entries to the cassette poll
I will run the criteria for the final in a few days.  The results should be
posted the first week of May so you still have time to submit your lists.

I guess Theo didn't recover from that bump on the head he took the other
night.

You have to admit, he was interesting to watch (Excitable little guy,
wouldn't you say, Brent).

New Cup Prediction:

        Pens Vs Kings (The Great One Vs Mario)  Now wouldn't THAT be great!!

[ Yeah, right.  Get past the Caps first, dude.  :-)               :rush-mgr ]

What happened to the Black (and Blue) Hawks?  That was pitiful if you ask me.

Have fun making your lists

Subject: Standard Interpretations

Greetings to all !!  I posted a question a while back (which no one
responded to unfortunately) regarding the interpretation of the line,
"We have assumed control...................".  I would like to believe
that the lyrics to these "fantasy" tunes were saying a lot more than
what is there at face value.  Perhaps they are a glimpse into our
future (rather than the literalist "Federation").  I believe that
Neil was doing more than relating a ganja-induced trip; that he
was pointing out one possible avenue that the world may be headed down.
Much of the theme of these albums (late 70's) was being put into place at
that time;

"We've taken care of everything,
 The words you read, the songs you sing................"

Or, maybe I'm on a ganja-induced trip ??

Subject: 2112

Hey fellow fans!

  I have been reading these interpretations of Rush's classic 2112 and
I felt the need to put in my $.02.  As you all know, the main character
of the story lets depression get to him and gives up his quest.  He can
no longer continue to fail so he decides there is no reason for him to
continue living.  Following his suicide, the Elder Race appears (with a
complete musical change;  note:  the part of the song where the suicide
takes place has a desperate and hopeless sound to it and immediately after
the character kills himself, the music changes to a sound of hope and
victory.  At least that's how I see it.)  Anyway, what I got out of it was
that it was a big mistake for him to commit suicide, not so much because
of the timing, but because suicide is fundamentally a mistake.  This is
the message I got because just after he killed himself, evil was conquered
and all things returned to order.  But because he ended his life, the main
character was unable to see the victory.  I think Neil was trying to give
a "never say die" type of message.  Knowing Neil's personal views on
suicide (he hates it altogether) as shown in The Pass, I really think
this is what he was trying to say.  Just when you give up is when you would
have succeeded, so stick with it and things will go your way.

	Howdy,
		This is my first posting, so I'll make it short.
I am a Rush fanatic and an Objectivist. Actually I was introduced
to Objectivism after being blown away by 2112. Anyway, are there
anymore people on this list who consider themselves Objectivists?
I also think I can field any questions about Ayn Rand or
Objectivism. I am still not sure what the exact question is though
pertaining to 'the Trees'.

Oh, I was in Worcester when Alex spoke, he did not sing. They were
doing some sort of mike check and his got turned on accidentally
or something. I will paraphase the dialog.

Alex "hello!"
Geddy "do you want to say anything? (or something like that)"
Alex "hello!", "goodbye"

but, maybe my memory isn't that great.

Hi,

Regarding The Trees; I always thought that the Maples represented Canada, and
the Oaks represented the big bad USA. Just an idea I had when I was young !

Cheers.

John Nicholson Writes:

&gt;Does anyone know if there is a particular significance to the Maple/Oak
&gt;antagonism? Is Canada the Maple? And, if so, who is the Oak?

Well, a few years ago, I showed this particular song to my English
Teacher(I even convinced her to use some Rush in our poetry section
of the class, but we ran out of time).  One of the first things
she noticed was that Maples are a dark wood, while Oaks are light.
Seems like a good analogy to use for oppression, don't you think?

Subject: The Trees

With all the discussion occurring about The Trees, I figured now is as
good a time as any to relate a story I was told by a good friend of mine
about that very song.  Basically, the story conveys one of many
labor/management disputes in Industrial America.  The maples symbolize
the disgruntled workers who, after many years of hardships, finally
rebell against management (oaks) and eventually form a union.  Finally,
the oaks cave in to the demands of maples and give them fair working
conditions/wages.

I have yet to read The Fountainhead, so I have no idea about the
validity of my tale.  Any responses are welcome.
