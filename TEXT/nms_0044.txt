Subject: Managers Notes

Hi all,

    I just thought I'd drop a line in here to talk about a couple of things.
First of all, there was no Digest for Monday, 9/3 (Labor Day).  

Secondly, the Washington DC/Baltimore MD area RUSH get-together went off 
last Saturday.  We had several people there (hi Del, Frank, Donna & Barry!), 
but were unable to get the band thing together.  All in all, I think it went 
pretty well, if a bit quietly.  Maybe we'll try to be more rowdy for the next 
one - I mean, the cops didn't even show up!  :-)  There were many good dis-
cussions about RUSH and related topics, and some interesting things were 
brought up; one of which I'll post here.

    I mentioned that I was going to re-vamp the informational file sent to 
all new subscribers to include a bit more information (frequency of dist-
ribution, etc.), and it was suggested that we also put together a file of
frequently asked questions by people new to the list.  A couple that spring
immediately to mind are questions about the Backstage Club, Neil's editorial
on Satanism, and "A Nice Morning Drive".  What I would like you 'old-timers' 
to do is to post a list of the topics that have gone around here several 
times (pet peeves, even).  I'll compile them, and see what information I 
can put together on each one.  I don't know how long this will take, but I 
figure it will take a few weeks to get done (at least).  I'll probably send 
the finished version out as a special Digest edition (EXTRA, EXTRA, READ ALL 
ABOUT IT!), and offer it to new members when they subscribe.  What do you 
people think?  

Oh, offers to help compile/proof-read will not be turned down.

Well, that's all for now; on with the show.

Manager,

&gt; 	I do feel strongly about saving our planet for future
&gt; generations, however, and that is one of the things I love about
&gt; Peart's lyrics because he seems to support this attitude.
&gt;
&gt; 	I liked Chris Schiller's interpretation of the "uninvited
&gt; guest" line.  Did you mean to say that the "eco-guerillas", or to use
&gt; a less violent phrase, the environmentally conscious people are the
&gt; "uninvited guests"?  I'll go along with that.
&gt;
&gt; Like some pilgrim,
&gt; Del Gordon
&gt;

     I guess at first I didn't mean to equate eco-terrorists (my favorite)
with the "uninvited guest".  I meant more to equate it with the pangs
of guilt which noone wants, but which everyone must now feel and come to
grips.  But now that you bring it up, I agree that this is another
valid interpretation.  Except that eco-terrorists and environmentalism
have been around for a long time, and it is only recently that they
have gained mainstream support and credibility.  They have been trying
to ruin the party for as long as they have been organized.  I guess
when I say "they" I must include myself, as I contribute to wildlife
habitat organizations.  I think the recent upsurge in environmentalism
is not caused by the efforts of the extreme organizations making a lot
of noise, but by the level of environmental abuse reaching a threshold
of pain for the common consumer.

     I believe a balance is needed.  Many groups want extreme goals.  No
development, no growth, throw away the cars, throw away the toys, live
"simple lives" of spiritualism and vegetables.  I don't deny them their
right to live this way, anymore than I deny the right of extreme capitalists
to live a life in pursuit of money, fashion, and material.  I think they
are both extreme and unrealistic.  Humans are tool users and have a brain
and ambition to modify their surroundings, they also have a brain to
see when too much modifying is going to cause trouble.  Going too far
backward or too far forward are both bad.  Compromises must be made.
See Natural Science.

     One of the bigggest revelations, I think, is the acceptance of the
idea that humans need the Earth's ecosystems in order to survive.  We
play god on Earth, determining the lives and deaths of species, but
the Earth also plays god, and humans really have very limited control.
We have the ability to mess it up, but far too little knowledge to modify
it globally in any constructive way.

OK, so this time I'm not just interpreting, I'm preaching.  But if
Peart's lyrics do anything, they should be fuel for thought and discussion.
Maybe I'm just "Getting a life" :-)

ORQ:  The star's aren't aligned
      Or the gods are malign

      &gt;&gt; Why is this quoted in the lyrics?

Subject: Bitmaps

  I am interested in obtaining Rush bitmaps, mainly in the xbm format,
but I don't have the inclination to actually MAKE one or anything so
difficult as that.  Are there any FTP sites for me?  Any help would be
appreciated.  I'm mainly interested in the Red Star from "2112", but
others, perhaps some album covers would be nice.

Subject: Questions left and right

Greetings and falicitations--

J'ai des questions:

I've never really understood "red lenses" (anyone want to do a
line-by-line analysis?).  What exactly is Neil talking about and why is
the title not capitalized?

This is probably obvious as all heck, but what does the first verse of
Presto have to do with anything?  I have my own ideas, but I was
wondering if my ideas might coincide with someone else's (I think I'm
opening up a LARGE proverbial can of komodo dragons here...!)

Damn, I had another one, what was it...

Oh, yeah, I seem to have lost (or "decided" to delete) Neil's editorial
comment(s) about the rock groups being satanic and all that stuff
(along with the rest of that issue)...would anyone be willing to e-mail
me that?

Subject: Backstage Club

I was wondering since I have heard about this if anyone could send me
some infomation about it.  i.e.  address and how much it costs, and maybe
some of the benefits I would get if I belonged to this club.  Thanks...

[ Ok, there have been enough questions about this, so I'll interrupt this
  posting for a mass-information answer.  The RUSH Backstage Club is a
  mail-order set-up by someone who has been in touch with RUSH for a loooong
  time.  The club itself is mainly just a way to mail-order t-shirts, pins,
  patches, posters, etc.  There is also a bi-yearly (?) newsletter sent out
  which contains (in addition to the price list) a blurb by Neil written 
  specially for the club, and sometimes other tidbits, like a tour schedule
  if they are currently touring.  The cost (last I heard) is $9. to join, and
  you'll need to order something on a yearly basis to stay on the list.  It's
  a small organization, and I think they're in it mostly because they want to,
  not for any profit motivation.  The address for them is:

  If anyone out there has a Commodore 64, I could send you 2 Rush songs that
are in the SID-Player .mus format. They are "Spirit of Radio" and "Tom Sawyer".
Send me mail if you're interested, or if you have any other Rush SID's.

Subject: Rush file archives

I've been subscribing to the Rush Mailing List since the very beginning, and
have saved every interesting message that's come across since.  In addition to
all of the lyric files, I've got several interviews, two tourbooks (PRESTO and
now P/G--thanks!), Neil's article on Satanism, a complete discography, Thrice
Told Tales, "A Nice Morning Drive", and a bunch of other stuff--over 50 files
in all.

They are all available on my BBS, the Broken Blade.  While its main theme is
centered around Tolkien and Middle-earth, Rush has made its mark--in the
message base, the music area is called "La Villa Strangiato", and another
area, "Invisible Airwaves", is devoted to discussion about the electronic
medium.  Besides the Rush and Tolkien concentrations (I've got a message and
file area devoted to JRRT, with loads of interesting stuff), I've got a ton of
Pink Floyd material, a wealth of Apple II files, role-playing stuff, Star Trek,
and the list goes on.

The phone number is (206) 781-9424, and it supports 300-2400 baud, with the
standard (8N1) settings.  It's up 24 hours a day, except when I use the system
myself to read the board, or call out (like now).

It should be possible to TELNET yourself over here, and then use the VADIC
modems to make the local call--I know its possible from Western Washington
University, up in Bellingham.  If all else fails, you could always make the l/d
call--I think the system is good enough to warrant at least a look around (of
course...I wrote the software! :).  If anybody does decide to set up a new
account, please let me know you're from the Rush Mailing List, and I'll make
sure and give you standard access so you can see all of the Rush (and other)
files.

I will be able to repost selected files to the mailing list, if there are
requests for specific items.

Subject: stuff&more

   I keep forgetting to ask this question, but here goes: [it may be 
elementary to most of you, but I've never found someone who's sure of 
the answer] How did RUSH get their name?

   Here in Denver, KAZY and KBPI play fair amounts of RUSH. On weekends KAZY
has the "triple-shot weekend", where three songs are played by each band. No 
single songs are played during the weekends. RUSH usually gets a couple of 
triple shots each weekend. KAZY also has a "two for Tuesday" deal, and RUSH 
is usually included. Led Zep gets by far the most airplay here, with at least 
a half hour of them everynight at 8:00. Plus, they're playing 6 hours of 
Zepplin non-stop tonight now that it's Zeptemper.  Personally, I think every 
night at 7:00 they should have a RUSH HOUR. [maybe at 5:00, to correspond 
with the *real* rush hour in Denver's streets...]

   What is the family status of our favorite power trio? Married? With kids? 
etc....?

I saw a notice on a "Coming Attractions" flyer distributed at a local record
shop that Chronicles is expected Tuesday the 4th.

I heard a rumor that a video is planned for release at the same time, but
nobody at the store knew anything about that - any info, anybody?

Uhmmm, looks like the Akron/Cleveland area is not the only area in the
country where Rush receives very little air play.  Guess we have to go to
the Great White North to here the Boyz often on the radio.  Actually
I don't listen to the radio very much either (cause all the duplicated
songs played every time a new jockey comes in for his/her shift), I was
just courious if Rush got lots of air play elsewhere.  Funny, Puanani mentioned
that they have a "Get the Led Out" on one of the local radio stations, cause
they do here too!  WONE in Akron has (you guessed it) "Get the Led Out"
every weekday evening at 7pm.  Even got the same name.  Uhmmm, what's with
Led Zepplin, I mean I like them and all but, cheeze, they aren't the world!!
(I know, you Zeppers and Zeppies out there are saying, "Yes they are").

Just some comments for thought I guess,
Dan...

Hi,

Thanks a lot, Dave Wolf for transcribing the GUP tourbook. I enjoyed
every word. As for the others promising to do a transcription, I'm
eagerly waiting for a digest containing another transcription.

Now that I saw a tourbook transcribed, greed took me over, and I'd
like to have'em all. Can anyone provide some clues where they can
be obtained?

About Rush airplay, only a few times I heard Rush on radio or tele.
MTV Europe used to play Countdown, but in spite of waiting for it with
the VCR ready for about three whole nights, I never saw it. One video
that I did encounter was 'The Big Money', which was a bit disappointing.

On radio, a few years back they used to play 'New World Man' sometimes
and once some live songs from a festival called PinkPop were played.
The dj announced La Villa, after mentioning him being a great Rush fan,
and came up with Xanadu.

Bye,

Frank.
