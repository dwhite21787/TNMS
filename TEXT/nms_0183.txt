This is notice that the mailing schedule for the NMS will change somewhat.
It used to be issued every weekday, sometime between 10 AM and 5 PM EST.
Due to load on Syrinx when the list runs, this schedule will be changed
to later in the day/evening.  This means that many of you may not get the
mailing until the next day.  If you think you've missed an issue, please
wait to see if it comes later before asking if something's wrong.

There will be a new issue of the FAQL posted in the next day or two; Dan
has gotten it to me, and I just have to send it out.

It's been noticed recently that somebody's been trying to gain unauthorized
access to Syrinx.  We've noticed several failed login attempts in the logs;
attempts to accounts like "guest", "games", etc.  For the record, there are
no un-passworded userids on Syrinx, so this will not work.  If/when we do 
find out who the person is, it will be followed up with their system admin-
istrator promptly.  We are currently tracing the attempts back through the
network with the help of some of our local network gurus.  Luckily, lots
of local gateways log information on who passes through, so we should be
able to track this down.  This will not be tolerated.  This isn't fun, it's 
breaking and entering (if successful).  True, you may not spend any time
in jail, but things could get spicy for you WRT your computer usage.  If
you think I may be referring to you, and you were just playing around, then
send mail to the administrative account letting me know, and giving an
explanation.  If you come to us before we (and your sysadmin) come to you,
things will go much easier...  Fair warning.

Well, enough mundane administrivia; on with the digest!

Subject: Thoughts...

Here is my input on a few recent topics:

        As far as the sound of geddy Bass goes, I love the sound of Freewill.
I don't know which bass he used there, I would have to guess the Rick.
While I am only an amateur bassist at best, I havwe played a Rick and couldn't
stand it for one reason, I felt like I had a tree trunk strapped across my
chest.  I also noticed that when Geddy had the Rick, his style was very
reminicent of John Entwistle, but when he switched to the Steinberger and Wal,
his playing style also changed and resembles Jeff Berlin.

As far as the ultimate concert lineup goes....

Gary Varney wrote:

&gt; One more thing, Can anybody out there explain what was
&gt; happening when Neil wrote "Red Sector A" from _P/G_?  For some
&gt; reason I always relate that song to the movie "Red Dawn".

I would also like for someone to elaborate on RSA.  Wow, I thought I
was the only one who thought about Red Dawn while listening to Red
Sector A.  I think I relate the song to the movie because of the
following lyrics:

       I clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed
       A wound that will not heal -- a heart that cannot feel --

(BTW, in the lyrics dir on syrinx, the above line misspells heart as
"hear") 

[ Thanks for the notice - it's been corrected.                  :rush-mgr ]

         In the movie there is a point where the boys from the high
school see their families being held behind a wire fence.  I can't
remember the movie that well, but that image comes to mind from the
first line in the lyrics above.  As time marches on, the young boys
become more immune to pain and emotions, which is what the second line
"a heart that cannont feel" talks about.  What a way to deal with
reality.

From: braun@iris.eecs.ucdavis.edu

Javier interprets thusly:

&gt;my personal apreciation of such phases is different:

&gt; 1) First Phase:  Metal (Strong inclinations towards Led Zeppelin)
&gt; 2) Second Phase: Progressive-high tec
&gt; 3) Third Phase:  "Back to basics era"
&gt;                  Rush tends to simplify its music, but still with very
&gt;                  high quality of musical performance. I know that this
&gt;                  appreciation is shaky, but I do feel a difference between
&gt;                  this phase and the rest.
&gt; 4) Fourth Phase: Presto- ?

I'd always thought the third was quite the opposite -- rather then a
move back to basics, it seems to me like they were getting increasingly
*orchestrated*, culminating in HYF.  When I first heard HOF, I thought,
gods! how'll they ever get everything synchronized in concert;
everything seemed constructed as layer upon layer (I seem to remember
an interview in which Ged said that out of all their albums, they were
less concerned about how the songs would work out live on this one --
that whoever produced it suggested they cut loose a little and
experiment with a more layered sound).  I'd call phase 3 "The
Orchestrated Era", and maybe (yet to be seen) Phase 4 the "Back to
Basics"...  (IMHO, IMHHO, IMHHHOO, etc., etc.).

To Terry:

&gt;        On another note, could anyone out there give me some insight on the
&gt;cover of Caress of Steel?  I'm having a bit of difficulty trying to figure
&gt;the pictures on the front and back of the album out.

The front: Friend Necromancer, gazing into his Prism "Eyes"
The back:  The Fountain of Lamneth, upon the Mountain in the East

Mr. Bob Pitas and Red Lenses:

&gt;I have always thought it was written to reflect the paranoia
&gt;accompanying the cold war.  Remember when we used to think that the
&gt;'commies' were everywhere?  For instance:

&gt;"We've got Mars on the horizon"

&gt; - Mars, the god of war, just over the horizon?  Scarey thought in light of
&gt;   things like the Cuban missle crisis.

Actually, the song could be quite prophetic, what with the possibility
of a joint US/Soviet manned mission to Mars in the future...

In light of the 2112 interpretations floating around, I was going to
offer one, in which our (tragic) hero can actually be seen as a Christ
figure, having to die before the better days could come, but in further
light of the recent (Christ!) Pass dialog, I'll forgo it...  ;) ;)

Several things...  (I hope this isn't too long for the list.  Is there any

1)  I'm the guy who originally wondered about the ending to 2112...
    I did mention the "lost brotherhood of man returning"...  I
    meant to say "Elder Race of man".  I was shootin' from the hip,
    and I shot myself in the foot...  Sorry for the confusion.  BUT,
    the discussion was interesting :-)  After going back and re-listening
    to The Grand Finale, the voice at the end can actually sound
    benevolent and maybe even joyous.  I guess you kinda hear what
    you expect to hear.  Hmmmm...

2)  Someone asked "What is Red Sector A about?"  I always thought it
    was about the Earth being taken over by some menace from space...
    "Are we the only human beings to survive?"  Kinda gives you a
    creepy feeling to think that you and your mom are the only humans
    left alive...  What would you do?  Try to re-start the human race,
    or would that pretty much be it for us as a species?  :-)

3)  Someone else mentioned that Neil was writing less complex songs.
    Actually, I have not really noticed his drumming going downhill...
    In fact, I would say that he may be concentrating on the lyric now.
    If you take an album like "A Farewell to Kings", and look a the
    lyrics...  They are pretty much strightforward stories with relativly
    little double-meantings, little gotcha's, etc.  Looking at Presto,
    though, you can read alot more into the lyrics, as evidenced by the
    recent "Christ in The Pass" debates.  Just my observations...

4)  Okay, now that I have my copy of "A Farewell to Kings" out, I have
    some questions for you Rush-experts :-)

    4a)  Why was the guy trapped in "Xanadu"?  Why couldn't he just leave
         the pleasure dome and resume a mortal life?  Was it like
         "Shangri-La" in Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, where once you
         leave, you turn real old and crumble into dust real fast?
    4b)  Where does Cygnus-X1 Book I fit into "Hemispheres?"  On the one
         hand, the "to be continued..." bit makes it seem like it is
         chronologically before book II, like the guy went through the
         black hole, and inside he found this world in torment...  However,
         In Book II, part IV, he talks about 'The Rocinante's final flight
         to this immortal place'...  Like Book I actually takes place
         IN BETWEEN parts IV and V in book II, and in Book I, he is leaving
         the world and entering the world of the gods!??!
    4c)  Who IS this Cygnus PERSON(whatever) who has memory and awareness,
         but no shape or form?  Is it supposed to be the same guy on the
         Rocinante, somehow disembodied in the trip throught the blackhole?
         Is it the black hole ITSELF???
    4d)  Is the 'Rocinante' based in any literature, or was it like
         "By-tor and the Snow Dog", just something they made up?
    4e)  The picture inside my copy of "A Farewell to Kings" looks "funny"
         Its hard to describe...  Kinda grainy and washed out, like when
         the toner on a laser-printer or xerox machine starts to run
         low.  Did they mean to do this, or is my printing just bad?
         (The lyrics are crystal clear though)

Well, I have TONS of little observations/questions, etc (Don't we all? :-)
But I'll save them for another rainy day...  Hay, maybe it would be k00l
to meet together before the next concert (Whoever's going to the Chicago
concert) with all the albums and pick the lyrics apart???..!!!?  :-)

Well, I've heard the following rumors from a ***VERY RELIABLE** source:
1) Neil is going to a minimal drum kit: just 7 synth pads and an automated
switching system.., he's just tap with his fingers, no sticks!
2) Alex is going to pay acoustic only from here on out.
3) Geddy has refused to sing lyrics which are not environmentally concious.
4) Religious music will enter into their repetoire frequently.
5) They will have songs with no music, only words and slapping of body parts.
6) On their next tour, the openning group will be Eide Brikell and the New
Bohemians.
7) They will remake several songs by Vanilla Ice & Milli Vanilli.
8) The album will be released in 2 versions, the normal and "dance-remix"
version.
9) They will sacrifice small furry animals to Our Lord Satan on stage.
10) All concerts will be held in churches, temples, mosques, or vetrinarian
  clinics.

&gt;Subject: bad RUSH lines
&gt;
&gt;	I know some, perhaps most, of you out there believe that everything
&gt;RUSH has ever written is perfect.  What I am wondering is if there are
&gt;certain lines (or even songs, or albums, whatever) that RUSH has written
&gt;that you absolutely do not like at all.

Well, the only thing that's ever really bothered me is in "Cygnus X-1" (and
no, I'm not picking on your name!)  Being a rather technical person, I'm
annoyed by the use of plane coordinates to refer to 3-D space.	("...just
east of Lyra, northwest of Pegasus...")  But that's just me.  Now, what can
I do about that public service announcement that refers to a black hole as
"the biggest concentration of nothingness in the universe?" (Not relevant
to Rush, of course.)

&gt;2) Does anyone out there think that Red Lenses is about Nuclear Warfare (I.e. t
&gt;hermonuclear attack) - I think that if the atmosphere gets saturated w. low wav
&gt;elength radiation - i.e. the Infrared associated with the heat output of a TMbo
&gt;mb you would see red.	Or am I totally misinterpreting this tune? I'd love to h
&gt;ear some interpretations of the song, because it was the first Rush tune I hear
&gt;d and still is one of my faves.

I thought it was about McCarthy-ism and similar paranoia.

&gt;On a slightly different note, here's a tip on how to get relatively new Rush fa
&gt;ns (or slightly younger ones) even more into the group - explain the concept be
&gt;hind Anagram For Mongo (i.e. the wordplay; you did notice the wordplay didn't y
&gt;ou?) to them. It is surprising how many casual fans/listeners miss the connecti

Good day eh,

     Well this will be my SECOND post (actually that's pretty amazing...) anyway
here goes.

     I'm writing in response to Gary Varney's interpretation of Red Sector A.
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not say that Gary is wrong, I just thought that I'd
add my 2 cents about the song.(By the way...I like your interpretation Gary)
I got _P/G_ when I was a sophomore in high school, and really started to get into
the album. I was also reading the book "Night" by Elie Wassel (not sure of the
spelling on that one). For those of you not familiar, the book is a true story
of a young man in a Nazi concentration camp. For some reason, I always pictured
the song being about a concentration camp. Of course I was probably greatly
influnced by "Night", but every time I hear the line "Sickness to Insanity,
Prayer to profanity", I can only think of Elie Wassel's struggle to understand
his religion and the attrocities of what was happening to him and around him.
     Well, this is all IMHO so if anyone else wants to talk about this some
more I'd be happy to see it!!!

On the subject of Geddy's basses: like so many others here, I too
miss his black 4001 Rickenbacker.  In fact, no less than three of
my musical friends in high school bought 4001s after AFTK (two
black ones like Geddy's, and one *strange* red one).  Of course,
to really have a 4001 like Geddy's, you have to do some work on
the thing, like replacing the bridge with a Badass for starters.
It also helps if you're willing to use Rotosound strings - they
kill the neck of a Rick, but they do sound nice.

As far as Geddy's voice goes, I don't think I'd call him one of
the great rock vocalists (and I bet Geddy himself wouldn't claim
to be a _great_ singer, either).  He is quite effective in the
context of Rush's music, though, IMO.  His range isn't quite what
it used to be, and maybe that isn't all bad: I think he sounds
much better now that he isn't always pushing his pitch envelope.

&gt; Alex isn't classically trained (though you'd never know it), I'm
&gt; skeptical.

I'm not a "true" classical guitarist either (just a humble rock
and roll kid following in Alex's big footsteps), so my knowledge
may be less than complete.  But at the least I've never heard of
any enumerated and limited group of 'Masters', and I would be
highly skeptical of such an arbitrary grouping even if it did
exist.  My guess is that someone was pulling your leg.

On the subject of "bad" opening acts, the Rainmakers also opened
for Rush on the Minneapolis leg of the HYF tour.  They do kind of
a straightforward, feel-good rock and blues show.  It should be
said that the Rainmakers are actually a quite good band in the
proper environment (they headlined one of the big bar venues here
in town shortly before that and went over like gangbusters, from
what I heard), but I agree that they were entirely the wrong
sort of band to have opening up for a much more serious and
thoughtful group like Rush.

the audience is none other than fans at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium during

Subject: Re:  FreeWill (the band)

for clarity below:
FreeWill = the band you have all been refering to (east coast? canada?)
Freewill = SF bay area local band...

  My brother is the lead guitarist in a different Freewill (band) in the
San Francisco bay area. They have been playing for about 4 years now,
and are becoming popular. They have a tape out (that you can pick up at
tower records in San Jose (Bascom Ave.) - or could as of a year ago -
but I wouldn't bother, its not that good. Their newer stuff is much much
better), and are putting together a cd - don't know much about the
details. They have opened for Y&T a couple of times, and regularly play
bay area clubs. Their brand of music is more or less Steve Vai meets
Night Ranger (ok, so it lands more on the Night Ranger side).

  They won KSJO's best bay area band contest 2 (maybe 3) years ago, and
won some headbanger bay area cheapo-magazine's best South Bay band
award this year. Anyways, they claim that both of them (the two
freewill) bands know of each other. Steve (my brother) has a tape of
FreeWill (which I have not heard), and he doesn't think much of them
(again, its his opinion, not mine).

  For those that care about these things, Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records
(and Guitar Player fame) was supposedly interested in them, but wanted more
speed lick instrumentals, which they refused to do. Then (again
supposedly, I take what musicians say with a grain of salt or two) the
producer for Whitesnake was interested, but opted out to go produce
some other band. Soo.. such is life for starving musicians.

Subject: Geddy Lee on Alex Lifeson on Metal Shop

Serious Headbangers, if you've missed this week's edition of Metal Shop, it's
a shame. A lot of the "guitar gods" were either interviewed or their songs were
played. Some of the "gods" interviewed were Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Ted Nugent,
Jimmy Page, Angus Young, K.K. Downing and Glen Tipton, Geddy Lee(about Alex),
Joe Satriani(on Eddie Van Halen), Jon Lord(on Ritchie Blackmore), ex jimi's
bassist(on Jimi Hendrix), Montrose..............

I am reproducing the brief comment that Geddy Lee made.

Charlie "the butcher" Kendall : When you look at the reader's polls in most
metal magazines, rarely do they reflect the finest musicians but rather the most
popular. Rush's guitarist Alex Lifeson is one such person ( doesn't your heart glow at this comment!!!!!!) often overlooked by these polls. But regardless of
public opinion front man Geddy Lee recognizes the importance of having a
guitarist like Alex Lifeson in Rush.

Geddy Lee  :  Alex is such an integral part of the band. He's developed a style
that I think lot of people take for granted and forget that there's only
basically three instruments on stage most of the time. You know and such a big
part of that sound is him and I think his style as a rythm guitarist has been
underrated because he has the ability to play almost two parts at the same time
to keep the momentum and the rythm of the track going. I also think that his solo style is totally insane and (laughs) I don't think there are many guitar
players that sound like he sounds. I mean solo wise and play the kinds of notes that he squeezes out of his instrument. Very demented soloist and I think that's
a wonderful ability to have.

Well, I'm not going to say much about the whole thing about what "Christ,
what have you done" means except to say that I lean towards the ambiguity
camp.  What's more interesting is what I found in today's (Sunday, March
3, 1991) Calgary Herald entertainment section.  The "Selected Cuts" column
features five selected tracks that one of the Herald's music writers has
been getting into for the last month.  To quote:

"The Pass: Rush (from Presto, 1989).  Canada's - and the world's - best
progressive innovators are aging like fine wine.  Dramatic melody and
articulate, humanistic lyrics."

This week's writer was Frank King who, suprisingly, tends to review all
the Christian record releases, and writes on religion extensively elsewhere
in the paper.  I'm not sure, since I've never talked to him, but I infer from
some of his topics elsewhere in the paper that he leans toward evangelical
Christianity.  At least someone of that religious persuasion can see
through all the smoke of others who insist that Rush is satanic, and for that
matter, doesn't see "humanism" as another instrument of Satan leading us all
down the garden path.  Also nice to see someone in the mainstream media not
automatically run down Rush with the usual cliches.

Then again, he says in the same article that mentions Rush, that the group
Prism was "an underrated Canuck band" (one of my top ten least favourite
Canadian groups).  Maybe King ain't so bright after all!

&gt;I don't agree with the sentiment behind it and it really bugs me that
&gt;a band as talented and hardworking as Rush is would stoop to writing a
&gt;song about drugs like so many other less talented groups do.

Is this purported "stooping" due to the fact that other "less talented"
bands write about drugs, or is it a comment on mind altering substances?
I *LOVE* _Passage_to_Bangkok_, thank you very much, and the fact that
its subject matter concerns drugs (gasp!) makes for a better song.

If you don't like it, that's fine.  But don't put people (The Band) down
because they don't match up to your standards.  They most likely march to
the beat of their own drum.
