Hi Rushians,
	I just got a cool bootleg cd on Saturday that I bought from Brent North
(thanks Brent. It's an awesome cd.) It's called "By-Tor '74" and it's
from the Rush tour. It's almost the same thing as Electric Ladyland
except it is remastered and there's no scratches or weird sounds.
	Anyway, some of you must of visited my web page by now. But now I'm
going to make a lyric section. I can get lyrics from all the songs. But
I need lyrics for "Not Fade Away", "You Can't Fight It", "Bad Boy", and
"Fancy Dancer." I also need to know (if it's not too much trouble) who
wrote the lyrics and who wrote the music. Can anybody help me with this?
I know that you guys are a big help.

I would just like to clarify something (not make a big deal out of it).
About Dan's comment on the star on the 2112 cover, he is slightly wrong.
Whether it is upside-down or not it is called the same name.  It is a
PENTACLE.  The five star points symbolize the five elements: Earth, AiR,
Fire, Water, and Spirit.  The only time it is a pentagram is when it is
written on something (hence -gram).  Though he is correct in that the
upside-down pentacle symbolizes satan.  The right side up pentacle is
utilized in witchcraft and I guess the other is used in satanism.  I don't
really know Rush's beliefs and I don't particularly care, so don't start a
big arguement over this.

LONG LIVE RUSH!

Subject: Red Buick Riviera

What follows is NOT A FLAME, just a humorous observation:

>> I recently purchased what serves as my Red Barchetta, a 95 Buick Riviera.

When I read this, the first thought I had was: "what if the song WAS called
'Red Buick Riviera'"? Can you imagine the intro on ESL: "This is a song
about a car, this is called Red Buick Riviera", crowd cheers. Just imagine
the lyrics: "I strip away the old debris, that hides a shining car. A
brilliant Red Buick Riviera from a better vanished time." I was laughing
out loud!

Anyway, on to more serious matters... Yeah, the top 100 solo list was
pretty bogus. Whoever made the list is obviously VERY biased. In my
opinion, people like Steve Vai, Steve Morse, Joe Satriani, Eddie VanHalen,
and Alex (of course) should be on there several time each.
And Stairway to Heaven #1?! Jimmy Page was a great songwriter, but lets
be honest, he was a sloppy guitarist, especially in his solos.

One of the things that I admire about Alex is that he doesn't seem to have
that typical lead guitarist attitude. He doesn't seem to use the solo
section of a song to be flashy or show off. He plays what will fit and help
the song as a whole. His solos seem to fit perfectly with the mood and feel
of a song. And some Rush songs don't even have solos! Many rock guitarists
would have a heart attack if there was no solo in their song. They would
take it as a personal insult, but not our Alex.

That's my 2 cents for today.

Chris Cosentino

Subject: Headbanging to rush songs...

<<I'm 19 years old, and I think 
that some Rush songs are good and hard enough to headbanging with them, 
like the middle part of Red Barchetta, Analog kid, the end of Cygnus x-1 
(Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrgghhh!) and all the FBN, COS and 2112 l.ps. What do you 
think? Are some of you young enough to enjoy a Rush show like a hog in 
the mud and headbanging?>>

No, it definitiely isn't seen very often at a Rush concert either, although,
you will see a couple spirited audience members pick their moments...Back a
couple of years, during the Roll the Bones tour (I was 19 back then, just like
you...and had about 12 inches more hair than I do now...so it was appropriate)
I just started banging away during "Anthem" in their encore medley...people
were quite surprised...but I thought it was so cool for them to play that song
(one they hadn't done in aeons...) and they were playing it so heavy...it was
mandatory headbanging time...so I did!
Bang your head with zeal, young man...while you still have the brain cells to
which you can do conussive damage!

Subject: Different Stages

great news on several fronts.

firstly, rush has released promo material to media outlets, which includes
krause publications. release date is oct. 6, so i'm not going to post the
setlist or liner notes, but i will say that the rush manager hasn't yet been
wrong. i have more exciting news (for myself), but first let me throw a few
tidbits toward you.

1. the album is entitled Different Stages.

2. it is three discs, including the Live at Hammersmith Odeon 1978 third
disk.

3. geddy writes a note to rush fans in the liner notes, thanking fans for
supporting them to their "continuing amazement." geddy is also listed as the
co-producer with paul northfield.

4. the album is dedicated to the memory of Jackie and Selena.

that's all i'm willing to release, out of respect for the record company,
which certainly has time to change the setlist or liner notes. i know there
will be a media outlet somewhere that will ignore the embargo date, so i'm
sure you'll be reading the full setlist in no time.

now for the personally great news ­ after more than three years of trying,
i've finally convinced goldmine magazine to write a cover story on rush
(guess who gets to write it?) it will be a very comprehensive story on the
history of rush throughout its 25 years. there will be sidebars highlighting
the influence they've had on rock and also detailing their collectibles.

here's where i need your help. i'll be compiling a list of questions to ask
geddy and alex (i won't be talking to neil, unless something changes). what
would you like to know? also, where is the best source of collectibles
pricing? also, what bands have specifically mentioned rush as an influence,
and where was the mention?

i appreciate the help. i'm sure i'll be using several of you as a resource,
so let me thank you all in advance.

Subject: (no subject)

This regards the comments of Keith on the subject of Signals.
    First, I must state that Signals is by far, pound for pound as they
say, the best RUSH record to date.  I say this without apprehension and
I'll tell you why.  What Keith stated with re: to Signals being a
musical study of adolescence and growing
up is very profound.  I too draw the opinion to its effect it had on my
own pubescent years.  The initial track 'Subdivisions'clearly paints the
picture of troubled middle-class youth in an environment that breeds
cliques as well as outcasts.  Yet this is not why Signals is RUSH's
greatest work.  It's the pure, unabashed driving musicianship that  L, L
&P exhibit on this
record that makes it second to none.
    Coming off what I feel were the band's coming-of-age records,
Permanent Waves and  Moving Pictures,  RUSH
graduated to a whole new level.  This was the first significant release
that did not have at least one epic-in-length song, i.e..
'Hemispheres', 'The Camera Eye' and 'Natural Science'.   Instead we got
eight spectacular songs, all standing together to
make a wonderful whole.  The record exhibits virtuosity that I believe
was spawned by PW and MP.  Also, there is a cinematic
feel to Signals that, as a striving, independent film and videomaker
myself, had (and still has) a profound effect on me and my
work.  You see 'The Analog Kid' gazing up through the puffy clouds
pondering his future; you feel the pain of the writer and
the dancer in 'Losing It'; and you witness the awe inspiring adventure
of space flight in 'Countdown'.
    These are just a few thoughts I had on the subject of Signals, a
subject that I feel is too often ignored in what is truly the
greatest body of work in modern rock music. I would love to read more on
the subject of Signals and how it fits in your
RUSH experience.

Thanks

Subject: My take on "Different Stages" title....

	I'll keep this short.  I think it has a double meaning, kinda
like "Moving Pictures".  On the one hand, the CD will probably be a
compilation from many different venues (stages).  On the other hand, it
is possible that "different Stages" is a subtle reminder of the phases
(or stages) that Rush has gone through over the years.

Since I have received so many messages and requests for info for the 
Convention, I'd thought I'd save a lot of typing time by just plugging 
the event again...so he goes....

The 3rd UK Rush Convention will take place on Saturday, 19th September 
at Leicester University in England, starting at approx 2pm and finishing 
at midnight (or whenever we get flung out of the bar)....

Tickets are priced at £12 and are available from Mick Burnett, Editor of 
"The Spirit of Rush" Fanzine who organise the event...

Cheques are to be made payable to "The Spirit of Rush" and sent with an 
SAE to:

MICK BURNETT,
EDITOR,
THE SPIRIT OF RUSH,
c/o 23 GARDEN CLOSE,
CHINBROOK ROAD,
GROVE PARK,
LONDON SE12 9TG.

Please send the SAE otherwise no tickets will be sent...Around 100 
tickets have been sold so far, which isn't really good enough, 
folks....last year we had close to 1000 people at the event, so get your 
tickets quickly!!!!!

There are loads of stalls selling merchandise, Bootleg CD's, concert 
videos, and so on; a huge Rush Raffle with loads of tour stuff as prizes 
eg last year we had copies of The Masked Rider and A Work in Progress, 
and the Grand Prize was a Moving Pictures Platinumn Disc....

Show wise, there's Rush Karaoke plus a full tribute show by one of the 
UK's premier tribute bands, "Tom Sawyer"......so please come along, 
cause as a favour to the organisers, I'm on vocals for the Tom Sawyer 
Show, so I'll need loads of support!!!!!!

See you there, and if you meet me at the bar, I'll have a lager!!!

Cheers,

I just got the latest Columbia House Music magazine in the mail and was

RUSH - Moving Pictures
And on the 7th day, God created power trio RUSH - and King's X and
Primus looked up from their high chairs and said, "Hey, these guys
rock!" Includes classics Tom Sawyer; Limelight; Red Barchetta and YYZ,
plus The Camera Eye; Witch Hunt and Vital Signs. (Mercury) 1981. 211961
$5.99.

The only thing wrong here is that this is not the remastered version.
They have the remastered Blizzard of Oz and Diary of a Madman but not
MP.

the release date for the live album has been pushed back to Nov. 17, we're
told by the record company. we weren't given a reason (nor did we ask,
actually). perhaps they're going for the christmas season, or perhaps
there's another product they don't want to compete with. whatever the

Subject: Rush at the ballpark

Hey,
I saw the Colorado Rockies play the Mets at Coors Field.  While I have
lived in the Centennial State for most of my life, this was the first
time I went to the ballpark to take in a game.  When each Rox player
comes up to bat, a theme "song" (actually just a few measures) is 
played, e.g. Larry Walker comes to bat, Ozzy's Crazy Train plays.

What song was played when Pitcher Darryl Kyle steps to the plate?
Tom Sawyer.  The first power chord plays, and then Geddy sings "A modern
day warrior..."  and then the music fades out.

I assume each player gets to pick his theme music.  It wasen't much
Rush, but it was nice to hear it each time he was up.

Final score:  Rockies 11  Mets 4

What you ask...  is going on here?

This is for those of you with kids, who have been overwhelmed with Spice
Mania and have been to one of the shows.  Check the tour book, which you
no doubt bought at least one copy of.  Look at the credits on the inside
back cover.  Specifically, the last name in the left side column.  Yes,
it's Tom Whittaker - Bus Driver.  Those of you who have been around the
block a couple of times will recognize 'Whitey' as Rush's long time bus
driver (up until Counterparts).  With Rush not touring, he's got a find
a way to pay the bills.

Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio appearing for a second time on a live album and
CLoser to the Heart appearing on it's third *consecutive* live album when
NOT A SINGLE track has been selected from Presto. I pretty much expected

I'd like to agree, but if there's one thing I'd hate worse than seeing
the boys get no recognition, it's seeing them become "trendy", you know? 
I mean, it's one thing for all of us, since we got into Rush because *we*

hear people say "Rush sucks!" than to know they're only listening to Rush
because someone *else* told them Rush is cool, and in about 3 months,
Rush will be "old hat" (kinda like that phrase...  ;) ).  I know I should
be thrilled every time someone new starts to listen to Rush, but I just
can't stand the idea that Rush would become a trend, have 15 more minutes
of fame, and then be shoved out the door to make way for the new new New

Hey Y'all,

I am along-time listener, first-time caller (blah, blah, blah). Anyway, 
I wanted to voice MHO about the new live album. I have the same mixed 
feelings as our dear administrator. Do we really need to have another 
live version of "Tom Sawyer", "Freewill", or "Spirit of the Radio"? 
Don't get me wrong, I love these songs; these are the songs that got me 
hooked on RUSH in the first place. However, I love the newer songs, and 
the ones that never made it onto live albums in the past, too. Obviously 
that was a corporate decision out of the hands of the band members; I 
can't see them not wanting to showcase their other work in a live 
setting.

I am excited about the third CD. It will be cool to hear songs like 
"Cinderell Man" live. I was too young to catch those shows. Can't wait 
for a new studio album!

Assuming that Rush indeed still has any plans to release another studio
album (my personal opinion is that it won't happen), on the oft mentioned
date of January 1, 2000, I would have to say that if the Year 2000 computer
problems come to fruition as many have speculated, then the release would
have to be delayed.  I know this is 16+ months away, but it has crossed my

praying for Analog Kid, thats one of my faves.

And I do have a crazy theory on the "real" meaning of "Carve Away The Stone."
Check the lyrics here: "Roll that stone to the top of hill."  My theory:
Rush's wisecrack shot to the Rolling Stones. Message: If you guys can still do
it, so can we.  And we all know that the Rolling Stones (who despise by the
way) did not only roll to the top of the hill, but are diving down the other

Hello all!
	Looks like the new album is going to be very good. I'm anxiously
awaiting the release. It's too bad tha Cold Fire and The Analog Kid
didn't make it because they are such great songs.
	In response to Valkyrie's request to Rush and MST3K, there are
about 5 to 10 episodes in which I know of a mention of them. They have
been on a roll lately with 5 out of the last 5 episodes with a
reference.
	Cat's post almost made me laugh. I actually knew someone who had
the Hanson CD. I would have to say that my Scorpions World Wide Live CD
is the most embarassing one I have right now.

Take care!

well, as far as i know, just about all of my friends hate, or at least
don't like rush.  so they think!  one of my friends heard the live
version of what you're doin' (from chronicles) and said it was awesome
(he didn't know who it was at the time.  then he heard the solo from
about 12:00 into 2112 and thought that was amazing.  so now i've got him
listening to rush a little.

but when i ask just about everyone else what they've heard by rush, it
usually comes up that they can't name anything by rush.  though Q98 plays
tom sawyer about everyday, closer to the heart, the trees, and
*occasionally* new world man.  so i mention closer to the heart and tom
sawyer, and they say 'that's it, those songs!'  i ask if they like them,
they say that the songs are ok, but lacking (???).  so my opinion on rush
haters is that they haven't heard the right songs to get them started. 
some people it's better to start them off with cinderella man and
madrigal, then closer to the heart and xanadu.  other people want to hear
something like what you' doin or dreamline, cygnus x-1 or a passage
through bangkok.  

remember, if you want to try and get some one to listen to rush, make
sure you know what they want to hear, and play something like it for
them.  the first impression is the most important.

     Was anyone as fortunate as me to have seen Rush back in 1983 at
Radio City Music Hall in N.Y.C. ? They played (5) nights and previewed
3 songs from Signals which they had just completed but not released.
They were Subdivisions, New World Man, and The Analog Kid ( one of my
all-time favorites).
All of the shows sold out at $17.50 a pop and I went to the 1st, 3rd, &
last show.  I had 10th row dead center for the last show and I remember
looking up at that beautiful domed ceiling in Radio City and feeling
that the Gods were truly looking down on me that night...
     They played alot from Moving Pictures and the acoustics were
unbelievable in that venue.
I remember they ended with Vital Signs and its true what they say- the
song is amazing Live;
and I can still hear Geddy's voice echoing through the hall "everybody
wants to deviate from the norm" over & over again like they didn't want
their New York experience to end...

Time for my once a year posting.

I must vent. I must.

The track listing for the upcoming live CD is absolutely emabarrassing.
The band should be ashamed to put this out. Lets see...

The Trees...again
Closer to the Heart...again. Will this overrated song ever die?
2112. Not even in the right key. 
Freewill...again.
The same drum solo...for the most part.
The Spirit of Radio...again
Tom Sawyer...again. See Closer...
YYZ...again.

Why?   I like almost all of these songs. I dont want them to be on another
album. I already own the first three where this material is covered. I was
really hoping for The Pass, Ghost, Vital Signs, Analog Kid, Cold Fire etc. 
That would have been a great live CD. Instead I will get a repeat of the
past ...again.

My same complaint holds true for the live setlist over the last half dozen
tours. Way too much repitition. Put something out for the real fans of
your CATALOG of work rather than the Greatest Hits type of thing.

I am very disappointed and will now seriously consider not even buying
this piece of garbage.

I guess all good things must come to an end sooner or later.

Hi All,
     I don't know about anybody else, but I'm a little disappointed by the
songs selected for the new Live album. How many times do we need Trees,
Closer, Freewill, Spirit and Sawyer?? It's not like the songs have really
changed over the years! Although it is pretty cool to finally have Limelight
and a regular live version of YYZ! 
     What happened to Analog, Pass, Vital, Xanadu/Prelude, Double Agent, Cold
Fire, Half The World (A fairly big radio hit here in NJ) Time & Motion, and
Virtuality!!?? 
     Hell, the stage set on the T4E tour was based on Half The World!! I don't
get it! Oh well, at least we get Natural, Bravado, and the updated 2112 (Thank
God!!)
     I really hope the Video has some of these gems! (If there is one!) And I

Ryan, I've enjoyed your previous posts, and I hope you will allow me to 
gently correct some of your points about the pentagram (no pun intended!).  
Yes, we are almost done with the subject.  I managed to ignore that other 
guy's post because it was so obvious he was blathering.  Also I thought this 
might make for an interesting discussion on different symbol-systems.
 
I agree with you that the star on the cover of 2112 is merely a star in a 
circle!

>Secondly, what you all keep refering to as a "pentagram" (a symbol of

>and if it's pointing the other way, it's considered witchery (or whatever
>the word is I'm lookin' for...something to do with witches and witchcraft
>and Wicca and that crap...).

In eleven years of studying ceremonial magick, I have never heard that the 
pentagram has to be completely within the circle to be considered a symbol of 
"evil."  Rather I have heard that the circle contains the energy while using 
a pentagram without it allows the energy to spread out.  But, then, perhaps 
you know more about it than I do.  I'd like to say that your ideas about the 
"pointing direction" are less than accurate: you see, five elements are 
attributed to each point of the pentagram, and Spirit is attributed to the top
point if the pentagram is up.  Spirit reigns over the other four elements....
Earth Air Fire & Water....hmmm, four Counterparts...anyway, when the pentagram 
is flipped so that Spirit is down, and essentially matter reigns over Spirit, 
people get freaked out and say that's satanic...which is an interesting thing 
to say, considering our materialistic society today....as you say below, 
these things are just symbols and have no intrinsic meaning.  But we attribute 
meaning to our symbols which *can* make them very powerful.  Remember a few 
years ago, the big hoo-hah about to-burn-or-not-to-burn American flags?

>Hugh Syme, in many, many sources, has been quoted as saying that

I could kick him for this.  (Kidding -- he is MY DRUM GOD.)  Couldn't he 
foresee the meaningless debate we'd have so many years later?  Did you guys 
ever hear that RUSH stands for Royal Ushers of Satan's House?  I heard that 
in high school.  I swear, people have great imaginations!

>What is the thing on the cover of 2112, then, if it's not a pentagram?

THANK YOU!  It's very simple folks!

I thought it was projected on water.  But then, I like to believe that Geddy 
burps during Camera Eye.

That's a great exercise in non-attachment!  The Buddhists would be proud of you!

This is an excellent point, but let's take it a step farther and look at 
their effects in consensus reality.  Because this is so obvious to me, 
perhaps someone else may agree?  There was a time when Ozzy was getting sued 
because some kid offed himself while listening to an Ozzy song, I believe it 
was Suicide Solution.  That's sad...and I'm the first to grant Ozzy his right 
to artistic expression....but the reality that occured is that this kid
offed himself, which caused a bunch of strife.  Perhaps Ozzy included too 
much of the dark forces in his music - certainly, tipping the scales towards 
light would have produced a constructive effect, helped this kid to deal with 
his world.  Now, on the other hand, Rush inspires us to greatness, integrity, 
as I've seen many of you write here, "Rush is the soundtrack of my life!"  
Trite but true.   The reality that is occuring is that Rush helps us out in 
whatever ways with our lives.  Therefore, they are not of the dark forces.  For
those who didn't follow this, this means that RUSH IS NOT A "SATANIC" BAND!

>Don't you think Neil is smart enough to know if the image he created is the 
> one he wanted?
Agree.  Neil's a pretty perceptive guy.

Of course, I could be completely wrong about all this.  Really, I hope that 
other Rush fans would be open-minded; that's the kind of company that I like.  
But anyone may feel free to flame me privately, they will be cheerfully 
ignored.  Peace be with you, Elise
