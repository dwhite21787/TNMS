First off I think you all missed a big one.  Didn't Firehouse's second album
have the name Hold Your Fire???  Also on a different note #C(sorry private joke
I'm not to sure of the song bu on the album Frixzzle Fry by Primus the begining
of one of the songs is the drummer playing a terrible version of YYZ and as 
soon as the bass hits that first note they all cut out like when you put your 
hand on a record that was playing, you all know that sound don't you??????
Oh, Well enough for know(-k_).

	I thought I would let everyone know (if you didn't know already) that
there may be some rare Master Recording versions (you know, the gold, over-
priced CDs?) floating around the Southeast of "Moving Pictures".  Seems the
folks over at the local JVC plant began pressing an incorrect screen for the
song titles onto the CD. Song two reads:  "Red Barchette". Only about 1500
of these were put out until they were caught by a line worker. If you can
get your hands on one, they might be a tiny bit valuable one day.

Hi Everyone,
	I posted yesterday about a talk here at B.U. about
Ayn Rand's theory of Free Will...I am sooooo sorry that I had
my facts screwy.  Let me clear everything up:
	The flyer actually reads (and this time I have it in
front of me):
	The Boston University Objectivist Club presents
	Ayn Rand's Theory of Free Will
A talk by Harry Binswanger, author of "The Biological Basis of
Teleological Concepts", editor "The Ayn Rand Lexicon", and "Intro-
ductio to Objectivist Epistemology, 2ed".
	Why is a drunk a drunk?  Why is Bill Gates rich?  Is your
culture in your blood?  Dr. Binswanger presents Ayn Rand's theory
of free will, according to which man fundamentally controls his
own life, bears moral responsibility for his actions, forges his
own character, and chooses his own values.
	Stone B-50, 675 Comm. Ave.   7pm, TUESDAY MARCH 30

Sorry all, if that's more than you ever needed to know, but I felt
responsible if there were any wandering people tonight.  Oh, and it
IS free, and it IS sponsored by the Ayn Rand Institute.  I had a
little bit right, at least!
	No chem lab that night, either...cool...

Subject: Radio Play

Here in NYC WNEW-FM 102.7, the 'classic rock' station (although they play
some new stuff) gives rush a decent amount of air time.  Nothing too far
from the standard rush radio playlist, though.  They have a feature called
"Live at Five" where they play at 20-30 minute live set for the evening
drive home.  Last nite they played Rush at the New Jersey Meadowlands, the
Hold your Fire tour.  I was only able to listen to a couple of minutes
though.

The other 'classic rock' station in NYC, 92.3 K-Rock ("all the music you
already own, all the time", Howard Stern (ugh), The Greaseman) plays some
Rush, but not that much.  The Rock Station on Long Island, 102.3 WBAB, plays
a lot of Rush and a decent variety of songs, too.

Can't wait for the New Album!  Really tired of hearing about Van Halen,
their old stuff is great, the new (Hagar) stuff is o.k., but the Live album
sucks!  A tribute to the Who?  Give me a break.....

Hello,
I just bought _Standing in the Shadows of Motown_, a book about
the life and influence of Motown bass great, James Jamerson.
Anyhow, for you Rush fanatics, Geddy Lee plays a cover of _Get
Ready_ (originally performed by The Temptations, and Rare Earth)
on one of two tapes accompaning the book.  Pretty cool.

Incidentally, I remember reading and interview with Gene Simmons
where he said that the _This is Spinal Tap_ scene where the band
gets lost under the stage had to be based on something that
happened to Kiss.

Subject: Opening Acts

And my vote for the opening act I'd like to see the most with
Rush......(envelope please!).....

NO ONE....yes, that's right....I would rather see Rush play an
extra 1 - 1 1/2 hours than sit through someone I had no interest
in seeing...when I go to a Rush show, I want to see Rush, not Mr. Big
, not (dare say) Dream Theatre, not Eric Johnson...if I want to
see them, I'll go to their show...no matter how small the venue
or whatever.

This does not mean other bands should not be given a chance to
go on tour with others...in fact, I've been enlightened to a lot
of new music by going to see a band and being impressed with the
tag-a-long...but I personally like to see the up-and-coming bands
group together and tour (a la Lollapollooza &lt;--sp?).

I don't feel like this about all bands either...just the ones who
have been around long enough to have sets which warrant such length...
the last couple of Rush shows I felt a bit cheated...instead of
hearing Rush play some of the stuff I *wanted* to hear...I had to listen
to someone else take up time...then only hear medlies of the songs
I've never heard before (in their entirety) in concert (I was a late-
blooming Rush fan).

Oh well, just my two cents....I guess if I *had* to choose an
opening act...hmmm, maybe a history of the band (like Metallica did
on their last tour).

Subject: Rush on the Radio, amongst other things

Ok this is my first posting, I've only been on the mailing list for a couple of
days so forgive me if I'm repeating stuff.

I've been a Rush fan ever since I got into rock music in about 1982, initially
I just liked all the early stuff (2112, Caress of Steel, Fly By Night) ... It
wasn't until I got a bit older that I started digging the more complex modern
stuff. I've managed to see them live twice in '88 and '92 ... I was lucky
enough to be at the Birmingham NEC gig where they recorded the video/album for
Show of Hands.

One issue that seems to be coming up quite a bit on this is the question of
Rush on the radio. Those of you who complain about the lack of Rush on the
Radio in the US should count yourselves lucky. At least you have rock radio
stations where you can hastle DJ's to play Rush. In the UK there is only one
national station that plays all pop and rock music - BBC Radio 1FM.

There are but 5 hours a week dedicated to rock music ... of which 2 are the
really heavy end of things (viz: Metallica, Motorhead, etc, etc), and the
other concentrates on classics and requests. Both of these are evening shows
on a Friday and Saturday when all decent rockers are in the pub anyway !! I've
only ever heard one Rush track on day-time radio (which is mainly chart and
dance music and is generally pathetic) and that was Time Stand Still when it
was first released.

Occasionally the local commercial FM stations have an hour or so of rock a week
(and by rock I mean anything from Doc Holiday to Napalm Death) so you can
imagine the lack of time for playing things like Rush. Not only this but the
local FM stations by no means cover the entire UK.

To another issue: I *hope* whoever compared Neil Peart to Frank Beard was
joking!

Thats all from sunny Wales folks : -) NOT !

The play Rush like they are going out of style...  They have this thing at
5pm called the five at 5.  They pick an artist and play five songs.

&gt; Here in lovely eastern Massachusetts, we have a radio station called 
&gt; WCGY (93.7)
&gt; The play Rush like they are going out of style...
&gt;
&gt; So, if you are ever in the Boston area, tune your radio to 93.7 (wcgy) and 
&gt; do me a favor...rip the dial off of the radio, and request lots of RUSH!!!!!!!

Really? When did this station pop up? I live out on the upper Cape (Cape
Cod, MA, for those going: "huh?") and I listen mostly to WHJY (94.1) out of
Providence, Rhode Island. They play mostly "mainstream" Rush and
occasionally will pick a less often heard song like "The Trees" and "2112".
Tuesday nights, they put up three classic albums and play the most requested
by listener votes in its entire length. So one night, the list included
"Permanent Waves." So, like any other model citizen and diehard Rush fan, I
cast three votes for the album. Turned out that it won by a landslide, so I
got to go to sleep by the sounds of PeW.

I can usually get the Boston stations, but I have never heard of WCGY. I
guess I'll have to use the dial of the radio and tune to 93.7 (however, I'll
keep the knob attached to the radio).

Subject: Tap notes

Yes, I know it's the Rush list, but it's still on-topic...

Nigel of Spinal Tap is based largely on Jeff Beck.  In fact,
the title of "Pop, Look and Listen" (from the Spinal Tap
soundtrack) is obviously a reference to "Stop, Look and Listen"
from one of the Beck albums (_Flash_, perhaps?).

I don't remember where I heard this... some interview with
Christopher Guest, I suppose.

Hello again and welcome to Wild Speculation Inc.'s AGM:

&gt; According to a very close source to the band, there will be 11 songs on
&gt; the new record.

Ouch, eleven? Really? Honest? Well glad I'm getting it on tape not LP,
judging from the so-so quality of the Presto vinyl. Eleven. Guess
they're not doing any long tracks then. :)

&gt; Peter Collins has been helping them write the record as well.

Let me get this straight word-wise. *Write*? Could be interesting. I'm
sure a lot of that kind of 'influence' thing must happen implicitly
anyway, but it'll be of interest whether they give him a credit or not.

&gt; as appears to be the case with most other radio stations, when i hear
&gt; Rush on the radio it's for the most part limited to mainstream songs

Rush on the radio. Hmm, well it's not going to be a high-scoring word
association over here - Rush, radio, errr? I remember a year or two ago
hearing 2112 (whole 1st side) on a rock show, and I know that 'Available
Light' and RTB were both played before the respective albums' releases
(I think). Remember though, unimaginative selections are better than
*zilch*. Well ok, better than very very very little indeed then.

&gt; Jun    Rush              &lt;title unavailable&gt;             [JC2]

Maybe that's Lush (groans from those with vague memories). 'Title
Unavailable', though - must be an anagram! Aha, so the title will be
"Lute Vain, Bale Tail". Right! It's official, the new album is about a
self-obsessed lute player, followed everywhere by his trusty bale of
straw. No? Er... "Vanilla Beat-U-Tile" then, the story of a harsh world
dominated by ice-cream-eating, ceramic-smashing madmen. Or possibly
"Tai Tuna Label Veil", a tale of the dangers that lie in not being open
about your labels...

I guess it's 'sit and wait till September' time now, isn't it. Oh well...

The more that things change, the more they stay insane.

This is excellent , keep the ideas coming into  me. Ive got some ideas
that sound like the show would be incredible.  Once again if you dont
have the question for the public opinion poll here it is:

"who do you think would be the best band to open up for an upcoming rush
show....this band can be past or present and do not have to have a
new album coming out."
this question comes in response to the rumors of a new rush album coming

I just FTP'ed the song parodies file off of syrinx, and found it to
be quite interesting.  But how come most of the stuff is from RtB?
Are there any ones from previous albums?  How about album title
parodies, like "A Farewell To the King", featuring Elivs sitting in
the chair, in the same position as the marionette?  Or how about Sigh
By Night (Sigh All Night?), Pesto (as in the sauce), or the ultimate:
Hold Your Mayo....

   [ Not all are from RTB, "The Big Money, Witch Hunt, and Red Tide" are also
     represented. Most were done just after the album RTB came out, which is why
     most are from that album. If you have a good parody of any song, by all 
     means send it to the list and I'll put it in the file!	    : rush-mgr ]

Hey this is my first post.  I'd like to first say that a

See, Rush is going commercial since I just saw an add on TV for McDonalds
and they used "Moving Pictures" as a subtitle.  Of course you don't see
any Madonna albums in McDonald's commercial so Rush has got to be
highly commercial these days. Also I heard my calc teacher also saying
'Divide the function f into subdivisions ....' Ha! so there.

Disclaimer: :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)...This is a Joke (note the capital J), just
thought it was odd to see the title in a McDonalds ad. Maybe Ronald is a
Rush fan!!!! Ha, now that would be funny....
