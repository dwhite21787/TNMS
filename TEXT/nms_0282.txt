For those of you keeping score, there was no NMS for either Thursday (7/4)
or Friday (7/5).

Also, read closely this issue, especially a certain post about the new
album-to-be - it seems to be pretty interesting, and jives with information
I'd previously gotten from another source.  Here's to a fast arrival of 9/3!

Well.....the dates are almost correct.  Actually, HYF was officially released
in September '87, although the single "Force 10" was first played about the
third week of August.  Also, I think Signals was released in August, not
September of '82, since I seem to remember buying it a few weeks before
classes began that Fall (usu. class starts in August for me.)

	Ok.  I see a trend towards random flaming, and I am going to try and
dump some halon on it.

	This is nuts guys (&lt;- not gender specific, I just can't bear "y'all").
This list was created for a certain purpose, and we are here to help
fulfill it.  If things go right, we all reap benefits.  Each and every
one us has a different viewpoint and a different style of presentation,
and that is what makes such a list interesting.

	I'm here because I like to hear various opinions and interpretations of
Rush and their work.  You don't like Rush?  Great!  Tell me why.  Just
don't *itch at me (us) for subscribing to a list like this and voicing
my (our) opinions.
	 Every now and then something comes up that I really couldn't care less
about.  I SCROLL PAST IT.

	I guess what I am saying is this:
*1) PLEASE don't stop doing things the way they are being done.  That is
    why I am here.  I don't want things bland.
*2) Keep giving all opinions, but do it in a unobtrusive manner.  You can
    tell when you are getting condescending  or hostile.
*3) If you must flame, seriously consider whether the rest of the list
    really needs to hear it.  Just about everyone can be reached by personal
    e-mail and you can iron out differences that way.  Don't just vent your
    emotion on the list-  Most of us really won't feel chastised.
*4) If things really get that bad, unsubscribe (send to
    rush-request@syrinx.umd.edu).  No need to make a specticle and send a
    good ridence letter to the NMS-  We'll just scroll past it.
*5) Kudos to the rush-mgr for putting up with all of it, and not
    exercising his ability to censor.

Finally- Too much time and space have been put into this already.  If
you have a disenting opinion or just feel like putting a torch to me do
it at gbest@athena.mit.edu.  Sorry it took so much space to say this,
it'll be the last.

Subject: Rush quotes in "serious" work

I used several quotes from Rush in papers written in college. A paper I wrote
examining the growth of the isolationist movement in the US and the concurrent
rise of facism/nationalism in Europe(at the same time as the pacifist movement
was trying to ban all wars) quoted the last verse from "Witch Hunt", while a
paper on theological perspectives of nuclear weapons/war quoted from "The
Weapon." I am writing a vaguely autobiographical novel based on the theme of
"Circumstances" and I'm certain my Ph.D. thesis will have a Rush quote in there
somewhere. Maybe I need some other sources....naaaaaaah!

Subject: more balls!

I wrote

   &lt;&lt;I'm really interested in knowing if there is anything in
    _The Fountainhead_ which mentions balls specifically. I understand
    that Objectivism is fundamentally individualistic and that the balls
    are _individual balls_ but is that really grounds for saying that the
    balls were inspired by _The Fountainhead_ or Ayn Rand in any direct
    way?&lt;&lt;

in response to Phil Simon's rather brashly presented claim that the
three balls on the cover of _HYF_ were inspired by A.R. and _TF_. What
I was looking for was a little _show_ to match Phil's _tell_.

Phil responded

&gt;This posting is in answer to Gregg Jaeger's dismissal of the correlation
&gt;between the three balls on the HYF cover and Ayn Rand's The
&gt;Fountainhead.  Anyone who has both read the book listens to Rush can not
&gt;ignore the direct allusion to the three distinct spherical objects as a
&gt;metaphor for individuality, independence, and egoism.  I seem to recall
&gt;it being mentioned on about page 300.

Let's not be holier-than-thou about Objectivism, please. I did not
_dismiss_ the hypothesis that the three balls have a connection
with _TF_ I was merely arguing against it in the face of the evidence
which had so far appeared in TNMS. I have read the books of Ayn Rand
and appreciate her ethical philosophy. I simply did not remember any
such connection. Since several people in a recent posting claimed to
remember the passage about three guilded balls, it seems likely that
there is a connection between the balls and _TF_ -- though I'm not
quite prepared to accept that they are ``a metaphor for individuality,
independence, and egoism'' -- and what I'm looking for is definitive
evidence of the connection (you know, a quote and a chapter or page).
Furthermore, there may be, and it seems likely that there is, _more
than one_ meaning that can be attributed to the balls.

Phil goes on

&gt;Gregg claims that the three balls signify the three members of Rush, and
&gt;that is an ostensibly plausible theory.  However, after reading The
&gt;Fountainhead, that theory was quickly dismissed in my mind.

What's so implausible about it? I think Phil is dismissing the idea that the
balls represent the band members too quickly. The _HYF_-tour rear-screen video
(where the three balls pass by the albums of Rush) gives some support to the
balls/band connection. There is no reason why the balls can't represent
_two_ things.

Paul May's post was much more enlightening (thanks, Paul.)

&gt;I've lent my copy of TF to a friend, so I can't quote exactly, but
&gt;there is a section
&gt;where one of the characters states that the symbol for Mankind should be
&gt;the 3 balls of a pawnbroker - the idea being that Mankind has pawned its
&gt;integrity to the highest bidder, and is satifying its short-term,
&gt;primitive needs, rather than investing for the future & doing what is
&gt;right & proper.

This reply has substance to it and accords with the themes of
_HYF_, ``Red Tide,'' ``Second Nature,'' ``Mission,'' and ``Prime
Mover.'' Indeed, Paul goes on

&gt;There are other quotes in the book, which refer to Mankind's spirit of
&gt;adventure and curiosity. Ayn Rand calls the force which motivates these
&gt;impulses a 'Prime Mover'.

The concept of a `Prime Mover' goes back to Aristotle where it has a
much different meaning than in Rand, being rather the ultimate cause
of the cause-and-effect chain of the universe. For an advocate of the
power of the human and individual spirit, this is a nice twist on the
original concept. The following is a quote from _TF_  [Ch. XVIII]
(p.710 in the Macmillan 1986 hardcover printing) -- relevant to
``Mission'' -- it is Roark speaking:

``Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down
new roads armed with nothing but their own vision... the great creators
-- the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors -- stood
alone against the men of their time... His truth was his only motive.
His own truth, and his own work to achieve it in his own way. A
symphony, a philosophy, an airplane, or a building -- that was his
goal and his life... The creation, not its users... The creation which
gave form to his truth... His vision came from his own spirit...
[The ego] is the whole secret of their power -- that it was self-
sufficient, self-motivated, self-generated. A first cause, a fount
of energy, a life force, a Prime Mover...''

``[Man's] brain is his only weapon...''

Clearly ``Prime Mover'' and ``Mission'' have something substantial to do
with Objectivism. I looked through _TF_ and wasn't able to locate the
passage mentioned by Phil and Paul and others, but I found another
interesting bit relevant to Rush (and the above mentioned ``weapon''?)
from the opening paragraphs of chapter V:

``[Dominique] saw the faces streaming past her, the faces made
alike by fear -- fear as a common denominator, fear of themselves,
fear of all and of one another.''

These three forms of fear were always the way I believed the songs
of the Fear Trilogy come together to form a whole:

``fear of themselves''  --  ``The Enemy Within,''
``fear of all''         --  ``Witch Hunt,'' and
``fear of one another'' --  ``The Weapon.''

Pretty neat. Although these three parts of the trilogy contain
other themes as well.

So, can anybody find the location of the hiding balls?

In my day......they didn't have a National Midnight Star,  Rush fans just
played Rush as loud as they could and spit at each other.  To get to concerts,
we had to walk through the Toronto snow barefoot, uphill both ways, and WE
LIKED IT!

&gt; a fact that there are many readers who gag when we get all these purile and
&gt; unecessary 'lyrical interpretation' pieces and only stay because occasionally

In my day.....we didn't have cute little words like purile and lyrical, we
had one Rush song, Working Man, and you listened to it over and over and
the only thing you discussed was why there was nothing going on here, and
WE LIKED IT!

&gt; there are interesting and useful bits of information that aren't just teenage
&gt; hero worship. I really like Rush, probably more than most people who read the
&gt; digest. However, they are not gods, Neil is not the last word on the problems
&gt; of the world etc. I get the feeling that this digest is doing a great job
&gt; of trying to put artificial meat on the bones of an interesting but limited
&gt; concept. Sure, why not give out scarce info on release dates, tour dates,

In my day.....we didn't have artificial meat, we didn't have meat at all,
we just had bones, and we didn't roll them, we gnawed them until our
teeth fell out.  And if we wanted an interesting but limited concept we just
puked the whole mess up and ate it again,  AND WE LIKED IT!

&gt; concert tracks listings etc. but all this 'well I think The Trees means this'
&gt; rubbish is gratuitous and very often infuriating (not just to me ---I know of
&gt; a considerable number of subscribers who only stay for the useful stuff). Just

In my day.....when someone used phrases like "rubbish is gratuitous and very
often" we just turned Rush up louder because it sounded like a "considerable
number" of our parents.  We didn't have "useful stuff" like weed, we smoked
orange peels and coffee grinds,  and WE LIKED IT!

&gt; keep all that crap to mail. Nobody really wants to hear a neo-romantic
&gt; interpretation of 2112 etc.

In my day....we only had one philosopher, Ayn Rand, and we grabbed any
neo-collectivist who called objectivists neo-romantics.  We opened their
mouth to try to see where all the drivel came from and found out
we were looking in the wrong orifice.  But we listened anyway because
we were sub-juvenile Rush fans, and WE LIKED IT!

Scott R. -is- a nice chap, confirming Phil D. Croix's impression from
that interview.  Ultimately, by providing backstage passes to a friend
of mine during their last tour (they met at a simple record-store
signing session), Scott opened MANY doors to us.

There isn't a "megaforce of lasers," nor will you see bunnies dance
during "Tom Sawyer" (!), but if you like expert musicianship, top-
notch singing, and a truly phenomenal video/concert interplay, go see
Queensryche on their current tour.  I saw the show two days ago and
even with high expectations, I was still QUITE impressed.  The video
sequencing was stunning -- flawless timing, better even than (gasp)
Rush's during the PRESTO tour.  There are a number of familiar firms
and names among the tour crew too (See Factor, et al.)

Subject: Bootleg questions

G'day and happy 4th of July fellow Rushians!
  I just recieved access to some Rush bootlegs for a pretty good price. Most
bootlegs run for over $30, but I found a place where I can pick them up for
under $20. Last month I picked up these three:

    1. Rushian Roulette (Holland 1979)
    2. Temple of Syrinx (digitally improved version of the GUP vidio)
    3. Red Stars of the Solar Federation (an identical version of the 
       Exit...Stage Left video, static included, on CD, with the voic of 
       Neil on a couple tracks discussing the meanings of certain songs. 
       Not to rain on somebody's little rip-off crusade,
       it's not worth anything over $30 bucks, considering I've seen it in
       the import sections of many record stores around Cleveland for $22. 
       I'd say it's the most common of Rush boots. Hell, it's not even a true
       bootleg!)

  All of these are available on CD.

  Anyway, I was just wondering if anybody owned one of these three:

    1. Fly in the Night (US tour,1980 or 77, i can't remember)
    2. Currently En Vogue (US 1978 tour)
    3. Live Under Pressure (Pittsburgh 1984)

   I'll recieve these three in about 9 weeks. I was wondering if anyone else
had them, how they sounded, what material was on them, etc...
   Please E-mail me if you have any info on these three, or any questions on
the ones I already have.

Subject: balls found

Hi Everyone,

Since yesterday's posting I have found the quote from _The Fountainhead_
containing the missing three balls. The following quotation is from Ch. X
(p.321 in the Macmillan 1986 hardcover printing) -- it is Kent Lansing
speaking:

``And what incidentally, do you think integrity is? The ability not to
pick a watch out of your neighbor's pocket? No, it's not as easy as
that. If that were all, I'd say ninety-five percent of humanity were
honest, upright men. Only, as you can see, they aren't. Integrity is
the ability to stand by an idea. That presupposes the ability to think.
Thinking is something one doesn't borrow or pawn. And yet, if I were
asked to choose a symbol for humanity as we know it, I wouldn't choose
a cross nor an eagle nor a lion and unicorn. I'd choose three gilded
balls.''

So it seems Paul was closest to the mark in his recollection. In this
quotation the three guilded balls aren't a metaphor for ``individuality,
independence, and egoism,'' but rather a symbol of _``humanity as we
know it''_, which is not Objectivist perfect but rather the contrary.
In fact the following lines from ``Second Nature'' seem the album's
closest connection with the three gilded balls:

``Folks are basically decent/ Conventional wisdom would say
  But we read about the exceptions/ In the papers every day''

Now I don't mean to suggest that Rush are holding this as an ideal for
human nature. I merely offer that the allusion, if intentional, suggests
that the album is delving into various aspects of human nature _as it
is_ rather than being a monument to Objectivism.

Subject: "The Pass"

just finished reading the (very nice) FAQL and the bit about "The Pass"
intrigued me a little...it was the first time i had heard Neil's
explanation, but i was wondering why he didn't mention the line,
"Christ, what have you done?" in his explanation...(maybe he did
somewhere else in the interview, i don't know)...well, i have heard
(read) several interpretations of this line in the NMS and elsewhere,
and some people think it has a deep historical/philosophical meaning,
and others think it's just "strong language"...

and then there's my opinion...i think it's both; i could see how
using the example of any historical figure willingly dying as
support for the song's theme, which is, if i understand Neil's
explanation, choosing to die a "noble" death is far worse than
choosing to live.  Then again, it's easy to see how anyone close
to someone who has committed suicide could cry out "Christ, what have
you done?"  But the line "Someone set a bad example" could directly
point to Christ, since he is "named" in the song, but could very
well point to anyone who has committed suicide...anyway, i think
my rambling calls for some more thoughts and opinions of more
insightful readers than myself...does anyone know of an interview
where Neil refers to this line specifically?  Please understand that
I would rather not start a religous debate or anything...just another
"song dissection"...(Rush fans have a religious debate? Scary...)

Just a quick question.  Is it still possible to get those SPARC audio
files that were at NIST for a while?  If so, from where?

[ If you do have them or can get to them, drop a line to me at the
  administrative address, please.                             :rush-mgr ]

Hope everyone had a great Fourth of July, also, Happy Belated Canada Day.

speaking of Canada, Just listened to Kim Mitchell's "Go for Soda" on
WDVE in Pgh.  I get chills listening to that song, one reason because they
play it every now and then here in PGH.  Of course, that's the only song
of Kim they play down here.  It's a crying shame. Anyway, I came here to
write about the FAQL.

Eric, Geddy's birthday is JULY 29, not last Saturday (We forgive you, at least
I do anyway :-) ).  FYI, Alex's birthday is Aug 27 and Neil's Sept 12.
Rush's address is in the FAQL, so if anyone is interested in sending cards
to the boyz, knock your self out.

August 3 is perfect night for a Rush Party in Pittsburgh.  I am think about
getting a party together in Toronto for the middle of August.  I would love
to meet some of the Canadian Rush/Max Webster/Kim Mitchell fans as well as
some of the Buffalo fans.  People from outside the area are invited to come
up.  Will let you know as soon a details are available.

Subject: PERMANENT WAVES TEST PRESSING

Hi,

A friend of mine is selling off his record collection, and one of
the things he's got for sale is an ORIGINAL "Permanent Waves" Test
Pressing. It's in absolutely mint condition, serial number 4001 from
P.R.C. Mastering Studio in Cambridge I think.

At any rate, it's an unbelievably rare item that should belong in the
home of a REAL rush fan and not some idiot "rare record dealer" that
will mark it up to 400$. So if you would like to make an offer for it,
please send email to me (MCS@CARLETON.CA) and I'll be sure to forward
your offer to him.

This is once in a lifetime folks. Take advantage of it.

Till later...

Subject: Three Gilded Balls
Date: Sat, 6 Jul 91 12:27:40 EDT

The elusive quote concerning the gilded balls occurs in Part II,
Chapter 10 (pg 314 of the Signet paperback edition) of _The
Fountainhead_.  The "contextless" quote:

------
[Ken Lansing speaking to Howard Roark]

"'...Integrity is the ability to stand by an idea.  That presupposes
an ability to think.  Thinking is something one doesn't borrow or
pawn.  And yet, if I were asked to choose a symbol for humanity as we
know it, I wouldn't choose a cross nor an eagle nor a lion and
unicorn.  I'd choose three gilded balls.'"
------

I say "contextless" because this quote is only a small part of a larger
discussion, one worth reading (but not typing by me!) to get the full
meaning.

Subject: record label change

why, after many successful years with Mercury-Polygram records did Rush change
to Atlantic records? Where they dropped by Mercury-Polygram (not likely) or
did Atlantic just offer them a better deal? I'm suprised that M-P would let
a band that has been as successful as Rush move to another label.

Subject: Radio Show, Alex and Geddy nerds? and Computer Music

From: "Chris Webster" &lt;cwebster@rodan.acs.syr.edu&gt;

One of the local radio stations, 95X, is presently playing a holiday
program called the Spirit of Rush.  They've said it's a satelite show,
but I doubt that it's being done nationwide as I type this.  I'm just
wondering if this particular show has been done before.  In case it's
not in the archives, I'm taping it, but I've already lost some of the
announcers' parts because they cut ends of songs short.

Also, it's the first time I've heard Alex and Geddys' voices.  (Neil
hasn't spoken yet. :[  )   When hearing their voices for the first time,
did anyone else think they sounded like the classic nerd stereotype?
(Boy, am I glad I witnessed them in concert before hearing this....)

Also, in case anyone's into PC music, I've come across two .rol format
songs by rush.  One's the Spirit of Radio, and I'm not quite sure what
the other is.  Neither one is the band itself playing, but instead is
an imitator playing a single keyboard.

I have an Soundblaster card for my PC, and I've gotten the software
to play this particular format on it from an ftp site.  If anyone wants
more info, email me.

Subject: Didacts and Narpets, and COS album

Ok, just a few questions about COS an Didacts and Narpets:

1) Concerning the title, someone awhile back said that didacts were
   teachers and narpet is an anagram for N. Peart. Aren't didacts also
   addicts (another anagram). Just an observation.

2) I just picked up a copy of COS on record and it has all the lyrics
   on the inside cover (the album opens up). Considering that no one
   seems to know the correct lyrics to Didacts and Narpets and this
   album has them on the inside, is this album something of value?
   Just curious.

3) The lyrics (or lyric) to Didacts and Narpets, by the way is "Listen..."
   Please excuse me if this has alredy been said, but last I checked
   this was still up in the air.

                                            Later all.

Subject: U KNOW U'R A RUSH FAN.../NEW ALBUM UPDATE!

Hello to all those out in RUSHLAND.
You know you're a RUSH FAN when..... You ask your parents to buy you
a Hemispheres gold record award as one of your Grad. gifts.

Now onto a topic you've all been waiting for.:

News on ROLL THE BONES!

The album is all finished. It contains 10 tracks, one of which will be
an instrumental. The release date (which still has to be confirmed) is
set for Sept. 3, 1991. The tour will probably start around the first
week of November. They are booking dates around the Northeast U.S.

Howard Ungerleighter, the production manager will be designing the
light show but will not be touring with the band this tour. He is
currently on the road with Queensryche and that tour will last until
at least Jan. And afterwards will be touring with Tesla.

The cover of the album: (drum roll please):

A kid kicking a skull down the road.
(this again is a rumour and still has to be confirmed).

So far I have 3 song titles from the upcomming album. They are:

1. Roll The Bones (title track)
2. Dreamline (which should be the first single)
3. Where's my thing? Part IV. The gangster of boats trilogy. (this
   should be the new long awaited for INSTRUMENTAL). WHAT A TITLE EH?
maybe another one of Alex's Dreams?

thats it for now, I should have the other 7 titles by the end of the
week, will definitely keep all of you informed. Have fun waiting for
the new album. :)

Subject: Bootlegs
Date: Mon, 08 Jul 91 12:23:33 N
From: Gordon MacKinney &lt;gordon@hpbblb.bbn.hp.com&gt;

I've noticed a number of references to bootleg albums recently,
as well as an occasional boot auction over the net.

Everyone should make their own decision regarding the right or
wrong of bootlegs, but in the interest of making informed
decisions, people should be aware that bootleg recordings take
money from the artists who earn it.  One might argue that only
the record companies suffer, but everything trickles down, either
to the normal consumer who compensates for pirated material or to
the artist who never sees bootleg revenue.  A recent Time
magazine article cited Frank Zappa's frustration at 400 different
Zappa bootlegs that are on the market.

It's ironic to see some contributors to TNMS promoting
bootlegging while at the same time supporting the band with their
postings.

hey, for any of you interested, I was watching Back To School w/Rodney
Dangerfield and in the scene where his interogated by his teachers,
the english teacher has him recite none other than "Do Not Go Gently
Into That Good Night".  I was almost asleep at the time, but as soon
as I recognized I sat up in my chair with a big F***ing smile on my
face.

Amazing the things that can get your attention.

Subject: Rush quotes - fortunes with sound

Here's a nifty toy that I was diddling around with last Wed. afternoon
(waiting for July 4th 4-day weekend). I forget who I got it from, but
I took that Rush quote fortune script and mutated it into something
that can either cat the quote (lyrics) or play the appropriate sparc
sound file, or do both. I've got the text/quote/lyric part running
okay, and all I need to do now is get ahold of the particular sound
bites to go with the words. That's the neat part about this - you
can add the audio piece by piece as you get it. (Anybody got a
recording of Geddy singing "Catch the fish" ??? ;-)
Anywho, if you want it, or want more info, lemme know!
