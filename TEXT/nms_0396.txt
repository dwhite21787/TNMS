Being of unsound mind and body, I'm going to post this ridiculous question
(against my better judgment) in hopes of a small miracle.  Does anyone in the
So. Cal. area have a couple (2) extra (gulp!) tix for either the 1/22 or 1/23
GW Forum shows or know of a good potential source for same?  If so, PLEASE
e-mail me with details (day/seat numbers/etc.) and semi-reasonable $ terms.

The misuc heard during the credits at the end of the Grace Under Pressure
Tour video is the song "Afterimage" off the album Grace Under Pressure.
Certain parts of the song have been looped so that it would play the same
parts for a few minutes while the credits are rolling. No, it is nothing
rare or special to have, it is not a jam session.

Oh how I wish they (Rush) would play the Raggae Version of Working Man on
this tour or any future ones. Of course, I also wish they would play
songs such as Kid Gloves, Hand Over Fist, Tai Shan, and The Necromancer,
but I'm dreaming. Neil Would be proud though.....

About the Shortened version of the Big Money video-- anybody else find it
terribly annoying how it throws you off by it's butchery?

&gt; Anyways, it was only about 8 minutes long, but there were a few interesting
&gt; tidbits.  Surprise!  The mystery rapper is STILL a mystery, although the DJ
&gt; doing the interview said that he had heard a rumour that none other than
&gt; Frank Zappa did the rap!  Geddy's *still* not telling, though.

By now, you've probably heard Neil tell the whole world on Rockline
that Geddy is indeed the guy that does the rap... Of course, I'm 7
digests behind, so it's probably already been written about...

&gt; NOT Eric Johnson though (mega :-( ).  I was looking forward to seeing him
&gt; *almost* as much as I was to Rush!

Me too... I was disappointed that they replaced him with Vinnie Moore,
here on the East Coast...

Only 5 more days till I see the boyz though, so I'll see if it was
worth replacing Johnson...

Brian Graves writes:
&gt;This morning I was surprised and overjoyed to hear RTB come rolling out my
&gt;speakers from the radio.  They almost never play Rush in the frozen northland
&gt;of Duluth, MN.  Anyway, as I sat enjoying the music I noticed the strangest
&gt;thing...  they cut out the rap section of the song... completely!  They
&gt;just skipped to the end of the song.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone ever heard of this happening?  I'm tempted to call them up
&gt;and ask them why the hell they did it.

What kind of radio station were you listening too?  I noticed that any
kind of pop station will cut down long songs to fall within the 3:00 to
3:30 minute time limit just so that they can play more songs in a given
time period.  I forget how long RTB is, but with the rap in, it's
definitely a little too long for your top-40 station.  Listen to Casey
Kasem's Top 40 countdown some day and you'll hear lots of that cut-down-
to-size stuff.  I guess they think that the rap section is uninteresting
or slow or whatever.  I have found that AOL stations will play the whole
thing, so that's why I listen to them more!

Scott
P.S. Please add my vote to the "I would like a Rockline transcription"
     bandwagon.  Did anyone in Philly catch it; if so what station???

Hello fellow Rush fans.  I have a few Rush records that I would be willing to
part with for a modest sum.  I'm sure that there are a few rabid collectors out
there who might be interested.

First, a Japanese import copy of Hemispheres.  This is in MINT condition- has
never seen a turntable; the corners of the jacket are still nice and pointy.
There is also a copy of the lyrics to the entire album--in japanese--enclosed
inside.

Second, an import copy of "Rush Through Time".  This is also in mint conditon.

Third, a "promotional copy only-not for sale" copy of 2112.  This is stamped
onto the record jacket and also is written on the record label itself.  The
record is in great condition and the jacket is pretty good.

Fourth, a Canadian picture disc copy of Hemispheres.  This is in good shape;
no scratches or anything.  It has the cover art on both sides of the disc.

Fifth, a bootleg two-disc set of Rush from 1974.  This is before the release
of FBN and features the band playing the title track on stage for the very
first time ever.  The sound quality is amazing, better than most bootlegs
I've heard, and this one is what, almost eighteen years old?

Lastly, a three-disc bootleg set from a Chicago date on the MP tour.  These
discs are pressed on swirled, multi-colored, transparent vinyl and still
sound good.

Please e-mail me at "slider@athena.mit.edu" if you would like to discuss the
sale of any of these discs.

Take it easy.

Terry Brown has recently produced the latest from Voivod (which was
rumored to be produced by Geddy), and has also produced _Parallels_
from the band, Fates Warning. This CD is not bad, but sounds so much
like Queensryche, it isn't funny. The singer sounds like Geoff Tate
and the sound is what you would expect from Terry Brown. I don't
know who recorded or engineered it, but it may be Paul Northfield,
who has worked with Queensryche before (I think he engineered some
stuff for Rush in the past). In any case, the guitars aren't bad,
though they follow the trend of the "I can play faster" mode a little
too much. Nevertheless, there are some melodic moments that remind
me of Queensryche (the newer stuff), so if you like that, you'll like
Fates Warning.

I just got off the phone with the Oakland Coliseum ticket office. The woman I
talked to said tickets go on sale for the Jan 29th show on Dec 15th. I asked
her about a Jan 30th show, and she said she didn't know about one. But, that I
should call back tomorrow, because she just overheard this information from
her boss, and the official announcement hasn't been made yet. So, I'll call

Subject: Freewill

Although the American LP release may say "If you still choose not to decide,
you haven't made a choice", it is wrong as stated in NMS 394.  I do not know
why they printed that, but I have several transcriptions of Freewill as sheet
music, all printed by American publishers, and they all have the correct
lyrics.  Strange.

Also, since we now know Geddy is the rapper, who did the "that's nice" at
the end of Chain Lightning?

To whoever (sorry) said Neil handled himself well on Rockline, I agree.  He
was really interesting to listen to and also sounded rather friendly, even
to some of the "less-intelligent" questions he was asked.

Subject: SPOILERS - Largo, MD show (12/4)

From: David Arnold &lt;davida&gt;

Hey, NMS'ers!

Thanks for all the offers for a copy of the Neil Rockline interview.
I have arranged to get a copy, so no more people need send mail.  Thanks
for the great response!!

This post contains concert SPOILERS - continue at your own risk.


I saw Rush last night at the Capital Centre in Largo, MD, and thought I'd
drop a line to let you folks know what's new.  It was interesting seeing
them twice back-to-back in two different cities (Philly/Largo).  They were
basically the same show, for the most part (read on).

On Tues in Philly Alex had a bit of guitar problem near the end of the main
set.  Neil also had drum hassles, with a tech working on his drum set during
the early part of the show.  During the encore a fan jumped up on stage and
was quickly ushered off by a roadie.

At Largo, Alex had guitar problems early on, but got them resolved within
the first two songs.  During "The Pass" Geddy broke a string (!) and had
to switch during the song.  They seemed to be in a pretty good mood (more
on this observation later), and Neil even stood up during "Finding My Way"
and waved his arms around!

The main difference between Philly and Largo was that they played "Ghost Of
A Chance" in Largo!  They added it to the set; they didn't swap it for any
other song.

I was quite impressed with the encore.  I was amused both nights that the
young fans around me got really quiet during "Xanadu" and the entire encore,
while I was going nuts and singing all the words.  When was the last time
you heard "Finding My Way" or "Anthem" live??  Pretty @#$%^& cool if you ask
me, especially after Neil's saying that pre-1981 songs don't hold meaning
for him anymore.  I figured they'd play progressively "younger" sets, leaving
off more and more old songs as they went.  Not so, apparently.

It will be interesting to see them in Baltimore, MD in 3-4 months and compare
the sets they play.

A few days ago, someone mentioned look-alikes of Geddy (& Alex?) & asked
if anyone knew of any others... Well, IMHO, I think John Sessions from the
British comedy show "Whose Line is it Anyway?" is a Neil Peart clone with
an English accent! The show is on the Comedy Channel (or whatever its name
is now) on cable weekdays at 8:30pm (MST) &lt;I guess that's 10:30 for you
easterners&gt;. Sessions was a regular on the show for 2 seasons (I think) &
I'm pretty sure those are the ones showing now.

Subject: Gary Cooper? / DC show - not a spoiler

I can't find it now, but I believe someone mentioned that the tune "Cinderella
Man" is based on/patterned after a movie called "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", and
that same person noted that Gary Cooper played Mr. Deeds. If that's true,
I think it's interesting that Cooper also played Roark in the flick "The
Fountainhead". Is NP a GC fan? Will there be a "High Noon" or "Friendly
Persuasion" song coming out sometime?  :)

on to (another, but quick) show revue...
Having been totally unable to make a Rush show since the Signals tour, I
don't know if or what they reused from the GUP/.../P tours (and I don't
want to). I have to say that Rush put on the best show I've ever seen.
The Who, Yes, Floyd, Bowie take back seats to this. From the viewpoint
that it's been 8 years since I last caught them, the show was pretty much
all "new" material to me, and I gotta say - ignore any bad reports and
go see Rush. (To quote the goddess of lumpy shoes - "Just Do It")

P.S. I'm slightly more impressed by "professional" wrestling than by
     Vinnie Moore. Christ, remember when lineups like Jeff. Airplane
     opening for the Dead who opened for Hendrix?
      At least I can't argue about VM's lyrics (none)

Subject: Wall of dice

NMS,

I posted a couple of weeks ago a question concerning the wall of dice.
Unfortunately, no one replied with an answer. So therefore I will ask one
more time.
    If you look at the wall of dice on either the album cover
or the tour poster, you will notice that the numbers are all 3's
until you get about 2/3 the way down. From that point on the numbers on the
dice begin to change. Knowing RUSH, there has to be some reason behind
that. They would all of a sudden just decide to change numbers.
    So my question is why do the numbers start to change? There has
to be some sort of message within the wall. It can't be just a random
order.
    If anyone knows the answer out there in RUSH land, then please mail
me and tell me what you think the wall means.

                                       Thanks for your time,

                                        Paul Williamson, Univ. of Tulsa

(& only) brother, who wants to know if anyone can help him get a copy of the
EXIT STAGE LEFT video?  He says he's looked all over (the Detroit metro area)
and has not any luck...

Anyone who has any information leading to the capture and arrest of such a
copy/original PLEASE let me know (STOY@LILLY.COM).

Incidentally, he doesn't know I'm advertising this part, BUT...his rock trio
is looking for a singer, and a lot of their repertoire is RUSH-based.  They
have their own homegrown studio and are pretty professional musicians for
amateurs.  Right now they are just getting together for fun but they put in
enough hours that the only thing that's holding them back from doing any kind
of a playing circuit is the lack of a singer.  If you're at all interested in
getting together with the band (and are in the Detroit/Ann Arbor/Windsor area,
anything farther is too long of a hike) please pass your name along to me at
the above address, and I'll let him know!

THANKS for your help, hope you all still studying will rock on your finals...

see ya

Subject: Ghost...Chance, Next Single

Hi all.
Our local radio station just played Ghost of a Chance-very strange as they
rarely played Dreamline.  I was wondering if GoaC is the new single.  If so,
any predictions on how it will do?  It's my favorite track on RTB, I think
it will fair well.
Later,
Matt J.

Subject: Rush/Primus tix for Fresno, CA on sale as we speak

Hi,

Just completed my weekly BASS call to find out when tickets
will be on sale for the Bay Area.  They, of course, didn't know,
but imagine my surprise to find out that they've been on sale
for Fresno (Felland arena) since 10:00 this morning.  Just wanted
to let folks know in case you haven't heard.
