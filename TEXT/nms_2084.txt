Welp, here's the complete listing of the live album, in order (you might've
seen this on other web pages, I haven't been back long enough to update
mine yet, so it still lists old information):

Disc #1

     2001/Dreamline / Limelight / Driven / Animate / The Trees / 
     Closer To The Heart / Bravado / Nobody's Hero / 2112

Disc #2

     Test For Echo / Freewill / Roll The Bones / Stick It Out / Resist / 
     Drum Solo / Natural Science / Leave That Thing Alone / 
     The Spirit of Radio / Tom Sawyer / YYZ

Disc #3 (Feb 1978)

     Bastille Day / Bytor & The Snow Dog / Xanadu / A Farewell To Kings / 
     Something For Nothing / Cygnus X-1 / Anthem / Working Man / Fly By Night /
     In The Mood / Cinderella Man

Unfortunately, it looks like the more "interesting" tracks (Cold Fire, 
The Analog Kid) didn't make the cut. But, we get another great rendition
of "Tom Sawyer"! *sigh*

I've also heard that a box set might be in the works, with the tracks that
didn't make the live album (Vital Signs, Ghost Of A Chance, Half The World,
The Pass, The Analog Kid, Double Agent, Show Don't Tell)

Hey gang...Long time no talk...but I had to respond to this...:

<<<<<From: "Keith Hurst" <keithh@psychology.leeds.ac.uk>
Hello everyone out there -
The email above got me thinking about Signals [again].  I too have 
been very influenced by this music, having got it in 1983 as a 15yr 
old.  Many of the themes it touches on seemed so poignant to growing 
up, and still do.  So, a couple of questions if I may?  [1] Am I 
right in thinking that Signals is regarded by many as a weak album?  
[2] When people have criticised it in the past, has this related only 
to the production, as I think some of the composition and playing is 
second to none? [3] Should I buy the re-mastered Cd, as I thought the 
normal Cd sounded great.  Ok, that's a wrap.>>>>>>

A lot of people felt a little uneasy about Signals, as it "devieated from
the Norm" reagarding Rush's musical style, but I, like Keith, found heavy
influence by it. It was my first Rush album, after not being able to find
Moving Pictures in the local music stores for some reason.. I played my
Signals tape until it wore out. For a long time, it was the only thing I
played, until I got Perm Waves and GUP. When I listen to Signals now, I'm
taken back to my childhood days of long hair, concert t-shirts, Rush vs.
Saxon fights with a couple of friends of mine, Dungeons and Dragons, and
smooching with my girlfriend while listening to Rush in my car. It's a total
nostalgia trip for those of us who were in that 8th grade to HS senior part
of our lives. Even though it's not my favorite Rush album, it's certainly
one of the most meaningful.... It also reminds me about how awful most of
the music that came out at the same time was....
Cheers from New Mexico..

Im sure others might be interested in this data.

Wow... I was really surprised at reading that.  A few years ago, in
Rolling Stone magazine, one of the members of the Beastie Boys listed Rush
as one of the reasons why white people were "wack." 
	I suppose Mix Master Mike has his own idea of "wack."

Cool to hear that Mixmaster Mike of the almighty Invisibl Skratch Piklz
gave the boys a nod of his own at a Beasties show.  However, this seems to
be entirely Mike's call, since I remember them quoting in Spin something
to the effect of, "How can white people be into stuff that's so wack, like
Rush?"  I saw that and I just said, "Excuse me, you're white, pal."  Maybe
it took Mike's touch (and a little bit of knowledge from their friend Biz
Markie) to convice them that it's not all that bad.  Who knows?

Greetings fellow Rush freaks,

     I am so completely amped about the forthcoming live release, the
very aptly titled "Different Stages", that when I first crank the
opener "2001/Dreamline"  I'm afraid that I might spontaneously
combust.  "Natural Science", "2112", "Analog Kid", "Limelight"...am I
imagining things?  This sounds downright too good to be true.  And I'm
quite certain that it will be.  Peace out.

	When it came out I thought it was the weakest thing they had
produced to date. In some ways it was, but I changed my mind later when I 
listened more closely and had some perspective from the later albums.

	It comes up often in interviews that the band was dissatisfied
with the way it was produced, especially Alex Lifeson who felt the guitars
took too much of a back seat in the mix to the wash of keyboards. The
move toward keyboards as the basis for compositions (characteristic of
80's Rush) and the production of Signals was probably what motivated the
change of regular producers. Terry Brown was an ideal producer for the
70's stuff because meat-and-potatoes hard rock was the big thing, but I
don't think he was prepared to handle 80's music at the time. For me,
Peter Collins was by far the best producer for subsequent Rush and their
choice to switch producers was a very good move.

	IMHO, the use of keyboards is what tainted Signals for me and a
lot of people at first. First, I don't think Geddy Lee has ever
been much of a keyboard player, and he was just experimenting with
keyboard based compositions at the time. Secondly, sequencers weren't too
sophisticated at the time, and since the band's philosophy has always been
to produce music that can be faithfully reproduced live, Geddy Lee often
put away his bass in order to play keyboards. The loss of bass
fundamentally changes the feel of the music. With Alex Lifeson's switch
from his more traditional lead guitar approach to the 80's U2/Simple Minds
"atmospheric" approach, the sound of the band was transformed to
something a lot of people weren't used to or prepared for, especially
following MP, which was a "classic" hard rock album.

> [3] Should I buy the re-mastered Cd, as I thought the 
> normal Cd sounded great.  Ok, that's a wrap.

	I like it, though I changed directly from LP to the Remastered CD
and I have never heard the first CD version. Signals was a real "drummy"
album in the way it was recorded and I think the remastered CD brings out
sounds in the drums that I had never heard on the LP.

I've set up a web page dedicated to the Rush-related comic books.  This

Subject: Different tracks on "live video"?

Greetings fellow Rush freaks,

     All of this live album anticipation and hype has led me to an
interesting query.  
     Many times, for continuity's sake, a video concert will be one
continuous show rather than splices of performances pulled from
different shows and tours.  Now, since "Different Stages" is
supposedly taken from both the CP and T4E tours, shouldn't the
accompanying video be from solely ONE of these tours? (Preferably
T4E!)  My point is that this would leave them no choice but to include
songs NOT on the cd.  Food for thought.  P.S.For a matter of reference
check out Pink Floyd's "Pulse" live cd and video.  The song "Take it
Back" was NOT on the cd.

Hey mgr., does this mean the new LP is coming as two packages, one as a
limited edition the other as a standard 2 disc set?  Did I miss anything?

   [ That's unclear, but from what I've heard of the packaging, I believe
     all three discs will come in a single, large double-cd case. I don't 
     know if they're planning on releasing it on vinyl, or what they'll do
     with the tape...                                          : rush-mgr ]

Subject: various Rush covers

Can anyone help me with these questions?:

1. I've heard that The Tragically Hip covered a Rush song (Limelight?).  In
fact, I think I may have seen about 5 seconds of a video of it during a
Canadian awards show.  Is this recorded/available anywhere on official, or
not-so-official CDs or videos?

2. Same question about the band Pavement.  Covered SoR?

3. Can anyone post the live album track listing in order and by CD?  That
hasn't been clear to me so far.  I was hoping it would be arranged like the
TFE tour shows (2112 at the end of CD1 perhaps?).

Btw, I ordered the Rachel Barton violin CD.  Her website lists the SoR cover
as "Spirit of *THE* Radio".  Kinda funny.

Thanks for any answers.

I hope he sticks with the music and RUSH, I could understand how the 2

Another thing I want to talk about is the Fender Geddy Lee Jazz Bass,
BADASS!!!! I have been hounding all the stores cuz I want to see it, but
they dont have it yet =(   I have been looking for an old Jazz bass like
geddy uses, but now that there is a signature model, THATS what I want
instead, and I have been waiting months for it it allready!  cudos to
fender for coming out with a Geddy bass.

I still wonder when the live album comes out, and I  feel stupid if it is
allready out, cuz I wanted to get it on the first day, but have too busy
recording to do much of anything, or keep posted (studio life is kind of
hermit like you know)

Hey everybody!

Awesome job on the web page, rush mgr! and thanks for the tip on that 
southland music store! I got that coveted red 'Red Sector A' vinyl and 
the Tom Sawyer remix thing from 'small soldiers'...
	it's interesting... I kinda like the effect the mixer put on Ged's 	
voice, but...

I saw that Waterboy trailer last weekend...seems really weird to hear 
Rush in a movie theater... I don't like to see Rush's music adulterated. 
It just seems so wrong for it to be used by Hollywood. oh well, maybe 
we'll get a few more Rush fans into the fold this way.

I bought a Barenaked Ladies CD this weekend...anybody else like this 
band? That new song was so catchy, and then I heard some other song of 
theirs about Yoko Ono and it was hilarious, so I had to check this band 
out. I love it, the CD is great!! Highly recommended.

So the local radio station was doing a 'cheesy music' survey a couple 
weeks ago to find out what kind of crap people had hidden away in their 
collection, and it reminded me of a game my laboratory used to play-- we 
had a week where everyone brought in the CD they were most embarrased to 
own. it was pretty hilarious. so how about it, TNMSers?
Anybody got a Neil Diamond or Hanson CD? ;) 

Besides all my 80's pop (hey, I'm a child of the eighties, I grew up 
listening to that stuff), I'd say the most embarassing CD I have is the 
"Macarena" single. :)

Hasta

that they have every Rush video on the cd-rom. That would be so totally
awesome. Rush is more popular than ever!!!!!!!

Subject: Tribute album

I just picked up the Rush tribute album. Here is the break down (IMO):

1.Working Man- Believe it or not, I have never heard the Rush version 
yet. But It didn't sound like the musicians were killing themselves over 
playing. It sounded pretty good.

2.By-tor and the Snowdog- Give me a break. What turns me off alot about 
this cover is Mike Portnoys blantant showing off. Over all, this one is 
decent at best.

3.Analog Kid- Again, never heard the original, but but this cover makes 
me want to.

4.The Trees- This one was a good cover, I think it stayed pretty true to 
the original.

5.La Ville Strangiato- Ech. Talk about overplaying!!! I hate the way 
these Musicians think they have to throw in so many extra notes and 
beats. For that reason, this one was ruined for me. Plus, the bass drum 
was way to loud.

6.Mission- haven't listened to it yet.

7.Anthem- This one was done very good. I like how they give it a heavier 
edge, while maintaining the same feel as the original.

8.Jacobs Ladder- A little bit of overplaying, but overall a good cover.

9.Closer to the Heart- Very good, and very true to the orginal.

10.Natural Science- Of all of the songs on here, this is the only one I 
would stack up against the original. This one is louder, but not 
heavier, and the singer makes it into a very emotional song. I love it.

11.YYZ-Pretty good. Kick ass bass player!

12.Red Barchetta-Very good cover. 

13.Freewill-They did this one very good. It sounds alot like the 
original, but with a little bit of creativeness.

I recommend this, because overall, it is pretty good.

Howdy,

Man (and woman), the bickering never ends. Does anyone else read this
mailing and hear "The Trees" ironically playing through their heads? I
have to laugh  at a lot of this stuff: "Dream Theater rules vs Dream
Theater sucks", "How dare you grieve/not grieve for Neil's misfortunes",
and, the ever popular, "I'm a true Rush fan and you're nothing but a
cheesy little poseur. Shave and go home, wimp!" Fortunately I have a
pretty twisted sense of humor and this stuff cracks me up, unless I'm
having a real crappy day.
I bow in homage to those sage souls who recommend the use of the Sacred
Page Down Key, but the screeds of volatile people who can't or won't
heed this wisdom are almost too funny for words. The best part is, my
modem is "bearing a gift beyond price, almost free." (heh heh)

Like most of you, I'm drooling in anticipation of the new live album.
Had tickets to the last tour, but work conflicted and I couldn't go.
Didn't see Counterparts either, so the track list so far looks like a
beauty!

Thanks for the bandwidth. Now I think I'll go butcher some innocent Rush
songs with my atrocious guitar playing.

Hello,

Well, it looks like the setlist is getting pretty set. I really like the 
picks.... especially if The Pass and Vital Signs are included.
I kinda figured we'd see a full version of 2112 too ;-))
Bravado live rocks as well. 

I wonder why AFTK was picked instead of Hem. for the 3rd CD???
It wud have been that much better to have all of Cygnus... but this will
be cool enuf, I'm sure.

CD-ROM too? All right!!!! That'll rock. 
My thoughts... If Rush does decide to call it quits after this 
release...
they will go out on a high note, at least. 
I tend to think we'll see another studio album... but I'm not holding my
breath for another tour after what's happened tho'  
Later,

Any of you Saga fans may be interested in a CD I picked up thru
Amazon.com.  It is a double live cd called Detours.  The track listing is
as follows:

In The Hall Of The Mountain King
How Long
The Perfectionist
Careful Where You Step
Ice Nice
Don't Be Late
Interview
Wind Him Up
Welcome To The Zoo
Take A Chance
William's Walkabout
The Cross
Scratching The Surface
On The Loose
The Security of Illusion
I Walk With You
Time's Up
Heaven Can Wait
The Flyer
You're Not Alone
Framed
Humble Stance

In addition in has multimedia videos of "Pitchman" and "The Intermission"

It is a pretty good album as most of the songs are pre-1985.  The only
songs that don't work are a couple of the newer ones and a couple in the
unplugged section (why do bands keep insist on doing this silliness?). 
Perhaps the best thing is that it was only around 17 bucks (including
S&H).  Pretty darn skippy for a double-length import.  A definite
must-own for Saga fans.

<<This could be a new thread; Geddy messing up the lyrics.>>

I know this is *completely* off that subject (more or less), but it got
me to thinkin'...how many variations (and what are they) are there of
Alex singing the chorus of CTTH?  I know we talked about it a little, but
the thread sort of died after a couple of posts...I don't know about
anyone else here, but I've never been fortunate enough to see a Rush show
(I actually broke my arm the day of the T4E show here in Indiana...I
probably still would've gone, though, despite the pain, but they had me
so drugged at the hospital that I never would've made it...but I was
feelin' *pretty* good...  :) ), so I've never heard Alex singing any
variations, and I'd like to know what all he's done with (to?) the
song...

Subject: Rush sighting!!!!

I was spendin' the night at a friend's house a couple days ago, and it
was about 2:30am...we'd just finished watching, "This Is Spinal Tap", and
laughing our asses off at it, even though we've seen it at least 100
times.  So, you know, it was late, we were tired...we did what any two
normal, American guys would do when it's late and you're tired: we
started channel surfing.  

Anyway...we get to The Weather Channel, and they're showing this
commercial for some incredibly stupid clock with pictures of birds on it,
and every hour, it chirps like whatever bird the hour hand is on.  (Well,
sorry to all bird lovers out there, but -- you know...this is pretty
funny stuff when it's 2:30 in the morning, and you're runnin' on 5 hours
of sleep anyway...)  Anyway, they give the number to order this clock at
the end of the commercial (by the way, for anyone who's interested, they
have a website set up for this thing, too...  <www.birdclock.com>), and
the phone number to order the clock is, get this... 
1-800-520-2112!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes!!!  The last four numbers were 2112!!!!!!!!  At this point, I just
absolutely lost it -- busted up laughin'....I couldn't take it any
more...I can't remember *why* I thought it was so funny, but I guess I
did!

Is there anyone out there who can actually back my story up?

Subject: Was Geddy in Queen??

First off, just a little note on my "Was Neil in Queen" post (well, the
reply to it...)...

<<I talked to him for about 15 minutes.  I wanted to talk about his
Fender basses, but
he just wanted to talk about IT.  You're right, he is a friendly person
but he definitely doesn't look like Neil Peart.>>

Actually, I agree.  John *doesn't* look like Neil.  In fact, he looks
*nothing* like Neil.  But, oddly enough, that one (really, those two)
photograph(s) of John make him look quite a bit (almost exactly) like
Neil.  (Could just be that the photos are a touch out of focus, and kind
of small...)  I wouldn't have pointed it out if John actually *did* look
like Neil, though.  It just struck me as odd that those two photographs,
of *all* of the photographs I've ever seen of him, looked like Neil.

Now...as for John looking like Geddy...once again, Queen fans, break out
your Hollywood Records versions of, this time, "Sheer Heart Attack". 
Open the liner notes to the page that has the lyrics for "Brighton Rock",
and the picture of the band playing live.  (Yes, this picture is out of
focus, too...)  This time, John looks like Geddy, nose and all.  (If you
could see details, he probably wouldn't.  But, you can't see details. 
All you can see is long hair, a nose, and a bass, and a big, lanky guy
holdin' all three in place.)

Now...if I can just find a picture where John looks like Alex...  :) 
(Maybe I'd have better luck finding a picture where Roger Taylor looks
like Alex?)

Subject: The dang pentagram thing again. . . .

Why does this always seem to come up?  

Okay...look...here's my contribution to the conversation....

A pentagram, by definition, is a geometric figure made of 5 unbroken
lines.  This can be a star, or it can be a pentagon, or whatever.  But
it's made of 5 unbroken lines.

The star on the cover of 2112 is *not* made up of 5 unbroken lines.  You
can call it either 10 smaller unbroken lines, or 5 broken lines, but they
are *not* continuous lines which make up that star.

Secondly, what you all keep refering to as a "pentagram" (a symbol of
evil) is a five-pointed star, made of five unbroken lines, contained
completely within a circle.  If you look closely at the star on the cover
of 2112, you'll see that *all FIVE* of the points are protruding
ever-so-slightly from the circle.  The same is true in *every* picture
which has the circle/star symbol.

Thirdly, it makes absolutely *no* difference which way the star is
pointing...if it's made of 5 unbroken lines, and it's completely within a
circle, it's "evil"...it it's pointing one way, it's considered satanic,
and if it's pointing the other way, it's considered witchery (or whatever
the word is I'm lookin' for...something to do with witches and witchcraft
and Wicca and that crap...).

Now...just a few minor things, before I make my final points....

<<First do you actually know that Neil contrived it????>>

Yes.  Hugh Syme, in many, many sources, has been quoted as saying that
Neil came up with the idea.  I think "came up with the idea" pretty much
indicates it was his idea.

<<he only difference between the star on the cover of 2112 and a
pentagram is actually the direction of the arrows.  When one point of the
star is facing downwards, that is a pentagram, and hence Satan.  However
when the point of the star is facing upwards that means all that
meaningful shit that I actually don't remember.>>

I just covered this, and I think I'll save a copy of this post for 6
months down the road when someone *else* brings it up.  That way I can
just repost it...

Now...my final points --

What is the thing on the cover of 2112, then, if it's not a pentagram? 
Simple -- it's the Red Star of the Solar Federation.  It's nothing more
than a 5-pointed star within (more or less) a circle, and the whole thing
happens to be on fire.  Even if it *was* what everyone keeps meaning when
they say "pentagram", it still means nothing.  It's just a symbol.  A
symbol is powerless.  I know I'm gonna get a lot of heat for this,
probably, but it's the same thing as if I were to rip a few pages out of
the Holy Bible.  In fact, I *have* ripped pages out of the Holy Bible,
and at my youth pastor's request!!  The only problem I have with it is
that I like to treat my books with respect.  But if you can't even force
yourself to rip some pages out of the Bible, then you've been worshiping
*that*, and not God.  

Symbols are powerless.  They're meaningless, unless you *put* a meaning
to them.  What I'm saying is Rush *can't* be a Satanic band, unless you
*want* them to be, and if that's what you want, so be it.  But I happen
to find a lot of *Christian* things in Neil's lyrics, as well, so, as far
as I'm concerned, Rush could be a Christian band.  It's all in how you,
as an individual, interpret these things...

And, besides -- there were at least 4 people who had some sort of input
on this cover (Neil, Geddy, Alex, and Hugh, plus probably record company
execs, and so on and so forth...).  If they *really* wanted it to be some
sort of satanic image or whatever, don't you think at least one of them
would have, at some point, said, "Hey, guys...we got this all
wrong...*this* is what we want...that's not what we have..."??  Don't you
think Neil is smart enough to know if the image he created is the one he
wanted?

Now, can we quit discussing if it's a pentagram or not on the cover (by
the way, it's not), and get on with more important things, such as Neil's
religious beliefs?  ;)  (It always seems to come up right after the
pentagram thing...)

Subject: Caveman & the Beasties

     This is mildly Rush related. Kevin Shirley (Caveman) produced the new 
     Rocket From the Crypt album. Caveman also worked with Rush on CP. 
     There is a funny picture of someone in the liner who I BELIEVE is 
     Caveman. If you have the record, you know what I mean. The picture is 
     hilarious. Anyway, this quotation comes from the liner notes:
     
     "Caveman Productions took great time in preparing this recording for 
     you, the knowledgeable listener. For the first time on compact disc 
     we've been able to exceed the industry normality of 20 digi-bits per 
     second. By using an array of microwave enhancement techniques, we were 
     able to achieve a spectacular 23 digi-bits. The obvious result is a 
     sound that is intimately close yet extremely 'hot' (music business 
     speak for a different kind of loud). I'm sure you'll agree, rock&roll 
     never sounded so good."
     
     Funny stuff, but it IS apparent that Caveman knows his shit. Rush, 
     bring him back into the fold if you do another studio album. Please.
     
     One other thing, I think it's cool that the Beasties are intro-ing to 
     a funky, scratched version of "Tom Sawyer". I may see them on Monday 
     here in Mpls, but I'm not sure. I'm going to paraphrase something that 
     Mike D said to Rolling Stone a few years ago:
     
     "White people are into music that is so obviously wack; like Rush & 
     Soul Asylum."
     
     Rolling Stone bumpered the quote by saying,"Mike D is a confirmed 
     white person." Funny stuff. Have a good day, all.

Imagine my surprise as I was leafing through the latest copy of the engineering
magazine "Design News" at work to come across a familiar Rush lyric.  
Actually, I have met several Rush fans during college and my six year career 
as an electrical engineer. Looking back, I guess Rush's themes of science 
and technology are what attracted me to their music in the first place. 
Signals was the first album I heard and I was hooked ever since. Apparently 
Gary owns that album too. You can see this article on the web at

Digital warriors test the Army's battlefield readiness

"He plays fast forward for as long as he can. But he won't need a bed--He's
a digital man." This lyric from "Digital Man" by the Canadian band Rush 
refers to societal changes brought on by the digital age. It also could apply 
to the digital-soldier model being developed by the U.S. Army Soldier Systems 
Command's (SSCOM) Modeling, Simulation and Analysis Center (MSAC). The program 
recently received Phase II status from the Small Business Innovative Research 
project on virtual prototyping. The object: to design "an automated system 
that will allow designers of clothing, equipment, weapons, protection
(systems),shelters, and workplaces to explore proposed designs and how they 
affect user performance, survivability, and behavior in realistic operational
(battlefield) settings." Unlike past Army endeavors, however, the program 
would not require that the items be physically constructed prior to 
evaluation and testing. The plan would result in a "digital human model 
suitable for virtual prototyping of protective equipment and as a character 
(computerized representation of the human form) in a virtual environment." 
Software to permit such activity includes the Integrated Unit Simulation
System, which allows for high-resolution analytic simulation and the insertion 
of proposed technologies in larger scenarios prior to investing in actual
constructed prototypes.

Subject: the best band ever

Greetings fellow RUSHians,
          
        First time writing to the National Midnight Star and it is such a
pleasure to see the legions of Rush fans all over the net. First off I have to
mention the great dissappointment that Guitar World had in their latest issue
of "the greatest 100 guitar solos of all time". What a damn load of crap that
was!!!! Lifeson only getting in at 94th, even for a solo that really wasn't
his greatest!! Any of his solos could beat more than half of the solos
mentioned. La Villa Strangiato for example is a musical masterpiece. I might
just be a little ticked off after throwing the magazine out into the garbage
can in our garage, don't you think? Anyhow, it's great to see Rush is putting
out a great new live album, even I wasn't sure with the first title, "Dimlit
Stages for All Ages" , I really like te new title "Different Stages", it rolls
better off the tongue. 
         Anyhow, I am also sad for Neil Peart for it's very hard to imagine
what he's going through being that he first lost his daughter Selena and now
his wife too. I hope Neil doesn't become a recluse and never perform again
(god i hope not). I think Neil is probably the best drummer of all-time (even
Mike Portnoy in an interview admitted Peart was the best). I also think Geddy
is possibly the best bass player and a quite excellent (if not different)
singer. Most of all Alex is my idol, being that he is my biggest inspiration
on my guitar playing and that in my opinion his playing, feel and sound is
unmatched.
          Okay, that about does it for me now. I enjoy reading the National
Midnight Star very much so. Hope to hear from other fellow rush fans.

Subject: Top 100

     Hello all,
     
     This isn't the typical post on the top 100 guitar thingys.  Sure, Alex 
     was listed at the bottom of the barrel, but what did you expect?  The 
     gang did numerous posts about how VH-1 snubbed Rush on their list of 
     top 100 rock bands, and I'm sure if there were a top 100 of anything 
     else, Rush would only receive a lip service in the bottom 20% of the 
     list.
     
     This happens over and over, and it is a tale that we all know too 
     well, "Yeah, I like Rush....that drummer dude kicks butt, I think.  
     Well, I don't actually have any CD's but my buddy is like really into 
     them.  I think he has all 6 albums."  Sound familiar?  While we all 
     have a disgust for the "expert opinion", it is just that -- opinion.  
     How many Rush haters do you know?  
     
     I guess my point is that whenever these "best ever" lists come out, 
     take them with a grain of salt and don't be surprised if Rush is never 
     given a higher-than-mediocre status.  These "all-time" lists are darn 
     fickle.  Not that MTV is worth rhino dung, but they do an "all-time" 
     video list every year that seems to change the #1 to whatever is still 
     popular in people's minds, even though Thriller still cracks the top 5 
     every time.  Told you MTV wasn't worth much.  Once again, Rush is and 
     will continue to be overlooked.  But we all know what's cool, don't 
     we?
