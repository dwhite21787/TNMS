News on the album! 

A roving Rush spy has reported that they have glimpsed the album artwork! 
It is a simple cover of something similar to tinkertoys in various stages of 
construction. They also report that fans will be happy with the numerous
*OLDER* photos of the band in the cds.

"Bastille Day" has also been confirmed for the AFTK disc -- "2112" will ONLY
appear on the 2-cd set, not on the 3rd disc.

Subject: Missing Soul

Good Day,

  I usually don't like to get involved in the bashing of bands, but the
constant bludgeoning of Dream Theater irks me.  I find it truly ironic that
some of the comments directed at their music were (or still are) directed
toward Rush.  I'm curious to see if the bashers have really listened to the
Dream Theater catalog.

  Songs like "Surrounded," "Wait for Sleep," The Silent Man," "Lifting
Shadows Off a Dream," Space Dye Vest," "Hollow Years," Take Away My Pain,"
and "Anna Lee" and many, many others are exceptional songs emotionally and
musically.  
	
  If I remember correctly, Neil considers instrumentals acts of
self-indulgence, but do they continue to write them?  I, for one, am glad
they do.  Dream Theater may play a lot of extended instrumental breaks
etc., but is that not the same as a self-indulgent instrumental (a la La
Villa Strangiato, YYZ, fill in your fav)?

  So, before you go bashing a band with much of the same intentions as our
beloved Rush, you may want to think twice.  Both bands are exceptional on
their own merits.  Leave it at that!

  By the way, Mystic Rhythms, the book is quite a pleasure to read.  I
would highly recommend you hunt down this work.  You will not regret it.

Take Care,
John

Subject: Beastie Boys do Tom sawyer

I live in Portland,OR and on Aug-2nd the beastie boys played the Rose Garden.
The place was packed, the atmosphere was electric and the crowed was 
amped to see the much antisipated B-Boys show. So Mix Master Mike comes 
out first to get ready.  With the beastie boys close behind he pulls out 
a record and puts it on the turn table.  To my shock and complete 
excitment he starts to scratch Tom Sawyer. I can't even tell you how Phat 
it was"Todays Tom Sawyer mean mean pride". Needless to say It got me and 
every one else there even more pumped up. Anyway the concert was fresh so 
if you get a chance check em out! 

One more note I was listing to some old old Rush song like Bad Boy Best I 
can it was off there Electric-Ladyland album. And I was just woundering if 
they ever listen to the sound they had back they and if they could come 
up with some new music with that kind off kick.
Anyway I love Rush and I respect anything they do, Much Love Brian B

			P.S any Portlanders out there listen to 1450 am
					Fridays from 6-7  I play lots of Rush

Subject: Various Ramblings

Haven't posted to the list in quite a while, so here we go.

1. Yes, Alex _did_ get shafted on the top 100 guitar solo's of all time
list. Keep in mind, this list was constructed by the opinions of those
who wrote in, not the staff. HOW Dimebag Darell got so high on that list
makes me wonder. I guess I'm going to have to get a Pantera album. I'd
vote YYZ for Alex's best solo, Working Man goes on the bottom half.

2. (Dream Theater vs. Rush) - Hearing Dream Theater AT the TFE shows
made me go out and buy their albums. While they aren't Rush, we have to
remember to give them some time. They've changed line-ups twice now, and
it's hard to evolve when you're facing that. Rush themselves didn't
"nail it" until 2112 I'd say anyways. Both are great bands, both explore
new musical ideas. Let us praise them both!

3. Rush with Tom Sawyer now on two movie soundtracks. Perhaps media
attention for Rush, finally? Even if it is TS (duck flames). Maybe this
will make the R&R HOF take notice?

and analysis from a Christian perspective (which is why I love it!).  A

night -- and when her intro music came up, it was "The Big Money!"  I
listened some more, and after the break, "Distant Early Warning" was the

To all in high places:

Wall of Sound reports this from the opening night of the Beastie Boys tour.

Finally, the Beasties hit the stage. Mixmaster Mike, the DJ brought in to give
Hello Nasty the old-school sound, preempted them with a scratch mix of Rush's
"Tom Sawyer," giving the trio an appropriate entrance. 

What is it with everyone getting their sampling hands on the boys?
There is also a tidbit on the new release which is not really new news to
anyone because Maher and the mgr. have been right on the big money as usual.

The perfect tune for Rush to cover would be the theme from Seinfield!

With Neil doing the little percusion at the beginning and Geddy 
jamming on the base and Alex could throw some cool rifs in there as 
well.

With their sense of humour (at least Geddy's so I hear) they might 
just do it too!

Dear fellow Rush Fans--

	I was at the store the other day, and looking for a certain item I 
needed.  I was walking up and down the aisles I saw a Nerf toy gun 
called the Nerf 2112.  Now, all of you probably have seen and talked 
about this already, but I am a new subscriber.  Was this toy gun named 
after Rush???  Just thought I'd ask.  Thanks

   [ AFAIK, the gun WAS named after the song, but they didn't get permission
     from the band, management or record company to do so (therefore you
     won't notice anything relating the two except the name)   : rush-mgr ]

Hi all,

I keep fairly up-to-date with reading the nms, but it's been a few
months since I've actually posted. 

1.) "Different Stages" is a much for fitting title, but it seems to be
missing something. It doesn't matter to me though, I'm happier than hell
about the live album release.  Cool, we get "Limelight" this time.
"Resist" is another awesome choice; it's my favorite song on T4E. And of
course, 2112, Analog Kid, and Natural Science, are wonderful surprises.
I hope they decide to include Limbo and The Pass. I really look forward
to hearing the 2001/Dreamline intro. LIVE ALBUM, YES!!!

2.) Does anyone know why Rush never performed "The Enemy Within" in any
of the tours following GUP? I think it's the best song on GUP, and it's
one of my all-time favorites. From what I've noticed, "The Enemy Within"
was one of the more popular songs from GUP, and received large crowd
response on tour. But after the GUP tour, it was dropped forever. Rush
played "The Weapon" and "Witch Hunt" on the PW tour, but excluded "The
Enemy Within". Any ideas why? (If there is another tour, wouldn't it be
cool if Rush performs the whole Fear trilogy?)

3.) As we all know, through the years, our beloved trio has changed hair
styles, dress styles, etc. In my opinion, Geddy's look for CP/T4E rules,
especially the glasses. Anyone know why Geddy chose to go with the 
"John Lennon style" sunglasses? Also, did Geddy wear sunglasses on stage
before "Counterparts", and if so, what kinds/styles did he use? I
thought he did during RTB/Presto tours, but wasn't sure what kind.

4.) I was listening to the "Virtual Songs" bootleg, from Rush's 1996
Phoenix performance, and noticed that Geddy messed up the lyrics on
"Resist". He sings ". . .with all the things I don't know" instead of 
". . . with all the things I can't explain" at the end of the first
verse. (I laughed on this one, because I sometimes do the same damn
thing when I'm singing along to "Resist" in the car. It's easy to mix up
the two main verses.) This could be a new thread; Geddy messing up the
lyrics.

Well, that's all for now. Can't wait until October 6th.

Later,
Brian

They certainly are inconsistent, but are you suggesting 
that Fender painted fret makers onto the fingerboard?  I 
have never seen 'painted on fret markers', even on their
cheap Mexican-made  stuff.  Plastic, yes, paint, no.

I met John Deacon about three years ago, at a party given by a
market data provider in the City (he has a friend who works for 
Reuters).  He was wearing a smart business suit, and I was the
only person there who recognised him.  I talked to him for 
about 15 minutes.  I wanted to talk about his Fender basses, but
he just wanted to talk about IT.  You're right, he is a friendly
person but he definitely doesn't look like Neil Peart.

It seems like that Geddy is following the guitar with his own voice modified

Last night I was in the car listening to KFAN(sports talk radio in 
Minneapolis)and The Scott Farrell show was on.  If you have ever 
listened to it before he talks about sports with music playing in the 
background.  Right before a commercial he had playing "Where's My 
Thing" and then when they came back from commercial "Working Man" 
kicked in.  He even let them go into the first verse before he started 
talking.  "Neil Peart and Geddy Lee of Rush".  Well of course he 
forgot Alex and Neil didn't even contribute to that song, but it was 
still neat to hear the boys on a sports talk show.

Subject: Rush Live Material

Havent posted in over a year, but figured since the live stuff will be coming
out shortly, it would be an opportune time.  The new live disc should
hopefully be great.  I cant wait to hear that slower, heavier version of
driven.  Plus, we all know how much better the live versions are of material
from the Presto and Roll The Bones era, due to the lack of good sound on the
albums compared to the latter two albums.  It's just too bad there wasn't more
included from the Presto album, it really IS a great disc.  If memory server
me correctly though, didn't the band film the last show of the Test For Echo
tour in Canada?  And since I wasn't a fan of the band when a show of hands
came out, did the live album and video come out at the same time?  Hopefully
they WILL release another video.  

As for Dream Theater, a recurring theme on the NMS :), they're another one of
my favorite bands.  I agree with Adam that they DO need more time to become
better songwriters.  With ALL bands that comes with experience and age.  I
LAUGH at the material my band wrote about 2-3 years ago, because its so
strange.  But those guys DO have great chops and they are getting better at
writing cohesive songs.  And yes, definitely see them live.  Theyre

BTW, I don't know if anyone saw it or mentioned it, but while i was at the
Met's game last Wednesday, they wished Geddy a happy B-Day on the big screen
and over the loudspeakers.

     In response to Rush Manager's statement that taking down the RV files
would not deter fans from buying the new CD-ROM, the issue is not merely
displacement of sales.  Rather, artists should also have the right to
present their creative works in a manner that they believe is appropriate
and best reflects their view of how those works should be viewed/listened
to by their audience.  As a Rush fan for almost 20 years, I too have an
insatiable appetite for every Rush recording, concert, or video I can get
my hands on; but as a lawyer who represents record companies and artists, I
also believe that we should respect the copyright owner's decision about
how those recordings should be heard by an audience.

Last Friday, whilst playing putt-putt at my niece's birthday party, 
the facility's (Malibu Gran Prix in Lilburn,GA) subscriber music 
service (or Rock Musak) actually played Rush's "Limelight".

The cool thing was that we were in the middle of the course, my in-
laws one hole behind us, my wife and her brother and his date in 
our foursome.

Anyway, it was cool to be jamming to the tune with a captive 
audience. :)

Dear fellow Rushians,

The editors at guitar world are either out of touch with reality or just 
have their heads up their asses.  I was very disappointed to see their 
top 100 guitar solo picks.  Most of them were either way out of place or 
didn't deserve to be there.  I'm not going to tell you what should be 
there (more Alex, more Ritchie Blacmore, less E. Van Halen, less 
Pantera, more Brian May).

The poll of what we Rush fans like on TV was quite interesting, but, 
South Park as the # 1?  Come on people.  IT's basically the same episode 
week after week. Granted that first week was funny, but how about some 
animation and some originality instead of killing the same person all 
the time and just yelling "kick ass" to every little thing said (or in 
most cases, screamed).

And one rush-related question.  Is the live album still scheduled for 
October 6 or has it been moved back again.  Thanks!

Chris Palo

   I have noticed Rush gets stiffed alot( me being 14 this is very 
observant). You see kids ask me what type of music I like I'll say Rush, 
Dream Theater( oh my god!!!! :). So on but most of them go oh yea I have 
heard of them they sounded good. So I ask why dont you like them and 
they will be like its not cool.And also by the general public its not 
what the people want any more like Garbage,Tool( i dont mind 
them),Metalica ect.Its want the record company wants( as iam writing 
this for rock 104 is playing there comercial for concret jungle.)becase 
Rush is way way better than green day. if some one told teens that rush 
was cool they would be.Sad to bad.
Ps: way does guys like joe satrinai get played on comercials but never 
on the radio.

Subject: PROGRESSIVE MUSIC

Hi Everyone,

I just got the new Explorers Club CD and it is just incredible. For those of
you who are not familiar with this CD, it contains a group of excellent
musicians from all forms of music. The rhythm section consists of Billy
Sheehan on bass and Terry Bozzio ( not human ) on drums. Talk about a
Drummer who is not of this earth, listen to the drum tracks Bozzio lays down
and you'll understand why he is from another planet. Soloists consist of
John Petrucci on Guitars ( awesome solo's ), Steve Howe on Acoustic Guitar,
James Murphy on Guitar, Frederick Clarke on Guitar, Derek Sherinian on
Keyboards, Trent Gardner on Keyboards and Trombone, Matt Guillory on
Keyboards and Michael Bemesderfer on Flute. Lead Vocals are Matt Bradley,
James LaBrie, D.C. Cooper, Trent Gardner and Bret Douglas. For those of you
who love Progressive rock, this CD is for you. As for the RUSH content,
can't wait for the live CD's to come out later this year. I hear all the
rumors about a third live CD containing music from the 1977 tour. Awesome,
that's all I can say. One last thing, I've read alot of negative e-mails
about the band Dream Theater and I want to put my two cents in. IMHO Dream
Theater is a good band. I'm really suprised by all the negative comments
about them. Each CD they have put out has been quality music. I have enjoyed
all of their CD's and even the side projects ( Liquid Tension Experiment,
Working Man Tribute, Explorers Club ). Just one mans
opinion................................keep that in mind

Subject: Songs on "Different Stages"

Hello! Howdy! How are ya!?

Am I the only one that would rather see "The Pass" and "Vital Signs"
on the live album instead of another version of "Tom Sawyer"? TS
rocks, OK, don't panic, but it's a mainstay of their live set. Anyone
who is even a mild Rush fan has heard this song many, many times. A
live version already exists on ESL, so why not use this (last?)
opportunity to put some less often played live songs on the album?
"The Pass" is a band favorite (so Geddy says on "Mirrors"), so what's
the logic here? 

Other than this small complaint, this live album(s) is gonna ROCK!
Great track selection and a full 2CD set! Limelight! 2112! Natural
Science! This can't come soon enough!! And just to piss all of you who
hate RTB, I'd vote for "Ghost of a Chance", too! :-P Oh yeah! The
Analog Kid! The only way it could get better is if they included one
of those 15-minute medleys (i.e. Mirrors again).

BTW, did the working title remind anyone else of a sendoff of sorts?
It sounded so FINAL. Dimlit Stages for All Ages sounds like, at the
very least, that Rush was through touring. Am I paranoid?

And lastly, I was one of the people who (kinda) bashed CP a while
back. Upon repeated playing, many of the songs are growing on me. Even
"Double Agent", which mere months ago, I would have skipped past.

Subject: Before it gets started!

I hope that this doesn't start into a huge ordeal.  Someone expained the 
meaning of the star that was on the cover of 2112.  First do you actually 
know that Neil contrived it????  Anyway, it has some meaning, each point of 
the star, like Earth, Wind, and some stuff like that.  The only difference 
between the star on the cover of 2112 and a pentagram is actually the 
direction of the arrows.  When one point of the star is facing downwards, 
that is a pentagram, and hence Satan.  However when the point of the star 
is facing upwards that means all that meaningful shit that I actually don't 
remember.  I just don't want to see a huge thread of people talking about 
Rush's religious beliefs.  I was on this list 4 years ago and unsubscribed 
because many ignorant people were going on at great length about their 
guesses of Rush's religious affiliation and whether they worship the devil 
or not.  To whoever wrote the response, I know you aren't trying to dig up 
a can of worms, but listening to people banter about such stupid stuff as 
that really ruins this otherwise great mailing.
	While I am here, seems to be alot about Dream Theater, and someone 
couldn't have said it better, they are still young.  However nothing they 
have written has shown the melodic promise of Fly By Night.  They certainly 
can show off their skills, but only time will tell if they can actually 
write music worth listening to if you are not a musician yourself.  Rush 
have only succeeded by beginning to write more radio friendly songs. 
 Permanent Waves and on, the only song I ever hear on the radio before that 
album is Fly By Night, 3 minutes and 50 seconds.  Pull Me Under was 
successful because they made a radio release of it, it was easy to listen 
to (mostly in 4/4, for the musicians).  If you listen to Mike Portnoy 
(Dream Theater drummer) play an odd time signature (7/8) he makes it very 
overstated to let the listener know it is an odd time, that's difficult for 
an average listener to enjoy (can't bob your head, tap your feet, etc..) 
 Neil Peart plays odd times so smoothly that you don't even realize he's 
doing it (sections of Natural Science that are in 9/8).  Sorry to drag on 
about this drivel, sorry to bash Mike Portnoy, believe me he is one 
incredible drummer, but his way of overstating the rhythym is hard for the 
average music listener to really enjoy and understand.
Anyway,   see ya later,    Dan

Subject: license plates

Hello everyone,

During my vacation last week, 7/25 to 8/2, I drove from Montana to
Wisconsin. If any of you on this list happened by chance to see a green
Honda Accord with the Montana license plate, "Force Ten", that was me.
Common cds in my player during the trip were, Test for Echo,
Counterparts, Roll the Bones, Hold Your Fire, Retro 1, Virtual
Songs(boot), Experience to Extremes(boot), Darkness & Light(boot), and
Animated(boot). In addition to Rush, I listened to Dream Theater's
"Falling into Infinity", Metallica's "Reload", and some new age music by
"Cusco". I did the trip in 14.5 hours straight, by myself, and pulled up
to my destination with "Driven" cranked.

Later,
Brian

Hello everyone out there -
The email above got me thinking about Signals [again].  I too have 
been very influenced by this music, having got it in 1983 as a 15yr 
old.  Many of the themes it touches on seemed so poignant to growing 
up, and still do.  So, a couple of questions if I may?  [1] Am I 
right in thinking that Signals is regarded by many as a weak album?  
[2] When people have criticised it in the past, has this related only 
to the production, as I think some of the composition and playing is 
second to none? [3] Should I buy the re-mastered Cd, as I thought the 
normal Cd sounded great.  Ok, that's a wrap.

Keith.

ps.  if this is old news to NMS, sorry, I only joined recently.

'Different Stages' ... not very inspiring is it. 'Dimlit Stages For All
Ages' now sounds like a good title! I'm with the guy who suggested the
'Cheesy Poof' title.
Anyway, October 6th can't come quick enough - but will it be available

Subject: THE BEASTIE BOY'S USE RUSH!!!!!MUST READ

             
I found this Beastie Boys Concert Review from Rolling Stone on the Point
Cast Network.  This probably the only time RUSH has been mentioned in
Rolling Stone. 

Beastie Boys Concert Review  
8/4/98 
     
Beasties: Super Nerve Breakin' (The Beastie Boys)
The Key Arena, Seattle, July 31, 1998

Given that Rush's precision rock dominated the airwaves when the Beasties
began their adolescent romp to the top of pop way back in the mid-Eighties,
it was only fitting that the group's highly anticipated tour kicked off
with Auxiliary Beastie "Mixmaster Mike" scratching the first thirty seconds
of "Tom Sawyer" for five minutes straight. The crowd of 15,000 was
simmering by the time King Ad-Rock, Mike D and MCA boiled up the ramp in
their trademark orange coveralls to the beat of "The Move," a track off the
Boys' latest, Hello Nasty.

Well!  Dose this mean what I think it's gonna mean?  Are the Beastie's RUSH
fans?  Do I hear a new thread?

By-the-Way:  I bought the new Beastie Boys "Hello Nasty" CD.  I did not
like it at first but after about 15 listens (because it has KILLER bass) I
give it a definite purchase for even the occasional Beastie fan or "Bass
Head".

Subject: Headbanging with Rush?

Hello TNMSers everywhere!

    I was thinking the last night about a weird experience. The last 21 
of May I went to a show of Yes here in Santiago de Chile. They started 
the show with "Siberian Khatru". I'm a heay-thrash metal fan, and I 
started headbanging... The other people was 35-40 years old, and  all, I 
said ALL the old guys looked me with with a blank face... Thinking 
something like "This guy is really crazy!" I'm 19 years old, and I think 
that some Rush songs are good and hard enough to headbanging with them, 
like the middle part of Red Barchetta, Analog kid, the end of Cygnus x-1 
(Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrgghhh!) and all the FBN, COS and 2112 l.ps. What do you 
think? Are some of you young enough to enjoy a Rush show like a hog in 
the mud and headbanging?
                                         Chao, compadres!

p.s: Excuse my poor english, and pray for the Rush first Latin-american 
tour, we need it!
