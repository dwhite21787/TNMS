Well, first things first.  Apologies for not putting out a digest in a while, 
I guess with vacation and all, everyone is away, traffic was slow.  Some 
things for the administrivia:

If you've been emailing to BEEZUS@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu about the new NMS-II 
mailing list, please don't.  There is no such thing.  Apologies for all the 
confusion, it's a long story. 

There's new information below about the upcoming tour.  Check out Bob Roper's 
post concerning opening bands for this tour.

Also, now that the full management is back from break, the rush-srv gopher 
will go up this week.  (promise!)  If you're attending shows, please send some 
email to rush-srv@syrinx.umd.edu


For those of you who like WWW and Mosaic, check out Jimmy's posting below.

That's it for now.

Subject: Neil's chest in the "Vital Signs" video

	That thing taped to Neil's chest in the "Vital Signs" video is a
pressure zone microphone, commonly referred to as a "PZM." These mics
have a flat plate, with a slightly raised rectangular element in the
center, creating a gap on about 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch between the plate
and the element.  This allows only the direct sound waves, and not the
reflections of those sound waves, to pass to the element, and get
passed on to the recording.  The engineer that recorded "Vital Signs"
was probably using this mic placement to add some of the sound that
Neil actually hears when he's playing his kit, and get a sound that
Neil was more happy with.....

Yep!  The subject says it all.  I was going through my snail mail today and
was very plesantly surprised to see a multi-page, multi-photograph article of
the stereo system in Alex's 1983 Mercedes 380SEC.  It's also shown on the cover.
There is also a side article entitled "A Day in the Lifeson".  I don't have
time to reproduce either of the articles here, but they give some interesting
insight into Alex, such as what discs he keeps in the changer in the car.

It's good reading, even if you're not excited about car stereos.

I'm sure someone will take the time to type it up so everyone can read it!

No, they use monitor-speakers for that very purpose. You hardly can hear
a guitar or keyboard if you play it UN-amplified. Therefore a monitor

Subject: Everything

As for the Rockline stuff, does anyone know whether it will be
all of Rush or just one or two?

I was (and still am) quite surprised that most magazine reviews
of Rush albums usually tear them apart.  I looked through a
periodical index at a local university and photocopied all of
the reviews.  I think a review in a German magazine was good,
but I can't read German.  Rolling Stone has NEVER liked Rush,
or any "conservative" band.  I looked at their first review
of a Rush album (Hemisipheres) and it basically asked, "Why do
they have a job?"  It called the Trees a crock of hipocritical
crap.  In a RS book about rock bands, they knock them the whole
time and then say that they show signs of only getting better.

I felt Cold Fire was very true.  The female connotation/context
may or may nor reflect opinions of Peart on women, but for the
most part I felt the message is to both sexes.

Has anyone noticed that Columbia House (the CD fellows) gave
_Roll the Bones_ an explicit lyrics thing?  What an outrage!

Subject: O.K., NOT a metronome...

Hi, all,

Just personal clarification for the record...
Sorry if I incorrectly stated that it was a metronome instead of a 'click'
track...they're very similar.  I just _meant_ to use the example of a
metronome to parallel the use of the 'click' track in explaining it all.
Sorry for the partial misleading...
As for using this just for electronic drums, again check out the (studio)
video for "Vital Signs"--regular drums; NOT electronic; and headphones.
Also, I doubt that Neil would use headphones to listen to his own drums, when
they're being amplified exceptionally loudly.
'nuff of that...--and...

I wish to extend my best wishes for a Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays and an
exceptionally (Rush-Filled  :) Happy New year.

Until LATER!!!   -NP

Subject: Ramblin' Man goes to Pensacola

Greetings!

  Hello once again. It's so good to be on winter break and have a
little jaunt to Florida in my near future. So very good indeed.

  Had to write in today. Just had to. The CP-Tour dreams are growing
to common a nighttime occurrence for me. Just had to get this off my
chest. (And a stained flannel shirt. Had to get that off my chest, too,
but you don't want to hear about it. Especially since I had a Primus
shirt underneath and the whole incident turned out OK.) I've been
listening to much radio lately, (is that the same as Much Music? I
think not...), and I've heard an encouraging amount of Rush being
played. Thanks go out to whoever suggested the new New York station that
now resided at 104.3 on your FM dial. (Well, mine, anyway.) Used ta
be a classical music station (One I rather enjoyed, actually). We
get to hear Cold Fire and Stick It Out the mandatory 3 zillion times a
day. And, get this: I heard Kid Gloves churning outta that baby this
morning.

I KID YOU NOT.

My brain skidded almost as audibly as the time MTV used The Body Electric
as thematic music for a small bit on Terminator 2.

Attendees of the upcoming Parts tour, rejoice! I shall be swooping in for
Pensacola 1-22-94 with unconcealable excitement. If you have some tickets
you don't need for this one, give me a yell! I got mine the hard way, and
just thinking about their location in the arena opened a few blood vessels
in my left nostril.

REJOICE!

I just wanted to thank everyone who wrote to me with info. on the tix

we're stuck in some bizarre place on the risers on Geddy's side.  My
friend who got the tix called me to "bring me the sad news" -- but I
figure, hey, as long as we're there, that's all that counts.  That's what
binoculars are for!!  :-)

anyway, thanx again, everyone.  I realized with a horrifying start that
I wasn't sure if I'd thanked you all or not, so this should make it
official. :-)  Here's to good seats for everyone!

Subject: Help wanted!

Hello fellow Rushfans(tm),
     I have been perusing over all the different boots avaible to
us.  And I have narrowed my selection to three.  But this is
where I need some help.  For those that have or heard these
three,  could you drop me a line to which one to get?  The
choocies are,  Cold Flames,  Over the Europe,  and Rush and
Rolutte 92'.  Should I go for the sound quality or the the
complete concert?  Just drop me a line which you like.

   [ Also you can email meg@syrinx.umd.edu, she has a listing of boots that 
     are currently available along with information on what's on them and 
     various notes about them.                                     :rush-mgr ]

     I also wondered about a theme in recent Rush album covers.
I am not sure if the FAQ doc covers this but here it goes.
Anyone know or care what is meant by,  "Bought to you by the
letter..."?  Just something to ponder while you all wait for your
tickets.  Cause this theme can be seen as early as '85 in PW.
     Hope you all had something Rush under or on the tree this
year!
     One other matter for the manager to look over.  I had sent
in a post a about 5 or 6 days before Christmas.  I had not seen
hide nor hair out of it.  Just wondering if it got lost or what?

just going over the six or so newsletters I missed while in beautiful old

- my votes are with 'men about oars' and 'ambition's the fire,' - maybe we
can start these threads up again (just a joke...)

- recently purchased 'A New Reality' boot, just to add on to what it says
in the boot info file, the foldout case for the cd is VERY COOL, and the
sound is pretty good, i have to rate it right there with 'Spirit of St
Louis' and above 'Mardi Gras'

- Just to agree with what Eric from Duke wrote, Dean Dome is at a rather,
how shall we say, extreme slope.  just to annoy everyone - When are
tickets going on sale for that show?  ok, i guess no one knows yet.

- On the 11 hour ride from mountainous boone, nc to philly, i was
pondering the fate of the NMS after rush has ceased to exist.  ok, sorry
to say it, but it will happen eventually, i guess in the next, well, i
dont know how long, but eventually.  so anyway, i was wondering how long
this could go on without Rush actually producing anyhting new.  i assume,
although i dont know, that there are led zep and beatles type things like
this.  so hopefully for a while.  just something i was wondering about.
'cause it is so cool.  i was telling my dad about TNMS, he is a recent
rush fan due to me, and he said, 'i still can't believe there is someone
who would take all the time to compile all that stuff and mail it.' so
thanks rush-mgr.  you've at least impressed my dad.  :-)

This is a "Pressure-Zone Microphone" (small microphone near large flat

Yes, that's right, Rusheads!  After my temporary stint as the editor-in-chief
of the ill-fated "All-New NMS 2," I decided that it was time to reopen the
Pandora's Box that is the Rush Cassette Bureau.  It's been out of service for
quite a while, but that's to its (and your) advantage.

The 1994 Catalog is aplumb with "rare" and "imported" Rush goodness.  Either
e-mail me, Unca Beezus, or my partner-in-crime, shermy@delphi.com, for all of
the horrid details.  There may a short time being that I will NOT be able to
be reached at my 'Net address.  As the "HH Guide 2 the Galaxy" would tell you:
Don't Panic.  Just correspond via Mr. Shermy's 'Net address there at Delphi.

All of you obviously insane subscribers to America Online can send me e-mail
on that service by addressing it to "Gush."  Pretty, huh?

There it is, folks, the official announcement.  A few of the regulations have
been changed, but it's still the same ol' RCB--the definitive, unassuming 
sourcefor "rare" and "imported" Rush recordings both 'commercial' and 
otherwise.  Got a question?  Drop me or Shermy a line.

Hope you can stand a little more on that 'phosphorescent waves' thing.
It could be just an observation of a natural phenomenon. In many parts
of the world, often in warmer waters, sea water glows when a ship passes
through it. You can see the trail behind you for a long way. It's kind

carries RockLine now?? It used to be the Loop (97.9fm) but they dropped
the music format for an all-talk/comedy lineup (Danny Bonaduce?????) Any
help on this would be greatly appreciated!
Also, <self-lauditory tone here> I am hosting a Conference on
Compuserve.  The content is going to be Rush-related (much like the IRC
stuff here on InterNet) however, as this is the RockNet forum on CI$,
anything goes
Time : Saturdays, 9-11pm Central time (do the conversions yerself <g>)
Where: On CompuServe, in the ROCKNET forum (go ROCKNET).
When: Starts on January 8th, 1994 (THis Saturday folks!)
Those on CI$, please drop by if time & schedule permit, it should be a

Hi, folks....   Two items:

I expect tickets for the Feb. 24th Rush show at Atlanta's Omni to go
on sale either this coming weekend or the weekend afterward.  I've
been compiling a list of people who are interested in getting together
on ticket-day in order to get better seats (the more people in one
place to draw lottery numbers for the ticket line, the better).  I got
8th row seats last time, and hope to do at least as well this time
around.  If you are interested, please drop me email.

I'll be driving over to Pensacola for the Jan. 22nd tour kick-off
show, and I have room for two more in the white Taurus egg-mobile.
(Dave/tvos will be joining the road-trip in Birmingham. :))   If
anyone from Atlanta is going to Pensacola and is interested in
carpooling, please drop me email.   We've also booked a hotel room
down there with a flat rate good for up to five people, so if anyone
needs inexpensive crash space within a few miles of the venue, let me

CANDLEBOX will open for RUSH from Jan.22 in Pensacola until Feb.8 in Fresno.
THE MELVINS will open in Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose.

   [ Bob, thanks for the update.  For those who don't know, Candlebox is a 
     band out of Seattle and they will be opening up for Rush for the 1st 2 
     weeks of the tour.  The Melvins opened up for Primus this past tour.
     Speaking of Primus, don't be surprised when you see them again as a 
     possible opener this tour :-)    And finally for fans in the Midwest, 
     although I don't have dates yet, Rush should be there around March 23
     through April 10.   (The April 10th date will be in Ames, IA).  :rush-mgr ]

Happy New Year Y'all,

    Hope that all of your holidays were good,  mine was pretty cool.  OK
enough of the small talk...after Christmas I went to a mall here in Buffalo
looking for the 2112 Ultradisk CD.  I checked 3 different places and one of
the places I approached someone for help.  Well he informed me that they had
them but are out.  He is going to special order it for me and should find out
by Thrusday the 6th.  I was wondering,  a while back a couple people
mentioned that they bought it.  Just in case I can't get one here, would it
be possible for one of yous to get a hold of me so we can arrange some sort
of deal to get one for me?!
     By the way the person who helped me said that the ultradisk has been out
for "quite a while"...is this true??  I thought it just came out?
     Thanks,
      Tony Moretta

Subject: RUSH URL - Beta

For those of you want to check it out, I am working on a Mosaic page for NMS 
and Rush in general.  It's still in Beta but if you want to check it out the 
URL is:

http://www.cerf.net/~jlang/rushfan.html

Any feedback, mistakes, comments, etc.. are welcomed.

Right now, I'm still in the process of making hypertext links to the albums 
and such.  Eventually it will be a full-fledge information home page, 
basically anything you wanted to know about the NMS and the band!  If
anyone is interested in helping with the project, let me know.  It's not
nearly being done but it's a preview if you have Mosaic and want to
check it out.
