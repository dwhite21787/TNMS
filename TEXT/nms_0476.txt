Just a few things.  First of all, I thought the person making the t-shirts
had posted in Fridays NMS.  After pawing through the issues, I couldn't find
a post from them, so I'll see what's up.  I've been trading mail with them
semi-regularly, so it is a go.  As for the questions about the design, in
particular the tabloid version, this will be a different shirt.  The person
who wants to do this version is too busy currently, so another person who
does have time & facilities will be offering the "star logo" version now (or
soon).  Buy 'em all, collect a set!  :-)

Secondly, as it is nearing the end of school sessions, if you plan on not
being around during the summer, or will lose your account shortly, I'd 
appreciate it if you could drop me a line AT THE ADMIN ADDRESS to request
removal.  It's more of a pain for me if you wait until the account dies, and
I have to look for "userid unknown" messages.  Thanks.

There is a new addition to the tab archive, guitar tab for "The Big Money."
There will also soon be an archive for chord notation, as our "keeper of the
tabs" has indicated an interest for it.  I'm assuming at this point that he
will deal with submissions for this as well.  (Correct me FAST if I'm wrong,
Frank! :-)

Remember, "add me/remove me/change my address" mail here will most likely
be ignored, except under special circumstances.

Hy Fellow Fans,

  It has been a while, but the import of what I have to say brings me to post
gain,  I got three things to ask of ya's,

1.  Does anyone know what the summer dates for concerts in the New England area
    are, I know of Great Woods are there others, and when are they, when do
    tickets go on sale.
2.  I am doing a report in which Rush and Its music will play a Major role
    nearlt 1/4 of the finished paper,  Are there any books and newspaper
    articles that you could suggest, that may help.
3.  Finally how the hell does one document an FTP archive in a bibliography
    specfically the one that NMS comes from.

Thanks in Advance,
Haplo -a gypsy with a plastic guitar.

BTW E-Mail responce would be nice as I do not get a lotta time to sit down and
read the NMS often save 'em up for semester breaks.

TAKE NOTE:

Rush will go on sale for both Jones Beach and Meadowlands Arena this coming
Saturday May 1st.  I do not know what time, call the Ticketbastard scum bags
for exact time.

Bear in mind, that this will be your last chance to see Rush in the New York
area on the RTB tour and that Jones Beach will be the first outdoor show in
New York.

Also, I believe Spac will go on sale Saturday or Sunday May 16 or 17th.

One last thing, does anybody know how many miles it is from Saratoga Springs,
NY to Dayton, OH????  Please email direct.

Thank you.

Subject: Pennsylvanian Apologies

Since Rush is coming to SPAC after all, I sheepishly apologize for all
bad-mouthed remarks about Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania.  I
still don't know WHY you'd want to live there ;-) because, as the Boyz
rightfully realized when they came to their senses, upstate New York is
clearly the best place for everyone :-)

But seriously, I have nothing against PA or the city, I was just venting
my frustrations.  Actually, I know several nice people from Pittsburgh
(even if they are slightly deformed from the pollution- yeah, I know,
it's a really clean city, but try the outskirts...)

So, don't take it personally!  Pittsburgh, a warm-up for SPAC!

Subject: Chicago is looking dim...but I am praying for some light

I have been calling TicketBastard every week to find out any info on the
  Chi-town show.
On my last try, I found out that Mr. Big is playing the Peoria Civic Center (I
  think that is what it's called) sometime in June.
Could this be that Rush is not going to play Chicago at all???
Mr. Big is doing a show by themselves????
Oh God this cannot be!

I believe there's a Ghost of a Chance,
That Rush will play Chi-town

Rehi all,

	I just got a message saying that the shirts are ready (YES!).
However, it's the pentagram design...I thought the tabloid idea was
totally agreed on.  Now I realize that my CPU got virused, and was
out of action for a while, and when I came back, my mail file was
deleted *BLAH, BLAH, BLAH*, but what happened to the tabloid?  I've
already got _2_ pentagram Rush shirts.  Is there any chance that the
tabloid version will be made?

	*Ahem*....anyone in the Cleveland area interested in listening
to November 17, 1991 as much as they want? :)!!!  Lemme know!

For those who missed the dates they are:

Rushppl --

Okay, I promise this will be the last time I'll clog up the NMS screens with
  this, but I figured I'd annoy everyone once more....  I've had about a dozen
  responses to my question (What is Rush's best instrumental song?), which
  IMO isn't enough to post the results....  So... in case someone wants to
  respond to this question and hasn't yet, this is your last chance.  BTW, 
there
  have been *no* votes for "Where's My Thing?"  (that kind of suprised me).

  Once again: What is Rush's best instrumental song?
      	      responses to "greed@chopin.udel.edu"

A few more brief items:
  1. To whoever heard someone speaking in the ASOH version of "Red Sector A,"
     I could hear what sounded like a missed guitar note at 0:41 (Alex screw
     something up? Never!), but nothing at 0:53... you must be hearing things.
  2. I seem to be one among many that missed the T-Shirt thing, or at least
     the post-planning stuff... (can someone email me info, pleez?)
  3. There will be no three.

Subject: Red Sector A on ASoH

In the NMS #474 Chris Kirkham mentioned hearing somethi like "I Scream"
in Red Sector A on ASoH at :41 and :53.

I listened carefully for something at those points and did hear something,
but couldn't make out what it said.  So I took the CD to work and recorded
that part on 8-track tape.  Then I removed as much of the instrumentation
as possible and boosted the appropriate frequencies and there it was!
On track 6 you could distinctly hear Neil say "Get a Life!".

Oddly enough, when I played the same passages backwards it sounded like
James Earl Jones saying "Neil has cancer, man.  Miss him, miss him, miss him."

Seriously, Chris, I think it is just Alex's guitar with delay.  At least I'm
pretty sure it's an instrument.

Subject: The Trees revisited

In NMS 474, cwg@acpub.duke.edu says it's "fairly obvious he supports the
Maples."  I must disagree.

I understood the song to be a reiteration of the basic Objectivist
storyline.  The Oaks represent strength and ability.  If you are familiar
with Ayn Rand's fiction, these would be the John Galt's or Howard Roark's.
The Maples, on the other hand, seem to represent Rand-type villians.  The
ideas of the Maples are described by Rand as "hatred of the good for being
the good."  They really have no desire to acheive greatness, however they
do desire to bring the Oaks down to their level.  They don't care to
acheive, only to destroy.  I do think you are correct that the Maple
represents Canada in some light, particularly the socialist aspects of
the Canadian government.  "Hatchet, axe and saw" represent laws passed
that hinder those of ability and attempt to "bring them down."  If you
read *Atlas Shrugged* or *The Fountainhead*, I think you will see a
similarity.

A separate note:  is alt.music.rush still out there?  It showed up for
one day with about 7 articles in it.  The next day, it was reported as
a bogus newsgroup.  Is it still around?  (I have a funny newsfeed that
has to go to Sweden and back, so that may be the problem.)

Subject: Pittsburgh Tickets, The Trees

Howdy, folks!  For all of you anxiously awaiting Rush here in Pittsburgh, as
of 10:30 this morning (Tuesday, 4/28), no date for when tickets go on sale
has been announced.  Rush _is_ coming to Pittsburgh on June 21st, though.
I think a NMS-member pre-show tailgate would be a great idea.  All we need
is someone to make a big TNMS sign or something so we can all get together.
Any volunteers?
	I've been following the debate on The Trees lyrics, and one
interpretation hasn't been mentioned yet -- I've always thought that the
meaning to "and the trees are all kept equal by hatchet, axe, and saw" meant
that man came along and chopped them all down anyway, so in the end it didn't
matter if the maples got their sun or not.  What they should have done was
unite to protect themselves, instead of arguing among themselves and getting
killed as a result.  Just my random thoughts....
	Later!

        There was a question about the lyrics to Didacts and Narpets in issue
# 474 (isn`t there always a question about DaN ?). Anyway, a while back I heard
an interview with one of the Boyz and they were asked about the lyrics. They
were unable to recall what all of the lyrics were, but they did announce that
it was some where along the lines of the strife between elders and youth 
(DAddicts and Parents, as mentioned in a past NMS issue). Lyrics like 
"Earn  ...Give!"
and "Learn  ...Live!", Elders proclamations and youth`s responses. Someday I`m
going to put that song on reel-to-reel and play it at half speed! Maybe then
I`ll know ....

Subject: Rush song parodies

As an avid collector of song parodies, I would be very interested in two
things:

1.  If you've got a copy of "Wayne's World Man" on tape, and could send me
one, I'd be forever in your debt.

2.  If you've heard any other parodies of Rush songs done by radio
stations or whatever, send me the name of the parody and where it was
played and I'll compile them, and post them when I'm done.

By the way, my local radio station, KISW, 99.9 FM Seattle, does HUGE
quantities of song parodies.  I've got 72 of them on tape so far, and know
of about 30 more.  Too bad they don't have anyone who can imitate Geddy!

Just to clear this whole thing up - can someone, anyone, post the
exact address of where to send requests for the TNMS T-shirt?

After reading this stuff going on about The Trees, I thought I'd just
post my (humble) interpretation.  I always thought it could be looked
at as an allusion to the French Revolution.  The stuff about "and
they wonder why the Maples can't be happy in their shade" sort of
fit with the "There's no bread, let them eat cake".  The end of song
suggests the conflict ended with violence ("hatchet axe and saw")
which sort of fits with the beheading of Louis XIV (I think it was
XIV).  Again, IMHO.  Flame away...

Just another question - are any of you out there also Red Rider (Tom
Cochrane & Red Rider) fans?  Would you know of any/where to get Red
Rider boots?  Thx!

The people to talk to about various bookings for RUSH would most likely be
their management company, since they actually handle booking the dates.
Their number is accessible through Toronto information, and if you have
the few bucks for the international call, then the name (accessible
on any of the album, cassete, or CD sleeves) is Ray Danniels, SRO
Management.

Because I am poor and don't have the bucks for the call, if someone
actually could mail me any information on any shows in the Chicago-
Indianapolis-St. Louis area (Alpine Valley as well), Memphis, or
even within a couple hours of Gainesville, FL, as soon as they
find out about them, I would be much appreciative.

Geddy Lee. If you can check it out, It makes sense what i read. If you
know anyone who is Yiddish you would know that the pronounciation of Gary
Levy could be mistaken as Geddy Lee.  Thank you

[ Doubtful, this has been checked several different ways.  If you can provide
  proof (page and paragraph #) then we'll change it.  His real name is "Gary
  Lee Weinrib"; that's where "Geddy Lee" comes from.  As always, corrections
  that are verifiable are welcome; send them to Dan Delany, the Keeper Of The
  FAQL.                                                            :rush-mgr ]

Hey all.  Just a quick thought-

Besides being a money making deal for the record company, what were the other
reasons for producing Archives?
