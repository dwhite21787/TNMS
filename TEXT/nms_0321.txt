I just have a couple of things to say today, both kind of gripes.

First, I think we've all seen enough transcriptions of telephone
conversations with DJ's.  From now on, when I see a post with that
in it, I'll zap the whole post.  If I'm in a good mood, I'll send
mail explaining why.  Consider yourself warned.

Second, please limit the size of your .signature files.  A few lines
is ok, but when they get over 5 lines or so, they tend to get to be
just a bit too much.  I'm pumping out 20K-30K of stuff each day; every
little bit to conserve helps, folks.  From now on, if I see one that's
too long, I'll edit it down as I see fit.  I'll leave pertinent info
in (name, address), but I'll trim extra stuff.  Also, please try not
to have lines &gt; 80 chars in your .sig.

Thank you for your support.  Now, on with the show ...

Unfortunately, no new Rush has been played on the radio here in Huntsville,
Alabama.  Last week I called the city's only rock station, WTAK-AM 1000, and
asked them if they had the new single.  The DJ had no clue that a new album
was coming out, and of course had no idea when they would get the single.
Someone else here called the same DJ late last week, and this time the DJ said
that he knew a new single was coming out, but still had no idea when the
station would get it.  I would try asking a different DJ, but the one I
talked to seems to be the most knowledgable of all the station's DJs.  (There
aren't very many of them, since the station is not allowed to broadcast at
night.)  So, it looks as though we may have to wait until the album is
released to hear any new Rush.

  Well, after all it is the boys home country! The Rock'n'roll station
here in Montreal got the single today in the afternoon, and premiered
it at 6:09. To my knowledge they only got the single. Someone I know
at the station was surprised that stations in the US got the album
earlier. It seems it happened to another Canadian, Aldo Nova, for his
latest album. It's great for all you guys who got to hear a few songs
from the album already, but still I find it strange.
  Anyway, about the single, I like it, and I can't wait to hear all
the album.

Subject: BAY AREA HAS DREAMLINE ON KOME!!!!

Hello all!

YES! FINALLY! Dreamline is now out in the Bay Area! I just heard it on
KOME and am now in my 10th or 11th repeat! So far it appears that
KOME is the only station able to play it in the Bay Area! (according
to KOME!)

Anyway- my own quick observations:

This song really rocks! I had already memorized the lyrics and was looking
for something a little more like the song Presto. But I like it! It is
not a very complicated melody like SDT was like when I first heard it.

It seems that the quick picking by Alex during Geddy's singing is a metaphor
for a ticking clock...

Also- did anyone ever notice the opening is the recording of a seashore?

The DJ on KOME said the cover has a bunch on wishbones floating over a
seascape. This conflicts with the cover of a boy kicking a skull. What
he could have been referring to was picture that appears inside the
album.

So there's my quick announcments and observations!

Gotta rewind my tape!

Subject: I heard it on Z-Rock...

Good day (and welcome to day 22):

O.k. -- the folks on Z-rock just played "Dreamline".  I wanted to
mention it because there may be a bunch of you out there who can get
Z-rock.  If your local radio station isn't playing it, you may hear it
on Z-rock.  If nothing else, it'll give you another option of where to
hear it.

That was the good news.

The bad news is that I don't think the local station here has it yet.
So far, I've called practically every DJ.  Guess I'll have to keep
bugging them.

For those of you who are upset ("upset?  UPSET?  No, I'm not UPSET!!
It's FINE with ME if I never hear the album!!  What do I care?!!!  I'm
NOT UPSET!!!") for not having heard anything yet, I actually envy you.
I've heard one song, but I know that the album won't get here for
another 4 weeks.  The shipment will take FOREVER!!  (no, this is not a
"pity me" statement.  I'm trying to make you guys feel better (!))  So
actually, you'll get the album before I do -- jealous, jealous.

But I have to say, that this has  been the most agonizing week in my
life after getting back onto the net and realizing that the album was
supposed to be "out" by August 22 (ha! yeah, sure.  Right.  Uh-huh...)
-- I feel like I've been pregnant since December -- I guess, in a
way, we've *all* been pregnant since December.  I wonder how the Boyz
would feel if they knew that their fans were driving DJ's up the wall
just to hear their new album.  Only Rush fans...

Ahhhh!  A new Rush album.   NIRVANA!!!!!

Waiting in agony for Sept. 3... or 30th!

Yeah!!!  I've finally heard it!  Thanks to vinnie@darkside.com you
already knew it was released on KOME.  The announcer mentioned that
KOME was the only station in the area to have it.  And, that Dreamline
was the only song available to them.  I want more - Where's my thing!

A quick comment about Dreamline.  This is the lowest (tone) that I
have ever heard Geddy sing.  It's alright, but a little strange.  I'm
more used to "WE ARE THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLES OF SYRINX."  A friend
made a blasphemous comment when he heard Geddy's voice on the song...
"Is this Billy Idol?"  Arghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First off, thank you, Frank for allowing us to ask questions to Geddy.
I missed all the stuff concerning your interview with Geddy (except
the fall-out of the face-to-face interview.  Bummer.), so I apologize
if I sound a little out of it.  And on to the question!

[I don't know if this would be a moot question or not...]

Could you ask him if they plan to tour Hawaii, Japan, and Australia?
They have fans out here!!!  And if they don't plan to, why won't
they?  Or will they at leat consider it?  And if they *do*, when are
they coming?

Well, I downlowded dreamline and listened...yep, it was RUSH. Now, I can load
you up with all my opinions about it, but why in the world would anyone care
what my opinions are when they can come to their own conclusions when they hear
it?

Plus, amidst all the fury, I think I'll just sit back and wait for the album to
be released, so I can buy one and listen at my leisure.  I'm not sure if they're
playing it on the radio here, as I don't often listen to radio.  I DO know that
the songs will sound the same when the album's released as they sound now.

Really, all this RUSHing around trying to hear songs a few days early!  That
same kind of attitude has caused more than a few car crashes.  All things come
to those who wait.

Learn patience.  Live longer.

Subject: Dreamline Premiers in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Area

Unbelievable.

On August 21, 1991, at 3:32 p.m., Dreamline premiered in the
Dallas/Ft. Worth area on KTXQ 102.1.

The DJ announced that new Rush was "coming up next", and then tortured
us with 5 minutes of commercials.  When the commercials ended, he said
the new album would be out in about 2 weeks, and then began rambling
on about how the term "Roll the Bones" came from medievil times (blah,
blah).  He also gave credit to Rush fans in the Dallas area for
being so informed and excited about the new album (I've been calling
him every day for the past few weeks, apparently others have been
too).  Finally, he played it.

Needless to say, I enjoyed it immensely.

When it was over, I called the station.  The conversation went
something like this:

"Hello, Q102."

"Hey, you finally got the new Rush.  It was awesome."

"Yea, it sounded pretty good, huh?"

"I loved it.  What took you guys so long to get it?  Other stations
around the country have been playing it for quite some time."

"That's not exactly true."

"Yes, it is.  A station in Providence was even playing it illegally
for a while."

"Providence isn't exactly the whole country."

"No, but many other stations all over the country have been playing
Dreamline and other songs off the album for over a week."

I then went on to tell him about the NMS and how I was getting my
information.  I think this kind of pissed him off, as he sort of
lost interest in the conversation.  When I asked him if he had the
whole album or just the single, he said "Just the Dreamline one."
He then assured me that he would be "playing the hell out of it" in
the coming days.  So, those of you in the D/FW area, keep your radio
tuned to Q102 (if you can stand all the crap they play), Dreamline is
finally here!

Speaking of NMS readers in the D/FW area, how many of us are there?
Anyone that lives in the Q102 listening area, drop me a note.

It seems everyone out there has heard at least one track off the RTB album,
except for myself.  Personally, I'll be content to wait for the album to be
released.  I'm anxious, that's for sure!

What I was wondering is what a tangent from an earlier post.  Does anyone
know if Rush plans to release any videos to support the album, like they
did with some of the songs from Presto?

I was absent for awhile, and I never heard any feedback about an acoustic
set of Rush material (ala Tesla's Five Man Acoustical Jam sets in clubs).
I think it would be fantastic to see Rush change their stage a little bit,
and make their show longer, including such a set.  But then, that's just
me. %-)

        Last night (8/22), 96.9 WOUR (Utica, NY) had dreamline on "love it

Not bad and of course I totally agree!
