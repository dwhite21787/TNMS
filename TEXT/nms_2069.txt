First does anyone know who's dog is pictured on the t4e "dog years" page.
also on the begining and end on the limelight video there is a dog running
around,
was this a band members dog?,and are the 2 dogs the same animal.
I think they are both german shepards.

Lists seem to be the thing here so here's mine;
Top 5 tracks.(in no real order)
Test for Echo.
The Big Money.
New World Man.
Bastille Day.
The Trees.

Fav Rush cd.......Power Windows,their best,not one bum track on it.
Least liked cds.....Grace Under Pressure/Roll The Bones....both are pretty
weak.

Best Rush video......Lock & Key.....great stuff!!!!

Fav cd cover.......T4E......fantastic front and back,just shows simple can be
best.

Subject: live release, "go geddy" and thanks

hello all,

    just wanted to put in a few words about the new live release.  i'm
excited about 3 discs ... (anyone guess at a price tag:  $30 - $40
maybe?)

    the aftk show will be cool and don't get me wrong - i love all rush,
but i think a show from the hemispheres tour would be a true "thank you
to the fans", or at least to me.  it's mine (and if i recall correctly)
the most popular album among fans from an nms poll.  of course there are
songs of aftk that i'd love to hear on a well mixed live recording, but
i think more on hemispheres.  i guess i just wanna hear the title track
live,  and circumstances and a different la villa and the trees. ;)

yyz note:
   i'm sure some of you noticed the guy yelling "go geddy" on the esl
version of yyz - right at the pause before the first quick ascending
scale in the beginning.  well, my friend since junior high and i who
have seen rush tons *always* yell the same thing together each time we
see them play.  it's like part of the song,  i actually consider them
the lyrics.  anyway, people always look at us sideways ....

side note:
    last year i posted that my wal bas was stolen at a gig in nyc.  i
got a bunch of kind email from good folks on this list - just wanted to
say thanks  -  and i was able to get a replacement made.

Subject: 4-17-90?

Can someone help me identify a tape? I have a copy of a Presto show
labeled 4-17-90, and all I know is that it comes from somewhere in
California. At one point Geddy says "It's nice to be back here in this
part of California". I had a look at the Tour Dates Listing on the TNMS
webpage (good to see it's back up and running- Rush lawyers...eat me)
but there is no listing between April 8 and April 20. Does this mean the
band took some time off or are we just missing these dates? I was hoping
this mystery would be solved since the list was just updated, but no
luck. Perhaps one of you were at a Presto show on this date and can help
me find out where it is from.

   [ There was a break between April 8th & 19th, Rush didn't play any 
     shows. I was at most of the CA shows for Presto (missed Sacramento &
     Oakland), if I had to guess I'd say it was the first night in Oakland.

Subject: Hammersmith '78 Show 

Greetings to all Rushians from Russia!

	If the rumors about Disc 3 from the upcoming live set pan out, we're in
for some great music. As it turns out, I have a tape from the first of
two nights Rush played at the Hammersmith Odeon (now the Apollo Theatre)
in London on February 19-20, 1978. The setlist is standard for that tour
(the Drive 'Till You Die Tour) and many of us are already familiar with
it. But for the benefit of those who are not, here it is:

Intro 
Bastille Day
Lakeside Park
By-Tor & The Snow Dog -->
Xanadu
A Farewell To Kings
Something for Nothing
Cygnus X-1
Anthem
Closer To The Heart
2112
i. Overture
ii. Temples of Syrinx
iii. Discovery
iv. Presentation
v. Soliloquy
vi. Grand Finale
Encore 1: Working Man-->
	Fly By Night-->
	In The Mood-->
	Drum Solo
Encore 2: Cinderella Man

	The quality which best defines this show is a high level of energy and
interaction between the band and the crowd. The set is punctuated at
many points by what I'll call the Patented U.K. Roar. Those who have
heard live tapes from the U.K. will recognize this sound. U.K. crowds
tend to be quiet during the quiet parts (e.g. the intro to AFTK) and
roar their approval in unison in response to a particularly dynamic
passage (right after the intro to AFTK). Have a listen to Jacob's Ladder
on ESL for a sense of what I mean (right after Geddy sings "Light
streams down in bright unbroken beams"). 
	This show was during Rush's second tour of the U.K., and second
appearance at Hammersmith (opening band was Tyla Gang). Rush at this
point was a clear favorite in London, and it's not surprising why after
listening to this show. For those lucky enough to have a copy of Brian
Harrigan's biography of Rush (now out of print), he speaks of how
popular the band had become in the U.K. during the '77-'78 period and
how this period marked a turning point in their careers. Word of the
band's popularity in the U.K. got back to North America, which led to
bigger and better gigs later that year, which led to etc. etc.
	Neil is all over this recording. His drum fills in songs like Lakeside
Park and overall attack really set the tone for this show. That's not to
take away from Ged or Alex, though. Lerxst shines on AFTK, especially
during the odd-meter solo. 2112 is a keeper too. Interestingly, Alex
performs Discovery on this tour and right at the beginning slips in the
five-note theme from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The only other
time I've heard this done was by Jerry Garcia during the Space segment
of a Grateful Dead show the previous month. Close Encounters must have
just been released.
	The music gets progressively louder and more intense as the show
continues, ending in a wild Grand Finale. The encore medley picks up
right where 2112 left off, and ends with a titanic Neil solo. The
Cinderella Man encore is merely icing on the cake at this point. The
crowd approval rating is an 11 on a scale of 1-10 (oblique Spinal Tap
reference folks). I may be partial to shows from this period, but there
is absolutely no doubt why the band selected this show for our Fall
listening pleasure. 
	A final thought: I wonder if Disc 3 will be an entire set from either
of the two nights at Hammersmith or whether it will be culled from both
nights. I don't see why they would need to split the set among the two
nights but we all know how the band tend to be perfectionists in their
choice of live material.

Subject: Tribute.

Evening Rushfaces-

Sorry to hear about Neil's wife-truly Neil's inspiring "show must go on" 
philosophy is going to be tested now. I certainly would not hold it against 
him if he decided that it was time for Rush to pack it in...they have given 
us ten times as much as enough, and they deserve to enjoy the rest of their 
lives knowing that they made an impact of the right kind.
	Rush has filled-and still continues to fill-a special niche. Their 
fan base is as devoted as ever: we joyfully never outgrew their music, even 
into our 30's and 40's. 
	Like a very small handful of artists, I never heard Rush's music in a 
beer (Genesis), cola (Van Halen), or working class bankrupting credit card 
(Paul McCartney) advertisement. 
	And they rightfully-from the beginning-never catered to the wishes 
of selfish bottom-line record executives. Nobody in this industry (I mean 
NOBODY) would have the balls to release a 2112 after the minimal commercial 
success of a Caress Of Steel. Then, at the other end, at the peak of their 
popularity, they had the steel balls to release a Signals after a Moving 
Pictures. The only band that I can think of that even comes near (i.e. within 
the same universe) that kind of integrity is Pearl Jam.
	What has kept Rush going is willingness to change, sufficient maturity 
to avoid stupid infighting, and the strength to avoid commercial catering. 
Rush could be like Genesis-writing a song specifically for a ($$$) Michelob 
commercial. Rush could be like Pink Floyd-releasing complete GARBAGE as an 
excuse to ($$$) tour. Rush could be like Aerosmith-new songs never failing to 
include plenty of T & A in the latest ($$$) video.   But they don't, and we 
the fans appreciate that more than they'll ever know. Who cares if they don't 
always reach the masses-the masses are asses anyhow.
	Now for the real point-their music is, well, I can't think of a word. 
"Awesome" is just too weak. Who out there reading this truly has a favorite 
Rush song? Is "2112" really head and shoulders (I sold out to Procter & Gamble 
;-) ) above the rest? Is the guitar solo in "La Villa Strangiato" really that 
much better than any other one? That is, to me, a sign of a REALLY great band: 
not even their most devoted fans can pick a favorite. At one time, all of 
these, for me: 2112. La Villa Strangiato. Subdivisions.   Turn The Page. 
Driven. Natural Science. The Camera Eye. Distant Early Warning. Between The 
Wheels. Xanadu. Bravado. Animate. Cygnus X-1 (Book I or II). 
	Unlike Hendrix or Led Zeppelin, nobody could really put together any 
kind of Rush tribute album worth listening to. This is very simply because 
NOBODY DOES IT BETTER. 
	I always look forward to new studio material from Rush, but I am 
more than ecstatic over the products that they have given me. To think it 
only costs about 12 bucks for a Rush CD. A hundred wouldn't be too much for 
me. You all understand what I'm saying, right? How many times have all of 
you played Signals or Power Windows? Do you agree that you got your money's 
worth, and then some, and then some, and then some?
	And the forthcoming live set would be a more than fitting close to 
an inspiring success story. Two discs documenting two great tours, and a 
third demonstrating how they were many years ago, for those of us who were 
unfortunate enough not to be enlightened at the time. A nice thank you from 
an institution that owes us less than nothing.
	Understand, I am not trying to suggest that they call it a career, 
only that I would have no regrets if they did. They have all the respect in 
this circle, and that is indeed what matters. There is NOTHING WRONG with 
being a Rush fanatic, people, no matter what they say, and don't none of 
y'all forget it.
	Neil, Alex, and Geddy, if you're listening, thanks.

Actually, the last vinyl release I can account for was for Show of Hands...but
even then CDs were massively outsupplying the LPs.  I don't recall any LP
versions of Presto, and there definitely weren't any RTB on vinyl, but Hold
Your Fire and Show of Hands were positively produced in LP format.

Hi all.  I'm taking a History of Rock class this summer and I'm doing my
final project on Rush of course.  Anyway, I'm hoping you guys can help me
gather a few things I'd like to use for the presentation.  Below I will
list what I am looking for, but first just let me set up the guidlines so
to speak.  I will reimburse the cost of buying blank audio and/or
videocassettes and shipping costs to get it to me.  I'm not looking to buy
the actual CD or video but if you are selling we might be able to discuss
price.  All the things I am looking for are boots since naturally my
collection of official releases is more or less complete.  Thanks ahead of
time for all those that can help!  I'm not nessacarily looking to get all
of these, but the more the better.  And one question, can anyone tell me
if Neil's solo on the Mirrors double CD live boot is edited?  

Video:  *preferably professionaly shot w/ sound feeds if they exist*
	From the ESL video YYZ.
	From the ESL video Broon's Bane/The Tree/Xanadu
	From RTB tour Where's My Thing w/ intro.  
	From CP Animate and Double Agent
	2001 & TFE intros for each set with Dreamline and TFE
		(2001 intro can be from CP)
	From TFE Red Sector A (i'm looking for good quality shots of the
		laser work)
	Music Video version of RTB
	Closer to The Heart from CP, specificallly any show where Alex
		introduces Geddy, Neil and himself as other celebrities.
	Neil's Solo from TFE (uncut)

Audio:  *preferably all sound board recordings*
	From the TFE tour Driven (from the June 30 Toronto show if at all
	possible, I'm not crossing my fingers.)
	From CP Cold Fire w/ C&W intro.	
	Closer to The Heart from CP, specificallly any show where Alex
                introduces Geddy, Neil and himself as other celebrities.
	Neil's Solo from TFE (uncut)

   [ I normally don't let such posts in to the NMS, but it *is* for a class...
     ;-)                                                          : rush-mgr ]

Not to much to ask for is it? ;-)  If anyone can help I'd greatly
appreciate it.  Thanks guys.

Yes, Maclean's did a story on Rush in the late 1970's (I still have a
copy of this issue).  However, the article had  nothing to do with John
Rutsey, but rather Rush's tremendous international success.

Between Sun and Moon has good music, but I still don;t like the Chorus.

Subject: A Passage to Toronto...

     I thought I would throw this out there: October 16 - 19 of this year 
     my wife & I will be in Toronto (for the first time). I really can't 
     wait. We are going to be running in the Canadian International 
     Marathon on behalf of the Leukemia Society of America (Minneapolis 
     chapter). So, in addition to seeing the sights (Rush related & the 
     others), we are going to be physically working our butts off. Here's 
     my pitch: because we're running for leukemia research, we are asking 
     people for donations to the cause. If anyone out there in TNMS land 
     would like to donate (or simply would like more information), please 
     e-mail me. Also, if anyone knows people with leukemia (or other forms 
     of cancer) & would like us to run in their honor, let me know. Please, 
     I'm not trying to offend anyone here. If you don't want to have 
     anything to do with this, that's fine. But, if anyone out there would 
     like to help out a truly worthwhile cause, don't hesitate. Thanks a 
     million.

Subject: Stretching for Rush Relation...

     This Rush content might be a bit of a stretch, but I saw former Living 
     Colour singer Corey Glover last week in concert. I won't bore you with 
     the details, but he put on an absolutely FANTASTIC show. He is very 
     funny, too. He played a couple of Living Colour tunes, but his new 
     solo ones rip. I remember reading that Living Colour were able to meet 
     Rush backstage after a show in the 1980s (remember then?). Either 
     Corey or Vernon said something like, "It's nice to see a band make it 
     on their own terms" to a member of Rush. See, I told you it was a 
     stretch. I really wanted to tell you to please go see Corey Glover if 
     he is playing your town.
     
     Chad
     
     P.S. After the show, he was personally selling tapes of his live 
     performance at NYC's CBGBs. He was signing them & talking to fans. It 
     was really nice. Wouldn't it be cool if Rush did this? Just a thought.

heard about the news this morning (july 6). Once again our hearts, thoughts,
and prayers go out to this man who has touched us with his words and music.
On a personal note, can we please not bring up the "to pray for or not to
pray for" thread again. Just a thought.....

Subject: re: Counterparts Tour version of Hemispheres

On the 7/1/98, NMS #2064 posting, "Timmy and Debbie" posted something to the 
effect that the Hemispheres version was longer than prelude at the Dallas 
Counterparts show.  "Timmy and Debbie" also added that it possibly was 
longer also at Madison Square Garden.

I happen to have both of these shows on video, and for both shows, the ONLY 
part of "Hemispheres, Book II" that was played was "I. Prelude."

Just wanted to set the record straight.

Random musings on other recent threads:

1) "Freewill" has one of the most incredible guitar solos ever recorded.

2) "I think I'm going bald" is one kick-ass tune.

3) Kid Gloves, Subdivisions, and the ASOH version of "Big Money" have really 
cool endings.

4) long time Rush listener (since '85), and I'm sick of "Top 10 worst Rush 
whatever" threads

thank you very much!!

Hello all,
     I just heard the bad news and the admin. note and I not help but wonder
what occurs in some peoples minds. I do not feel TNMS is responsible for
informing me of any late breaking news, be it good or bad. I can't imagine
being upset with anyone who provides us with a place to learn and express our
ideas concerning Rush.
     We choose to subscribe to TNMS, we choose to post our feelings toTNMS.
They do not owe us anything, we should be thankful for that privilage and most
of all we should have respect for anyone who is feeling saddness during this
second coming of bad news. I am very dissapointed in the lack of feelings some
people show in the face of someone elses pain. I sincerely hope everyone will
be careful in how they react to delicate situations like this and do not
create actions that add to the hurt anyone involved might feel. Please think!!
I can't imagine what I would say to Neil, so I will keep to myself and in my
heart I will only hold well wishes for him.

                                                 Sincerely,
                                                           Jim

Subject: Rush Sighting in "Small Soldiers" promo

Hey all,

I don't know if this has been mentioned already, but I saw
a commercial for "Small Soldiers" on tv the other day. It's
kind of a "Roger Rabbit" meets "Toy Story" film. Anyhow, 
during the clips you hear a few bars of "Tom Sawyer." Small
potatoes, sure, but Rush getting commercial exposure is somewhat
notable. :)

Hi fellow Rushians,
	I'm sure that most of you read the John Rutsey interview. That was
pretty funny and stupid. I doubt that it was a real interview. If it was
real, then where does Rutsey get the guts to say that he was Neil
Peart's drum teacher. I don't think so! Peart is way better than Rutsey
will ever be. Rutsey isn't even a talented drummer.
	Rutsey says stuff like all the album titles are directly related to him
and he says that he wrote Before & After and Here Again. The notes in
the 1st album said that not a single song was written by Rutsey. They
were all written by Lifeson and Lee. John Rustey is full of
S.H.I.T.!!!!!!!!

Subject: How much more grief? How did us Non-US NMS'ers get into Rush? 

Jeeeeeeeeeeeezus,

How much more shit is Neil going to have to take? I can't believe that fate
has dealt him such a harsh hand. The deck was definitely loaded. Are we
going to have a messages page for Neil again? I always wondered whether he
actually received those we sent in for Selena, some of them were so moving.
It's hard to know whether it's a good idea or not. There's a very thin line
between sympathy and platitude.

I am sure there will be plenty of posts in this digest on the same subject
so I'll vary the tempo by answering a few other threads too.

How did I get into Rush.

Well, believe it or not Rush were BIG news in the UK in 1980-81. I was at
school, aged about 15 and my woodwork teacher let us bring tapes into
school in the last week of term. My friend Rob and I brought in a big
BoomBox and we were playing Genesis which our Teacher really liked. He
confiscated all the other kids' tapes and then gave us one to put in the
machine...................Hemispheres! We only had time to get to 'The
universe divided' but I was hooked.

I bought 2112 and drove my friends mad with it but it wasn't until the end
of the summer term in 1980 when we had a tape day again when someone
brought in Permanent Waves. Remember we were all 15 year old school kids
but the music we were all into was kind of cool in retrospect. If a 15 year
old kid brought Permanent Waves (or even TFE or CP) into school these days
he would probably get tarred and feathered!!!!!!!!

Anyway, I was blown away by Permanent Waves and set about getting my Dad to
buy me all their albums (guilt money after my parents split)! I still have
a complete vinyl collection and have seen Rush 16 times. 9 times in the UK
and 7 times in the US on TFE.

I still look back fondly on 1980, 1981 and 1982 when Rush were front cover
material for the music papers in the UK. It should be noted that in 1992
for Roll the Bones (The last European Tour) the boys could still sell out
multiple nights at 10,000+ seater arenas with little advertising.

I kind of hope that they tour Europe again and bring over a stripped down
show to some of the smaller venues. 

Finally, Lerxst solos.

In my mind Al is the most tasteful versatile guitarist on the face of this
planet. Sure there are better technicians (John Petrucci blows me away) but
Alex always plays the RIGHT notes. I have only ever got pissed at him once.
The Rolling Stones pastiche on Counterparts just sucks BUT the rest of the
CD Kicks such serious ass that it takes my breath away.

Anyway, Best solos have to be in order of age: -

Anthem
Lakeside Park
Soliloquy
Cygnus X1
Absolutely everything on Hemispheres
Natural Science
Limelight / Camera Eye
Subdivisions / Digital Man
BETWEEN THE WHEELS!!!!! / KID GLOVES (he was cooking on GUP)
Marathon / Middletown Dreams
Open Secrets
Available Light
Ghost of a Chance
Counterparts in general
TFE

Sorry about the long list but I just LOVE Alex Lifeson's guitar
playing!!!!!

Farewell from the UK!!!

Alright you "mightier than thou" RUSH fans who say there is no skippable

just "because they put it on there", tell us "certain parts of these
songs are good, beautiful, etc. because........" or "listen to the way

That would make this newsletter awesome.

Subject: Re: Top 10 Skipable Rush Songs:

Wow! What a topic. I laughed, I cried, but most of all, I was very intrigued. I
have occasionally voiced my least favorite Rush songs while in a "chat room" 
on the IRC. Some disagreed, some agreed, one or two got bent, but pretty much 
everybody else didn't give a poop.
I have been a fan since 1983 (between exit stage left and signals). I prefer the
new stuff, but pretty much love it all, but I'd like to put my $.02 (US) in - I
don't know what that translates to in Canadian dollars, eh.
Please remember this is an opinion and not a personal attack on you, your 
loves, or your belief system.
I have to start by saying that while many songs on the first album rock, I dont
consider it eligible. I didn't get into rock music until I was 15 because so 
many
of the lyrics in rock music were lame (IMO) and the bands with good lyrics Pink
Floyd, Led Zepplin, Jethro Tull and the like just didn't appeal to me. The first
Rush album is no exception lyric wise - who can argue with "hey baby it's a
quarter-to-eight and I feel I'm in the mood..." as deep lyrics to anyone but the
horny. But, I still break out the first album sometimes when I'm just in the 
mood to rock.
So, here's my list of my 10 least favorite Rush songs:

Lessons - Nice try Alex - now stop.
Chemistry - I don't know why I dont like it - I think for me the music and 
lyrics crash.
Tai Shan - Couldn't neil have enclosed some of his pictures of his vacation to
China in the CD instead?
Bravado - Somebody felw to close to the sun that day.
Heresy - What ever happened to political songs like 2112 and beneath, between, 
and behind?
Speed of Love - Speed of Skip
Dog Years - What the hell? Who really wrote this song?

Hmm, I can only come up with 7...

Subject: Idea for NMS #2112

Many of us have been waiting for the big NMS #2112 with the hopes of
getting our names on it. All of us who subscribe to the NMS have
obviously responded to the guys work in some way in that it is important
enough to us to discuss it or read about how it has affected our lives.
I say we dedicate #2112 strictly to stories of how our favourite trio
has impacted our lives in some way. At this very point in time, I don't
think Neil really cares one way or the other. But a couple weeks from
now, he may just be interested to see what all of us have to say about
the little things he has done for us. Also, it would be a great way for
us to pay tribute to Neil and the band, and a chance for the rush mgr to
be a litle selective in what is posted for this special issue. I can say
myself that Neil has made an impression on me as far as not just simply
being a great drummer, but by being a master of discipline and someone
who has spent a lifetime of trying to constantly improve himself in all
facets of his life, not just his abilities as a drummer.  Believe me,
Neil and the rest of the guys know that they have impacted lives, but
out there there may be just that one little story that may touch them in
a way they haven't been before. So while Neil faces the biggest
challenge of his life to date, let's do something that, although it
can't bring both the women in his life back, it can at least show him
that his life hasn't been lived without a purpose. Rock on Neil. I don't
idolize you, but I have a tremendous amount of respect for you and the
way you have shown me how even the best can still get better. 

   [ Actually this sounds like a great idea! I'll put more details in the
     next digest...                                          : rush-mgr ]

Hey!

Why do some people freak out and expect the rush-mgrs and various other
sources to spend every waking moment waiting for a smidgen of Rush news
and then type it up ASAP?  Never mind if it's just a rumor, or tragic,
or not even really news, some asshole's gotta know and gotta know it
now.  Fuckin' leeches!

Yeah, sure, I want to know what's up w/ the band.  I'm even curious
about their personal lives and stuff that goes on around them.  I'm
interested in what makes them tick, but if I have to wait a couple of
days after the fact to find out that Neil lost his wife, then so be it.
Who the hell am I in the Rush kingdom?  No one, a lowly serf-fan, and
that's OK.

Frankly, I'm glad the rush-mgr(s) waited a couple of days.  It shows
respect for the family, and it shows some class.

To those who flamed the rush-mgr, think about what is REALLY owed to
you.  Not a whole hell of a lot, if you're honest.

Okay, let me put on my asbestos suit....

Ann, I agree with you on a lot of what you said, but as has been printed here 
before, we have no idea whether or not the boys will stay together -- and 
until such time as we have information from a reliable source, why think 
that they'll break up?  This is not just to stay optimistic.  What has Neil 
taught us?  Among other things, act on the facts you got.  We won't know until 
we know.  Obviously his personal life is going to take priority for awhile.

Some folks in the NMS have said that we should not talk about Selena to 
respect Neil.  No one has said that it's important for we who care about him 
to acknowledge our feelings, and that for the position that HE's put us in, 
one of those feelings is helplessness.  Even his close friends must feel this 
right now, and we all know that only Neil can come through it.  We all want 
to do whatever we can to help, and that's noble, but we can't do anything.  
That's something *we* have to deal with, and that may not be easy for us, 
especially for those of us who have been profoundly affected by his words; 
and especially for those of us who are rather good at changing things, but 
we have to do it.  

To those of you who have been flaming the rush-mgr: wake up!

Yeah.  It sucks.  Neil, I'm there with you.  Thanks for everything.
