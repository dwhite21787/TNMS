Subject: worst rush song

Finally somebody mentioned the ONLY Rush song that I will take pains
to skip on the disc player - "I Think I'm Going Bald."  Now if you
could see a picture of me, you would draw some fairly obvious
conclusions about why I so dislike that song.  However, I hated it
even when I had (more) hair.  There's just no question that it is their
absolute worst song.  The only other one close is "War Paint" from
Presto, but even that I won't skip when I play it.  Just thinking
about ITIGB gives me the willies...

One other thing:  for all of you college students who are drifting off
in class until the prof mentions something vaguely tangental to Rush,
you should think about two things.  First, that prof may be a Rush fan
too and the Rush content may be more subtle than your drifting mind
can pick up.  Second, what do you think WE'RE thinking about while we
sit and watch you guys take tests?!  You don't know how much I would
kill to take my walkman with me when I give 3 hour finals!  The problem
is that even using the phones, it would be too loud for wimpy students!
I love it when I have to turn down the radio when students come in
for office hours!

Last weekend, MTV had a special on the new Van Halen tour. It was mostly

Just a quick response to someone's question of Alex's best guitar work:
	The best ones that I can think of off the top of my head
are...the solos from Mission, The Manhattan Project, YYZ, 2112, and
everything about Xanadu and La Villa.  Also, a cool acoustic tune is
Broon's Bane (this tune, btw, even sounds good when I play it on piano).

Actually I heard Geddy say in an interview that New World Man was written
while in the studio just to fill out the album.  He thought that's why it
was so interesting that it was one of their biggest commercial successes.

Subject: Some audio hints

Fellow Rush Fans,
	The time to stop lurking is upon me as I noticed a couple of
comments concerning audio equipment/set-up which I believe I can
address:
	1).  Turntables-- A woman wrote in about the difficulty of
finding turntables now since most companies no longer manufacture them.
Pioneer makes a good belt-driven turntable for about $150.00, less if
you avoid shopping at some expensive audio dealer.  Check out the
catalogue from Crutchfield Corp. which, while not the cheapest mail-
order company, has an excellent service department and competitive
prices.  Bang & Olafson (sp?) still make very high quality turntables
but they are also very expensive.
	However, since you are in school, I would recomend going down
to the music department and seeing if they have decent equipment.  You
may be able to reserve time in a lab in order to copy your vinyl albums
(redundant, I know;-) onto cassette.  You might even find a friendly
audiophile in the department who will help you set EQ and bias to get
the best possible recording.  If that doesn't pan out try your college
radio station-- someone there might be able to help.
	2).  A gentleman recently posted about his favorite Rush
listening set-up being "between two speakers in a darkened room."  He
then went on to say that he has recently purchased a pair of big Polk
speakers.  Congratulations!  I too recently bought a pair of Polks to
replace my little bookshelf Polks.  I would caution you, however, to
read the literature that comes with the speakers regarding proper
speaker placement.  If you are sitting between them, with the speakers
facing each other, you are not allowing the stereo to create a sound-
stage.  In other words most of the stereo imaging is gone.  On the
other hand, if you have tried different configurations and found the
one you like the best, use it!  A personal listening environment is
a subjective thing, the only goal is to please yourself:-).
	By the way, as to my personal favorite way to listen to Rush--
the word "continuously" comes to mind!  Actually I also enjoy the
darkened room.  When I turn the lights down and play ESL or ASOH, I
can almost recreate the feeling of a live show--minus 10-12 thousand
fellow fans.
	I apologize for the length of this post so I will include the
obligatory first-post bio some other time.
	Back to the Books,
			Rob
P.S.  Any Rush fan/audio enthusiasts out there?  Feel free to e-mail
me privately with anything about equipment, set-up, reviews, etc.  I
have a small library of material on audio components and such.

I could not agree with you more!  They have too many awesome songs to limit
themselves to 2:10-15 a night.  I've also thought that they should form a
pool of songs from which to play on any given evening (a la the Dead).  It
would be even *more* fun for those of us who like to see them in different
cities :-)

Subject: Bravo, Mr. Collier

To Will Collier:

Thank you for a thought-provoking, well-written post on Neil, Tolkien and
The Necromancer.  I enjoyed reading what you wrote and you touched on
what I have been thinking about for a long time--since the album cover of
COS is the Necromancer and Sauron had been the Necromancer in The Hobbit,
it seems obvious to me that I'm looking at Sauron when I gaze at the
cover of COS.  To me, this is significant because I have never seen a
picture of what that evil dude looks like.  Sauron never appeared in any
of the Tolkien movies, nor have I seen an illustration of him in any LOTR
calendars that I have seen each year in book stores.  Do you know of any
pictures of Mr. Sauron out there?  I always thought he was so evil that
he was left to the readers' imaginations.

And BTW, ladies and gentlemen of the jury: why did Rush name their third
album Caress of Steel?  This is the one music/lyric question I would ask
Rush if I ever met them.  Of course, if this question is answered by
somebody in TNMS, my veracity to meet them would certainly not be
tarnished.

For those who have complained about the opening bands, here's some food
for thought--Rush used to be an opening band too.  They learned enough
when they were an opening act to give this same opportunity to other
bands once they headlined a show.

I believe Rush has some control in who opens for them.  If this
is the case, you are booing more than just that band.

My approach to the opening band is to sit back and watch.  That opening
band is where Rush used to be.  Relax and enjoy the show.  If not,
read the tourbook.

Chasing something new to believe in.

How's it going fellow Rushlings? I've been reading TNMS for a couple of years
now, but since this is a first post, here's the info: 17, male, student at
Livingston HS (thus the AOL accnt) but will have an .edu soon.  I was first
introduced to the guys 5 years ago by a friend (David Soko --had to give him
credit!) with the album MP.  At first I was amazed by the musicianship and
talent but I didn't quite catch on for a few months.  Shortly after I got
ASOH and RTB, and eventually all of em. I've seen 3 of their concerts, 1 RTB,
and 2 CP, all at the Meadowlands in NYC.  Also have about a dozen t-shirts,
many boots, all the MFSL releases, & ofcourse the bible(Visions). Instruments
played: euphonium, baritone horn, bass guitar. Other musical likes (in no
order): Prog Rock, i.e. Echolyn (check out their new album _As The World_),
Marillion/Fish, Van Der Graaf Generator, Gentle Giant, Yes, Asia, Dream
Theater, Tangerine Dream, and Pendragon. Also, I don't favor either the "new"
or "old" Rush, it just depends on what mood I'm in. Thats about it in a
nutshell.  Glad to be on here, thank you for your time :)

About the recent analysis of the lyrics to DA, shouldn't it be obvious that
the holy cross is a reference to Christianity since the song is based on the
poem _Gerontion_ by T.S Elliot in which he mentions "Christ the Tiger" ?? See
the relation ?

Anyways, on to another matter. We are discussing genocide and the holocaust
in history class and I'm gonna bring in Witch Hunt and hand out a copy of the
lyrics to everyone. Cool idea huh? I tell ya guys how it went on the next
issue. Actually this is the 3rd time I'm playing a Rush song in a class that r
elated to what we were studying.  Once we were studying the concept of free
will in English when we were reading Slaughter House Five by Vonnegut and I
brought in Free Will (duh), and once brought Circumstances to French class
because we learned the phrase "Plus ce la meme chose" heh.. The teachers
loved it, especially my English teacher (I further told her about their Ayn
Rand influences and stuff, she was impressed :))

Also, about that "Gub" thing. Could that also be the word that is used in TCE
when someone says "Hello, Good morning Guv" in the middle of the song? I
always thought it was "Guv" but it could even be "gub." Is that a
possibility, no?

I just want to take this opportunity to publicly condemn the attitude
portrayed in the Rush story I have just read. Using the wheelchair
section (even to see Rush) when you do not truly have need of it is
horribly rude, insensitive, crass, and hateful. Sorry if I sound a little
overboard, but one of the nicest people (and biggest Rush fans) that I
know happens to use a wheelchair. It seems like we are always
encountering blocked parking spaces, insanely steep staircases (with no
ramps nearby) and other obstacles.

You have good taste in music, Gopal, but as far as your manners go:

Been reading a lot of stuff on here on other bands people like, and
all that kinda stuff.  Figured I'd suggest a band named
'echolyn'.  They have a new album out entitled 'as the world'.  I
think it'd be very accessible to Rush fans.

They are fast approaching the mighty Rush as my favorite band.  Seen
them 8 times, Seen rush 10.  Check them out live if you get the
chance.

Definitely worth the money for the disc, and if you like Rush, odds
are you'd like echolyn.

Hell, dare I say that IMO, this disc is better than most of Rush's
stuff.  (with the exception of Hemispheres, PeW, MP, Signals, and HYF)

Subject: red barchetta

True story:

I live in a rural area of upstate NY with lots of what I call "Red
Barchetta" roads - a lane and a half wide, no markings, no cops etc..
While taking a ride into the Adirondack foothills yesterday (clear
skies, cool etc.) I happened to have "Red Barchetta" on the tape deck.
As I turned onto a particular favorite stretch of road, the middle
section was on (heaven so far).  After the guitar solo, I noticed that
there was a big old pickup truck coming up on me from behind.  Given
what was playing on the tape deck, there was just no way I was going
to let it pass me.  So I sped up to about 70 or so.  Just as Geddy is
getting to the "desperate plan," I realized that I was just coming to
a very sharp turn in the road that I love to take as fast as my old
85 Lynx can handle.  Sure enough, while it wasn't a "one lane bridge"
I took it much faster than I should have, and *much* faster than the
big pickup could and wound up leaving it in the dust (at least for
awhile!).  Can't beat that for a nice afternoon's drive...

YKYARFW... you not only air drum to Red Barchetta, but after the
verse ending with "his dearest dream," you flip an imaginary drumstick
in the air and catch it on the beat as Neil does in the ESL video.

Another thought... the Boyz have never (to my knowledge) done any covers
of other bands' material in concert.  Perhaps we can start a list of
songs we'd like to see Rush cover live.  Here's a few to start:

"The Real Me"  (The Who)
"Fool in the Rain" (Led Zeppelin)
"No Reply at All" (Genesis)
"Hearts" (Yes)
"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding" (Elton John)

Obviously these reflect some personal musical tastes, but I'd be
interested to hear what others would like to hear.

Subject: What one of the boyz has been up to

Greetings fellow listeners and admirers of all that is Rush,
	My first post in a long while.  I've simply been lurking in the
wings.  Anyway, I just had to post when I came across this.  I think this
will clear up alot about when the next album will be out, and what the
boyz have been up to.
	I was recently poking around the SatchelSports page on the WWW
(great sports page, if you're looking for one).  Well, they posted the
opening day rosters for the replacement "baseball" teams, and being bored
I decide to poke through them and see what aging baseball "stars" and
collection of never-will-be-stars, we will have the pleasure of seeing
this year at our favorite major league ball parks.  Lo and behold, listed
as an outfielder for the Toronto Blue Jays, Geddy Lee.  I almost fell out
of my chair.
	Well, this clears up what at least one of the boys has been up to
lately.  And I assume this means that the boyz aren't working on a new
album and won't be until this strike is over.  (It could be a long time
before the next album).  We always knew that Geddy wanted to be a
baseball player, and I guess his singing of "O Canada," at the all-star
game coupled with his talent was enough to get him a shot.

In 1077 Brian sez:

Anyway, I am one of those

        I certainly agree with your praise of Fish from Marillion for his
lyrics.  I'm thinking especially of Clutching at Straws, an album that
deals with a rock star's long (and ultimately futile) battle with
alcoholism, each song examining a different time in his life; the lyrics
are incredible.
        However, I'm not crazy about your avowed intolerance of others'
musical taste (or, in your opinion, lack of taste).  While I'll be the
first to support Rush as the best stuff I've ever heard, I realize that not
everyone feels the same way.  It baffles me, but I'm sure a die-hard Stones
fan is baffled by my lack of appreciation of their music.  I certainly
don't feel superior to non-Rush fans; if you do, I would suggest to you
that you just don't get it (believe it or not that was not an intentional
Rush-quote, just a happy conincidence).
        I'm sorry if all that sounds a little heavy, but the words "no
tolerance" don't sit well with me.

absolutely not!!!!!!

I was not sure if this song was pro- or anti- socialist until I went to a RUSH
concert and during the "trees were all kept equal . . . " part, they showed a
clear-cut forest.  The trees were all equal because they were all reduced to
dead little stumps.  zero equals zero.  (maybe at the concerts in Canada the
thought police forced them to replace the stumps with idyllic perfectly pruned
hedgerows)

The song is *not* about taking a little pain for the sake of equality.  It's
about what happens when a group tries to attain equality by destructive and
coercive means.  Especially when they attempts to subvert nature.  GOD made the
oaks taller than the maples and who are we to take away from the oaks what GOD
gave them in this world.

This is probably stretching the analogy, but it's something to think about:
 The maples could have occupied a different part of the forest that they would
own outright and where they would not have to compete with oaks for light.  Too
bad that doesn't jive with the modern fallacy of "unity" in all things.

Yes, but...

Why did they fade Lock & Key out?!?!?  The song was just building towards
an incredible conclusive drum-kickin' outro!

And why DIDN'T they fade Dreamline out?!?!?  Every time I hear the end of
the song I want it to repeat on "They travel on the road to adventure."  I'm
always disappointed when they do the whole chorus all over again.

Subject: Re: Alphabetical Rush

     This is to Michael Jund and any other interested parties out there.
Right around the time that tickets for the CP tour went on sale (Milwaukee
and Madison shows), one of the Milwaukee radio stations had a Rush special
on it one Sunday afternoon.  It was a Rush A-Z.  Imagine that.  Having
a radio station play nothing but straight Rush for twelve hours non-stop.
It was heaven!  The only bad part is I had to go to work for four hours
at the local McDonald's.  But I didn't miss hardly any of it.  I had a lot
of blank tapes, and my dad was kind enough to record it for me.  It was
worth it since I didn't have all of the tapes yet and I got to hear what a
lot of the songs I hadn't yet heard sounded like.  I also recorded off of there
Not Fade Away.  Yes, they actually played it.  Earlier we were in the car (this
is when I discovered that the A-Z was on) and they played You Can't Fight It.
The DJ must not have looked closely at the title since it was played with the
C songs and not the Y's.  Then again, the DJ that was on later in the evening
got corrected constantly.  He said You Bet Your Life would be the last song
played, and he had to change it to YYZ.  Plus he said Pert.  I bet he got a
LOT of calls over that one.  For all interested parties, the radio station
was LAZER 103.

I just have to add a few more of these YKYARFW:

you know how to spell Zivojinovich.

you know how to say Zivojinovich.

you listen to the drum parts on the muzac at work and have fun picturing how
Neil could play them in his sleep.

you think Geddy's voice is one of the most beautiful voices you've ever heard,
and can't understand why other people trash it.

You seriously consider using Alexandria as a middle name for a girl, and toy
with the idea of Alexander Neil for a boy.

you try to drum Double Agent on tabletops and all you can get is your high
school fight song, which a fourth grader could drum without any trouble.

     Oh, well, enough of my rambling.  I'd like to add more of these, but
I can't think of amy more.  I'm sure that two seconds after I send this, though,
I'll think of at least 20 more.

Subject: Fascism: Peart/Rand

For those of you familiar with the infamous J. Kordosh crucifixion piece in
_Creem_ on Neil Peart, he suggests at one point that Ayn Rand -- and by
extension, Neil -- are fascists.

Additionally, in the '84 _Modern Drummer_ cover story on Neil,
interviewer Scott Fish comments, "In Harry Shapiro's book called
 _A - Z of Rock Drummers_, he alluded to many of your lyrics as being
fascist."

What am I missing here?  If we define fascism as "a political
philosophy, movement, or regime that exalts nation and often
race above the individual and that stands for a centralized
autocratic govt headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic
and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition"
(Webster), then what the hell are Kordosh and Shapiro talking about?

I'm only the most cursory of Rand students, but isn't she
completely about *individualism*? I mean, isn't that one of
the major threads running through her works?

Are these people so superficial that they miss the point of
2112 and think that Neil is espousing the Priests' point of
 view? I find this very difficult to believe.  I mean, Kordosh
seems to be a reasonably intelligent individual. To what do
we attribute such a gigantic oversight?  And Neil doesn't
really correct the error outright in either case.

What am I missing??

Subject: Free Will Lyrics

The FAQ does not resolve this issue to my satisfaction, so
please suffer me to open "the olde Free Will lyric thread" again:

We all know that Ged sings, "If you choose not to decide, you
 still have made a choice."   We also know that the lyric sheet
says:
                 If you still choose not to decide
                 You cannot have made a choice

I'm puzzled by the comment from Neil printed in the FAQ, [from Backstage Club
Dec. '85] in which he states that the lyric sheet
 is correct. I'm also puzzled by the FAQ-creator's comments --
"So what?" and "Lighten up!".  Neither response gets to the heart
of the matter which is the vast difference in meaning between what
 is printed and what was recorded.

To me, the question remains, if the lyric sheet is correct, as
Neil seems to assert, why was such a substantial change in meaning allowed to
go down on tape?

Subject: Geddy's bass playing

  well, here we go again, bagging on Geddy's playing. I am a bass player
studying at Indiana University and I am into many style of music, which is
cool, however, Geddy was also one of My first influences. His bass lines and
style are what make him unique. As for saying someone like Flea is better,
please! Do you know that Flea cannot even read music. Granted, I love the Chili
Peppers I think they are awesome, especially live. But anyway, Geddy's style
is part of what makes Rush Rush. I hold a number of players at an equal plane.
meaning they all have influenced me in some way.  Jaco, Stanley, Stu Hamm (which
whoever wrote the Geddy bashing mail left out) as well as Marcus Miller, and
many others.  At any rate, Geddy is someone you and I cannot touch in terms of
his style.  I think that if I ever make as much money as Rush had, I believe
I will play like shit just to make people wonder how I made it. Geddy probably
doesn't care how he plays just as long as he is playing.  There are some
crackers to chew on for fellow bassists.  Rock on!!!  ;)

Subject: guitar solos

In the thread on great Lifeson solos, I haven't seen mention of some
of my favorites.  I think what unites all of these is that they are
ones where Alex makes his guitar sound like a violin, esp. by using
slower more dramatic sequences (if I could play guitar, I'd be more
technical).  For example:

All time favorites:
Natural Science, Red Barchetta, The Camera Eye, Between the Wheels
(perhaps the best of the best), Mission, and the ultimate rock jam
the Presentation section of 2112.  Notice that LVS is absent mainly
because it's impossible to pick out one section as more brilliant
than the rest.

I saw the HYF tour in Washington DC and when they played LVS it was
a total surprise and the closest I've come to believing in God.

From: Joseph.Nagraj@Dartmouth.EDU (Joseph Nagraj)
Subject: Re: Digest #1072 Part 4 of 12

ah, yes to yes

Just wanted to jump in on two separate issues involving interpreting
Neil's lyrics...

Keith Smerak describes "The Trees" as a parable about the stronger
oppressing the weaker.  I think it's the exact opposite.  My reading
of the song is that the Maples (the weaker) oppress the Oaks (the
stronger).  That oppression is made possible by the strength in
numbers reflected by the Maples' "union."  In fact, many critics of
Rush have interpreted this song as "union-bashing."  It probably is.
More relevantly, it is one of the clearest statements of Neil's
individualism and is a song that reflects the Rand influence as well.
The productive are always at the mercy of the unproductive in a society
where the unproductive can use an unconstrained state to gang up and
expropriate the productive.

BTW, for the last 5 years I've used lyrics from "The Trees"
juxtaposed against John Lennon's "Imagine" as the basis for an essay
question on my final exam in my Comparative Economic Systems course.

As for Cary Lasher's question about 2112.  I've always interpreted the
ending the first way (the good guys win).  On the assumption that the
song reflects Neil's general optimism, a happy ending is the only way
to make sense of the main character's obvious suicide ("my life blood
spills over") in "Soliloquy."  That suicide is a symbol of how unbear-
able life is under the Federation, and leads to the return of the "men"
of old.  More evidence for that reading... why would the Priests say
they have "assumed" control?  They already *have* control!  It can only
be someone else who *assumes* control, no?  That interpretation is also
consistent with Rand's original story where, near the end, the main
character (who lives) says:  "For the battle they [the men of old] lost
can never be lost.  For that which they died to save can never perish."
This implies the eventual victory of the good guys.  Though Neil has
claimed no conscious link as he was writing, the stories remain close
enough to justify paralleling them this way, IMHO.

Incidentally, I know several people who knew Rand personally when she
was alive.  I have never asked if she was aware of Rush's music.  My
guess is that she wasn't, and if she was, she would have hated it -
at least the music!  In Barbara Branden's biography of Rand "My Life
with Ayn Rand," she has a chapter tracking famous people who have been
influence by Rand, which includes a mention of Neil (as well as Simon
LeBon of Duran Duran, oh well...).
