Subject: Chronicles Video

Fellow Rushians,

   I've seen plenty of discussion in NMS about what a waste the Chronicles
CD set may or may not be if you already have the the complete Rush
catalogue but I haven't seen any mention of the Chronicles video collection
which has videos the band has released from Closer to the Heart through
Lock and Key (they seem to be arranged in Chronological order of release -
makes sense doesn't it).  Anyway, I am really enjoying the video - it's the
ideal way to beat the MTV blues since now I watch Rush whenever I feel like
it (i.e. often).  However, it is kind of spooky watching Neil, Geddy, and
Alex age 15 or so years right before your eyes.

  A couple of things I noticed and wanted to see if anyone else had opinions on:

 -  At the beginning of Big Money there is this animated yellow car which
flies through a landscape of skyscrapers.  The license plate on the car
reads "MR BIG."  Now, correct me if I'm wrong but in the movie "Wayne's
World" wasn't the license plate on the limo belonging to the president of
Sharp records also "MR BIG."  Coincidence, I think not?  Could it be that
Wayne and Garth are closet Rush fans?

 -  In "Time Stand Still" why does Aimee Mann run around through the whole
video with a camera and indeed she has such a large part in the video if
you weren't familiar with Rush you might think she were a regular member of
the band.  I'm not complaining, as I like what Aimee Mann has done both as
a solo artist and with 'Til Tuesday, but this is the only occasion I can
think of where someone outside Rush has been featured so prominently (I'm
not ignoring the Ben Mink solo which was discussed at such great length in
NMS, I'm just noting that in a live situation another musician could play
the solo but it would be tough to get someone to duplicate Aimee Mann's
voice - I guess that's why they play back a recording in concerts).

That's enough for this post.  I'm outta here!

I appreciate the work and time put into such a worthy cause for a sole
purpose!
 I read in Guitar Shop Magazine Summer 1994, that Alex Lifeson said "Our next
project is to record this tour(Counterparts) for a live alblum.  We use live
alblums to cap off eras of development and, in fact this one will come out
one year earlier than usual, but this year is our 20th anniversary as a
recording act.  So for our next tour, that's slated for early '95, we're
planning to do 'An Evening With RUSH', instead of of having an opening act.
 We'll start the show with a set that runs chronologically from 1974 to 1984,
then we will take a short break, and run some films on the history of the
band.  After that, we'll finish up with another set covering the second
decade.  Actually, I think it should be as much fun for us, as everyone
else."

Subject: another band Rush fans may like

This is only peripherally related to Rush so I beg the indulgence of
the rush-mgr and all those subscribed here.

Of late I've really gotten into the band Echolyn, and a number of Rush
fan friends of mine have also enjoyed their stuff.  I think this band
may well appeal to a lot of Rush fans out there (hell Echolyn opening
for Rush would be beyond my wildest wet dreams).  They have just been
signed by Sony/Epic and have a new album entitled 'As the World' due
out on February 28th.  I humbly suggest you get it in your local
record stores when it comes out.

Not only do I suspect you will really enjoy it (as it has complicated
musicianship, and great vocal harmonies, and meaningful lyrics
somewhat reminiscent of Rush),  but it also may help make
more good music become commercially acceptable.  I hear a lot of  gripes on
here about how Rush gets no airplay/commercial support.  They have a
pretty established fan base however, after so many years.  Many new
bands of similar type caliber are finding their stuff impossible to
market because they AREN'T the kind of 3 chord ear candy you see on
eMpTyV.  Sony is really unsure of how to market Echolyn for just that
reason, and the bigger THEIR success, the more likely we are to hear
better new bands in the future.  Dream Theater (who I don't really
care for, but DO respect), is another such band that has broken
through the commercial barriers.

So if you like Rush, Dream Theater, and other bands with above average
 musicianship, take a gamble and try out the new Echolyn when it comes
out on Feb 28th.  And if they come to a club near you, check em out
live... dare I say that they are comparable to the mighty Rush in how
tight they sound?

I honestly haven't been this excited about a band since I first got
into Rush way back when.

			-John Santore

P.S. I'm NOT affiliated with Echolyn in any way, although I DID just
see my 4th show just last night :-)

	Well to answer whoever posted the B&B thing, they sorta did mock
Rush like saying "Oh no its Rush", "This song would be cool if your a
wuss" and some other stuff. They didn't show credits because they changed
the channel but it sorta sucked since they were almost through playing
it. I am going to try to tape it and then transcribe what they say about it.

Subject: Magazine article on Peart

In the December 1994 issue of CD Review there is a review of the BfB CD.
I am always nonplussed to see a review of any Rush related item, so
here is the article sans Neil photo behind the small kit pictured
in the CD.

NEIL PEART

	It's not often we get the chance to hear Neil Peart outside
of his long running association with the rock band Rush.
Certainly as a rock drummer Peart needs no introduction:
the whole Rush catalog seems, at times, a textbook of modern
rock drum technique.
	But what about Peart's fabulous talents in another context.
Recently, he was asked to play a tribute concert for Buddy Rich.
The caller was Rich's daughter, Cathy, and Neil graciously
accepted.  Out of that concert came the idea for a tribute
album to the late jazz superstar.  Burning For Buddy: A Tribute
to the Music of Buddy Rich (Atlantic) was Peart's brainchild
and this time he called Cathy Rich to initiate the proceedings.
What resulted is a veritable "who's who" of modern drumming
with 17 drummers contributing to 17 tracks.
	Peart's inclusion is the wonderful Ellington composition
"Cotton Tail." It is easy to wonder if there's a future for the
drummer in jazz.  If "Cotton Tail" is any indication, we can only
hope.

And that was it.  A reasonably short review but a good one all
the same.  I'm sure you kids are tired of seeing lame reviews
of the Nifties Band Ever.  My humble apologies if this post
was a bit lengthy, but I thought the article was short enough
to post.  A small side note:  female Rush fans are reasonably
easy to locate.  Try finding a female Zappa fan, and you're in
for some serious trouble.

Hey:

I don't write much, but I love to read. I have been "into" RUSH for about 10
years. I can give my opinion (for instance, Peart would view this dicussion
about him as a wast of human energy), but I prefer to chart my own path. I
would, however, like to take my name (RWWaddell) off this mailing list.
I still get this insightful on-line discussion VIA RobWaddell on AOL, so you

Thank you for solidifying and directing this purposeful and insightful

If this one doesn't get edited, you'll see why I decided to send it
anonymously.

I was in a "Men's Club" Friday night, where the dancers performed 3-song
sets.  Now I've seen strippers dance to a Rush song before, but never
before had I seen them dance to 3 Rush songs in a row!  In this case, it
was Freewill, Dreamline, and Spirit of the Radio.  I was pretty impressed
(and bought a private dance for SotR, since I knew it was a 5+ minute
song).

   Hello all!!

I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season.   It's been a while
since I last posted, I've just been watching the fur fly.  There have
been some pretty heated arguments going on.   I just had a few things
to comment on. No I'm not going to tell you what you should or
shouldn't post about, I enjoy reading it all, and if I don't I just
skip it.    I don't remember who mentioned the idea for a Rush
Christmas album, but I like it.  Neil doing a rendition of the Little
drummer boy, we can dream.  Great idea whomever mentioned  it.    I
also just wanted to second Mr. Rocke's recomendation of Richard
Preston's book "The Hot Zone"  This book makes AIDS look as bad as the
common cold.  And it's all true. Check it out. After reading it you'll
shiver everytime you hear something about the ebola virus.        Sorry
for such little Rush content.     Have a good one!!

January 9, 1995

Greetings Rush fanatics!

This is my first posting on NMS, and I hope you will find it interesting.
I'm sure that some of you may relate to my story, especially if you've
roller skated at a rink before (I'm sure most of you did that when you
were younger, or maybe you still do it now).

I'm a disc jockey at a roller skating rink just outside of Atlanta.
About a month ago, a member of the speed team asked me to play "Tom
Sawyer" for a speed skate.  I was floored.  I had heard that the song
had been a popular speed skate at one rink, and at first, I couldn't
understand why.  It's not fast (when compared to songs like "Where's
My Thing?") and it doesn't have a good skating tempo, according to
my bosses.

So, I played "Tom Sawyer," and the older speed skaters LOVED IT!  As far
as age is concerned, we're talking about teenagers 14 to 17 years old.
What I'm really excited about is how that one request has caught on.
Now, the speed skaters ask me for "Tom Sawyer" more than anything else--
even Green Day!

>From my observations, I've gathered that there's a new generation of Rush
fans on the rise.  As with any classic rock group, you're going to have
fans decades down the road, even if you're no longer existent.  It's awesome
knowing that the generation known for Lollapalooza and Nine Inch Nails still
appreciates GOOD rock and roll.

Because of the requests for "Tom Sawyer" at my rink, I'm also playing other
Rush songs for speed skates.  The speed skaters enjoy "Stick It Out" next
to "Tom Sawyer" and "Where's My Thing?" to a lesser degree.  I was really
surprised when I played "Yyz" and they didn't like it.  I'm still searching
for more Rush songs for speed skates, so if anyone has any suggestions,
send them to my e-mail address.  That's your best bet, because I don't
always read the NMS straight through.

I'm looking forward to more Rush in '95.  Keep rockin'!

Bonjour fellow NMSers:

I want to relate to you a true Rush story as told to my brother, Vaughan,
from a friend of his who had a recent run in with Rush.

Vaughan attends the BBA program at York University. For those not
familiar with York University, the main campus is located in the
North-West end of Toronto. That has no relevance to the story but
I add it for reasons of setting. His friend is a recent immigrant from
from Singapore. In December after completing mid-term exams, she met with
a few friends at a bar. During the evening she met a few of their
associates. One young fellow, named Justin, mentioned that he was having
a New Years party at his place. They were invited.

Come New Years Eve Emylin and a friend proceed to Justin's house,
destination Richmond Hill, a ritzy big town/small city about 15 minutes
north of Toronto (but considered part of Metropolitan Toronto). The party
is being held in the front foyer. This gives you an idea of the size of the
house. A fair size crowd has gathered. Off to the side is a bar with a
bartender dressed in a tuxedo. On the other side a DJ cranks out the tunes.
Emilyn's friend turns to her and asks what she thinks of the party.
Emilyn's expression is along the lines of 'seen it, done it'.
Amazed by Emilyn's subdued restraint, her friend asks, "Don't you know
who Justin's parents are?" Emilyn replied no.

Her friend shakes her head and says, "See that blond guy over
there. That's Justin's father. His name is Alex. He works with that guy
over there. His name is Neil. Oh, and the third guy standing next to him
is the other guy. His name is Geddy. They're musicians."

Emilyn smiles discreetly. Amazed her friend has not drawn the connection,
she says, "Emilyn, they are in a group called Rush." It is obvious
Emilyn doesn't know who Rush is.

She related this story to my brother a few days later. She was sitting
with Vaughan in the University lounge with a few other classmates and she
told him about it, "My friend was saying I partied with Rush. Just who
are these guys?" My brother's eyes went wide, "Wow, what an incredible
party that must have been."

"No big deal, really. No one made a scene. I've been back to his place a
couple of times. A bunch of us pop in and hang out. No big deal."

Then my brother told her how I was a big fan and asked her to get an
autographed picture for me. I'll let you know if it ever pans out.

Cheers,
Sharkster.

Now that Aimee Mann's name has come up regarding her background singing
on Hold Your Fire, I might as well ask a question I've been thinking of
since the thread started:

just how many songs does Aimee Mann sing on the album (and by "sing," I
mean contribute some part to; doesn't have to be as noticeable as Time
Stand Still...)?  Off the top of my head, I can think of 4 -- Force Ten
(though I'm not sure about this offhand), TST, Open Secrets, and now Tai
Shan.  Does she have some sort of part on every song?

Subject: Rush, of course

Hello fellow Rush fans,

Well, since it has been deemed uninteresting to announce that this is my
first post, I won't say that.  What I will say is that after reading
about 11 or 12 issues of the NMS, just today, I am pretty impressed with the
different ideas that people have come up with about this band.  That the
topics discussed here fall into such a wide range is a tribute to the
fans, but especially to the band.  I seriously doubt that fans of many
other bands would get into such heated discussions about such things as
the band member's view on the environment or even their use of grammar.
But, you all know that already.  Instead, I would like to just reply to a
few of the things that I have read:

1)  To the person who said that they thought Moving Pictures contained
some pretty weak songs at the end, just take the time to listen to them
some more.  If you are like me, and prefer the earlier Rush to the more
'progressed' Rush, you will eventually find yourself really getting into
these songs.  In fact I think that they are some of my favorite Rush
songs, that is why I had to address the issue.

2)  All-Time Greatest Combo Band
      Well, since the rule is to limit yourself to only one person from
an existing band, this may be a little interesting.  What I can say is
that some of the bands that I have seen listed have been a little
disappointing.  It has been said that Rush fans are varied in music
taste, but so far I haven't really seen anyone who is not really into
progressive music (besides Rush of course).  But anyways, here goes:

Vocals:  Maynard Keenan of Tool.  Such a unique voice, eh?
Guitar:  Tie-Steve Vai/Joe Satriani.  They're just good.
Bass:    This one is easy, it is obviously Les Claypool from Primus.
Drums:   That would have to be Neil Peart.  Besides, 'The Professor' is just
	 such a cool nickname...
Lyrics:  Tie between Curt Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets and Greg and Mr.
	 Brett from Bad Religion.  If you don't believe me just listen to
	 some of their stuff.
Flute, and some words :)    Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull.
Saxophone:  Roland Alphonso of the Skatalites.
Trombones:  El Hefe of NoFX and Lars Nylander of Skankin' Pickle.
Drugs:   Beck
Accordian:  don't be ridiculous  :')

ok so now you have guessed it, the ultimate band *is* a ska band.  This
would work, trust me.

well, I hope this has convinced everyone, Rush fans truly do like every
kind of music.  Someone probably even likes country-western, but maybe

all the albums back to back  (wait, that would probably take more than a
day, wouldn't it?  Oh well)  That's it for now, nice meeting y'all

Subject:  "O Canada"

This being my first submission to TNMS, please excuse any mistakes in my
posting style.  First off, I was wondering if anyone has ever heard Geddy
speak of his visit to the most beautiful ballpark in the country, Camden Yards.
I cannot access backfiles of TNMS so therefore I may have missed any reports
posted not long after the All-Star game.  I still brag to many people even
today that my favorite band's lead singer sang his national anthem at my
favorite teams' (and my employers') ballpark.  Yes, right now I'm making

Blue Jays fans pretty sick, but hey... the O's will rule if they ever play the
damn game again!

B.E.P.

Glad to see that some people didn't take Beavis and Butthead's critique of
"Stick It Out" too seriously.  After all, they are on the long list of
people that have to suck up to the MTV higher-ups (I've never known anyone who
thinks that both Metallica and the Humpy Dance rule).  Just be happy that MTV
thought the video was hip enough to include on B&B.  If Rush was smart (and
I'm not saying they aren't), their next video should be Rush watching B&B
watching Rush.  I can see Alex whining that he is not a wus.

It should get them more airplay at least.

MTV sucks,

I believe Neil once mentioned it during a Rockline interview, basically
stating that it's a clip of Aimee Mann being played backwards. The boyz
thought it sounded nifty, so they put it in. (Maybe it's 'time stand still')
I can assure you that it's *not* Chinese. :)

  I was on AOL last night, and I was looking at SPIN magazine's area, and
they have March 28
as the release date for the new Rush album (there was no title). What I
want to know here is where in the world are these people getting their
information? From the way it was stated, it sounded as if word had come
down to them from Atlantic Records, but why would the record company be
that stupid? Something's weird here...

Subject: Nightmare

	Hi all!  I just started getting TNMS about a month ago, and i
must say, it's great.  Anyways, i just thought i'd mention that i was
watching the original Nightmare on Elm St. the other day, and guess what
i spotted in Johny Depp's room.  There over his bed was a p/g poster!
Also by his door was a Police poster.  Does Wes Craven have good taste in
music?  I think so.

Subject: Some Presto Questions
Date: Tue, 10 Jan 95 19:09:34 EST

Love the NMS...its nice to see so many Rush fans sticking together in
defense of good musicianship, lyrics, and performance in this age of
Grunge and neo punk recycled garbage.  This is my first post, and I had
some questions about the artwork on the sleeve of Presto... in reference
to the sketches of the hands... do they represent the band members?  My
guess would be the clenched fist=percussion and Neil.  The open hand
suggests the guitar and Alex.  The upside down peace sign the plucking
hand of Geddy on bass.  Is this blatantly obvious?  any comments
welcome.  2nd question:why is Presto brought to you by the letter "D"?
PoW is brought to us by letter "M" because its the first letter of
the songs Marathon, Manhattan Project, Middletown Dreams, and Mystic
Rhythms (possibly big Money?)... im clueless to the "D" on Presto.

Just to throw in 2 more cents before I leave, Power Windows is the best
Rush CD in my opinion for its unmatched sound sound, power, and energy.
And I wholeheartedly disagree with all the HYF critics out there!
