It seems that it's getting to be "that time of the year", when schools shut
down and summer vacation begins (for those in the U.S. anyways!). If you are
planning to be gone for a while and not have access to your account, please
unsubscribe yourself before you leave! I don't want sysadmins mailing to me
because their disk space is overflowing with NMS... Mail right around the day
you want to be taken off, and when you get back you MUST send me mail to
resubscribe; I can't keep track of everyone who wants back on once school
starts up. This way things are much easier on me! And never fear, the NMS will
still be running when you get back (unless all 1800+ readers decide to
leave... :)

Subject: The Wal... Again.

   Well, now I have a question about the basses on Power Windows.  I know that
the Wal on Power Windows was the borrowed one and all that, but in the Mystic
Rhythms video, you see Geedy playing a Steinberger.  Now, I know it's just a
video, and it may be for visual reasons why he used it, but could it be that
he used the Steinberger AND the Wal?  It may just be the mix, but the bass in
Mystic Rhythms sounds a bit different than in The Big Money, so maybe...

Just puzzled

Subject: Musical challenges, Seeing Red

	Aloha, all.
	I would like to see an unplugged show, for the same reason that I
think the bad would want to try one - it's a very different sound. I believe
those who say "They'd have to change their sound, it wouldn't be Rush, their
songs can't be acoustisized" are out of touch with the driving influence of
the band, which is growth/evolution. Neil has said himself that he doesn't
like to write like they used to (concept albums, older sound) because that
was them then, and RTB is them now.
	I think they would find it a pleasant challenge to work in acoustic
mode. And if you think that it would sound terrible and violate your sense
of what is RUSH, listen to the new Layla by Clapton - if you like it, you'd
like a RUSH unplugged set. If not, then that's a valid impression, just don't
tune in when it's on.

	About Red Lenses - That whole album is very important to me,
probably because of the time in my life I first heard it. I don't much like
the idea of rating songs, since judgements are so subjective, but I like
the sound on P/G. Geddy has said they went crazy on the guitars for that
albumn, but I like the force they carry. It's an angst-ridden mood, and I
think it goes with the ideas of the song as well. Sort of a list of trouble-
some aspects of life. I like the baseline, the way the percussion hops all
over your head with headphones, the way Alex's chords ring out hard, then
die fast, and the xylophonic sound in the bridge (listening to it now -
have to say again about Ged's baseline).

	Sorry to hear about your friend, Robert. I think it was a good choice,
though I personally would have added Afterimage. Probably your pick was a
better "first RUSH song" for the others, though.

	Clear Skies,

I have been quietly reading my NMS's lately and I have seen alot of 
discussion about Rush being on MTVs Unplugged.  Forgive me if I am wrong but 
doesn't Rush have enough accoustical material to be able to fill up a half-
hour to an hour? I personally would tune in just to see Neil perform his drum 
solo.  Anyway all this aside usually (I haven't watched the program much but I 
have caught alot of the shows) The band is asked by the audience to perform 
certain numbers. My tapes of REM on unplugged all show the band taking 
requests from the audiences. Now I would think that you would have to have a 
group of really diehard fans that would know what songs were suitable to be 
played acoustically.  My personal opinion is that the band would want to do it 
because they would have to mess around with most of their songs to get it to 
sound good for an acoustical performance.

Just my .02 of a dollar

Subject: A few things...
Date: Fri, 30 Apr 93 23:58:09 CDT

Greetings, Rushians!
    First, my comments on "Red Lenses":  I do not like this song lyrically.
I think it is much simpler than almost anything Neil has ever written, and it
basically grates on my nerves.  I felt this way about "Kid Gloves", too, but
I find myself to like it more now than a few months ago.
    Second:  I noticed that my sig was somewhat shredded on one end in the
last issue.  Rush-mgr:  why?  Everyone else with sigs:  ever happen to you?

   [ The first line in your .sig is longer than 80 characters, so I simply
     placed a &lt;return&gt;.						: rush-mgr ]

    Third, some things about black holes.  I did a research paper on faster
than light travel last year, and learned much about light and black holes.
Nikos' comments were almost correct:  Light actually _does_ have mass, however,
it must be moving at the speed of light in order to have this mass.  Also, a
black hole is not a star with a large gravitational pull:  it is a star that
died and had such a huge gravitational pull that as it died, it sucked itself
in on itself.  A black hole, according to Steven Hawking, PhD in relative
field, has _no_ dimensions whatsoever.  It has no volume, yet infinite mass.
Seem paradoxical?  But true.  Also, time would not have to slow down as one
approaches a black hole.  This is due to the fact that Realativity breaks
down near places of infinte mass.  It is realativity that would cause the
slow-down and stopping of time.
    Fourth:  Critical Mass.  Someone (sorry, deleted that issue!) thought
that it would be cool if the new album was reall Cygnus Book III.  Well, if a
star is to become a black hole, such as Cygnus X-I, it must not only burn at
the right temperature, but also have the correct mass.  Otherwise it will not
have the sufficient gravity to create the black hole.  Thus it could very well
be possible that Critical Mass, if that does become the final title of the
album, could be a return to the Books of Cygnus, perhaps dealing with the
origins of the black hole of Cygnus X-I (add explosion sound...).

Subject: Hold Your Fire and Humanity
From: easy@west.darkside.com (Phil D. Croix)
Date: Sat, 01 May 93 00:10:30 PDT

        Hello Rush trippers,
        I think that Hold Your Fire, as a whole album, is indeed about
and concerning humanity. In this album Neil has exposed some of his most
inner thoughts and perceptions, and they all deal with human emotions and
nature.
        I love the way that 'fire' and light and brightness play a
reoccuring role throughout the album. I think it was a conscious
decision of the band to put "Mission" as the centerpiece of the record,
as it is where the album title ties into the lyrics and one of Neils
favorite themes (discovering your dreams,potential) is predominant in the
words. I find now that for ME, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire are
Rush's best work to date. I think that these two albums were the best
produced, best written and best sounding of all.The Music of these albums
is so diverse and sometimes complex, and it is like a meche of sounds
that complements each other. Songs like Territories, Mystic Rhythms,
Middletown dreams, Open secrets and Mission are so full and majestic!
Yes, MAJESTIC, that's the word for it!
        When it comes to lyrics that work together like the gasses that
form water, Neil has mastered it beautifully here. I find that his
observations of contemporary society in Power Windows to be so very
correct, true and undistorted. I admire his cynical pokes at popular
cultures around the world, and his poetic way of acknowledging social
disarray among nations and the world. It is a whole world view, big
picture kind of thing on Power Windows. I think that Hold Your Fire is
more introspective in its themes, kind of the opposite of the album
before it. This album does indeed give us a look into the mind of one
incredibly talented and balanced person. When I listen to the songs on
HYF, I settle into Neils point of view so perfectly because he presents
it so clear and well.
        Hearing the news that Peter Collins is a good possibility for the
next album, I was and still am ecstatic! I see going further still in new
directions and with the same team again, Rush will again reach a high
point very soon. I am patiently waiting.........but isn't waiting most of
the fun?

I been reading a lot about the possibility(I know it's not  but I can't think
of another word for it)of playing Unplugged.  There are several(2) SIDES
to this point.  Either you like it or you don't.  I tend to think that it would
be a challenge.  And Rush is no stranger to a challenge.  I heard on a
bootleg from somewhwere the song Working Man done ala Reagge.(Not sure of dates
This seems like a change in style!!  Why not take the change to acoustic(sp).
Just a thought.
P.S.  anyone know why the C.D. single with Marathon(live???) is so much $$$$$$
I see it occoasionaly and wonder who would dish out,I think it was $150.

   [ I think it's simply because it's very rare. The live song is from

Subject:      Rush concert story/mis.

A big howdy to everybody on TNMS!!

I was supposed to go to the presto tour but things fell through at the last
minute.  But anyway to the story... A bunch of my best friends went to that
concert in Seattle, WA.  Well they decided to take one of their fathers $1000
cameras and sneak it into the concert.  Well for those who arent in seattle
when you go in there are two lines one has a patdown search and the other has
a metal detector!  Well my friends didnt know this and were in the line for the
metal detector!  And for some reason just out of the blue they moved to the
line.  Well one guy had the flash, one the zoom lense and the other the camera
and they all had them in their crotches!  So they had quite a nervous time at
the patdown!  Anyway they all got through and took about two rolls of film.
when they got them back only about 4 pictures came out!  But one picture that
I am going to have blown up to a poster is of a close up of Neil during his
drum solo cast in all blue light!  It is so awsome!

I would like to comment on kenneth bullock's post about classic rock stations
that stink!  I feel very sorry for you because it seems that you just havenot
listened to a good station!  I personally listen to a station out of Spokane
Wa. (KKZX 98.9) and it is one of the best stations I have ever heard!  I hear
Rush at least 7-10 times a day and I have tried to keep track of the variety
of songs...I think I have heard almost every Rush song at one time or another!
And not to contridict what you posted to much they DO play new groups with the
old rock type of sound mixed with the original classic rock!  If you like
anything from Rush to Beatles to Led Zepplin this is the station for you!  But
If you are one of those that doesnt like a variety or not a classic fan I would
not suggest the station.*grin*

One more thing...(well actually a question?)  How many people think it would be
cool to see a fully animated video to Red Barchetta?  I personally think it
would be really cool if it was put together right!

(my apologies to the rush manager this is my first posting and I dont think
I did these lines very well ie. number of characters per line etc. Again sorry
about that!)

Later yall

Subject: MTV ...and a few replies

Hi,
I wish to reply to a few people. Certainly many interesting
conversations are going on in the last few issues.

About Rush Unplugged(in one sentence): I think that it is a great idea and I
am sure that Rush can make it - I also agree that it will not be an easy task
for them - but I don't think that MTV is willing to make it.

To jeffrey r brinkman  &lt;brinkmaj@gas.uug.arizona.edu&gt; and
   tcorcora@sunlab.cit.cornell.edu (Travis Corcoran) :

Couldn't agree more with what you two said about MTV in TNMS 62. MTV is not
interested in playing music with quality and meanings. It is only interested
in having as many viewers as possible. This can only be achieved if it
plays continuously music that is "trendy" and easy to hear.
This is obviously not the kind of music what we like to hear...
A solution may be smaller, alternative, rock-oriented TV-stations.
Of course there aren't any such TV-stations in Greece but what about USA
or Canada?

To tcorcora@sunlab.cit.cornell.edu (Travis Corcoran):
- Thanks for the correction and the info about Asimov. I didn't know
that he died... (I'm sorry - RIP).
- I agree that Red Lenses is not one of the best songs in GUP.
- No you're not the only one. I sometimes want to hear a song or
an album many times so that I can rate it properly. Also sometimes
I start liking music which I have heard at the past ,without paying so
much attention then.

To Luis Arturo Loyo Delgado &lt;LLOYO%VMTECQR2@OSSA.CCF.AUTH.GR&gt; :
Thanks for the The Arcane Rush Trivia file that you mailed to me. It's a great
job and it's a great honour for me to see my $0.02 appear there. It's up to
us to make it better (My fantasy is a Rush-database where any fan can find
analysis and additional information about any Rush song that he wishes).
The reason that I use TNMS to reply to you is that I'm afraid that my previous
reply never reached you (there may be some problems with our Bitnet-Internet
gateway here in Thessaloniki ) so please e-mail me telling me whether you
have received any reply from me or not.

Subject: "break-in" time with music....

Hi all!  Travis Corcoran brought up a good point last issue, regarding
the fact that it takes him a while to get used to/ really enjoy Rush.
I feel the same way.  In fact, I see a direct relationship between the
amount of time it takes you to enjoy music and it's quality.  (In some
cases!  No matter how long I listen to some music, I'll never like it!)
What I mean is, like so much of "popular" music today is so simple,
so superficial, for a reason.  The masses can start loving it (and therefore
start buying it) after only hearing it once or twice.  This is because
the songs are so shallow you can get all there is to get out of it
in one listen.  Rush is so much more complex, that after listening to it
a few dozen times, you still discover new things about the songs.  That
complexity gives the songs a certain staying power.  Ever notice how many
trendy, simplistic, instant-success songs fade away into nothingness inv
in a few short months?  Man, what was so amazingly popular only a few
short years ago couldn't ever be played by a "pop" radio station anymore.
It's too old, too worn out.  But ever notice how you can never get tired
of hearing Limelight, or Hemispheres, or 2112?  Because there's more to
these songs than a simple steady driving beat that is the only requirement
for a song to be popular today.  Umm, I'd go on about this whole thing
for a while more if I didn't think I was babbling, but I probably am, so
why doesn't someone else jump in and tell Travis and me if we're off our
rockers or what.  Long Live Rush!  :)

Has anyone ever noticed the difference in themes presented by
Freewill and RtB?  Freewill encourages taking control because
everything is up to you, while RtB is very fatalitic.  In RtB, it is
up to fate what will happen and you just have to take your chances.
It seems to me that maybe Niel has learned a few lessons in life.  He
started off thinking that it was Freewill, but now realizes a lot is
not up to you and everything is up to fate.

Subject: break-ins, bootlegs, etc...

in reply to a number of people whose names elude me at the moment:

the hypothetical unplugged playlist is very good but needs "Different Strings";

any claim that Neil was influenced by ayn rand cannot be overemphasized, as
long as we are talking about the mid-seventies.  just listen to the lyrics to
"Anthem" (as well as the title) to see what i mean.  as for HYF, Neil
certainly retained his individualism, but it is also clear by that time he no
longer subscribed to just one system of philosophical thought;  he had his own,
which was influenced by rand, not dominated.  ("i placed no trust in a faith
that was ready-made.")

"Red Barchetta" the bootleg is worth buying, but keep in mind the songs from
PeW/MP are rather standard performances.  the show in montreal, may 1981,
during the MP tour, and i believe sit is taken from a radio broadcast, but i'm
sure the bootleg is the same show as "A New Reality", so don't get both.

and lastly, i agree with whomever said they needed a break-in period.  my first
Rush album was a copy of HYF someone made me, but i never liked it when i
popped it in, and hence never really listened to it.  the first album i bought
was Presto, which i had gotten used to because was mongo radio play of songs
like "Chain Lightning", "The Pass", and SDT.  at the same time, however, i was
borrowing other people's Rush albums and listening, and gradually starting to
like them, but again, it took time.  later, after i was hooked, the first time
i heard all of Signals, i despised the first side, save Subdivisions.  now i
love it, as well as everything else Rush has done.  i guess Rush needs to be
appreciated as much as loved, which is why it took time to love them.

Subject: Rush album cover posters

I noticed the poll on favorite album covers,
and I thought I would ask a related question.
I hope this isn't in the FAQ.  I don't have a
copy handy . . .

I'm extremely interested in obtaining at least
one nice quality poster suitable for framing
of one of the album covers.  Preferably Moving
Pictures, but I'll consider others.  I have been
looking around in the local stores, but it appears
futile.

So, does any one know where I could buy an album
cover poster?  I don't mind receiving it in the mail
if I have to.  I'm sure they are out there, I just
don't know where to get them!

   [ You could try looking in "Goldmine" -- several places offer Rush
     posters (not always listed in their inventory). I came thiiiiis close to
     getting a MP poster, but the guy's cat tore it up...	   : rush-mgr ]

Thanks in advance,

Dear fellow Rushians,
  Hi, I'm Alex Randall and I just joined a couple of days ago.  I have
a question for anybody that can answer it:
  On _Caress of Steel_, what do the words "Didacts" and "Narpets"
mean?

Hello. This is my 28th post to TNMS. Sorry to be such a pest.

Just thought that before 95 percent of the list vanishes for four
months :), I'd update everyone on the geography survey (NOT a
poll, god forbid!!) of a couple of weeks back. Thanks to everyone
around the world for your responses, most notably that of Mike
(CUBSFAN@OREAD.CC.UKANS.EDU), who for some strange reason my
brain had filed under Illinois. Can't imagine why ... :)

Anyway, for everyone's bragging purposes or whatever, the 1800
members of TNMS are scattered across, as near as I have been able
to determine:

     * 8 provinces of Canada (NOT represented: Yukon,
       Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan, and Prince Edward
       Island);

     * 44 U.S. states (NOT represented: Alaska, Maine, North
       Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming);

     * And 23 nations worldwide, including Canada and the U.S.

Thanks, everyone, for all the hellos; good luck with finals; hope
you all have a good summer; and here's counting the hours to
Critical Mass time ...

Is there any more news on whether the _Atmospheric_ CD set is a different
show from the _Over the Europe_ CD set? Is _OtE_ not supposed to be from
Holland in May 1992 anymore?

Thanks a lot to anyone with any information.

as my girlfriend and I made our way to the King Soopers down the block for a 
late night snack, we decided to take a shortcut, and cut through a gas station 
parking lot. Parked against a barrier was a late 70's CHevy van, completely 
covered in multicolored swirled astroturf. We stopped for a moment to admire 
the artistry of this paint-job, and my eyes wandered to the Illinois license 
plate, which read:
          "1 PEART"

Subject: Presto!

In descending order of triviality:

(1) I'd like to hear people's thoughts about the song "Presto."  I think it's
    a fantastic song; it lifts my spirits every time I hear it.  But what the
    hell is it about?  It seems that Neil's lyrics are more obscure than usual.
    "I radiate more heat than light" is one of the best lines he's penned;
    Neil's reminding us that there's more beneath the surface than we see, not
    only in others, but in ourselves, too.  "I'm not one to believe in magic,"
    he claims, but at the same time, he muses "if I could wave my magic wand."
    The contradiction is intentional, obviously; one interpretation: people are
    complex creatures, and, while we see contradiction from the outside, if we
    had the other person's perspective, the mutual exclusion might vanish
    (presto!) in a puff of emotion.

    Whaddy'all think?

(2) My Hemispheres CD has a picture of Neil wearing a natty vest, on which
    is pinned a button.  Any idea what the button says?

Subject: Break-in period for new music

Hello Rush Fans-

Travis Corcoran writes:

&gt;ObNewTopic: I need to get used to a lot of music before I like it.
&gt;This break in period is usually short, but w/ Rush, it is often a year
&gt;or longer.  I only started to really appreciate HYF a year or so ago
&gt;(and I was a Rush fan long before the album came out, I went to the
&gt;concert,etc.)  I'm starting to like RTB around now.  Has anyone else
&gt;out there had a similar experience, or is it just me, and I should
&gt;take my lithium more often...?

I have had the same experience - to a point.  When HYF came out, I ran out
and bought the CD immediately.  I was so disappointed in it that I actually
traded it in to a used record store after only a month.  Looking back on
it, I think I probably had that opinion of it because it was so dissimilar
to my favorite Rush album at that time, Permanent Waves.

Anyhow, I recently bought myself a new copy because I wanted to complete my
Rush collection (only need 2 more...).  Imagine my surprise when in just
the past month it has become one of my favorite Rush albums - ranking up
there with Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, and Signals.  I suppose I
never really gave it a chance before, but it's shocking nonetheless.

I guess what I learned from all this is not to EXPECT anything from a new
Rush album - just take each on its own merits.  I never had a "break-in"
period for RTB, and it ranks near the top of my list.

Everytime I take a road trip, I like to pop in good old 2112 in the
cassette deck.  About 2:32 into THE TWILIGHT ZONE on Side B, there is this
squaling noise that makes me think the radar detector is going off!  It's a
great feeling, although unsettling.  For about a second afterwards, my
head is darting the countryside and putting the foot on the break.

It seems that it's getting to be "that time of the year", when schools shut
down and summer vacation begins (for those in the U.S. anyways!). If you are
planning to be gone for a while and not have access to your account, please
unsubscribe yourself before you leave! I don't want sysadmins mailing to me
because their disk space is overflowing with NMS... Mail right around the day
you want to be taken off, and when you get back you MUST send me mail to
resubscribe; I can't keep track of everyone who wants back on once school
starts up. This way things are much easier on me! And never fear, the NMS will
still be running when you get back (unless all 1800+ readers decide to
leave... :)

Subject: The Wal... Again.

   Well, now I have a question about the basses on Power Windows.  I know that
the Wal on Power Windows was the borrowed one and all that, but in the Mystic
Rhythms video, you see Geedy playing a Steinberger.  Now, I know it's just a
video, and it may be for visual reasons why he used it, but could it be that
he used the Steinberger AND the Wal?  It may just be the mix, but the bass in
Mystic Rhythms sounds a bit different than in The Big Money, so maybe...

Just puzzled

Subject: Musical challenges, Seeing Red

	Aloha, all.
	I would like to see an unplugged show, for the same reason that I
think the bad would want to try one - it's a very different sound. I believe
those who say "They'd have to change their sound, it wouldn't be Rush, their
songs can't be acoustisized" are out of touch with the driving influence of
the band, which is growth/evolution. Neil has said himself that he doesn't
like to write like they used to (concept albums, older sound) because that
was them then, and RTB is them now.
	I think they would find it a pleasant challenge to work in acoustic
mode. And if you think that it would sound terrible and violate your sense
of what is RUSH, listen to the new Layla by Clapton - if you like it, you'd
like a RUSH unplugged set. If not, then that's a valid impression, just don't
tune in when it's on.

	About Red Lenses - That whole album is very important to me,
probably because of the time in my life I first heard it. I don't much like
the idea of rating songs, since judgements are so subjective, but I like
the sound on P/G. Geddy has said they went crazy on the guitars for that
albumn, but I like the force they carry. It's an angst-ridden mood, and I
think it goes with the ideas of the song as well. Sort of a list of trouble-
some aspects of life. I like the baseline, the way the percussion hops all
over your head with headphones, the way Alex's chords ring out hard, then
die fast, and the xylophonic sound in the bridge (listening to it now -
have to say again about Ged's baseline).

	Sorry to hear about your friend, Robert. I think it was a good choice,
though I personally would have added Afterimage. Probably your pick was a
better "first RUSH song" for the others, though.

	Clear Skies,
		Kimo

CRITICAL MASS
If that is in fact what they choose to call the new album, I can envision
many examples of rush-esque word play.  Example: A significant religious

I have been quietly reading my NMS's lately and I have seen alot of 
discussion about Rush being on MTVs Unplugged.  Forgive me if I am wrong but 
doesn't Rush have enough accoustical material to be able to fill up a half-
hour to an hour? I personally would tune in just to see Neil perform his drum 
solo.  Anyway all this aside usually (I haven't watched the program much but I 
have caught alot of the shows) The band is asked by the audience to perform 
certain numbers. My tapes of REM on unplugged all show the band taking 
requests from the audiences. Now I would think that you would have to have a 
group of really diehard fans that would know what songs were suitable to be 
played acoustically.  My personal opinion is that the band would want to do it 
because they would have to mess around with most of their songs to get it to 
sound good for an acoustical performance.

Just my .02 of a dollar

Subject: A few things...
Date: Fri, 30 Apr 93 23:58:09 CDT

Greetings, Rushians!
    First, my comments on "Red Lenses":  I do not like this song lyrically.
I think it is much simpler than almost anything Neil has ever written, and it
basically grates on my nerves.  I felt this way about "Kid Gloves", too, but
I find myself to like it more now than a few months ago.
    Second:  I noticed that my sig was somewhat shredded on one end in the
last issue.  Rush-mgr:  why?  Everyone else with sigs:  ever happen to you?

   [ The first line in your .sig is longer than 80 characters, so I simply
     placed a &lt;return&gt;.						: rush-mgr ]

    Third, some things about black holes.  I did a research paper on faster
than light travel last year, and learned much about light and black holes.
Nikos' comments were almost correct:  Light actually _does_ have mass, however,
it must be moving at the speed of light in order to have this mass.  Also, a
black hole is not a star with a large gravitational pull:  it is a star that
died and had such a huge gravitational pull that as it died, it sucked itself
in on itself.  A black hole, according to Steven Hawking, PhD in relative
field, has _no_ dimensions whatsoever.  It has no volume, yet infinite mass.
Seem paradoxical?  But true.  Also, time would not have to slow down as one
approaches a black hole.  This is due to the fact that Realativity breaks
down near places of infinte mass.  It is realativity that would cause the
slow-down and stopping of time.
    Fourth:  Critical Mass.  Someone (sorry, deleted that issue!) thought
that it would be cool if the new album was reall Cygnus Book III.  Well, if a
star is to become a black hole, such as Cygnus X-I, it must not only burn at
the right temperature, but also have the correct mass.  Otherwise it will not
have the sufficient gravity to create the black hole.  Thus it could very well
be possible that Critical Mass, if that does become the final title of the
album, could be a return to the Books of Cygnus, perhaps dealing with the
origins of the black hole of Cygnus X-I (add explosion sound...).

Subject: Hold Your Fire and Humanity
From: easy@west.darkside.com (Phil D. Croix)
Date: Sat, 01 May 93 00:10:30 PDT

        Hello Rush trippers,
        I think that Hold Your Fire, as a whole album, is indeed about
and concerning humanity. In this album Neil has exposed some of his most
inner thoughts and perceptions, and they all deal with human emotions and
nature.
        I love the way that 'fire' and light and brightness play a
reoccuring role throughout the album. I think it was a conscious
decision of the band to put "Mission" as the centerpiece of the record,
as it is where the album title ties into the lyrics and one of Neils
favorite themes (discovering your dreams,potential) is predominant in the
words. I find now that for ME, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire are
Rush's best work to date. I think that these two albums were the best
produced, best written and best sounding of all.The Music of these albums
is so diverse and sometimes complex, and it is like a meche of sounds
that complements each other. Songs like Territories, Mystic Rhythms,
Middletown dreams, Open secrets and Mission are so full and majestic!
Yes, MAJESTIC, that's the word for it!
        When it comes to lyrics that work together like the gasses that
form water, Neil has mastered it beautifully here. I find that his
observations of contemporary society in Power Windows to be so very
correct, true and undistorted. I admire his cynical pokes at popular
cultures around the world, and his poetic way of acknowledging social
disarray among nations and the world. It is a whole world view, big
picture kind of thing on Power Windows. I think that Hold Your Fire is
more introspective in its themes, kind of the opposite of the album
before it. This album does indeed give us a look into the mind of one
incredibly talented and balanced person. When I listen to the songs on
HYF, I settle into Neils point of view so perfectly because he presents
it so clear and well.
        Hearing the news that Peter Collins is a good possibility for the
next album, I was and still am ecstatic! I see going further still in new
directions and with the same team again, Rush will again reach a high
point very soon. I am patiently waiting.........but isn't waiting most of
the fun?

Subject: Unplugged again

I been reading a lot about the possibility(I know it's not  but I can't think
of another word for it)of playing Unplugged.  There are several(2) SIDES
to this point.  Either you like it or you don't.  I tend to think that it would
be a challenge.  And Rush is no stranger to a challenge.  I heard on a
bootleg from somewhwere the song Working Man done ala Reagge.(Not sure of dates
This seems like a change in style!!  Why not take the change to acoustic(sp).
Just a thought.
P.S.  anyone know why the C.D. single with Marathon(live???) is so much $$$$$$
I see it occoasionaly and wonder who would dish out,I think it was $150.

   [ I think it's simply because it's very rare. The live song is from

Subject:      Rush concert story/mis.

A big howdy to everybody on TNMS!!

I was supposed to go to the presto tour but things fell through at the last
minute.  But anyway to the story... A bunch of my best friends went to that
concert in Seattle, WA.  Well they decided to take one of their fathers $1000
cameras and sneak it into the concert.  Well for those who arent in seattle
when you go in there are two lines one has a patdown search and the other has
a metal detector!  Well my friends didnt know this and were in the line for the
metal detector!  And for some reason just out of the blue they moved to the
line.  Well one guy had the flash, one the zoom lense and the other the camera
and they all had them in their crotches!  So they had quite a nervous time at
the patdown!  Anyway they all got through and took about two rolls of film.
when they got them back only about 4 pictures came out!  But one picture that
I am going to have blown up to a poster is of a close up of Neil during his
drum solo cast in all blue light!  It is so awsome!

I would like to comment on kenneth bullock's post about classic rock stations
that stink!  I feel very sorry for you because it seems that you just havenot
listened to a good station!  I personally listen to a station out of Spokane
Wa. (KKZX 98.9) and it is one of the best stations I have ever heard!  I hear
Rush at least 7-10 times a day and I have tried to keep track of the variety
of songs...I think I have heard almost every Rush song at one time or another!
And not to contridict what you posted to much they DO play new groups with the
old rock type of sound mixed with the original classic rock!  If you like
anything from Rush to Beatles to Led Zepplin this is the station for you!  But
If you are one of those that doesnt like a variety or not a classic fan I would
not suggest the station.*grin*

One more thing...(well actually a question?)  How many people think it would be
cool to see a fully animated video to Red Barchetta?  I personally think it
would be really cool if it was put together right!

(my apologies to the rush manager this is my first posting and I dont think
I did these lines very well ie. number of characters per line etc. Again sorry
about that!)

Later yall

Subject: MTV ...and a few replies

Hi,
I wish to reply to a few people. Certainly many interesting
conversations are going on in the last few issues.

About Rush Unplugged(in one sentence): I think that it is a great idea and I
am sure that Rush can make it - I also agree that it will not be an easy task
for them - but I don't think that MTV is willing to make it.

To jeffrey r brinkman  &lt;brinkmaj@gas.uug.arizona.edu&gt; and
   tcorcora@sunlab.cit.cornell.edu (Travis Corcoran) :

Couldn't agree more with what you two said about MTV in TNMS 62. MTV is not
interested in playing music with quality and meanings. It is only interested
in having as many viewers as possible. This can only be achieved if it
plays continuously music that is "trendy" and easy to hear.
This is obviously not the kind of music what we like to hear...
A solution may be smaller, alternative, rock-oriented TV-stations.
Of course there aren't any such TV-stations in Greece but what about USA
or Canada?

To tcorcora@sunlab.cit.cornell.edu (Travis Corcoran):
- Thanks for the correction and the info about Asimov. I didn't know
that he died... (I'm sorry - RIP).
- I agree that Red Lenses is not one of the best songs in GUP.
- No you're not the only one. I sometimes want to hear a song or
an album many times so that I can rate it properly. Also sometimes
I start liking music which I have heard at the past ,without paying so
much attention then.

To Luis Arturo Loyo Delgado &lt;LLOYO%VMTECQR2@OSSA.CCF.AUTH.GR&gt; :
Thanks for the The Arcane Rush Trivia file that you mailed to me. It's a great
job and it's a great honour for me to see my $0.02 appear there. It's up to
us to make it better (My fantasy is a Rush-database where any fan can find
analysis and additional information about any Rush song that he wishes).
The reason that I use TNMS to reply to you is that I'm afraid that my previous
reply never reached you (there may be some problems with our Bitnet-Internet
gateway here in Thessaloniki ) so please e-mail me telling me whether you
have received any reply from me or not.

Subject: "break-in" time with music....

Hi all!  Travis Corcoran brought up a good point last issue, regarding
the fact that it takes him a while to get used to/ really enjoy Rush.
I feel the same way.  In fact, I see a direct relationship between the
amount of time it takes you to enjoy music and it's quality.  (In some
cases!  No matter how long I listen to some music, I'll never like it!)
What I mean is, like so much of "popular" music today is so simple,
so superficial, for a reason.  The masses can start loving it (and therefore
start buying it) after only hearing it once or twice.  This is because
the songs are so shallow you can get all there is to get out of it
in one listen.  Rush is so much more complex, that after listening to it
a few dozen times, you still discover new things about the songs.  That
complexity gives the songs a certain staying power.  Ever notice how many
trendy, simplistic, instant-success songs fade away into nothingness inv
in a few short months?  Man, what was so amazingly popular only a few
short years ago couldn't ever be played by a "pop" radio station anymore.
It's too old, too worn out.  But ever notice how you can never get tired
of hearing Limelight, or Hemispheres, or 2112?  Because there's more to
these songs than a simple steady driving beat that is the only requirement
for a song to be popular today.  Umm, I'd go on about this whole thing
for a while more if I didn't think I was babbling, but I probably am, so
why doesn't someone else jump in and tell Travis and me if we're off our
rockers or what.  Long Live Rush!  :)

Has anyone ever noticed the difference in themes presented by
Freewill and RtB?  Freewill encourages taking control because
everything is up to you, while RtB is very fatalitic.  In RtB, it is
up to fate what will happen and you just have to take your chances.
It seems to me that maybe Niel has learned a few lessons in life.  He
started off thinking that it was Freewill, but now realizes a lot is
not up to you and everything is up to fate.

Subject: break-ins, bootlegs, etc...

in reply to a number of people whose names elude me at the moment:

the hypothetical unplugged playlist is very good but needs "Different Strings";

any claim that Neil was influenced by ayn rand cannot be overemphasized, as
long as we are talking about the mid-seventies.  just listen to the lyrics to
"Anthem" (as well as the title) to see what i mean.  as for HYF, Neil
certainly retained his individualism, but it is also clear by that time he no
longer subscribed to just one system of philosophical thought;  he had his own,
which was influenced by rand, not dominated.  ("i placed no trust in a faith
that was ready-made.")

"Red Barchetta" the bootleg is worth buying, but keep in mind the songs from
PeW/MP are rather standard performances.  the show in montreal, may 1981,
during the MP tour, and i believe sit is taken from a radio broadcast, but i'm
sure the bootleg is the same show as "A New Reality", so don't get both.

and lastly, i agree with whomever said they needed a break-in period.  my first
Rush album was a copy of HYF someone made me, but i never liked it when i
popped it in, and hence never really listened to it.  the first album i bought
was Presto, which i had gotten used to because was mongo radio play of songs
like "Chain Lightning", "The Pass", and SDT.  at the same time, however, i was
borrowing other people's Rush albums and listening, and gradually starting to
like them, but again, it took time.  later, after i was hooked, the first time
i heard all of Signals, i despised the first side, save Subdivisions.  now i
love it, as well as everything else Rush has done.  i guess Rush needs to be
appreciated as much as loved, which is why it took time to love them.

Subject: Rush album cover posters

I noticed the poll on favorite album covers,
and I thought I would ask a related question.
I hope this isn't in the FAQ.  I don't have a
copy handy . . .

I'm extremely interested in obtaining at least
one nice quality poster suitable for framing
of one of the album covers.  Preferably Moving
Pictures, but I'll consider others.  I have been
looking around in the local stores, but it appears
futile.

So, does any one know where I could buy an album
cover poster?  I don't mind receiving it in the mail
if I have to.  I'm sure they are out there, I just
don't know where to get them!

   [ You could try looking in "Goldmine" -- several places offer Rush
     posters (not always listed in their inventory). I came thiiiiis close to
     getting a MP poster, but the guy's cat tore it up...	   : rush-mgr ]

Thanks in advance,

Dear fellow Rushians,
  Hi, I'm Alex Randall and I just joined a couple of days ago.  I have

  On _Caress of Steel_, what do the words "Didacts" and "Narpets"

Hello. This is my 28th post to TNMS. Sorry to be such a pest.

Just thought that before 95 percent of the list vanishes for four
months :), I'd update everyone on the geography survey (NOT a
poll, god forbid!!) of a couple of weeks back. Thanks to everyone
around the world for your responses, most notably that of Mike
(CUBSFAN@OREAD.CC.UKANS.EDU), who for some strange reason my
brain had filed under Illinois. Can't imagine why ... :)

Anyway, for everyone's bragging purposes or whatever, the 1800
members of TNMS are scattered across, as near as I have been able
to determine:

     * 8 provinces of Canada (NOT represented: Yukon,
       Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan, and Prince Edward
       Island);

     * 44 U.S. states (NOT represented: Alaska, Maine, North
       Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming);

     * And 23 nations worldwide, including Canada and the U.S.

Thanks, everyone, for all the hellos; good luck with finals; hope
you all have a good summer; and here's counting the hours to
Critical Mass time ...

Is there any more news on whether the _Atmospheric_ CD set is a different

as my girlfriend and I made our way to the King Soopers down the block for a 
late night snack, we decided to take a shortcut, and cut through a gas station 
parking lot. Parked against a barrier was a late 70's CHevy van, completely 
covered in multicolored swirled astroturf. We stopped for a moment to admire 
the artistry of this paint-job, and my eyes wandered to the Illinois license 
plate, which read:
          "1 PEART"

Subject: Presto!

In descending order of triviality:

(1) I'd like to hear people's thoughts about the song "Presto."  I think it's
    a fantastic song; it lifts my spirits every time I hear it.  But what the
    hell is it about?  It seems that Neil's lyrics are more obscure than usual.
    "I radiate more heat than light" is one of the best lines he's penned;
    Neil's reminding us that there's more beneath the surface than we see, not
    only in others, but in ourselves, too.  "I'm not one to believe in magic,"
    he claims, but at the same time, he muses "if I could wave my magic wand."
    The contradiction is intentional, obviously; one interpretation: people are
    complex creatures, and, while we see contradiction from the outside, if we
    had the other person's perspective, the mutual exclusion might vanish
    (presto!) in a puff of emotion.

    Whaddy'all think?

(2) My Hemispheres CD has a picture of Neil wearing a natty vest, on which
    is pinned a button.  Any idea what the button says?

Subject: Break-in period for new music

Hello Rush Fans-

Travis Corcoran writes:

&gt;ObNewTopic: I need to get used to a lot of music before I like it.
&gt;This break in period is usually short, but w/ Rush, it is often a year
&gt;or longer.  I only started to really appreciate HYF a year or so ago
&gt;(and I was a Rush fan long before the album came out, I went to the
&gt;concert,etc.)  I'm starting to like RTB around now.  Has anyone else
&gt;out there had a similar experience, or is it just me, and I should
&gt;take my lithium more often...?

I have had the same experience - to a point.  When HYF came out, I ran out
and bought the CD immediately.  I was so disappointed in it that I actually
traded it in to a used record store after only a month.  Looking back on
it, I think I probably had that opinion of it because it was so dissimilar
to my favorite Rush album at that time, Permanent Waves.

Anyhow, I recently bought myself a new copy because I wanted to complete my
Rush collection (only need 2 more...).  Imagine my surprise when in just
the past month it has become one of my favorite Rush albums - ranking up
there with Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, and Signals.  I suppose I
never really gave it a chance before, but it's shocking nonetheless.

I guess what I learned from all this is not to EXPECT anything from a new
Rush album - just take each on its own merits.  I never had a "break-in"
period for RTB, and it ranks near the top of my list.

Everytime I take a road trip, I like to pop in good old 2112 in the
cassette deck.  About 2:32 into THE TWILIGHT ZONE on Side B, there is this
squaling noise that makes me think the radar detector is going off!  It's a
great feeling, although unsettling.  For about a second afterwards, my
head is darting the countryside and putting the foot on the break.
