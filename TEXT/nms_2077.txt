About Working Man, the Rush tribute album, I heard some of Niel's 
feedback to the CD. He didn't like it. He felt ripped off! Despite when 
Geddy and Alex thought, Neil hated it! If I was in Rush and the group of 
talented musicians who were on Working Man (Mike Portnoy annd John 
Petrucci of Dream Theater, Sebastian Bach from Skid Row, etc.) made a 
tribute album for us, I would be damn honorned! I would freak out. I 
think Neil has somewhat of an attitude about other people playing his 
songs, maybe? What do you all think? Please give me feedback at 
joltrules@hotmail.com

attendance can listen to the release in the store (adequate stereo system
present) before buying the discs at midnight.

FEATURES:

1.  Free Dominos pizza.

2.  Raffle (Copies of the new release will be raffled off.  The more
raffle tickets purchased, the more copies raffled off.)

screen TV, spread throughout the store.  Rush video items will be played
on the system starting at 9:00pm until the end of the party. 
Possibilities:  MuchMusic specials, Auburn Hills '94, or maybe the
official new video if there is one.)

The release will be on sale and there should be adequate quantities for
all in attendace.  More details will follow as the release date is
solidified, but the go ahead has already been given for the party.

Subject: Can't we all just get along?

Uhhhh, sorry, was down in LA in the early 90's.  Couldn't help but use
that reference.  :)

OK.  So...  I wasn't going to do this.  But now it sure seems a bit
appropriate.

So...  I read things like "I hope this doesn't start a flame war" with
regards to both the Selena and Jackie tragedies.  In my OPINION, one
should not have to say this!

But but but...  some of you are thinking, that behavior just isn't
*rational*!  Why grieve over someone you didn't know -- I've read that
line in several recent NMS issues.

In my experience...  grief is far from rational.  in fact, I've found it
to be very IRRATIONAL.  I've seen some people express their grief quietly,
denying that anything is wrong until in solitude.  Some people just burst
out in tears anywhere.  Some people think life is unfair as a result of
tragedy.
Which way is the right way to grieve?  ALL OF THE ABOVE!!!  We all have
different responses.

Let me share an example...  almost two years ago (and, dammit, it was
RIGHT AFTER I got front row seats to the TFE show in San Jose...  what a
way to dampen spirits) a good friend was killed in a car crash.  Man.
What a blow.  Was I rational in handling her death?  Of course not.
Emotions are very irrational.  Worse yet...  another friend (Rush fan with
whom I went to the show -- and assuming Rush fans are a step above mere
mortals :) this says a lot), also a friend of hers, and I got into
repeated arguments over who had *known* her better.  Now, is that
irrational or WHAT?!?!?  Looking back, I can't believe how stupid I was.
But in reality, my irrational emotions were controlling my actions.

So -- I've said way too much already, some of you have hit "page down" by
now, but let me sum it up with...  everyone is at a "delicate" stage right
now.  Flame wars are sure to be rampant.  But...  let's just ACCEPT that
we are all different, that we all handle our emotions differently..  and
that it's OK to do whatever you have to do to feel good about Neil's
circumstances.

respectfully to all...

Yes, I remember this from the '78 tour in England, and have a 
tape from the Newcastle show which I attended 6 days earlier.  
It's Geddy, he says "get funky!", and his voice is being run 
through a pitch shifter to make it even more squeaky than usual.

On a related note, that instrumental bit is completely off the 
wall isn't it.. a bit Weather Report-ish.  There's nothing else
like it in the Rush canon.

Cheers

Subject: TS Goes Hollywood

	I'm trying to avoid movies with TS in them. TS has so
many great associations for me from my teen-aged and subsequent years,
that it would be a shame to be irresistably drawn to thinking about a
bunch of computer-animated toys running around every time I hear the song.
In general I think that Hollywood cheapens great songs by using
them to pique interest in a mediocre films. It is a great way to advertise
though.

	People here have been speculating about why so many movie-makers
have been after TS. I don't want to sound too crass, but I'd like to turn
the question around and ask why Rush has chosen to mass sell off TS at
this time. Was it a record company decision? Did the members of Rush have
anything to do with the TS "remix"?

   [ I doubt it. My guess is it was probably a Mercury/Polygram decision.

Subject: small soldiers comments on nms

Here's what Ryan (galahad77@juno.com) had to say about Small
Soldiers:

"...Well, I went out and bought the Small Soldiers soundtrack.  I *hate* the
remix of Another One Bites The Dust, but I already told the Queen mailing
list that.  However, I *love* the remix of Tom Sawyer..."

I had almost the opposite reaction.

I don't really care either way for the Tom Sawyer remix (apathy instead
of strong emotion?). It does make me long for the original, primarily
because it doesn't vary much from the original. The biggest difference
between the two is the mangling of the percussion, which is a big part of
what makes Tom Sawyer so great. However, it's better than 95% of the
crap on radio, plus if it expands the fan base for Rush, I can't really
knock it too much.

Another One Bites the Dust is a true remake. The remixer (I don't have
access to the disc right now, so not sure who it is), puts an entirely
different spin on the song and adds constructively to it. This one got me
to stand up and take notice; Tom Sawyer was just sort of there... didn't
really grab me.

To date, my favorite Rush cover is Rachel Barton's TSOR. She grabs the
song and makes it her own, which she had to do in order to make it work
on a violin (duh).

Hey Rush-Heads!

In light of recent band-events, I've seen sitting on this thread for = about 6
weeks trying to find a cool, polite, interesting way to bring it up for
discussion.     Screw that.

I think Rush should do Unplugged as a special event / band continuance /
farewell... whatever they see fit.  Somehow, it just seems appropriate.  =
I'm not suggesting jumping into rehearsals right fucking now,=20
just whenever.  They're on a live album release, they can get away with
exposure that highlights the band's history, and a quieter return to = what
makes Rush truly great - the quality songs, lyrics, and songwriting - in
appropriately different acoustic arrangements, would be, to me, = personally
theraputic.

Pretty goddamn selfish, ain't it?  Well look at it this way.  Maybe it
would give the whole band a welcome option in their cycle of
studio-studio-studio-studio-live-studio-studio-etc.

I throw this out knowing full well that this event will most likely be
scheduled right after the monkeys close my butt on their way out, but = let's
hear it:

Unplugged Set Lists, anyone?   Here's my start, & it's not thought out = at
all.

Closer to The Heart
Lakeside Park
Losing It
The Pass
Limelight
Half The World
Subdivisions (sloooooow arrangement)
Broon's Bane
The Trees
La Villa Strangiato

Be imaginative.  Try to hear these songs at different tempos, with = whatever
instruments you can imagine, especially strings & woodwinds, different
vocal arrangements, arpagiated guitar lines, upright bass, Neil's wet = dream
of acoustic percussion instruments, maybe a little Hugh Syme, maybe a
little special guest John Rutsey.  Hey - since it'll probably never = happen,
what you come up with will most likely be better than reality!

Whadayathink?

"Those who know what's best for us

Hi All,

Just a quick follow up on the show "1985" with Mystic Rythms.  Most every 
one that emailed me said it was NBC with Connie Chung.  There were only a 
handful of responses, but let's leave it at that.

The Camera Eye thread caught my attention.  I've had my own theory for 
years, very similar to these, but I think it's "hello (to passerby on 
street)...good day (response)"  In a heavy British accent.  Just my guess.

More ramblings....I was watching cartoons with my son and noticed parts of 
La Villa popping up in a Buggs flick! I guess it's the other way around 
though, buggs tunes in La Villa...pretty cool though.

Later!

Hi all!! 
	List managers, please allow this to go through... I promise there won't
be a subsequent posting of this sale to your lists and it won't become a

	Well, it is time. It's time for me to sell the CDs I never thought I'd
sell.. the ones I've always loved, that I paid the most to get, that I
searched the hardest for, that EVERYONE wants the most, and so forth.

cheques are totally OK... believe it or not I trust most of you

big leap of faith in you the collecting community. So please don't abuse
this, and please don't send a cheque if it's more than $100, for
security purposes on your side as well. I will ship these items the
moment I receive the orders for them. Well, within the hour, anyway.
They're already ready to go, I have the mailing packets here waiting to

Subject: WHO were they?

     Hello all,

     (Please don't confuse this with the endless condolence thread!!!)

     I've been wanting to ask this but haven't seen hope for an answer yet;
still, I'm going to ask anyway.
     The question is: *Who* were Selena and Jackie? Selena was an aspiring
artist, I
believe, but is there anything else known about her? It's was said after she
died that she was "special." How? Because she was Neil's daughter?  I'm
assuming that's NOT what was meant; but what then? Will we ever see any of
her artwork? And Jacquelyn surely had a life larger than just being a wife.
What was notable about it? What career or other pursuit made up her time?
     Maybe it's none of my business, but I'm interested nonetheless.

     Special thanks here for the Rush Mgr. while we all vent about this.

     Curious,
     Robert

Subject: Neil's feelings and the UK Rush Convention

Greetings from Scotland, lads and lassies......

After recently subscribing back to the NMS, I can't help but notice a 
lot of people who seem to think that it's time for Neil to quit mourning 
and get back to writing and drumming....

Sorry to say this , folks, but that is an extremely selfish attitude. As 
someone who is living with cancer at the moment...to explain, I was 
diagnosed with Hodgkins Disease in March of this year. Luckily my 
treatment is going great and I should be all clear by the end of the 
year, but there is always that possibility now in my life that it will 
come back and be more dangerous, I certainly hope not. It takes a lot of 
bloody guts to live with cancer, and I'm sure Jackie Taylor was 
dignified, brave, and 100% positive to the end, as all cancer patients 
should be......

Neil should be allowed to take as much bloody time as he needs to come 
to terms of losing Jackie,and Selena of course...let's not forget her.
And it makes me pig sick to see fans of the greatest band that ever 
walked this god-forsaken planet saying "Right, Neil...enough crying, 
let's get back to work"

My personal feeling is that Rush will continue making albums, but not as 
a touring band....I felt that watching and listening to concerts from 
the tour, especially the 30/06/97 gig in Toronto, that it was them 
saying goodbye to everyone as a live act.....but please, guys, it does 
take time to recover after a personal tragedy..Neil has suffered two in 
the past few months, so give him peace....

Right on a more happier note....for all Rush fans in the UK and 
Europe....

THE EVENT OF THE YEAR IS COMING!!!!!!!

I am of course talking about the 3rd annual Rush Convention!!!!

Venue: Leicester University, Leicester , England

Tickets on sale now priced £12...from the editor of "The Spirit of 
Rush", Mick Burnett...

If you want a ticket write to him at:

23 Garden Close,
Chinbrook Road,
Grove Park,
London SE12 9TG.

If it's anything like last year's, it should be a cracker...

Loads of Rush Videos, merchandise and bootlegs on sale, a grand raffle 
with prizes suppied by Anthem (thanks)......plus Rush Karaoke, and to 
finish off, a 2 1/2 hour set by one of the UK's top Rush tribute bands, 
Tom Sawyer.....

So get your tickets quick, and if you meet me at the bar, mine's a 
pint....

Take care y'all,

Subject: Tom Sawyer re-mix...I hate it, and who approved it?

	Hello Rushians....
	Thought I'd chime in on the discussion of the Tom Sawyer re-mix
in "Small Soldiers".  I listened to the whole 6 minutes plus at a
listening station at a music store and found it AWFUL.  I was appalled,
and not amused by it AT ALL.  Why mess with a good thing?  Ugh.   A lot
of the other songs on the Small Soldiers soundtrack I enjoy, but in their
natural state, not after they have been turned into hip-hop.  I just
thank God that Puff Daddy didn't touch this song! I know I am in the
minority here, as most of the posts here have been appreciative of the
re-mix.  Now I guess kids are going to think Rush is some hip-hop group
because of this!
	Lastly, I would like to know who ultimately approved of this
re-mix.  Did Geddy, Alex, and Neil approve of this?  Or was it someone
else within their management group or record company?  I wonder if the
guys are happy with how it turned out.
	Enough rambling for now,
	Jon G.

Subject: Creativity = "grand " designs

Hello fellow Rushians,

This is my first time ever writting to NMS. Well, let's see...I've been a
fan for about 15 years now and consider Rush's music a part of my life in
many different aspects. Too abstract to get into.

Something you may find interesting. I'm an Industrial Designer/Architect
and have found that many colleagues in the same field consider Rush as one
of their favorite band(s) and a major influence in their lives. Moreover, I
find myself extremely creative and cranking out "grand" designs whenever I
have them as opposed to others playing in my office. Another thing.....back
when I was in grad school, my fellow classmates and I always had them on in
the studio also. Hum?? I assume it has something to do with Geddy, Alex and
Neil being so precise and polished which is how we designers have to be to
succeed. Or another word........CREATIVITY! I'm sure many of you in other
fields can relate.

Some album recommendations I thought I might share with all of you:

I just got the new Candlebox - Happy Pills which came out on Tuesday
(7.21). Let me just say that I'm extremely impressed! It may be one of the
best ones I've gotten this year. They really took a dive on the last record
but seem to have come back to life on this one. It has
everything....typical Candlebox, a few Teslaesque rockers and the ballads.
Check it out at the record stores' listening areas if you get a chance!!

Mike Portnoy's Liquid Tension Experiment: need I say anything else?

Genesis' Calling All Stations : new singer----great voice

Marillion's This Strange Engine : not as diverse as the last two but still
provides us with the vintage Marillion sound.

ABWH: Anderson-Bruford-Wakeman-Howe---out since '89 but finally picked it
up: excellent and very diversified

One I bought during the holiday season but thought I'd include----Trans
Siberian Orchestra (TSO): Christmas Eve and Other Stories. These are the
boys from Savatage under the TSO name. You probably won't find it now; it's
usually in the Xmas section. Also, they (TSO/Savatage) have a "part 2"
coming out this holiday season entiltled The Christmas Attic.

Does anyone have any other recommendations in the progressive rock genre???
Not Floyd or Yes....have it all....almost. Catherine Wheel too.
Enough for now.

I'm not even gonna go near Neil's personal life...it's none of my business.
To that end, we don't know him on a personal level so let's not ponder his
decisions or the future for Rush. They'll figure it out......they always do.

Later,

"A to B....in different degrees."  -----To any Kappa Sigs out there, you
know what I mean.

Subject: Which CD would I choose???

Hello Rushians...

<<<I'm curious. Let's say the date is October 6th,
1998. You've just picked up the much anticipated
live release and are about to put it in the player.

Problem:  Which disc to play first?????>>>>

I must say that I would *definitely* put in the 1978 show CD first and 
give it a spin.  I love ATWAS, and this one is supposed to be even 
better.  I love how raw and powerful they sounded back then.  Their 
recent tours have sounded very refined, as well as powerful.  I am gonna 
totally enjoy having another live CD from their early years.  Speaking 
of which...Does anyone have any mp3's from the early days?  Are there 
any mp3's of their songs that were not released on studio albums?  
Thanks dudes and dudettes...

Take care...

Subject: Mancow Muller mentions Rush (print/internet article)

For the clueless, let me preface this E-mail with a
quick description of Mancow Muller.  He's a "shock-
jock" broadcasting out of Chicago with affiliates
scattered around the USA; think of him as Howard
Stern-light.  For those who know/follow Mancow's
Morning Madhouse, I thought you might find the
following interesting.  In discussion about his recent
change of stations, he mentioned our boyz.

>From the (on-line) Friday Morning Quarterback,
July 24, 1998:

"I left because of scenery. I wanted to go where
people were hungry and willing to take chances again.
I take chances and that's why I make advances. Don't
worry, my old seven-billion-dollar corporation will be
okay. When I heard my formerly cutting edge station
playing Canned Heat and Rush, I knew it was over!
I am too young to be on a Classic Rock station just
yet. Sorry! My new station (Q101) features music by
people who are still living. I am preparing for the new
millennium."

Kinda funny if you think about it; Rush has been
taking tremendous chances almost as long as Mancow
has been alive -- even to this day!  Obviously, he's
got a lot of learning left to do.

Subject: drumming

I'm currently faced with the challenge of proving to a friend that Neil is the
greatest drummer alive (maybe ever).  If you were to play one song (not
counting his solos), to show off Neil's ability, which would it be?  I'd have
to say either Tom Sawyer or Big Money.  Tom Sawyer needs no explanation (no
one could play that near as good as Neil).  I like Big Money, because of the
end with the drum rolls.  It shows how controlled he is and also shows of his
fast hands.

Hey fellow peoples in Rushland...

My name's neil and I've been a fan of rush for about 6 years now.  I got into
them my freshman year in high school, being a talented drummer I was placed on
cymbals in the marching band, but I still had to learn rudiments, like
paradiddles, flams, and stuff....at first I had trouble getting it all down,
so my friend came over with a bunch of sheets with the rudiments all spelled
out.  But before he left, he played the drum solo from ESL....and afterwards,
I had to pick up my lower jaw from the floor, and he told me to keep
practicing.  Since then, I've been a fan of Rush.  Everything about them is
miles above other bands....the music, the lyrics, the whole package in
general.  I was able to see them on the T4E tour, and it was just awsome!!!!!
Even though I'm just 19, I like lots of other prog-rock bands from the
70s....King Crimson (the 73-74 version of the band especially), Pink Floyd,
ELP, Yes, Genesis, in addition to those, there's also Dream Theater, Black
Sabbath, Dave Matthews Band, David Bowie, The Cure, Led Zep, Van Halen (I hope
this doesn't start another flame war.....i appologize Rush Mgr if it
does....), Alice in Chains, Queensryche....the list is endless considering I
have 400+ cds.  One of those is a Rush bootleg of a concert in Pensacola from
the RTB tour....it's pretty cool, good quality and all....plus the last song
is a 13 min. medley of just about all their songs....starts off with 2112
(overture) then segues into a bit of Finding My Way, La Villa Strangiato (not
sure which section....I think it might be A Lerxst in Wonderland/Monsters),
Anthem(1st verse), Red Barchetta (picked up from "wind in my hair.."), and
concludes with the end of Spirit of Radio.  It's AWSOME!!!!!!  

As for TV shows....well there's South Park, the Daily Show, MST3K, Seinfeld,
Frasier, Star Trek (orig. and TNG), The Simpsons, The Critic, Newsradio, Just
Shoot Me, and Politically Incorrect for the news.  Well, that'll about rap it
up....take care all for now.....

Not only is there plenty of files, they are very much _complete_ songs

You make a good point, though, about this whole grief thing.

Also.

I have a picture hanging on my wall of dogs playing poker.   Actually, it is a

Fine art, really.
This weekend I bought Moving Pictures on vinyl and noticed that it is the

This is about the coolest thing I have seen this week.
The dogs are cheating.  That just kills me.
