&gt;And speaking of lyrics: Does anybody have Rush lyrics on-line that
&gt;they'd like to share?

I'm sure that several people on the list have the entire text of all
the RUSH albums online; I know I do, and it's thanks to the generosity
and effort of another one of the list original members (hi Jimmy!).
Drop me a line if you still want them (you'll probably get mail from
a few people).

Maybe we could get together a list of people who have them online; we
could make the list available to the general list public.  That way, if
you wanted to get some/all of the lyrics, you could just send mail to
the closest person to you and get what you need?  That way, we could
circulate the lyrics and minimize the impact on the net traffic at the
same time.  What do the rest of you all think?  I'll volunteer the
administriva account as the repository of the list caretaker, if I can
get some people to send in names & addresses.

This would save Brad Armstrong some money, as he wrote:

&gt;lyrics.  Well..., ok; I work at the company whose name equals photocopy in
&gt;this country.  If I get some requests for this mailed to my net address,
&gt;I'll see what I can do about copying the inner sleeves for Fly By Night,
&gt;Caress of Steel, and 2112 (although this one is red on black so it might be
&gt;quite a trick to photocopy) and mailing them out.

&gt;Anyway, on to album art.  I have often found the album art
&gt;and liner notes to be as full of hidden messages as their
&gt;music.

&gt;2112 (1976):

&gt;                           Inside, we find that the boyz didn't
&gt;quite escape the disco revolution themselves :-).

I don't think this has anything to do with disco; it's probably
more attributable to the 'pomp rock' trend at that point in time.
Consider bands like Yes, ELP, Kansas, et. al. who were doing similar
sorts of long, orchestrated pieces.  It was sort of like the uniform
of the time for that genre of music.

&gt;                            This is the only album I have by them
&gt;that doesn't have the lyrics :-(

You don't know the half of it if you don't have the original album
lyrics & notes.  Before each song, there is a paragraph giving a
brief explanation of the situation behind the song; they explain
how he finds the guitar in a cave, how he learns to play and then
excitedly takes it to the priests, how they grind it to splinters
beneath their feet (very symbolic), about his dream, and how he
loses hope at the end.  The song tells most, but not all of the
story.

&gt;mentions of Daisy the Dog as voice coach and Oak Manor (what is
&gt;this place?) that will be mentioned again.

I'd guess Oak Manor is associated with the recording studio they
used...

&gt;out at Oak Manor.  The (xx - xx) where xx is some number usually less
&gt;than 30 appear to be volleyball scores.  These appear on PW as well.

I'd guess they were baseball scores when the band & crew take some time
off to play...  You know about Geddy & baseball!

&gt;Manor again.  Interestingly, His Royal Highness King Lerxst is
&gt;mentioned... is this they guy Lerxstwood Mall is named after on
&gt;the back of Signals?

King Lerxt is Alex.  The mall reference is also probably to him.
One thing I love about RUSH is they don't take anything, including
themselves too seriously!

&gt;Hold Your Fire (1987):  Nothing revealing about the cover, other
&gt;than the fact there are three red marbles (planets?) and three
&gt;members of the band (I love this cover, is it available as a
&gt;poster?).

Yes, the RUSH Backstage club was giving it out with new memberships
at the time the album was released.  You can probably get it from
them on the normal list of stuff (just a guess, tho).

&gt;Mac Plus, Lynda Barry, and Pee Wee's Playhouse get mentions.

Subject: Backstage Club, Red Tide again, more on Peart and religion

What's the latest scoop on the Backstage Club?  A friend and I joined back
in 1982 as "lifetime members".  We received some mailings for few months,
but then nothing.  Is it anything more than a merchandizing outlet now?

Also, still wondering what "bringing a sea-change to the factory floor"
means, from Red Tide.

Oh yeah, we can't let "The Pass" issue rest, can we? #-}

Alber Crombie writes:

"First off, after reading what Neil wrote about his feeling on Satanism,etc.
in music, I feel that 'The Pass' has no connection with religious stuff
(actually, I never did).  (my $0.02) I don't think Neil would ever write
anything about religions unless it was in an article like was just posted."

I have to disagree.  Given Neil's views as expressed in the Satanism article
and elsewhere, I'd be amazed if his bias against religions and what he
takes to be "superstitious" thought did not appear in his lyrics.  How can
you listen to "Freewill", "The Weapon", or "Witch Hunt", with any degree of
sensitivity to the lyrics and not sense a commentary on religion?  OK,
perhaps that's a bit strong, but look at these examples (I'm sure others
can find many more):

"You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice ...phantom fears...
kindness that can kill...  [but] I will choose free will."  Religious
people don't accept responsibility, claims Peart: "The stars aren't aligned,
or the gods are malign, blame is better to give than receive", thus
equating religion and astrology.

"They shout about love, but when push comes to shove, they live for things
they're afraid of".  Religions, says Peart, use fear, not love, as a
weapon. "Thy kingdom's will be done".  Do you think Peart throws in
references to the Lord's Prayer unaware of the connotations?

I won't go through "Witch Hunt", or "The Pass" again.  I just want to make it
clear that people who are such strong individuals as Neil will often write
about things they don't believe in, because they want to state that lack of
belief.  And one of the (mistaken) messages in the Pass, IMHO, is that
Christ's example of sacrifice, regardless of its original intent, has set a
bad example for people.  Peart doesn't believe in Christ, and he thinks it
is important to mention (one of) the reasons why.  And it is this aspect of
the song with which I disagree.  Of course, I agree with Peart that people
shouldn't give in to suicide.  So would Christ.  But I disagree when Peart
implies that Christ's teaching is the cause of such problems, by "making
surrender seem alright".

&gt;Moving Pictures (1981):  Front cover shows the obvious... pictures

The woman is crying because "the pictures are so moving" according to

Subject: A few tidbits...
From: skennedy@ihlpb.att.com!

A couple of things I have read in the last posting that I thought I
would throw my $0.02 in....

YYZ, in a boot I have called "Rush - Nassau Coliseum - 1982", Geddy called
the song "Why-Why-Zen" (phonically). I have also heard "Why-Why-Zed", so
there are two ways to pronounce it.   I had also read in a book called
"Success Under Pressure" (made with their cooperation), Geddy stated that
the title YYZ originally came the tags placed on the luggage at the Toronto
Airport.

And, speaking of boots, I have been working on an "extensive" (i.e loonngg!!)
detailed listing about the boots I have access to. So, until then, all
I can come up with is the extremely short listing.
Here is:

	   Name			 Year		  Type/Quantity
           ----                  ----             -------------
        Stellar Dynamics         1974             Album/4 sides
        Temples Of The Syinx     1980             Album/4 sides
[ I thought this was one album, and "Xanadu" was the double album? :rush-mgr ]
        Rush'n Roulette          1981             Album/6 sides
        Nassau Coliseum          1982             Album/4 sides
       *Rush Through Time        1983             Album/2 sides
        Rush Hour (In Lakeland)  1984             Cassette/60 minute
      **Anthology                1984             Album/2 sides
     ***Saliling Into Destiny    1985             Album/4 sides

  * - "Rush Through Time" was a Holland album through Mercury. It's all
       studio cuts.
 ** - "Anthology" was a Venezuela album via Polygram. All studio cuts.
*** - "Sailing Into Destiny" is the P/G video on album with five songs
       from the "Exit... Stage Left" video.

Worst sounding "boot" (not counting the studio albums...) was "Rush Hour
(in Lakeland)". The best non-studio was "Temples Of The Syrinx". (No,
I didn't get the name wrong; that's the name listed on the cover.) The
"Rush Hour" album sounded like it was taped with a walkman with the batteries
running down.  As you go through the tape, it gets faster and faster....
"Sailing Into Destiny" has a very sci-fi type cover.  Kinda neet.

As always, feel free to correct anything I may be wrong with.

&gt; Whoever decided to not compare Bill Bruford to Neil Peart was wise :) The
&gt; two don't have anything in common with their playing styles (Bill is more
&gt; into jazz and jazz fusion than rock these days, although he's 1/5th of the
&gt; way through a 5-album contract with ABWH)

**I** was the one who decided not to compare Bill Bruford with Neil
Peart. :-)   ...And it wasn't because they don't have anything in
common...(It was along article at that point, and I didn't feel like
using any more bandwidth at the time.)

They have a lot in common... First and formost, they both do an
incredible job in playing in odd metres.  Both of them make playing
in 2/4 and then switching to something crazy like 9/8 sound incredibly
easy.  I guess the best word that comes to mind right now is smoooooooth...
(Yes, with 7 Os)

Have you ever heard Bill Bruford in a multi-percussion situation?
Oh that's right, he didn't generally do that with Yes...  You have
to go towards his Jazz work... (OH MY GOD NOT THAT!!!!!:-))  I've
particularly enjoyed the marimba solos Bruford worked into some of
his songs...  I'll admit, he doesn't play the exact same way Neil
does, but there is a resemblance there.

If you think Bruford can't possibly show any resemblance to Peart
in playing style based on the fact that he is more of a Jazz musician,
I would ask you to listen to Jeff Berlin's first solo album, _Champion_.
Neil plays on two songs.  It shows that Neil can play with Jazz artists
as well as he can play with Rock artists...  I don't feel the type
of music you play heavily influences your style...  BTW, Jeff Berlin
is a bass-player friend of the Boyz...  He's done a lot of work with Bill
Bruford...  He Blows Geddy away on bass...

Well I guess I've wasted enough bandwith....

Subject: Re:  RUSH Fans Digest of 08/06/90 (#24) RUSH Fans Digest, Number 24 Monday, 6 August 1990

Just to clarify: The Yes Albums are the following (This is ALL of them I see
some other names floating around which have nothing to do with Yes):

Yes - a somewhat sixties/beatlesque album that shows promise of things to come
      in some spots.

Time and a Word - very similar to the first but a bit more progressive.

The Yes Album - The first album with Steve Howe,  one of their best contains
	a lot of their classics.

Fragile - Considered the classic album only for the inclusion of "Roundabout"
	IMHO a bit disjointed but some great songs.

Close to the Edge - three songs, last with Bill Bruford on drums.  Always on
	my list of the greatest albums of all time.

Yessongs - A triple live album, contains all of their early great songs. i.e.
	the ones that got airplay.  Sound quality isn't so great but the 17
	minute version of "Close to the Edge" makes it all worth it.

Tales From Topographic Oceans - A good album, a critical disaster.  Definitely
	not good for a first exposure to Yes but "Ritual" is one of their
	all time greats.

Relayer - The closest yes ever got to Jazz Fusion.  My all time favorite.  Just
	listen to the drums in "Soundchaser" or the instrumental section
	preceeding the "soon" section of "Gates of Delerium", absolute heaven.

Going for the One - Good album, different sound!  Not as accessible as some
	of their eariler work but very good.  Great acoustic guitar and piano
	on "Turn of the Century" and seriously rocking bass on "Paralells" and
	lets not forget the immense power of "Awaken"

Tormato - Possibly the most bashed Yes album of all time.  It has been in and
	out of print over the years.  Has real high and low points.

Drama - Very different.  Similar to Relayer but trades Jon Anderson's Vocals
	for Trevor Horn's and we've got Geoff Downes playing Keys.  MUCH
	more metal sounding than anything else they ever did (The were always
	heavy at times but this is different).

Classic - A Greatest hits sort of thing.  Good for the initiate and definitely
	worth the investment for the collector for the live versions of
	"Roundabout" and "All Good People".

Yesshows - their second live album.  Very good but not as filled with the
	well known songs as "Yessongs"

90125 - The biggest departure for yes.  I'll withold comment since most people
	have heard it or at least parts of it.

Big Generator - I'll withold all comment other than that I think the cover art
	matches the music on the album very well (If you find it appealing
	to each their own).

Anderson Bruford Wakeman and Howe - Took me a while to really get into it.  Has
	its ups and downs but I think its the closest thing we've heard to yes
	since 1978.

Hope this is helpful to the original poster.

Pardon me for saying this on this list (But we Yes fans do not have one
of our own at the time) Yes is the greatest band to come out of the progressive
wave and probably the greatest band of all time!

Subject: Permanent Waves Headline

	The headline originally read, "Dewey Defeats Truman".  The newspaper
was, in fact, a copy of the paper with that infamous headline.  The headline
was removed from all American editions of the album other than the first
printing for copyright infringement reasons, and it is similarly illegible
on the CD version.  However, a quite legible version of the cover can be found
in the "Rush Complete" songbook, which, by the way, is also a fine source
for the lyrics of all Rush albums through Signals.

Subject: Liner notes and other stuff

MUSICAL PREFERENCES:  Alex is into, I believe, everything!  Geddy once
remarked that Alex's music collection was quite varied--including
selections from Martha and the Muffins!  Frankly, I've never heard of
them before, but a friend of mine says they're a punk group.  Anybody
know different?  I'm not sure about Neil, but I do know that he
does/has listened to reggae mainly for gaining drumming knowledge
about the rhythm of reggae music.  Whether he *likes* it or not (one
would assume he would) is unbeknownst to moi.  I think, he too, would
be into a whole bunch o' stuff.  oh yeah, I do know he likes, at least
to some extent, jazz/big bands as he has mentioned that his father
listened to that, so he "soaked in into his skin", as they say.

LINER NOTES:  If I'm not mistaken (and I probably am) Oak Manor is a
studio in England that they "frequent" when over there on "recording
runs".
	Sam Charters is listed on Permanent Waves as being the Personal
Shreve.  I can't find his name on any other albums, but I would suspect
he was a very good friend of the band.
	Grace Under Pressure (here goes):  "Afterimage" was, in fact,
written for Robbie Whelan, who died in a car accident.  That is partly
the reason for the dark mood of the album.  However, I'll let Neil tell
all:
	(ED NOTE: He's talking about 1983)  "Yes, it was a year of
crisis and tragedy-both globally and on the home front.  While we were
at 'Writing Camp', the Toronto _Globe & Mail_ was delivered to our
doors each morning.  Since it was there, I found myself reading it over
breakfast everyday, before I would start working on lyrics.  the topics
of the day, especially as expressed in the editorials and letters to
the editor, were necessarily on my mind, and this circumstance affected
the lyrics to certain songs profoundly.  This was the time of the
Korean 747 mrders, the on-going cruise missle controversies, acid rain
(one of my pet protests) was large in the Canadian news, wars raged
everywhere--and we, our families, and our friends were trying to cope
with economics, death, illness, stress, romantic problems,
unemployment, and depression (Well, not all at once!)  Songs like
"Distant Early Warning", "red lenses", and "Between the Wheels" were
definitely interwoven with these thoughts and feelings.  Like the
newsman Peter Trueman says: "That's not news; but that too is reality."
	That was from the GUP Tour Book.  The tour books really give
	you an insight into the songs, and the band as well.  Anyway, I
hope that answers some questions.
	The Tour Book also mentions Roger Kneebend who is given credit
	in the liner notes.  He was Geddy's son's 10" action figure
whom the band adopted.  As Neil says, "He was placed prminently atop
Alex's tape machine so he could stay on top of the recording! (Groan)"
Groan is right!
	Also, Hentor the Barbarian was a joke put upon the producer,
Peter Henderson.  Peter had brought over a bass, but it was too
big for Geddy's taste.
 Alex promptly put the letters spelling "Stratocaster" on it, but the
bass is really non-existent.  I know I'm missing a huge chunk of the
story--I have it somewhere.  I'll look it up (goodness knows I have
nothing better to do...!).   Hope that answers some questions you
hadn't ever considered asking.  Later...
