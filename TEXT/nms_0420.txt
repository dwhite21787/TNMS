In the for-what-it's-worth department, there may soon be a mail archive
server operating directly off of Syrinx soon.  Another user is putting
it up, and once they have it working correctly :-) I'll add the Rush stuff
to the list of possibilities.  This is no way meant to replace the mail
server at Ingr.com, it just sort of fell into my lap, so I may take advantage
of it.  This is sometime down the road, so don't start asking about it just
yet, please.  (Caveat to David Schuetz for installing & debugging, for those

Subject: Rush TV appearances

We readers of the NMS have here at our disposal at tremendous resource: the
collective knowledge of over 1100 Rush fans about our favorite band. It seems
to me that we are not utilizing this resource anywhere near as much as we
could! Looking over the various bits of information tabulated in the monthly
postings of the FAQL, I see some glaring omissions, which, with your help, I
propose to fill in. In particular, I think it would be useful to have a
listing of all the band's known TV appearances, and also a listing of all the
radio specials done with or about the band.

Since I anticipate a large number of responses to this project, I will
undertake the tabulation of these listings one at a time, beginning with the
list of TV appearances. So, fellow Rush fans, send me e-mail with any
information you have about Rush's TV appearances. Please send as much detail
as you are sure of. For example, I know Rush appeared on Don Kirschner's Rock
Concert, and did at least 3 songs, but I don't know the date of the
performance or if the 3 songs I have seen are the full performance. I also
have seen a couple of appearances at the Canadian Juno awards ceremony, and
an interview from Japanese TV, but again with no information on the dates.

To avoid overloading my regular mailbox, which I use for work, I have
arranged for temporary access to another e-mail address which is seldom used.
Please send all e-mail for this project to: "lin@areaplg2.corp.mot.com". Try
to respond within the next 2 weeks.

Best I heard was when they released 'Chronicles' here, a review in New Musical

&gt;&gt;&gt;Give me a break!  That kind of idle speculation is exactly why Neil said
&gt;&gt;&gt;TNMS readers should "Get a life." (or something to that effect) when he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;shown a copy.

Man!  I see my above post certainly brought forth some response.  About the
responses:

&gt;Definitely! This is no place for thought police.

Censoring someone that wants to censor someone is still censorship.
Incidentally, I never said everyone doesn't have a right to their opinion,
nor that their opinions should not be expressed.  I simply expressed my
notion that some of the opinions expressed were wildly speculative.

&gt; If you don't understand
&gt;&gt;or disagree with the purpose of the list, then, by all means, get off it.
&gt;
&gt;Right on!

Now there's an open-minded statement!  While there are certainly some
negative comments made (about Rush and other list members) that I don't
approve of, I certainly don't take a "love it or leave it" attitude toward
Rush, this list or its members.

Again, my only purpose was to state that I thought some members were being
overly speculative.  Perhaps I'm completely wrong.  So what?  I'll admit my
statement may have been worded a bit strongly, but it was not aimed at
*you* personally.  If you didn't agree with it, just scroll right on past
it.

Ok, now back to the subject of Rush......

&gt;	Much to my surpise and amazement, and package came in the mail
&gt;the other day... It was a Roll the Bones CD autographed by Geddy and
&gt;Alex!!!

&gt;Not that I want to sell it, but does anyone know what an autographed
&gt;copy of the CD would go for?

Whatever someone is willing to pay for it... Thats the beauty of
of market-based economy.

A local radio station held an auction last year where a Chronicles
CD signed by all three boyz went for ~$250. Given that your CD is
missing one autograph, its value is greatly diminished. My guess,
based on the $250 benchmark, would be that its worth ~$100.

Subject: Grammy voting

I remember hearing on Howard Stern that the Grammy nominations are made by
people "in the know", i.e., producers, musicians, etc., who are capable
of recognizing quality.  But, unfortunately, the actual voting is done
by lots of people who are employees of record labels and are told to
vote only for artists and records who represent that label.  So the actual
voting comes down to more of a popularity contest (surprise!) than the
nomination process.  How the hell else could you explain Bryan Adams'
nominations!?  ;^)

 &gt; From: Bruce Holtgren &lt;70724.1622@CompuServe.COM&gt;
 &gt; Subject: Grammy, Schmammy
 &gt;
 &gt; [....] awarded a Grammy to Jethro Tull for Best Heavy Metal
 &gt; Album instead of Metallica [....]

Not to be anal or anything, but I just wanted to correct this: Jethro Tull
won a Grammy in 1988 for "Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal Record", for _Crest
of a Knave_, beating Metallica's _...And Justice For All_.  Frankly, I think
they deserved it; as much as I like Metallica, I think _Crest.._ was a
better album.  No, it isn't Heavy Metal, but it is definitely Hard Rock.

The next year the Grammys split it into two separate categories: Best Heavy
Metal Record and Best Hard Rock Record; Metallica won Best Heavy Metal
Record for the single "One", beating out Soundgarden's _UltraMega OK_ and
Faith No More's _The Real Thing_, both of which I think are better than
"One".  (How can they compare a song to an album, anyway?)  They also won a
Grammy for "Stone Cold Crazy", which is a cover of a Queen song.  Sure, I
think Metallica deserves Grammies (well, as much as anyone deserves a
Grammy), but they keep winning it over better-qualified entries.  Oh well.

Does anyone have a record of nominations and winners for these two
categories, plus "Best Rock Instrumental" for the past 3 years?
Just curious...

Subject:    Talking point...?

Hi,

   It's great that Rush have finally been nominated for a Grammy for
Where's my Thing...about time too! However I thought I'd use this
opportunity to make a comment about all 3 of Rush's instrumentals.
This could be controversial, so remember it's only my opinion.
  The main point is that I feel all the instrumentals, Where's my
Thing, La Villa Strangiato & YYZ end far too abruptly. Don't get
me wrong. I love each of these tracks, I just wish they had decent
endings! Rush seem to have taken a great deal of care about the intros,
with each instrument building gradually upon the previous ones. They
then do a superb middle section...and then the song just ends. Bang!
There are no outros...they just seem to stop half-way through a
'verse' with no warning. This is a bit of a disappointment, since the
rest of the songs are so well-crafted. Give me a good Thanks-&-Goodnight
ending any time, like those on Xanadu or Working Man, rather than an
ending which feels as though someone just stopped the tape while I
wasn't watching. Okay, this is a bit of an exaggeration, but you know
what I mean. Or do you? Does anybody else out there think the endings
of the instrumentals are too abrupt? Or do you think they're perfect
as they are, and who am I to criticise?
   I'd be interested to see what you all have to say.

FYI: Actually, PeW was released on January 1, 1980, according to

Spirit of Radio was one *damn* fine way to kick off the '80s,
IMHO ...

Subject: Moving pictures & Grammys
Date: Tue, 14 Jan 92 17:14:37 EET

As Gregg mentioned in the latest TNMS, there are a few
different meanings for "moving pictures" in the album
cover. The ones I've found are
1: The old lady is crying, she's been moved by the
   pictures.
2: The pictures are moving because the men are carrying
   them to the house.
3: The pictures are moving from a place to another,
   probably from an art gallery to another.
4: The film crew is making a moving picture.

Any other ways to find moving pictures from the CD cover?

By the way, I think the people are rather desperate in
finding candidates for the best rock instrumental. I
mean, Masquerade by Yes as a possible winner. Oh my god,
what a farce! After all, the song consists of Steve Howe
fingering his guitar. And if you ask me, the song is
absolutely terrible. Where's my thing isn't a lot better..
I don't know about the rest. Anyone heard Eric Johnson
and the other candidates?

Earlier, I posted about some talking going on in La Villa where all you
hear is the drums in 7 right before Alex's solo. I hear a yell or
something in the background. (On CDs you can hear it, you'll have to
have a great turntable and LP to hear it, and tapes might work.) Can
anyone verify this?

Greetings Rush Fans,

  	I'm writing _again_ to ask for votes in a poll I'm conducting.
Excluding the members of Rush, I'd like to know who you, Rush Fans, consider to
be the best:1)Keyboardist 2)Guitarist 3)Bassist 4)Drummer and 5)Vocalist.  I
know polls have been conducted before, but they haven't seemed to be too
succesful.  That is why I am posting this announcement to ask for YOUR votes.
Besides, with a mailing list of over 1100(?) we should get a pretty good
idea of what Rush fans really like.  So how 'bout it, give me your votes.
Your votes can be e-mailed to: smm0264@ritvax.isc.rit.edu
                               smm0264@ultb.isc.rit.edu

						-Sean Morrison
PS-  Depending upon the responce, I plan to post the results by 1 Febuary.
I know that many of you have just gotten done with your first semester.  I will
continue the poll long enough so that I will hopefully be able to collect your
votes as well.

Subject: hi

	Well, Rush is nominated for the Grammy award in the "best instrumental"
category. I won't get my hopes up. Didn't YYZ make the list a few years
back? They probably lost to some schlock-rocker then. If the judges are
as mindless as music is today, they'll pick Eric Johnson - the speed
demon. Now eric is good, but Cliffs of Dover wears thin after he
traverses the entire scale in the first second of the song. Now if the
judges are "with it" they still will pan Rush because they will find
that Where's My Thing is simply an isomorph of YYZ. The mood is the
same. The Sections are laid out the same, the droning, repetitive licks
are the same.
	I do sincerely hope they win, and I do like the song, and I jam to it
(it's not as hard as YYZ)  on guitar and keyboard, but it doesn't seem
like they have covered new ground on that track.
	Finally, the grammies are just another sensationalistic show and they
are so far from an accurate rating of music. Everybody knows Jackson
will appear, and Hammer and Paula, and every other synth-waste band ever
to hit top 40. The selection committee would rather give an award to Dee
Snider of Twisted Sister than to Rush. The general public wants to see
Guns 'n Roses, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slaughter, Poison, Metallica,
but to see rush there - even with them seems like a great contrast. I
won't watch because when YES, a band that has seen better days wins, or
Johnson wins, my guts will churn and I will be forced to crank my stereo
with Rush until the TV tube explodes.

	I hope I am wrong.
