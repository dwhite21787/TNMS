There was no digest for yesterday, Wednesday June 16.

And finally, I feel it's time for me to interject.  Really folks it seems a
lot of this racism discussion is getting WAY out of hand.  The S/N ratio seems
to be going in the wrong direction.  When posts are 10% Rush related (directly
or indirectly) and the rest 90% something having to do with person views
something is wrong.   So take it to email.

One last thing.  There are some interesting threads towards the bottom
of the digest (not related to sexism or racism, etc..) I wish to thank
those who contributed.

Comments?  Email me and I'll consider it.

Hmm. So now it's good to be racist, and nobody should speak, teach or learn
slang. Ohhhhhkaaaay ...

And I thought it was going to be a slow, dull summer without the *.edu

&gt;	Rush isn't sexist? This is the band who write songs like "Working

&gt;places..."                                    =8-P
&gt;	But who cares, anyway?

Actually, the examples you give are not sexist, they are just politically
incorrect by today's standards.  There *is* a difference.  But, like you said,
who really cares, anyway.  :)

I once saw a 1941 Ferrari "Red Barchetta" in a car museum in Reno, Nevada.
It was way cool.

&gt;Subject: Must be the heat.....these people are crazy!
&gt;
&gt;Somehow I get the feeling that the order of the world is falling apart
&gt;when one generation can't talk to another due to the language barrier...
&gt;I've seen grandparents unable to talk to their grandchildren because the
&gt;grandkids speak in slang and are unable to express themselves articulately
&gt;in any semblance of English.  Don't take this as a flame, 'cause it's not
&gt;meant to be one.  My point is that when slang such is this becomes accepted
&gt;as "normal" English, kids start having trouble expressing themselves
&gt;intelligently.  Okay?  (*grin*).

Actually, the problem is not that kids use slang -- the problem is that
different generations use different sets of slang.  One of the properties of
slang is that it is constantly evolving and splitting off into new tangents.
There was just as much slang around in my grandparents' day as there is now.
However, there are very few words in common between those two sets of slang.
It's hard for people to keep up with all the changes in slang.

&gt;&gt;So what does this have to do with Rush? Everything. No English
&gt;&gt;speaker alive today, native or otherwise, can fail to benefit
&gt;&gt;from the priceless contributions that black people have made to
&gt;&gt;the language - and, even moreso, to popular music. Rush, and all
&gt;&gt;of us, owe the speakers (and, yes, rappers) of black English a
&gt;&gt;tremendous debt. Neither they, nor the words they use, have ever
&gt;&gt;been "junk."
&gt;
&gt;Well, I think that I could live a normal life if "soul speak" had never
&gt;been invented....I would hardly say that rappers have advanced the English
&gt;language with their often homophobic, racist, crime-littered verse.  Just
&gt;my feelings, again no flame intended.  Yo mama indeed. (*grin*)

A person can only benefit from slang if it helps him or her communicate
with another person.  Personally, I use a lot of slang because it is fun.
However, there I have never *needed* to communicate with slang, so I have
never actually benefitted from using it.  However, I can imagine situations
where using slang would help me communicate with other people...

&gt;Subject: Sexism and Rush: an observation
&gt;
&gt;	Rush's lyrics may not (or may) be overtly sexist, IMHO they do think
&gt;in terms of strongly typecast gender roles (atleast their songwriting reflects
&gt;that: check out _War Paint_ on _Presto_). IMHO Part II, that makes them
&gt;sexist. Not misogynist, mind you (this comment for all impatient potential
&gt;flamers), but sexist. It is this one singular thing that convinced me
&gt;Rush was not really created by God on the eleventh day with a delayed
&gt;Entry.

I think that Neil is commenting on society's gender roles in the lyrics
of "War Paint".  I don't think that song actually endorses those gender roles.
Compare this song to "Vital Signs", for example, and you can definitely notice
a difference in the style that Neil uses.  In "War Paint", he is describing the
way people act, and in "Vital Signs" he is providing his opinions of how people
should act.  I hope you can see this too and change your mind about Rush being
sexist...

Subject: Non-Rush topics and Presto yak.

It seems to me that a lot of the mailing list's bandwidth is being
wasted with non-Rush stuff.  The subjects we've chosen are certainly
significant...subjects like what constitutes proper English and just how
sexist our favourite band happens to be, but the discussion seems to have
moved away from the three guys and their inflatable bunnies { ooh!  vinyl
bestiality  ;^&gt;  }  Maybe these debates should be taken to email where
their worthy discussion may proceed unfettered.

{ Is "unfettered" proper English?  Wait, wait, please email the response!  }

Now, so that I don't seem like a hypocrite....

I don't know why, but I've never been able to get into Presto.
Why doesn't everybody try to convince me just how cool it really is?

Subject: Post #2 Memo to lower office

Hey posting the MTV request letter again, have some signitures that are in
send more get more lets go can't fight the fight, witout the fire.

Hy Fellow e(M)pty(TV) Haters, and RushFans(Tm),

Today the long awaited Sample Letter to MTV/VH-1&lt;&lt;Take your pick they
Both Suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a basic letter to MTV and VH-1 concerning their abject lack of
musical taste and need to get a clue about what music is all about.

   [ You could also e-mail this letter directly to them, since Adam Curry now
     seems to have an internet address...			: rush-mgr ]

Dear [MTV/VH-1] program Director,

     I[We], the undersigned would like to make a comment on the programming
that is shown on MTV[VH-1].  We represent the fans of a Musical Group that
you seem to have forgotten exists, RUSH!!!!.  In our opinion it seems that
you have in recent years had something against airing videos, by this group,
or actually by any group that falls into the same sort of Music categories
(although we all know that RUSH!! is in a category all by itself) that Rush
fits into.  We can find no reason other than abject prejudice against this
oh so worthy band, that their music is not aired in the volume and with
the respect that they so richly deserve.
        We ask that you please take note that this group released the CD
Roll the Bones Back in 1991, and to the best of my[our] knowledge the videos
from this album got minimal air play at best and never in prime viewing
hours, for critical exposure.  The One time I the writer of this letter
can ever remember having seen the Roll The Bones Video was at 3am in the
mourning.  You have in fact in all of the history of your channel not played
Rush at all well in your rotation.
        The usual comeback that I[We] would expect to hear is that you play
what is popular.  You and I[We] know a little better than that, you also
control what becomes popular by what you play.  It is my[our] contention
that if you bothered to play videos by Rush, you would see that many people
would watch and make requests to you that they keep playing strongly in
your rotation.
        The greatest threat that I[we] have seen is how fragmented your
programming has become recently.  There is a time for that sort of music,
and a time for this and that, unfortunately that tends to leave some music
with no place to go.  A second threat is that the music you play recently
is for the most part by bands that have sold out to commercialism, and basic
public ass licking.  Bands that are rated more on looks and ability to
achieve the "right" sound than to make good music.  Some of the music is not
even played by the people performing, rather there is a group of men/women,
who stand in front, sing, dance and look good while some nameless band in
the background does all the work.  You are promoting the idea(and making it
seem to work) that anyone can get into music.  Instead the Idea that it takes
hard work, talent, and perseverance should be what is promoted.
      The point has to be raised that there are a great many bands that
would have never made it had MTV not been there to make their career ,in
music painless and easy.

This section specific to MTV:
       The slogan that you use of late is "The Music Revolution of the 90's
will be televised".  The question is the revolution of who's choosing,
who is to be the guidance of the direction this revolution will take.
I personally think it should be the listeners and watchers, of the music.
Evermore I find that it is instead MTV, and the Record Companies money
that will be the guidance of this revolution.  To put it bluntly, anyone
willing to kiss enough ass and pass out enough green, can make it in music
today.
      This is wrong, we the audience should decide what we want to see, or
listen too.  We do not need to be told what to like and have it forced down
our throats.  It seems actually that you as a station have given up on Rock,
it is not often that I flip by MTV and see a Video that is not Rap, Hip Hop,
Dance or some of that sort of Garbage.  I'm sorry, but when one sees the same
video on for the 8th time in as many hours, one get disappointed.

This Section for VH-1:
        A prime example of your passing over of Rush is the A-Z music
marathons, or what ever you call them.  Rush is not included in these
ever!!  There are plenty of Rush Videos that would fit rather well in the
context of this program and you throughout the program more or less say
that I includes just about every band that ever bothered to make a video,
you include Queen, why not Rush?

Back to the letter in general:
        I the writer of this letter, listen to a station in Boston WAAF
107.3Fm, as I listen to the station it occurs to me how few of the songs
I have ever seen videos for on your channel.  I know videos exist for
a great deal of these songs, a trip to the store proves that.  Where are they?
Why do I never see them on your channel?  Oh, I know, no $$$$ from the
record companies.
        Alright to make a point in here somewhere, Rush will be releasing a
new CD in the coming months, as I'm sure you know, but are ignoring.  It would
be nice to see some video footage come out of you channel when the videos
for these new songs are made.

Thank you,

The undersigned Rush Fans.

   My idea on how to use this letter,
Print it out customize as you see fit for either MTV or VH-1,
Sign it(on a separate page),and get as many other people to sign it as you can.
Signatures should include as much of the following info as the signer is
willing to give.
Name    Address     Internet Mail Address  Phone #

Then send it back to me,
I will edit all of the changes, and additional ideas together into a new
letter , put it together with the signature pages and mail them off to MTV
and VH-1 shortly before Critical Mass is to be released.
Please remember to maintain separate signature lists for VH-1 and MTV as photo
copies usually don't count very well.
I figure if the signature arrive in one envelope, at the same time it will

have more force.

Please send submissions to:

Subject: REALLY obscure Rush reference in translated 'Appleseed'

Here's my entry into the most obscure Rush reference:

For readers of Japanese comics, the English translation of the 'Appleseed'
book four manga has just been released by Dark Horse Comics.  In the
Epilogue, the two main characters, Deunan and her lover Briareros, are
sharing in an expensive bottle of wine they charged as an expense to their
employeer.  The date on the wine was 2112.

Obscure, eh?  :)

From: Mike Smith &lt;spawn@netaxs.com&gt;
Subject: My last words on the following subjects...

1. English
   -------

   At what point did I say I was perfect? I've recieved about 10 letters
now, not including postings in the NMS correcting various spelling and
grammatical errors in my posting. I didn't sit down to write it with the
thought in mind, "I'm writing something very serious and important here,
so I'd better make sure everything's correct." I wrote it very informally,
at 4am EDT. I wanted to make a lot of points, and the letter rambled on.
The main point seems to have evaded the majority of the readers of this
mailing. I thank the few who were able to get out of it, what I was trying
to suggest. That being "Let it go for God's sake and discuss RUSH". The
letter which started this entire thread was nothing more than an
afterthought, not even the main body of the letter I'd submitted. Yet
nobody addressed the actual letter, which did deal with Rush, and the NMS
itself in particular. It served only to give you MORE things to ramble
about that are of no importance. The ONLY point to what I said in that
afterthought was that the person who didn't know what "homeboy" meant,
need not worry about it, because it was garbage (i.e. SLANG). I just
happen to use the words "garbage english" instead of slang sometimes. I
don't deny using a fair amount of it myself. Nor have I ever tried to say
I was perfect, and don't make spelling or grammatical errors. Those who
felt the need to point them out, are rather immature, and seem to me to be
adopting an attitude of "Neyh! See, you screwed up too, you're not
perfect!" Never said I was friends!

2. Racism
   ------

   I had thought I'd explained myself clearly, I see it needs further
explanation. Racism is NOT bigotry, or prejudism. Look the words up, yes
they're part of the "language". The dictionary will ......

   [ Blah blah blah.. LOOK people this has NOTHING to do with Rush, your
     personal interpretation of racism is that, take this #$^@#$# stuff to 
     email.  Apparently you already have as I'm starting to get email
     from people who are complaining about your flames with them in email.
     Keep this stuff of the digest.  Thank you..        :rush-mgr ]

3. THE WHOLE BLASTED POINT AGAIN!
   -----------------------------

   Once again I'm going to come around to the point of the original
posting, the subsequent responses, and this final posting. The topic of
this newsletter (I guess that's what it is, mailing list doesn't seem to
sound right). Is RUSH. And some of you might think that it's cool to sit
around and bash each other over the head about the stupidest little minute
detail. There are however those of us who are sick of reading it. If
that's what it's come to, if there is so little about Rush left to be
discussed, even with the forthcoming new album... Then perhaps it's time
to close down the newsletter, and save the airways for something else? I
don't know about anyone else, but aside from a very few segments from the
NMS, I could do without the whole thing. 

   [ The address to unsubscribe is listed freely for everyone who wishes.
     It's true that the digest gets kinda dull once and again but that's
     what happens when the band's not on tour or there's not much news
     really.  Can we spell rehash?                       :rush-mgr ]

The FAQ is interesting, and some
people have something interesting to say, but by and large, it's all been
nonsense. I'd furthermore like to add this, if you MUST respond to this,
send me mail directly, don't add to the already ludicrous amount of
worthless chatter in the newsletter with more nonsense about this subject.
If you do, I will not respond to it, and more than likely, I'll just
cancel the newsletter. It's boring people! And let's think about this,
what if one or all of the members of Rush are reading this? How do you
suppose they're going to feel, seeing that we can't find enough
interesting things about their music to talk about, that we have to resort

Subject: Yes, it's another sexism post

For what it's worth, here's another vote from a man who agrees
that the "Tom Sawyer" cartoon-woman is sexist. My reaction when
seeing it has always been to just laugh - it's clearly intended
to be funny, and I wouldn't think of cheering such a thing. But
despite the offensive nature of the cartoon, neither this nor any
of the other examples raised are anything nearly serious enough
to convince me that Rush is a sexist outfit overall.

In a no doubt useless attempt to wind this thread down, I offer
the following as a tentative resolution of this matter:

Of the main arguments advanced so far, ALL are correct: Yes, the
cartoon is sexist. But no, it is hardly a very significant
example of the problem. (Certainly not enough to make me want to
drop TNMS or (horrors!) my allegiance to Rush.) And yes, sexism
is a significant issue, particularly in rock music, and is
a perfectly valid concern to discuss in this digest. (TNMS, if
anything, is generally short on substance - sometimes to its
credit, sometimes not. :) ).

Thanks to all who have sounded off on this. I've been enjoying
it.

Subject: My .02 cents worth.

Whewwwww.
          I guess I will never ceased to be amazed at what some people will
call sexist or racist.  This stuff is getting pretty boring.  This is not
meant to flame anyone, cuz I'm not interested in wasting time on flames.
But come on people.  Get a life.  You know, all this waisting of good NMS
space with indescriminant references to Rush be sexist or racist with any
of their material is about as off the wall as some of the pusillanimous
idiots out there who have tried in the past to accuse RUSH of being satanic.
Once again, as Neil put it, "people are good at seeing exactly what they want
to see".  Lets at least try to view things within their respective context
before we even try to assign a title such as sexist or racist.  Trying to
claim that reference to a drummer being "female", is a
Neil's reference to (female) drummer a sexist remark is about as accurate
as calling the song 2112 satanic.  They are both classical examples of
something taken out of its original context and used as a pretext for
something completely different than the original intent.  Sorry about the
long windedness of these sentences, but it is true.  These remarks going
back and forth about some of the content of Rush material being sexist or
racist have just as much of the lack of substance and even honest objective
interpretational conviction, as the idiots out there who dishonestly tried
to say Rush was satanic.  I am not going to go into definitions here even
though these unsubstantial claims out there are using their own home made
definitions for what they want to term sexist or racist.
But come on folks.
Things do have a specifice meaning if kept in their own respective context.
Oh well,  probably wasted my time.  Just hate to see perfectly good RUSH
space be subjected to such misinterpretation and lack of true stimulating
RUSH content.

Oh bye the way.   What was the name of that Internet address for Neil Peart 
again.  One of the best posts I've seen in a while.

     Hi everyone,

     I'm new to the list (a week since I subscribed), and have avoided
     to get into this 'Homeboy' thread -in fact, I don't consider it
     a Rush-related subject, which is *in theory* the original purpose
     of this list-.

     Just to put my two cents, I'd like to point out something: since
     I was born and live in Barcelona, and my mother languages are
     Catalan and Spanish, I think I have the authority to make this
     correction:

     - 'Hombre' is a spanish word that means 'man', NOT 'friend'.
       the correct spanish word for 'friend' is 'amigo'.

     - 'Homme' is french, and has the same meaning as 'hombre': 'man'

     - About whether 'homeboy' is a correct english word or not, I
       can't possibly be sure; but wasn't there a movie called
       'Homeboy' (Boxing stuff, with Mickey Rourke)?

Subject: New Album

It has become painfully obvious that there are a number of people who
actively participate on this mailing list for whom the new album couldn't
arrive soon enough.  Now with it having been pushed back a few more weeks,
into October, that only means three more weeks of these wonderful discussions.

I guess in these troubled times we are all wishing the world was a better
place.  Most people feel somewhat powerless to make a change.  So, like them
or not, these discussions (rap, sexism, etc.) are healthy.  They give people
a chance to speak their mind to a fairly large audience.  If even one person
is affected positively by the words of another, then some good has been done.
There are a lot of things in this world that I do not like, or am ignorant
about, or both.  It is my right, as it is everyone's, to like and dislike
what I choose.  It is also everyone's right to be able to speak their mind.
Whether they are speaking about black holes, black people, or whatever.  I
appreciate these discussions, as I hope most of you do.

End of sermon.

I'd still rather talk about silly meaningless things like what "1001001"
really means, etc.

Subject: Women with large chests DO exist

I didn't think I would be drawn into this thread, but here goes:

&gt;The fact that she's animated is completely irrelevant. Yes, I know the
&gt;difference between cartoons and real life. But there was a message being
&gt;sent here, and it was, "Looky, boys, here's a chick with really big
&gt;(you supply the terminology)." If the clip wasn't exploitative in the
&gt;context of the song, it certainly was gratuitous.

Anyone offended by the "Escape from Moving Pictures" video is being
ridiculous or hyper-sensitive or both.  No one would have complained if the
animated woman in the video was plain looking - with darker hair and a
not-so-prominent bustline.  But that's not how the animator decided to draw
her.  I've got news for everyone... Full figured blond women REALLY DO
exist... and that's just the type of person that the animator drew.  Do
those offended by the cartoon feel this way because you don't believe that
such women exist?

Here's a hypothetical for you.  What if the woman in the video was a
drawing of some well-known person who liked Rush?  For example, what if
Dolly Parton was a Rush fan, and she was drawn into the video?  Would you
consider the animator and/or the boyz sexist because Dolly has a large
chest?

I guess this is the point I'm trying to make.  Expecting an animator to
draw ONLY women with small bustlines is descriminatory.  It's like saying,
"Women with large chests should not be seen."  And it's ridiculous.

An individual's reaction to a picture or video is just that - an INDIVIDUAL
reaction.  A man is not sexist for preferring large-chested women to
small-chested women.  It is only his preference.  And a woman is not sexist
for preferring muscular men to skinny men.  It is only her preference.

We all have preferences, and the animator's was blond and large-chested.  If
you don't like it, don't go to Rush concerts.  But please don't label
someone a sexist because of his or her personal tastes.

All in my opinion,
Russ Arcuri

Subject: Love born via Rush music...a true story.

Howdy ya'll,

Don't be intimidated by the large size of my post...
It does have rush content you'll see below...
besides, it's summer, and there's only so much to talk about.

I can't quite remember, but I think I've been getting this digest since the
issues in the late 100's or early 200's.  Anyway, it's been a long time and
I like it very much.  As a result, I have a story to report that you might
find quite interesting and amusing (although I'm still bitter...)

On Sunday, June 12th, I Spent a wonderful afternoon rollerblading around the
downtown section of my little East-Bay, California town.  Granted, blading
is not the most mature thing in the world, and I hadn't been wearing a shirt
and I have a killer tan from the lunchtime soccer league I'm in, so I looked
somewhat like a kid, I guess.  (I'm a 25 year old theoretical physicist).
After having my butt pinched not once, but on two separate occasions
by high school girls who mistook me for a teenager, I was feeling pretty
low about my prospects of ever meeting an intellegent, professional woman
near my age.  Seriously, all the women I meet in the East Bay, if they aren't
single mothers are generally pretty much uneducated.  I guess all the bright
ones go away to school or work - and my workplace is, sadly, all male!!

Anyway, late in the evening on Sunday my landlady brought over one of her lady
biker (I mean a big ass Harley) friends who also had a tenant.  This tenant
turned out to be a gorgeous, 25 year old chemist who would be doing a summer
intership at the lab where I work.  Well, I kept my enthusiasm in check, but
I must say, she and I hit it off splendidly.  We talked alone for over an hour
about life, the universe, and everything.  In the end, I thought maybe this
old cynic could possibly be in love.  And the best thing of all,  SHE IS A
BIG RUSH FAN.  *fanfares and hoorahs!!!!* I finally met a genuine FEMALE
RUSH FAN.  At this point you can picture Mike Myers (sp?) as Wayne saying
with a manical gleam in his eye 'she will be mine, yes, she will be mine!'

To come to the point, we made a date to go see the Oakland A's play ball at
the Collesium on Tuesday, 15 June.  We got bitchin' seats 5th row behind 3rd
bass (I've never had seats that good for any of the 5 rush shows I've been to
over the last 12 years!!).  Things were going splendidly until the sixth
inning when we had finally finished laughing long enough to get back to a
serious conversation.  We were talking about past romances when she just
casually mentioned that it was only a year and a half ago that she met her
HUSBAND.  (say what?!?!!?!?!?!?)  She's been married for about 8 months and
still is not quite used to it.  Oh did she forget to mention that?  Anyway...

Well, it is one of the more memorable dates I've had, and about as successful
as any of them usually are.  Later that night we laughed about the whole thing
over cafe lattes (sp?) and agreed to go see Jurassic Park later this week.

Thanks for letting me get that off of my chest...I don't mean to turn this
(quasi)journal into a true confessions magazine, but for that breif instant,
I thought I'd found - ahh, never mind

Later ya'll,

Brent

Subject: bs in this newsletter

I am Babak Nivi a new member to this newsletter.

I do not understand what it is that you guys actually talk about.  You seem
to talk about every subject on earth except for Rush's music.  Let me remind
you that rush and any other band should mainly be appreciated for its music.
Rather than talk about their music, this is what you guys talk about

   [ As a new member I should inform you that a single (or even a few)
     readings of a digest(s) do not really represent what the NMS is all
     about.  Perhaps a look at past issues or some of the files in the ftp
     area from past digests/discussions would give you a better idea.  Like
     some things, it just takes time.  I'm sure the quality will be better
     once the tour starts or the album comes out :)        :rush-mgr ]

	1)sexism
	2)neil peart's toilet habits
	3)etc.

I don't mean to say that your various conversations are not fine, I mean to
say that you should appreciate Rush mainly for it's music.  It's fine to
read article about them in magazines and so on, but your emphasis should be
on their music.  After all, that is the ONLY reason that we like them.  Psycho-
analyzing Neil Peart's Modern Drummer articles is not the way to understand
and appreciate their music.

Contradictory to all that I've just said:

Yes, English is a versatile and is evolving like any other language but it is
not SLANG.  It is up to educated persons to choose how it is that they are
going to speak, to choose what grammatical constructions they are going to use,
and to accept or reject new words in the language.  There is such a thing
as Garbage English; not that there is neccesarily consensus on what that is.

Finally:

Let me say as a Rush fan and a drummer that Roll the Bones is the biggest
piece of shit that rush has ever ever produced.  Of course, I would buy a
Rush/Aaron Neville team-up album; but, Roll the Bones is so much toilet paper
that I wipe my butt with it.

   [ Oh boy!  Are you gonna get it now!  Go get 'em start flaming!  List
     members with a serious need to flame please note the email address.
     Perhaps, Babak a MUCH MUCH better approach to discussion is not simply
     stating your choice for alternate toilet papers, but to say why you
     don't like RTB!!!  Just thought I should warn you.    :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Musings, etc...

Hail Fellow Rushians!

Just a few musings to amuse you with...

Topic 1 : To Chris Schiller - Well said!!  I like the TV analogy and I find I
feel very much as you do.  When I don't want to read another post about rap,
sexism, etc. I just skip it.

Topic 2 : To John Lee - Nice sense of humor.  I liked it.  You got me hook,
line and sinker, since when I was reading your post the last few lines were off
the screen.  So, for a second there, I couldn't believe our luck.

  As for Presto in the car; it's funny that you should mention that.  When
Presto first came out I lived in Texas and used to drive out to a friend's
house in the country on weekends (Hi Robert! :) ).  The first really good
listen I gave to Presto was on such a trip.  It was twilight on a warm, soft
summer day and I had the windows down.  It left an indelible mark in my memory.

Topic 3 : As for Presto itself, it seems, to me, that The Pass was maybe
written about someone near and dear to one of the boys.  Like maybe there was
some trouble between a parent and child.  I have children and the phrases like
'...don't turn your back on me and slam the door on me.' and '...Christ what
have you done...' are haunting.  Not being able to communicate with your child
about something troubling them and then the revelation of an action as a
consequence of that lack of communication is something that chills my blood.
Does anyone else get the feeling that this song is *very* personal?

  As I understand it, Eric Clapton wrote 'Tears In Heaven', for his son, as a
catharsis.  Do you think that Neil would do likewise?  Or would that be too
personal for him?

Topic 4 : I must be getting slow or something but I only just recently noticed
the pun on the cover of 'Permanent Waves'!!  What a gas!!  Am I the only one
who missed it?

Topic 5 : Can anyone give me a meaning to the phrase 'Can't you see/My tempera-
ture is rising/I radiate more heat than light' from the title cut off Presto?

That's all for now.  Y'all keep it coming.

C ya...

This is a reply to ssilton@polar.bowdoin.edu (Scott Silton) who made the

You've got a good point.  Although I'm not "bored to tears" by Tom Sawyer
(an amazing song!), I think da boyz could mix it up a little bit. I mean,
they've been doing these songs for years now!  I'd LOVE to see some more
impromptu jam sessions.  In all fairness, though, the RTB tour was the most
spontaneous tour I've seen (and I've been a regular since the Signals tour).
They messed around, they jammed, and they seemed to have a great time.

 Subject:      INTERNET FREE ACCESS THREATENED

 PLEASE FORWARD TO OTHER NETWORKS

 Most of you are probably aware of a plan to limit free use of
 INTERNET to "scientists" transmitting huge files and to start
 charging for e-mail.  Apparently, this is the result of private
 telecommunications interests putting pressure on the National
 Science Foundation.

 If this plan is realized, it will mean that the majority of the
 approximately 15 million users of INTERNET will be cut off.
 Sadly, this is occurring just when the potential of this network
 was starting to be realized.

 Something must be DONE.  We can not let private interests deprive
 us of access to INTERNET.

 I suggest that all concerned users register their protest/concern
 directly with Clinton and Gore via e-mail.  Their e-mail address
 have recently been posted and they are:

 Clinton= PRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV
 Gore = VICE.PRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV

 In addition, I also suggest that we identify the office in the
 NSF which is responsible for INTERNET and register electronic
 protests with them.

 Any help or suggestions would be appreciated, especially in
 locating the e-mail address for the office in the NSF.

From: Montreal Canadiens - 1993 Stanley Cup Champs! &lt;JMCNAMAR@ucs.indiana.edu&gt;
Subject: various (sorry)

A few various blurbs...

1.) CttH.  "And the men who hold high places..."  This is grammatically
correct.  If the subject's gender is not specified, the masculine form is
used.  A one-syllable word fits better here and "ones" is used in the next
line.  "And the people who hold high places" just doesn't flow as well.
NB.  No PC remarks here please.  Here in Germany some people use only the
feminine form when referring to many people who aren't necessarily all
female.  Works for me - it makes things a lot simpler.  Free examples
available on request.

2.) *** attempt to start a new thread alert ***  Where is the most
interesting (or least expected) place you have found Rush lyrics /
allusions / references?  I ask because yesterday I saw the refrain to
_Dreamline_ (without the source) in the men's room of the Anglistik
building here at the Freie Uni.  (Yes, I did add the author's name!)

3.) Limbaugh's given name is Rusty, I believe.  Rush is an uncommon
nickname like Geddy, if you want to look at it that way.

4.) So who would be the ideal intro person for _Tom Sawyer_?  How about
King Arthur from Monty Python's _Holy Grail_?  One, two, three, five!
Four, Sir!  FOUR!

ObHockey:  Les Canadiens win it all.  Again.  Stanley Cup #24, for those of
you keeping score at home.  GO HABS!!!  Where were the Broons?

All for now.  And if you like rap, well that's your business.  Just don't

Subject: The cartoon/sexism/nudity

Hi Rushians,

   I have'nt seen the controversial Tom Sawyer video which some of us perceive
as being sexist. But I hope that Rush do not repeat such things because it
seems so much different from the usual attitude that the guys have towards
such matters. Neil Peart himself says he deliberately avoids using topics
like love/sex  in his songs because such topics are so over used. That being the
case, using the female anatomy (even in a cartoon) is something only groups
which much less calibre and talent (IMHO) would resort to. I for one do not
expect this of Rush. So it came as a big shock to me.

   As for our feminine friends being upset about this cartoon, I perfectly
understand their feelings. It all comes down to the same question - Is nudity
(female,especially) exploitative of people ? Now, some of us might feel that
why make all this fuss about just a cartoon. But then again, the issue is the
same. There are so many groups which literally "exploit" females, writing songs
which treat women as objects, and not as human beings. And all of this stuff
is certainly not about love and using nudity and sex in that context. The same
kind of crude stuff appears in porn magazines. I don't mean to have a "holier
than thou" attitude and in fact  have enjoyed glancing through such magazines.
At the same time, I always felt guilty because it seemed exploitative and I
eventually controlled the habit.So, I think it is perfectly reasonable for
some of us to feel disappointed with Rush on this count.

    I would like to add something more, though this is strictly non Rush
content.In most countries where nudity/pornography is banned or restricted
the status of women  in soceity is worse than in places where it is'nt. In
some Islamic countries, where pornography is forbidden, women can't even
drive cars. In places like the U.S and a lot of other western countries, where
porn is tolerated, (IMHO) women are better off. I have heard from some friends
that in very liberal places like Scandinavia ( where pornography is hardly
a big deal), women are well represented in business and government. Seems like
the choice is really between nudity/exploitation and no nudity/total 
discrimination. I would like to know if any countries are exceptions to this 
rule.

Thanks for reading through.

ok, i have kept quiet up to now, but.....

will you guys lighten up??!!? maybe neil mentioned that she was a woman
drummer because female drummers are not that common, and he probably
doesnt talk to too many female drummers, so it stuck in his mind??

i can think of a lot of words to describe the guys, but "sexist" isnt one
of them!!

Subject: Force Ten

Hi Rushians,

I noticed two lines in the lyrics provided for Force Ten that don't
seem to be in the song; I am not sure though.

The lines are:

rising falling at force ten
we twist the world and ride the wind.

I tried to check by listening to Force ten both on HYF and ASOH and
could 'nt hear them on either. Can someone enlighten me on this?
I am sorry if this question has been asked before.

   [ These are said in the background and kind of hard to hear, just before
     they go into the guitar solo.				: rush-mgr ]

After reading the ongoing discussion about the sexist nature of the Tom Sawyer
cartoon, i agree with the guys/girls who say that no matter how trivial
or funny the cartoon is, there is no escaping the fact that it is
sexist and so unlike Rush. Ideally, their videos should be gender neutral and
"spiritual" as their songs have been.

There are a lot of groups which talk about love and sex. And sometimes,
most of them wilfully use words that are sexist. But in some cases, the
humor in the lyrics kind of obscures the sexism (Maybe I am in a delusion).
One such group is Jethro Tull. They talk about girls quite a bit in
their songs and their portrayal of women IMHO seems to be slightly
stereotypical. But (again, IMO) their lyrics are of very good quality
and the humor is great.Check out "Crest of a Knave" for evidence.

Thanks for reading through.

&gt;ADJECTIVE TO DESCRIBE SUBDIVISIONS:
&gt;
&gt;Quite some time ago I read in an NMS issue where somebody was trying to come
&gt;up with the right adjectives to describe the above mentioned song.
&gt;How about "Hauntingly powerful"?  I think that might hit pretty close to
&gt;home, eh?  Not quite perfect, but still pretty close.

How 'bout unfriggingbelievable?  The first time that I ever heard this song
was in concert.  I just about made in my pants from the power of the song!

&gt;From: Tracey &lt;TMCCART3@UA1VM.UA.EDU&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Mr. Smith, before you presume to lecture on standard White Man's English,
&gt;I'd like to suggest that you go out and buy a good dictionary, or at
&gt;least use a mailer with a spell checker. I simply cannot believe that
&gt;someone who can't spell or use a comma correctly has the unmitigated
&gt;gall to ramble on ad nauseum about "garbage words." Your post may have
&gt;been one of the least literate I've ever seen, and that's saying something
&gt;on this particular list.

All right, now this will be juicy....I really don't think that ad hominem
attacks will prove anything about your point.  Case in point, your attack
on Mr. Smith.  His misspellings don't negate the power of his arguement.
Neither do your ad hominem attacks.  I would suggest that you make your
point with a logical arguement and leave the ad hominem attacks for the 
unschooled.

&gt;Last and least:

&gt;&gt;From: ahung@discover.wright.edu (The Sun Dog)

Well now, nothing like a good finger-pointing ad hominem attack to prove
your point, eh?  I'll treat you and your views with as much respect as I can.
I would appreciate it if you would accord me the same courtesy.

&gt;Once again, living proof that some people Just Don't Get It. Is it
&gt;not plain how "showing some busty video babe" discriminates on the
&gt;basis of gender? When was the last time you saw a *man* objectified
&gt;to that degree?

I believe that this is known as begging the question.  You're arguing
that "it's discrimination because it's discrimination".  All you have
drawn are conclusions without any premises.  The last time that I saw
a man objectified to this degree was this morning when I was eating
breakfast and watching tv.  I saw a Levis commercial with some half
naked guy baring his pecs while wearing Levis.  Oh, perhaps you've never
seen it because you object to the use male/female attributes to sell
a product or tell a story.

&gt;Once again, living proof that some people Just Don't Get It. Is it
&gt;not plain how "showing some busty video babe" discriminates on the
&gt;basis of gender?

Also, I believe that now would be as good a time as any to clear up our
terminology so that we stand on common ground.  Sexism is discrimination based
on sex.  If two people qualify for a job and I hire the less qualified man
over the woman, then I have committed a sexist act.  Sexism is not (in my book),
the differentiation of men and women into two separate groups.  Otherwise, using
separate bathrooms and locker rooms for men and women is sexist.  Separate 
clothing styles for men and women is also sexist by this definition.  Face it, 
men and women ARE separate and very different type of animals.  You are 
telling me that it's wrong to notice that a woman is a woman and not a man.  
If that is so, then we should quit having separate locker rooms and styles of 
clothing and so forth......

If you feel that the Tom Sawyer video is exploitative, then say that.  But if 
you feel that noting the difference between men and women is wrong, then be 
ready for me to come walking into your bathroom or locker room....Eeek, what a 
thought.  By the way, I DO feel that the video is kind of gratuitous.....If 
only you'd said that in the first place, we probably could have avoided all of 
this garbage...

If you feel the need for more discussion, let's go the e-mail....It's bad enough
that we've wasted all of this space with out little discussion.  Okay?


    [ YES!!! Please make my life easier, certainly we can all see when a
     discussion leaves the realm of relevance where Rush is concerned.  Take
     your personal differences to email.  I thank you.     :rush-mgr ]

I would like to apologise for posting this completely non-Rush related note to
the NMS. I would have posted it directly to Puanani, but I can't find her
address!

   [ If you're having trouble finding someone on the list, send me mail and I
     can usually find their address for you.			   : rush-mgr ]

Puanani, I would like to thank you for referring to British English as just
that, and not English English (if you know what I mean). In my experience the
vast majority of North Americans refer to the whole of Britain as England. I
remember one American I used to know saying that he'd been to Edinburgh...in
England. It is, of course, in Scotland.

Thanks again. You've restored my faith in humanity! By the way, do you get
'Whose Line is it Anyway' in the States now?

Catch you later
