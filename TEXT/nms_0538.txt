Subject: FAQ: Rush Fans Common Questions [1/2]

Rush Fans Frequently Asked Questions List, Part 1 of 2
Generated: Sun Oct 11 00:30:17 PDT 1992

   This file contains questions that seem to crop up frequently in The
National Midnight Star and alt.music.rush.  If you received a copy of
this file in email, other than as an issue of TNMS, it is probably
because you asked one of these questions.

   This file has been expanded into 2 files because some mailers have
problems with files that are longer than 60K.  Part 1 contains general
questions about the band.  Part 2 contains questions inspired by
specific albums and songs.

   If you want a copy of the current version of this file, email me and
I'll send you the most recent version.  This set of files is posted on
the 2nd and 4th Sunday of each month to rec.music.info,alt.music.rush, and
TNMS.

   If you have any suggestions for additions to the list or corrections,
please send them to me at dan@rat.csc.calpoly.edu and I'll add them in
if you have documentation supporting your theory.  Also, don't send
your suggestions to rush-mgr@syrinx.  I'll repeat that because it's
important.  Don't send faq suggestions to the moderator of the Rush
fans mailing list.  He doesn't have anything to do with keeping the
faq up to date.  Faq suggestions should be sent to me at
dan@rat.csc.calpoly.edu and not to the mailing list moderator.
If mail sent to dan@rat bounces, try dan@polyslo.csc.calpoly.edu or
dan@garden.csc.calpoly.edu - they should work.

I'd appreciate it if people who submit questions submit anything they know
about possible answers, since I don't have all of the answers myself!

THE FAQ IS A FILE OF FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT RUSH AND THEIR
ANSWERS.  IT IS NOT AN "OBSCURE RUSH TRIVIA" FILE.
Please consider this before sending me a suggestion for an addition.

I'll repeat that because it's important and people don't get it.
THE FAQ IS A FILE OF FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT RUSH AND THEIR
ANSWERS.  IT IS NOT AN "OBSCURE RUSH TRIVIA" FILE.
Please consider this before sending me a suggestion for an addition.

I know that it's fun to come up with pet theories for how things
are related to each other.  But please don't send them to me saying that
"It *can't* be a coincidence!"  I routinely ignore such email.  Send me
a reference to an interview or a quote or something from a band member
that supports what you say, and I'll be happy to add it to this file.
If you have a pet theory that you want feedback on, post it to TNMS
or alt.music.rush.

For example:  Don't point out to me that 1001001 in binary is equivalent to
73 decimal, and 73 decimal is ASCII for the letter "I", and the letter "I"
was significant to the plot of Ayn Rand's _Anthem_, and Neil Peart read
lots of Ayn Rand, therefore "The Body Electric" is a reference to _Anthem_.
Believe me, you won't be the first to point that out.  But Neil Peart has
never said anything on that particular subject as far as I know, so I'm
not going to put that into the FAQ.  (Especially since I think it's
a coincidence!)  Remember, coincidences happen, even in Rush songs!

DISCLAIMER: The information in this file is accurate to the best of my
knowledge, but I'm not perfect.  If you have an answer to one of these
questions that doesn't match the one given here that you can verify, let me
know, and I'll put it in.  But if you make a bet based on this
information and you lose, don't blame me.

One more thing: If you send me mail and I don't answer right away, please
be patient.  I eventually read all of my mail.  However, Rush FAQ related
stuff has a lower priority than my job.

Here are the questions I get asked the most, so I'll put them here at the
start:

What is The National Midnight Star?

   It's a Rush fans newsletter that is distributed via email.
   Submissions are all sent to one address, and the moderator goes through
   the submissions periodically and sends out a digest containing lots
   of submissions.

   (If you don't know where the name "The National Midnight Star"
   comes from, that means you don't watch enough Canadian TV.)

How can I subscribe to The National Midnight Star?

   Send email to rush-request@syrinx.umd.edu asking to have your name added
   to the list.  Don't send email to me - I can't add you!

   I'll repeat that.  I (dan@rat.csc.calpoly.edu) have absolutely nothing
   to do with the management of TNMS.  I can't add your name to the
   subscription list.

Latest Word on the next album:

   The band is scheduled to go into the studio in January or February
   1993.

   ftp.uwp.edu (131.210.1.4).
   {according to datta@cs.uwp.edu, at least.  I haven't looked.}

   Additionally, several collections are available: {sorry - no catalog 
                                        numbers, as I don't have these.}

   Archives (includes _Rush_,_Fly By Night_, and _Caress Of Steel_)
   _RUSH_ Through Time
   _Everything Your Listeners Ever Wanted To Hear By Rush But You Were 
   Afraid To Play_ - this collection was targeted at radio stations.
   It was never officially released, and is extremely rare. It's a
   selection taken from FBN, CoS and 2112.

   _Rush - Profiled!_ - This CD was released to radio stations and
                        is rather rare.  It contains recordings of quotes
                        like "Hi, this is Alex Lifeson of Rush, and
                        you're listening to the magic of radio."  that a
                        DJ can put on as a promo between songs.  It also
                        contains quite a few tracks of band members
                        answering questions.  The questions are printed
                        in the liner notes, so a DJ can ask a
                        question and play the CD of the appropriate
                        person answering that question.  The questions
                        are mostly about _Presto_, since this CD was
                        released shortly after _Presto_.

  * The Anthem release of ESL, available in Canada is [ADD], but
    the US CD is [AAD].  Some people have told me that their CD says
    [ADD] on the disc and [AAD] on the label.

Are these tapes available on laserdisc?

   According to the Barr Digital (a Seattle based mail order dealer in
   laser discs) database, available for ftp from cs.yale.edu in the
   pub/rec.video/BarrLDDB directory, there are laserdiscs for
   _Through The Camera Eye_, _Exit Stage Left_, _Grace Under Pressure
   Tour_, _A Show of Hands_, and the video single for _The Big Money_.
   The database also says that _Exit Stage Left_ was "discontinued 8/91."
   This does not imply that Barr has them in stock; this database is
   not Barr's inventory.  It is only a list of laserdiscs that have been
   made.  The file that I ftp'ed from cs.yale.edu had a Feb 26 1992
   time/date stamp, so I assume that this information is accurate as of
   that date.

   According to meg@syrinx.umd.edu, Chronicles is available on
   laserdisc in the US.  However, "Red Sector A" isn't on this
   laserdisc.

   Videos with the 'live' comment are concert videos; all others have
   studio soundtracks.  Some of these have minor edits to the soundtrack.

   CASSETTES:
   
   "Star Jam Series: Neil Peart Style"
   
   "Starlicks Guitar Lesson: Alex Lifeson Style"

   In the January 1986 issue of _Modern Drummer_ magazine, while discussing
    his appearance on the Jeff Berlin album, Neil says that he "...did a
    similar thing with a musician named Ken Ramm in Toronto.  That record
    was released in Canada."

   VIDEO:

   "1991 Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship Concert"  (Neil on a few songs)
   DCI Music Video

What was the first single released by the band?

   The A side was a cover of a Buddy Holly song called "Not Fade Away."
   The B side was a Lee/Rutsey song called "You Can't Fight It."
   These songs are not on any Rush albums.  If you want to hear them,
   you have to track down a copy of the single, which is very rare, or
   find somebody who has the songs on tape.  There is no collection
   for sale that contains these tracks.

I just bought the CD of &lt;Exit...Stage Left | All The World's A Stage&gt; and
it's missing a track!  Is a complete version of this CD available?

   No.  But if you absolutely have to have everything on CD, the 2 missing
   tracks are on _Chronicles_.

Has &lt;song&gt; ever been performed live?

   The 1st anniversary issue of TNMS contains song lists for each tour
   Rush has done up to _Presto_.  This is issue 99, available for ftp at
   syrinx.umd.edu.

What is Battlescar/Max Webster, who plays on it, what is the label/catalogue 
number for the Universal Juveniles CD?  Where can I write to get it?

   Max Webster is a Canadian band that used to open for Rush.  Battlescar
   is a song from their _Universal Juveniles_ CD that was done as a duet
   of the 2 bands.

Have any books been written about the band?

   People have sent me the names of books of Rush sheet music, but
   I'm not going to include those because there are too many of them
   and this file is getting far too large.  Besides, they really aren't
   about the band.

I heard that Neil Peart was going to publish some of his writings.  Has
this been done?  Can I buy this book?

   No, not yet.  Neil hasn't published yet.

I heard something about a Rush comic book.  What comic book was it?

   That was Defenders #45. It was dedicated to Geddy, Alex, and Neil of
   Rush on the first page. The story has an anti-collectivist theme to it.
   Since it was printed Mar 77 it makes sense that it would draw from
   2112 (however vaguely).

   The villian (Red Rajah) says, at one point, "Truth is false and logic
   lost, seek the Rajah at all cost".

Somebody posted &lt;item&gt; in TNMS.  I missed it - could somebody
please send me a copy?  Does anybody have the lyrics to &lt;song&gt;?

   An archive server is running at server@ingr.com.

   The address of this archive file server is:
   
      UUCP'ish:  ...!uunet!ingr!server
      ARPA'ish:  server@ingr.com
   
   The following is the help file for this server.

   === HELP ==========================================================

   Dragon has a number of features that are available to most people.
   Mail based archive server, anonymous ftp, email list subscriptions,
   and such.  Some features are reserved for Intergraph people only
   due to the nature of the beast.

   To subsribe to an email digest or list, read the following text
   concerning the /SUBSCRIBE command.  A list of lists is in the
   appendix at the end of this help file.

   If you wish to make files available or create an email digest,
   please contact fordke@ingr.com or send a message via the server per
   the instructions provided below.

   For those with access, you can use anonymous ftp to fetch files
   from the server.  Simply FTP to dragon and log in as "anonymous" or
   "ftp".  No password is necessary.  The /pub directory is where the
   archives are stored.

   The archive server will allow you to retrieve items via electronic
   mail, subscribe to email lists, and more.  It has limited error
   detection, so study this help file before sending a request.  The
   server processes requests only once per day.  This is generally
   during the very early morning hours in the US.

   To make the archive server do something you should send an
   electronic mail message to server@ingr.com.  The body of the
   message should consist of one command per line.  The case of the
   text does not matter.  /SEND INDEX == /sEnD iNdEx

   Command keywords always have a forward slash '/' character for a
   prefix.  Lines without this prefix are ignored.  Commands are
   interpreted and put into action as they are encountered when
   parsing the message from top to bottom.

   We currently have the local Rush/SOL/APP archives from node bisbee,
   a partial mirror of the SIMTEL archive, and a mirror of the Rush
   archives at syrinx.

   === COMMANDS ======================================================

   /HELP
   -----

      Sends you this text explaining the server commands.

   /ADDRESS &lt;address&gt;
   ------------------

      This becomes the active address for your request.  It overrides
      any previous address specifiers.  This must be a valid domain
      style address by which you can be reached.  If you have any
      doubts about your mail address, you should ask your system
      administrator for a correct domain style address.  Use this
      command if you are not sure that the 'From:' and 'Reply-To:'
      addresses generated by your mail system are reliable.  [/PATH]

   /SUBSCRIBE &lt;list&gt;
   -----------------

      Subscribe the active address to an email list.  A list of
      currently available lists is presented at the end of this help.
      Some of the lists are restricted.  [/SUB]

   /UNSUBSCRIBE &lt;list&gt;
   -------------------

      Unsubscribe the active address from an email list.  A list of
      currently available lists is presented at the end of this help.
      Some of the lists are restricted.  [/UNSUB]

   /WHO &lt;list&gt;
   -----------

      Show addresses of subscribers to an email list.  A list of
      currently available lists is presented at the end of this help.
      Some of the lists are restricted.  [/LIST]

   /LIMIT &lt;bytes&gt;
   --------------

      Specify the maximum number of bytes which may be sent in a
      single mail message.  Transfers exceeding this amount will be
      split into several messages before sending.  A value of 0 means
      that there is no limit.  The archive server has a default size
      limit of 100000 bytes.  You may change this if you know that you
      have different limits.  Most (but not all) uucp sites have a
      limit of 100000 bytes.  CompuServe accounts have a 60000 byte
      limit on mail.  Internet and Bitnet sites should set this to
      300000 bytes.  [/SIZE]

   /QUIT
   -----

      The remainder of the message is ignored.  This can be useful if
      a long signature is appended to the message.  [/END,/EXIT]

   /SEND &lt;item&gt;
   ------------

      The specified &lt;item&gt; is looked up in the file list.  If found,
      it will be sent to you by email.  Binary (8-bit) items are
      uuencoded before sending.  The /PACK and other commands affect
      this command.  You must specify the item as directory/filename.

      NOTE: use forward slashes '/' only

   /RESEND &lt;item&gt; &lt;part&gt; [&lt;part&gt;...]
   --------------------------------

      Resend the indicated &lt;part&gt;s of this &lt;item&gt;.  This is useful if
      not all parts of a multi-part transmission arrived correctly.
      When resending, the /PACK and /LIMIT used must be identical to
      those of the original transmission.  This information should be
      on the 'BEGIN' line of one of the received parts.

      NOTE: use forward slashes '/' only

   /UUSEND &lt;item&gt;
   --------------

      This command is identical to the command /SEND except that the
      &lt;item&gt; is guaranteed to be uuencoded.  This is useful if you
      know that the return message will go through EBCDIC based
      computers.

      NOTE: use forward slashes '/' only

   /UURESEND &lt;item&gt; &lt;part&gt; [&lt;part&gt;...]
   -----------------------------------

      This command is identical to the command /RESEND except that the
      &lt;item&gt; is guaranteed to be uuencoded.  This is useful if you
      know that the return message will go through EBCDIC based
      computers.

      NOTE: use forward slashes '/' only

   /PACK &lt;type&gt;
   ------------

      Change items compression to this &lt;type&gt; which will affect all
      SENDs and RESENDs (and UU versions) from this point on until
      another PACK line is encountered.  Choices are NONE, Z, COMPRESS,
      and ZIP.  [/ARCHIVER]

   /INDEX
   ------

      Sends a list of the items with sizes, dates, and descriptions.
      This list is sorted by directory and then by filename.  It has
      the same effect as the command /SEND INDEX.   [/FILES]

   /MESSAGE
   --------

      Send a message to the administrator of the server.  The
      remainder of the message will be sent, without parsing for
      additional commands.  [/NOTE]

   === APPENDICES ====================================================

   1.  Requests are queued and processed once per day during the
       early morning hours of the US.

   2.  The current list of available lists.  (* restricted)

         dragon ----- available services
         pc --------- MSDOS pc related

   3.  There is no /TEST command.  All email sent to the Dragon Server
       will have a log report sent in response after processing.


   { End of mail-server help file }

   Additionally, an FTP site has been established.  There are several
   read-only directories containing informational files, plus a directory
   for uploading files into.

    The address to ftp to is:

    syrinx.umd.edu

       or

    128.8.2.114

   for those of you who don't have name resolution.  Once here, you will be
   prompted for a name (userid) and password.  Use "anonymous" for the userid
   and your userid for the password.

    Once you're logged in, 'cd' into the "rush" subdirectory.  Once there,
   you can list the files in the directory.  There is actually only one file
   (README) currently, the others being subdirectories.

    The directories available now are:

    "digest" - Contains back issues of the current incarnation of the
                digest from issue # 1 to the current issue;

    "lyrics" - Contains the lyrics for all the albums up through _Roll The
               Bones_.

    "names"  - Contains a recent (thought not always the latest-and-greatest)
               version of the subscription list; and

    "images" - Contains GIF and Rast format pictures of album covers and
               photos of the band members.

    "sounds" - A directory containing sound files in NeXT .snd or Sun .au
               format.

    "MacSounds" - A directory containing Macintosh-format sounds.

    "c64-sounds" - A directory containing Commodore-64-format sounds.

    "tab" - A directory containing guitar and bass tabs for various songs.

    "incoming" - A directory that's world-writable for uploading files to
                 Syrinx to be moved (by the digest manager) to one of the
                 other directories.  (If you upload something, PLEASE send
                 mail to the Syrinx administrative address to let the list
                 manager know!)

    "special" - Contains the longer items - interviews, articles, tour 
                lists, etc.  Any item warranting it's own file but doesn't
                fall into any of the other categories.

   To transfer a file to your machine, type
     get &lt;filename&gt;
   where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you want.  If you're on a Unix
   machine, do a 'man ftp' for more information.

   If you have questions about how to decode/view/use these files,
   ask your local system administrators.

   Any files in the subdirectories with a suffix of ".Z" are compressed; 
   you'll have to uncompress them on your end.  There is a Unix Shell Archive
   (shar) format file in the main directory named "compress.shar" which
   contains the source for the compress/uncompress commands.

   If you wish to submit something for a special edition posting, send it to
   the 'rush-request' address; if it's of general interest, it'll be a 
   special edition, and then placed in the "special" dir.  The same effect
   is created by uploading something to the "incoming" directory and sending
   mail to the 'rush-request' address and informing the rush-mgr it's there.

   Remember, if you don't have ftp capabilities at your site, there is still
   the mail server at "server@ingr.com".

What issue of TNMS is &lt;item&gt; in?

   This list isn't complete, and it probably contains errors.  Let me
   know, so I can fix them!

What is the marital status of the band members?

   In _Visions_, there is a group picture of all 3 band members and
   their wives.

I've heard &lt;rumor&gt; about &lt;band member&gt;.  Does anybody know anything about
the truth of it?

   These rumors have been popping up for quite some time now.  Here
   are some of the ones that have been shown to be wrong over the
   years by the activities of the band:

    - Alex is dying of cancer
    - Neil is dying of cancer
    - Geddy is dying of cancer
    - Geddy has throat cancer; he's not dying, but can never sing again
    - Geddy is going blind from stage lights.

What are the birthdays of the band members?

   Geddy Lee          July 29,1953 {according to _Visions_}
                                   {No, Geddy Lee's birthday is NOT June 29!}
   Neil Peart         September 12, 1952
   Alex Lifeson       August 27, 1953

But in "Thrice Told Tales", it says that Geddy's birthday is June 29!

   Well, every article written on the subject agrees that Neil Peart
   joined Rush on Geddy's birthday.  In _Visions_, Alex Lifeson says
   that Neil came down "on the second day of auditions."  It has also
   been documented in several places (_Visions_and "Thrice Told Tales",
   to name a few) that when Neil joined the band, he had about 2 weeks to
   learn the show before his first gig with Rush, which took place in
   Pittsburgh, opening for Uriah Heep.

   On June 28, 1974, Rush opened for ZZ Top in Cleveland.
   On July 1, 1974, Rush opened for Nazareth in Toronto, Ontario.
   On July 20, 1974, Rush played an "MZ Bennett summer dance."
   On August 14, Rush opened for Uriah Heep in Pittsburgh.  This was
    Neil's first show with Rush.

   Based on this information, I believe that the day that Neil joined
   the band, and therefore Geddy's birthday, is July 29, not June 29,
   and that the June 29 date is a typo.

   Geddy Lee said that July 29th was his birthday in an interview
   taped before the May 31, 1992 show in Mountain View, California.

What are the real names of the band members?

   Geddy Lee          Gary Lee Weinrib
                     { The book "Heart of Gold", a history of Canadian rock,
                       provides this as Geddy Lee's real name.
                       In 1971, Gary Lee Weinrib, Alex Zivojinovich, and
                       John Rutsey all joined CAPAC, the Canadian
                       writers/publishers/composers guild. }
   Neil Peart         Neil Peart
   Alex Lifeson       Alex Zivojinovic

How is "Peart" pronounced?

   It rhymes with "near", according to Neil on the "Rush - Profiled!" CD,
   so I assume that's the correct pronunciation.  I don't remember the
   exact wording off the top of my head, but the "Profiled!" CD contains
   a recording of Neil saying "Hi, this is Neil Peart of Rush."   That
   also agrees with the way Geddy pronounced "Peart" when introducing
   Neil's solo during RTB shows.

I heard that Neil Peart has a PhD in &lt;field of study&gt;.  Is this true?

   In _Visions_, Neil is quoted (on page 65) as saying that he is
   a high school dropout.  I don't see how he would have had time to
   go to school and get a degree, what with being in Rush and all.

Does anybody have an address I can use to write to the band?

   This address was posted to TNMS, but I can't vouch for the
   correctness of it.

                RUSH
                41 Britan St. (#200)
                Toronto, ON
                M5C 1R7, CANADA

   The Backstage Club will probably forward mail as well.

   _Modern Drummer_ magazine will forward mail to Neil. (or other drummers,
   for that matter!)

Who says &lt;phrase&gt; in &lt;song&gt;?

    Geddy says "One...Two...Buckle my shoe" in "In The End" on ATWAS.
    Neil does the narrative during "The Necromancer".
    I've never seen anything definitive saying who whispers in
      "The Twilight Zone."
    Neil does the "Attention all planets of the Solar Federation - We have
      assumed control" bit at the end of "2112".
    The deep voice at the beginning of "Cygnus X-1" is none other than
      Terry Brown.
    Neil says "Subdivisions" in the song of the same name,
      even though Alex is shown in the video and does it live.
    Alex says "That's nice" at the end of "Chain Lightning".
    We don't know who says "I will be the judge" and "Give the jury
      direction."  I did receive the following email on April 11, 1991
      on just this very subject:

    { Begin quoted text }
   &gt;Good day. I am a Rush fan who has access to an Amiga and a good quality
   &gt;digitizer.  I noticed that in the "Who says what" section of the FAQL you
   &gt;wrote that you don't know who says "I will be the judge" and "Give the
   &gt;jury direction."
   &gt; 
   &gt;Out of curiousity, I digitized that section of Show Don't Tell, and then
   &gt;played it back at the 'proper' speed. Although the main vocal track
   &gt;(Geddy's voice) was obviously too high, I could now hear the background
   &gt;vocals that were intentionally slowed.
   &gt; 
   &gt;The task was fairly difficult because of two reasons:
   &gt;1. The background vocals are very weakly mixed in comparison to the main
   &gt;   vocals, which makes it hard to distinguish the voice.
   &gt;2. The phrases are actually whispered, sampled, and then slowed down by
   &gt;   some factor.
   &gt; 
   &gt;All above statements coming to a conclusion with my submission to the
   &gt;FAQL issue: Neil whispers "I will be the judge" and "Give the jury
   &gt;direction" during Show Don't Tell.

   &gt;UC Davis.
   { end quoted text }

   According to Neil on the Dec 2 1991 Rockline, Geddy does the RTB
   "chat" section.

What is a Lerxt?

   A Lerxt is an Alex Lifeson.

Do the other band members have nicknames?

   Ged and Neil also have nicknames, Dirk and Pratt. Hence "Lerxtwood Mall",
   "Old Dirk Road" and "Pratt & Co." on the map on the back cover of Signals.
      -- from ano@uk.ac.rdg.cs.csres

What's the story behind Alex's "Hentor Sportscaster" guitar?

   "'Hentor' was the name that we had for Peter Henderson, the producer
   of Grace Under Pressure.  When he wrote his name out to leave us his
   number, it looked like Peter Hentor instead of Peter Henderson, so
   we nicknamed him Hentor The Barbarian.  I got some Letraset and put
   it on this white Strat that I had.  It has a Shark neck--these are
   unlabeled replacement necks--so I threw 'Hentor Sportscaster' on there. 
   Amazing all the mail we used to get over that [laughs]:
   'Where can I buy a Hentor?  How much does a Hentor cost?'"
              -- Alex Lifeson, in the April 1986 _Guitar Player_ magazine

Where did the name "Rush" come from?

   Paraphrased Background: In August of 1968 the band's formal lineup
   was Alex on guitar, John Rutsey on drums, and Jeff Jones on bass and
   vocals. They got a job to play at the "Coff-In", a coffee house
   in the basement of an Anglican Church [Great name, eh?] for $25/night.
   
   "The band was excited, but they had a big problem. While
   they had been dreaming of playing, they had neglected to come up with
   a name for their group. So a few days before the gig they sat around in
   John's basement trying to come up with an appropriate monicker. They
   weren't having much luck when John's older brother Bill piped up,
   'Why don't you call the band Rush' and Rush it was."
                           -- from _Visions_

Whatever happened to John Rutsey?

   "John's still around.  I see John quite often.  He gave up playing
   shortly after he left the band and went into bodybuilding.  He
   competed on an amateur level for a while, doing that for a few years,
   and has sort of been in and out of that, but he still works out, and I
   work out with him a few times a week at a local gym - at a Gold's,
   here in Toronto." -- Alex Lifeson, in the 2/6/89 Rockline interview
