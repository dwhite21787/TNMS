Subject: Counterparts Remaster?

Hello all,

Sorry if this has been addressed before, but was the Counterparts CD
remastered?  I haven't been able to find Counterparts in local record
stores, so I am thinking about ordering this through my music club.   I am
a little hesitant since my music club doesn't list this one as a remaster.
I would prefer the remaster if it exists.  Please let me know if it's been
remastered.  If there is no remaster, I'll order the CD from my club,
otherwise I'll have to keep searching the stores...

Thanks for your advice.
 -David.

On another note, the disk on which I had the file is now corrupt.  Could

Subject: Buenes Noches, Mein Froinds!

I was listening to a tape of 5-22-79 Chateau Neuf, Oslo yesterday and
noticed something interesting. After Alex's electrified Spanish guitar
riffs and shortly after he starts the softly repeating arpeggio part, I
heard the following over the PA: "Buenes Noches, Mein Froinds! Welcome
to La Villa Strangiato!". I've heard this before, but never could make
out what exactly was said. The reason is that it was heavily treated by
some sort of strange effect. The "Buenes Noches, Mein Froinds" part
sounds like it's playing at 16 2/3 RPM, then "Welcome to La Villa
Strangiato" sounds like it's being played at 78 RPM. What gives here? Is
this a sped-up tape effect, or is it one of the band members speaking
into the microphone while someone backstage plays with an effects box? 
	The same sort of effect happens during Cinderella Man, which I have on
a couple of tapes from the Drive 'Till You Die tour. In fact, it's on
the 2-19-78 Hammersmith tape, which I briefly reviewed here a couple
issues back. It appears during the brief pause before the solo break.
However I have no idea what is being said, much less by whom. Does
anybody know what is being said, and what effects are being used?

Yes, in my case, that's what I was concerned with; trying
to score points.  I'm not sure what you think the game is,
the one I try my best to play is "let's share our feelings
about stuff that goes on in the NMS."  I merely tried to
show how strange it is to suggest we pray for someone who
doesn't believe in "angels watching from above" in their
moment of despair.  Especially when the only way we know
that someone is through their writings, which include things
like the above snippet.  Think, people, think.

Did I say they should'nt post as they did?  No.  I simply
tried to point out what I found to be wrong with their posts.
But I forget, that sort of thing just simply isn't allowed
around here...

And it's natural for some to resist holding back their 
natural reaction to what they read, especially if they find
it distasteful.

So scroll the fuck down the screen when you come across 
someone's criticism of something they find distasteful, mate.
Practice what you preach, maybe?

In my case, duh, of course I knew there'd be a buttload of
appeals for us all to pray, cry, flog ourselves, etc., over
Neil's loss.  I got email right after my post from those who
said they were expecting such a post -- from me.

Right, keep it to yourself.  Apply this evenly to all, why
doncha?
 
And to the guy who said "keep quiet Nick, don't spread that
which you despise...":  touche'!  Please email me.  And if
rush-mgr went to the trouble of wiping any flames to me, well,
I'm terribly sorry to have put you through the trouble.  If
anyone's flame of me got wiped from the NMS, please feel free

Well .. i sent this post before to rush@syrinx.umd.edu and I'm guessing
it didn't go through ... but if you've seen this post once before ..
please forgive me  =)

I have an MP3 of the Tom Sawyer remix from the Small Soldiers soundtrack
available for download at my web site:

http://venus.aros.net/~geddy

I know a lot of you wanted to hear this but really didn't feel like
seeing the movie or buying a soundtrack full of songs you don't like. 
The remix isn't too bad although some parts of the song has a very "rap
song" sound to it.  This MP3 will only be available at my site until the
end of the month, so if you want it .. you'd better get it soon.

I have a website http://www.2112.net/powerwindows with 40 album art images for
download in 800x600 pixel format.  Every album cover (except for three: Caress
of Steel {I have a better one}; Chronicles; and Retrospective II), plus most
of the other album art.  I'd be happy to email any of these images to anyone
without web access.

Many of the images I had to alter/enhance to get to the proportions used by a
monitor.  For example, I added a second story to the building behind the
juggler on the liner notes of Hold Your Fire (my personal favorite image), and
moved the "stage players" on the cover of Exit...Stage Left closer together to
fit the screen (my second favorite!).  Let me know which ones you want, and
I'll send a zip file to you.  They are all JPEG's, so if you need BMP's or
another format, be sure to let me know.

NevrSilent@aol.com said: 
<<**Available Light"   Yet another album wrap-up song...and that sustained
guitar note as the song fades out is priceless...>>

While I realize the boyz fade some songs and abruptly end others for reasons
unknown to us, but does anyone else believe "Available Light" should have
ended with Geddy only with the final "In the Available Light......."  The
music should have stopped with Ged singing that last line.  Talk about
shivers!  There were, however, many other tunes on Presto with non-fade out
endings, and perhaps they didn't want to "over do it".

Also, I discovered recently that Rockies hurler Darryl Kile uses "Tom Sawyer"
as his walk to the plate music.  I wonder if he has a Rush shirt under his
jersey!

Subject: Tom Sawyer (Small Soldiers Mix)

Well, I went out and bought the Small Soldiers soundtrack.  I *hate* the
remix of Another One Bites The Dust, but I already told the Queen mailing
list that.  However, I *love* the remix of Tom Sawyer, and I was
wondering if anyone on here knows of any other Rush remixes I might be
able to pick up.  (The remix of TS is great, but it also makes one long
for the original...that makes it even better, I think...it doesn't try to
replace or out-do the original...only expand on it with new musical
ideas...)

So, if anyone happens to have (or would be willing to put together for
me) a bootleg of Rush remixes, I'd like the info very much.  Thank you.

Subject: Rush sighting

I light of the recent Neil posts (which, frankly, are making me sick...I
mean, we all know he likes his privacy...why the hell can't we give it to
him, and let him mourn in peace?????), I thought I'd try to lighten the
mood a bit with my latest (and best yet) Rush sighting...

I was drivin' down US 31 yesterday in my red Barchetta (ok, ok....teal
Cavalier...) with a mix tape that I made for my girlfriend in the tape
player (I just happened to put a few Rush tunes on there...  :) ).  So,
Yyz comes on, and I of course (being a drummer) start pounding away at my
steering wheel, drumming (rather outrageously, I might add) along to it,
while watching in my rearview mirror as the people behind me laugh at the
little show I seem to be putting on for them.  Rather than stop,
completely embarrased, I keep going (even more outrageously, probably,
without even realizing it), just to make sure the people behind me are
getting a good show (just like they would with the *real* Rush, rather
than one moron in his car... :) ).  After the song ends (these people
following me the whole song, and my hands sore from beating the steering
wheel so much), a semi drives past me on the right side of me, and, as it
drives past, as if some sort of reward for having put on a good show for
the folks behind me, I notice the name on the back of the truck:  RUSH
Trucking

I swear!!  I couldn't possibly make that up!!!!  (Anyone else ever seen a
RUSH Trucking semi?)

I suspect the reason has to do with dice being made from ivory, and ivory
coming from tusks, and tusks coming from elephants.  The butt-shot probably
represents what the elephant's feelings about this would probably be.... :)

PS: I don't know if dice are still made from ivory, but I'm pretty sure
they were at one time (at least).

There are a lot posts talking about "A real Rush fan this," or "A real
Rush fan that."  So what the heck is a real Rush fan. Well, a real Rush
fan will be able to sign the statement below.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I can communicate telepathically with the band.  That
is how I know that they will now 		call it quits and never
put out any more studio albums.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I hate Alex Van Halen

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I will believe exactly what Neil believes
philosophically, since he is a drum god.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I will never think ANY Rush songs are bad in any way.
 Furthermore, I will heap grief to any of 	those so-called Rush
fans who whould even think about doing so.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I will cast aside my own moniker and go by a
Rush-related name such as Lerxst, Rocinante, 	Broon, or Snow Dog. 
Furthermore, I will change my e-mail address to a Rush-related one such
as 		newworlddoubleagentcoldfire@aol.com.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I can find the answer to any of life's questions in
the lyrics of Rush songs.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I will NEVER skip any Rush songs when using my car cd
player.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I will act as the band's watchdog and correct anyone
who makes any incorrect statement 		regarding Rush.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I will not read NMS Issue 2112, because that issue
should not even exist, as a tribute  to the 	band.

As a TRUE RUSH FAN, I think everything Canadian is cool, because that is
where Rush if from.

i originally thought it was a belch from ged followed by one of the 
studio techs (or maybe ged himself) saying "keep rolling guys".  
apparently i was wrong.  most nms'ers and die-hard fanatics will argue 
that it's "hallo.....morning guv (gov)".  i think that someone once 
posted that a "guv" is a british term you use for either someone you are 
familiar with, like a friendly greeting.  i also heard it was like 
calling someone sir.  but being of italian decent, i have no f***ing 
clue, eh.  if somebody would be so kind as to correct me on this one....

also, i was listening to stern the other morning (tuesday morning, i 
think), and in the background i heard tom sawyer.  quite possibly the new 
remix of the song.  it was only in the background with him talking over 
it, so i'm not sure.  i did crank up the stereo and scream to my roommate 
that rush was on stern--a definite rarity and a true shocker.  a pleasant 
surprise, though.  in the past, i've heard stern bag on rush--one of his 
only flaws is that he doesn't appreciate these guys, imho.  his loss.  
but i'll still listen, cuz he says some funny-ass shit.  until next 
time....

Subject: Rush radio

I've been reading this digest for a few years now and I am stunned at the 
number of people who get excited that they actually heard a Rush song on the 
radio.  Does Rush get that little radio airplay?  Here in Houston, on 101.1 
KLOL, I hear them every couple hours.

Also, does anyone know where I can find information about how well they fill 
arenas nation/world wide?  Here in Houston, if you don't get tickets 
within a few hours of them going on sale, you miss the show.  Basically, I'm 
just currious as to which cities have the strongest fan base.

   [ At least in the U.S., you'd probably get a good idea by checking out
     the tour dates listing, and checking over the dates for the 
     Counterparts tour -- almost every night has the number of people

The song was originally written and recorded as a single by a guy named
Larry Williams, who had several hits in the late '50s, a few of which were
covered by the Beatles (including "Dizzy, Miss Lizzy" and "Bad Boy") because
John Lennon was a big fan. This particular song was covered on two Beatles
albums. For anyone who's interested, the song was also covered by the Cowboy
Junkies.

Hey!

I'm curious. Let's say the date is October 6th,
1998. You've just picked up the much anticipated
live release and are about to put it in the player.

Problem:  Which disc to play first?????

1. The aftk show?
2. The cp/tfe shows?
3. Pick the song you've waited the most for
live and skip to it regardless of what disc it's on?
(2112, Bravado...)

I'd like to know what everybody else would do
and why. I'm planning on starting right at the
beginning of the cp/tfe disc's and listening to them
both before taking in the 1978 show. Why? I
guess because this will have the best pick of all
their music over time. And, I have to admit, I'm
interested to hear how the mix sounds.

Hi Rushians,
	Some of you were discussing those unknown sounds at the end of The
Camera Eye. Here's my idea of what they are. I have always thought that
it was the sound of a dove that croaked and died and then some one says,
"Poor dove." Some people might disagree with this but this is what I

Hi Rushians,
         I saw Small Soldiers on July 21. It was pretty cool. The girl
in it said that she liked Led Zeppelin (who I also like), and at one
point she was listening to Tom Sawyer on her head phones. She has a
great taste in music. (What do you think?)
         And I also saw them playing Tom Sawyer for the preview of the
Adam Sandler movie "Waterboy." It sounded pretty cool. Also I heard at
the Rush at Ghostland website (http://www.webcom.com/qghost/rush.html).
They were talking about the Tom Sawyer Remix for Small Soldiers, but
they also mentioned that the studio version of Tom Sawyer is on the
soundtrack for a movie called "Whatever." I never heard of this movie
but the adress is

Subject: Hardest Alex solos

As a guitarist who quite literally learned how to play by transcribing and
learning Alex's guitar parts, both rhythm and solos, I was curious as to what
the guitarists on board the NMS feel are Alex's most difficult guitar solos to
play?   My own personal picks would be: 
Hardest to play note-for-note:  
Cygnus X-1- Alex doing some pre-Vai "talking guitar" with wah pedal and some
artificial harmonics that's just about impossible to get down.
Cinderella Man- Alex doing some terrifying phrasing with wah pedal and vibrato
bar that's damn tough to nail.
Chain Lightning- I think only the crimson twang-bar-king Adrian Belew would be
able to duplicate this little monsrosity!  Amazing phrasing on this one,
considering it's backwards!!
A Farewell To Kings-  Not only does Alex rip hard at the end, the shifting 5/8
| 7/8 time signature during this section makes your head spin.  His phrasing
against Geddy and Neil's groove is killer too!
2112-  Presentation- those growls, wah-wahs, and thse piercing artificial
harmonics are killers to nail.  Although his note selection is fairly easy to
grab, he does rip pretty hard on it.
Double Agent- He's got some Eric Johnson-esque "slap harmonics" at the end
that are tough to nail (If you saw them on the CP tour, you may have been
wondering why he was slapping his fretboard during this solo, other than it
looks kinda cool!)

These were ALL pretty tough to figure out, too.  By the way, I'd stay away
from transcriptions you may find of Rush songs/solos too.  The ones one the
web especially- terrible!!  They're ok for getting an idea of what's being
played, but let your ears be the final judge.  Got any inquiries about guitar,
theory, Rush, or prog rock?  Send me an e!!

Subject: meaningful lyrics

  If you had to pick one Rush song that was the most meaningful to you in 
terms of it's lyrics what song would you pick and explain why?

For me it would be "Witch Hunt" because it clearly paints a vivid picture 
of a raving mob determined to see their brand of justice carried out, in 
their minds, for the sake of the victim. With lines like ... "The righteous 
rise with burning eyes of hatred and ill will",  "Mad men feed on fear and 
lies,to beat and burn and kill" and "Quick to judge,quick to anger,slow to 
undestand", "Ignorance and predjudice and fear walk hand and hand" one can 
visualize and feel very vividly what Neil is conveying in his beautifuly 
chosen words. When you add in the dynamics of the accompnying music you 
have what everyone on this list is so enamored by. A song with meaning,
feelings,and sonic drive which propels us onto the next song,the next album 
over and over again.

This is my own opinion of what a Rush song has to offer and this is just 
one of many many more that can be broken down and disected like I have done 
here. What song/songs would other's pick ?

Subject: Condolences ad nauseum, new thread?

Hello fellow fans -

        Just my two cents (nothing more, nothing less)-  We all feel terribly
for Neil and his family.    However, all of our efforts to show that
emotion appears to be having a negative effect on us a group.  Some of
us feel the need to show a public display of grief.  Others feel it
should remain private, and try to inhibit the only outlet that they
have.  I know that my point of view will not be the same as everyone
else's, but I think we've all had sufficient time to voice our dismay,
disgust, disapproval, etc. on the subject and all the tangents it has
created.  
        I, for one, would like to spend more time reading about your opinions
on the work of Rush, rather than suppositions (because that's all they
are, right?) of whether or not they will continue.  What do we benefit
from such talk?  They will do what they will do, and they will not
consult with us before they do it.
        Let's all try to focus on the task at hand, the impending live CD, and
let the chips fall where they may.

        That said, let's try a new thread, that I don't recall hearing before,
that most of us can contribute to.  Those of us lucky enough to live in
North America, or those who had the resources to get there and were able
to catch a show on the T4E tour, which song(s) were the best
performances in your opinion, and here's the part that makes it
interesting, boys and girls, WHY?  Always remember to explain your
thoughts, and we can strive towards peace within the bandwidth.

Here's mine -  I went to three shows- Hartford, CT,  Mansfield, Mass.,
and Toronto, Ont.

Of the three, I was most touched by the performance of 2112 in Toronto. 
The reason?  It struck me near the end of the song, that I may very well
be seeing the last of Rush onstage, and it actually brought a tear to my
eye, because they have been such a part of my growing up.  I drove 12
hours to Ontario, just to have that feeling.  

Okay, I'm done.  Your turn.

Bill

Uhmmmmm...make that THREE!!!

Supposedly, Rush is also on ANOTHER recent movie soundtrack, the new Susan
Skoog  80's-esque film "Whatever."  (Skoog is from Red Bank, in my home
state of New Jersey, the same neck-o-the-woods as Kevin Smith, of "Clerks,"
"Mall Rats," and "Chasing Amy" fame.)  And guess what: it's TOM SAWYER
again!!!  In addition, the Rush connections continue, as Aimee Mann's " I
Should've Known," a great song incidentally, is also on the "Whatever"
soundtrack (Furthermore, "Whatever" is the name of Aimee Mann's first solo
album.)  
I haven't confirmed this, just saw it on the f's web-site at:
http://www.spe.sony.com/classics/whatever/whatever.html

Hello Rush Fans!  Isn't it great to have the NMS in your mailbox!

I was lucky enough to get to Toronto over the 4th of July weekend.  What
a beautiful city and the folks there were great.  We looked for the boys
everywhere, but didn't see them, imagine that!  I still had a great time
driving my husband crazy with Rush inferences all weekend - "Look!
There's Geddy's sister!" ;-).

Anyway, I guess after that, I had Rush on the brain and I had the
coolest dream.  Alex and Geddy were staying at our house for some reason
(any reason!)  I don't remember speaking to Alex, but when I talked to
Geddy I was so awestruck that I could barely understand him.  About all
I could say was "Gah."  and that didn't come out very well.  So, in
order to thank us for our hospitality, they invited us to go with them
to Lake Louise to tour their winery!  I remember asking if we would be
back by 2 o'clock so that we could get the kids from school.  I think if
that happened, we'd grab the kids on the way to the airport and take a
family road trip.  Needless to say, I woke up in a good mood.

In response to someone's question about the "burp" in The Camera Eye, I
believe some folks queried that before and the answer was that those
noises are someone (Geddy?) saying "Hello" and responding " 'Mornin
Gov."

Enough for now!  Many thanks to rush-mgr for all the hard work!  Lara

Hey everyone, I just recently re-subscribed to TNMS because I was
interested in what's going on with Rush today, especially Neil.

Now that his wife and daughter are gone, does he have anymore
immediate family?  Is he alone?  

If so, I disagree with the guy who said that he'd be glad if Rush calls it
quits.  I think the best music Rush has produced in a long time awaits us
if Neil starts writing songs again.  Imagine the sorrow and passion that
would come out of his pen after these experiences!  This would take
Rush to a whole new level as a band.

Hey gang...
Wow, it's going to take some getting used to writing in the new addy....
Mike asked why all of a sudden TS was getting so much play in movies.. 
In MHO, it's partly due to a couple of things... 
1. It's argueably Rush's most popular signature songs.. It seems that I know
a lot of people who don't like Rush, but they love TS, and always have... 
2. Like Triumph's "Magic Power", TS is a classic rock anthem, and represents
a generation that is currently back in vogue, the 80's. Since Rush was able
to make it out of the 80's unscathed, I think they're getting some justly
deserved respect. 
3. No one (or at least very few) can argue that TS is plain and simply a
kick ass song. Even those of you who are tired of it, can't say that it
isn't. It's got a strong beat, heavy but not overbearing guitars and enough
atmosphere to support its own life forms.. .
OK, I said a couple of things, but three is better than two.. Any other
ideas people.... 
BTW, any Denver residents on the list..? I heard 850 KOA play some Rush as
in intro to their post game show( I think) for the Colorado Rockies the
other night.. I think it was Limelight...
Cheers from New Mexico...

Subject: Future of RUSH

I have some thoughts on the future of Rush. First of all, I am in no way
saying "Come on Neil, enough mourning, get back to the band!" That would be
very selfish. This is in response to those who say, "Neil will quit Rush",
"Rush is done", etc.

I for one am certain that Neil will NOT quit Rush due to his recent losses.
If he did, what would he do then? Sit around his house and stair at the
walls? That would be a great waste of his skills and it would be a very poor
way to cherish, and celebrate the memories of his lost loved ones.

We have all suffered losses in our lives. It takes time to heal, then we
go on, but we never forget those that we have lost. We pick up the pieces
and we start again. We don't just quit! When I was 16, my oldest brother
(he was a huge Rush fan too) died and it was the most traumatic thing that
my family has ever gone through. But we continued with our lives.

Think about it this way: if you died tomorrow would you want your family
to just stop everything and quit living their lives? I don't think so.
When I die I hope that my family and friends remember me by telling funny
stories about me. I hope that my friends reminisce about all the crazy
adventures and misadventures that we had. And I hope when they think of me
a smile crosses their face instead of a frown.
