I just spent my spring break at home on Long Island and was pleasantly
suprised to hear an unbelievable amount of Rush on the Radio:

Bravado (twice)
Dreamline (three times)
Limelight (three times)
Ghost of a Chance (twice)
Subdivisions
Closer to the Heart
Distant Early Warning
Tom Sawyer
Roll the Bones

Okay.  Another new-comer with a first-time post: Howdy!

In response to several things:

    1)  I'm all for having a poll on whether or not we should have
        any more polls. My vote: Not.

    2)  Rush on the radio in Chicago doesn't appear to be much
        better than the rest of the world.  Our two main 'rock'
        stations: WLUP 97.9 and WBLZ 103.5, tend to play the
        same songs - i.e.:

             Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, New World Man, etc.

        Although we just got a new 'night' station that seems
        to be playing more.  The call-in requests continue....

    3)  Geddy is the best bass player I've ever heard (IMHO, of course).

    4)  Rush Opening Band: Primus or Dream Theatre. (NOT Mr. Big, please!).

That's all for now. Of course, ALL opinions are IMHO.

Subject:      Master and Rush

As well as I remember, Geddy Lee wanted to produce the Master of Puppets
album and of course they wanted him also.  However, due to Rush's very
busy recording/touring schedule time wouldn't allow Geddy to become deeply
commited to the project.  Hence, the thank you on the liner notes

   [ Will, where did you get this information on Geddy wanting to produce
     Masters of Puppets.  Please unless we have specific proof, let's not
     start any speculations.  Geddy has been noted for saying in interviews
     that one of the new groups he likes is Metallica.  Cliff Burton, the
     original bassist for the group (before he died), has mentioned Geddy 
     and Rush as one of his major influences and favorite bands.  I recall
     nothing in terms of Geddy wanting to produce Masters of Puppets.  If
     there's a particular interview you have or something else with
     information about this I'd love to check it out.  :rush-mgr ]

Subject: KSHE

&gt;I personally would recomend KSHE 95 (95.4 MHz) out of St. Louis... by far the
&gt;most redeeming radio station in So. IL, Ea. MO, and that general area.  I'm
&gt;not big into Chicago radio (cause I can't get it) but the AM/FM Loop (WLUP)
&gt;plays good Rush on occasion... B96 sux!
&gt;
&gt;So, if you're in St. Louis for a RUSH concert, dial up 95.4 for pre- and post-
&gt;RUSH tunes... afterward they play the entire concert out (all the songs) for
&gt;that drive home!

I met a few other NMSers (Hey Mike, Dave, Lewis and Tony!) for the St Louis
show and thought that KSHE was pretty cool at first, cuz they were there
handing out Rush bumper stickers. But THEN they cranked up their broadcast
REALLY loud, drowning out the soundcheck we earlybirds had come to listen
to.  :(

Oh well...I'll take your word for it that they're a good station, but
blasting over Rush's soundcheck....sheeez how rude!! ;-)

Seeyas at convention!

Subject: Working Man, Hemispheres LIVE

In TNMS #651, Donald Petrille was wondering about "any songs rush has about
the drudgeries of college life (i.e., working so hard for what seems like so
little)."  There is one song that comes immediately to my mind here, and it is
none other than Working Man, one of my favorite songs of all time.  Besides
a great guitar riff, it seems to describe what Mr. Petrille was looking for.
Whenever I am overworked (which is a lot here at Wash. U.), I crank it up and
relax for the seven or eight minutes of the song.  It does wonders.

Also, someone mentioned a Radio One recording of a live show which contained
Hemispheres.  I have been looking for a live recording of either that or
Circumstances for a while now, and have yet to find them.  If anyone has info
on this, I'm sure that there would be plenty of interest among NMS members.
Maybe we could write to Radio One and get them to rebroadcast it.  I would
love to get my hands on a copy.  That's all for now.

Well, I know how to play it, or at least I did at some point.  I haven't
played that in a while, and right now, sitting here in the lab, I don't
even remember the basic stuff for playing that solo.  So, if in a couple
of days it still remains unposted, I'll put it up, since by then I'll
have a chance to get to a piano or keyboard and relearn it.  Friday's a
definite keyboard availability day.  (Unless anyone at Pitt would like
to let me use their keyboard for a bit??  :-)

Subject: Poll

I'm wondering who suggested Kate Bush as the opener for Rush. If that were
the case I would drop dead. Kate was my first musical addiction--I've
everything she's done, save the box set that was only released in England.
Hey, any of you guys (or gals) from England who might be able to get a hold
of it for me, drop me a line on e-mail (directly--don't post here)--I'd
really appreciate it. Of course Kate's been overrun by my thirteen CD Rush
collection to date (I've yet to buy COS because I've been "borrowing" it from
a freshman since September, I also don't have any of the live albums). I've
reached a real dilemma at this point because I have a 6 CD magazine changer
and so I have 12 of my CDs loaded in magazines loaded with RTB and the
borrowed COS loose. Do you guys who have ATWAS and ESL... think I should get
them to help fill another magazine (with the upcoming new release--I can't
wait)? I bought ASOH used last year and returned it because I wasn't too
impressed, but then again, at that time I was not yet addicted (now Rush gets
over 90% of my play time).

Last weekend I saw an incredible concert on public television--The Moody
Blues at Red Rock. They might be an interesting opener for Rush. They had the
Colorado Symphony Orchestra with them. Of course I didn't pledge any money to
them. But now if public television did a few hours of Rush concerts I'm sure
many of us would pledge some money. Anyone know anybody in public TV?

Yo Rush fans.  Can anybody explain the "Now it's dark" from the jacket of Roll
the Bones?  My friends and I thought maybe it meant that they were through, and
we panicked.  Also, can anyone confirm for sure that Rush has a new album due
out in June and a concert tour starting in September?  

    [ Sorry folks, let's not get excited over this June deadline for the
      new album, or the tour in September.  This is *FALSE* and can be
      traced back to a posting in alt.music.rush on USENET.  The album
      is scheduled for Sept/Fall '93 release and tour has been pushed
      back to Jan. '94.					:rush-mgr ]

My top 5 albums:
5)Moving Pictures
4)Permanent Waves
3)Presto
2)Hold Your Fire
1)Hemispheres

Hear -n- Aid was a part of that whole Aid thing at that time. It was Ronnie
James Dio's conception I beleive because 'Heavy Metal' bands weren't really
allowed to play in Live Aid unless they were reforming specially for it.
(Basically there were very few hard rock bands in Live Aid). Hear -n- Aid was a
compilation of a whole load of bands and also includes the song We're Stars
written by Dio. The Rush contribution is Distant Early Warning (freaky - see my
post in yesterday's NMS) Live. It's no great deal because that version is
available elsewhere (in fact on the B-side of the Prime Mover single). I think
this version of DEW is from the same concert as the GUP video. I'm sure a
RushHead on this mailing list will correct me if I'm wrong.:-&gt;

     [ You're correct on this.  I've only seen an official tape release
       of Hear-n-Aid and it does indeed have DEW on it live.  I've not
       seen it again for about 4-5 years now.  You could probably find it at a
       use record shop or something.  I doubt it's out on cd.  :rush-mgr ]

(insert (sub) standard comments about it being my first post here)

    I have yet another theory about what "Critical Mass" could be
    referring to.  How about something along the lines of a
    church blowing up on Sunday? (I'm not trying to be
    anti-religious, but considering some of the past album names,
    this seems like a valid interpretation)  I know this almost
    begs to lead into the old time worn topic about "Is Neal

As for the Rush-Metallica connection, I remember an interview
with Geddy Lee from some years back (85-87ish) where he was asked
what he thought of bands like Metallica--heavy and fast.  Geddy's
reply was that he (not sure this is verbatim) "loved bands going
a million miles an hour.  I think it's great."

Happy racing.

Greetings and Salutations,

   On the subject of Rush music played at weddings, I happened to be the
best man at a wedding last October, and before I accepted the job, I told
the couple in question that they must agree to play Time Stand Still at
the reception.  They did.  It seemed to me to be the perfect song for
such an occasion.

In response to L Clator Butler Jr's question regarding Hear 'n' Aid...

This was a project related to Live Aid back in 1985. Ronnie James Dio (one of
the best rock vocalists ever) was the brains behind it, and also wrote the
single (Stars) released with the album. The single had various rock luminaries
perform on it, such as Adrian Smith and Dave Murray of Iron Maiden, Geoff Tate
of Queensryche, Vince Neil and Mick Mars of Motley Crue, Ted Nugent, Blackie
Lawless of WASP, Vivian Campbell, Jimmy Bain and Vinnie Appice of Dio (Viv now
of course wasting his time and talent with Def Leppard)...even Spinal Tap made
an 'appearance'! There are many more, but my memory of those days is fading.
As far as I DO remember, Rush had no part in the single, but instead
contributed a song for the album, which I think (and I stress think) may have
been a live version of 'The Spirit of Radio'. If anybody can confirm this or
correct me I'd be grateful. The rest of the album featured songs from various
other big name (at the time) rock bands. Some of the songs were previously
unreleased. I'm sorry, but I can't remember who they were by, or what they
were! Never mind, I hope this has helped anyway...

	[ The song Rush contributed was Distant Early Warning.  :rush-mgr ]

There has been much discussion recently comparing Geddy Lee and Sting. My own
opinion is that Sting may not necessarily play such flamboyant lines as Geddy,
but he generally plays a fretless, which is much trickier than fretted. I
don't think I've ever heard Geddy play a fretless.

Finally, to John Santore. I'm sorry there hasn't been more interest in the
convention. I would go if I could afford it, but Toronto is a hell of a long
way from the south of England! I wish you all the best, and I'm sure I speak
for the whole NMS membership when I say I really appreciate your efforts. Of
course, that isn't going to make you feel a whole lot better when what you
need is more financial commitment from people who could get there! COME ON YOU
LOT IN NMS LAND! DON'T JUST LET THE CONVENTION FALL APART! There, I've said
it...

Actually, this is the final point - what's happening with the thing that shall
not be mentioned?

Subject: What Critical Mass means
Date: Tue, 30 Mar 93 10:39:10 CST

Someone stated that the new album might be called "Critical Mass" and
wondered what that meant in relation to nuclear physics. Well, I'm no
nuclear scientist, but basically, a "critical mass" of uranium is the
smallest amount of uranium necessary to carry on a self-sustaining nuclear
fission reation. When a uranium atom splits (fissions), it releases a
fast neutron, which will fly around, with the itention of hitting another
uranium atom which will split and release a neutron which will fly around and
hit a uranium atom and .... you get the picture. If you don't have a critical
mass of uranium, this reaction just peters out (hmmm....peters out, Peter
Collins, Critical Mass....just coincidence?). Above the critical mass, the
reaction just keeps multiplying (hmm...references to "Chemistry"?), and you
have to deliberately slow the reaction down or it will melt your reactor and
go to China through the floor.

I'm sure some other readers will post explanations too. One of the most re-
freshing things about Rush is that the general Rush fan seems to be slightly
more intelligent than the average bear. I'm sure Rush is glad that their
fans generally have the brainpower to recognize and decipher all the hidden
meanings in their songs and album covers and nicknames, etc.

Subject: Have YOU sent in YOUR deposit for the convention?

I called up John Santore yesterday and talked with him for 10-15 minutes.
The guy is REALLY psyched about the POSSIBILITIES for the convention,
however, he sounded downright UPSET that there hasn't been a bigger
response.  It is obvious that he has spent a lot of time preparing this
for us.  He also mentioned the POSSIBILITY of getting someone VERY
IMPORTANT from Anthem Records.

My deposit is now on its way.  How about you?  Maybe you're wary about
the convention actually happening.  John tells me (and please, John,
correct me if I am wrong) that no one's deposit check will be cashed
until he's sure it can really happen - so you don't have anything to
lose (except 29 cents).

So far the NMS has actually done everything it has talked about (our CD
is coming along) so let's not blow our track record now!

Subject: convention funding

Greetings all,
    This is my first post to TNMS so I'd like to say thanks for having me.

    Also, the reason why I am posting is because of my concern for the
convention.  Mr. Sanatore &lt;sp&gt;? reported that the number of people signed up is
low.  I know I can't make it, but I would hate to see this fail.  So here's my
idea:
    A few people inquired about video tapes of the event.  I am also interested
in one.  If the people who are interested in the tape are willing to pay out
some extra funds perhaps we can raise some money for the event that way?
     Please comment on the proposal.  Maybe we can make the convention happen.
Great things usually start small!
                                         Respectfully,
                                               Joe Maletta

    [ Please check out Neil's editorial on Rock and Satanism.  Also for
      you fans reading this check out Dominic's PS. message at the
      bottom of his post.  :rush-mgr ]

Sorry to post again, but I've been deftly avoiding replying to this thread in
alt.music.rush, but since it's turned up here I hope some sensible discussion
(which has not been covered before) may be started up. By the way just so you
know where I stand - I am a Christian.

        Heavy metal megastars RUSH sing 'All the world's a stage'
   The reversal reveals the words " Oh Satan, you, you are the
   one who is shining wall of satan , Walls of sacrifice . I know
   it's you are the one I love ."

Assuming this is a correct transcription by raghubn@vigyan.iisc.ernet.in (which
I am).

I'm no linguist but this doesn't make sense to me. The words aren't formed into
sentences. In the last sentence there are 2 parts of the verb to be with the
same object and subject. I think that it's fair to say that Rush would never
let anything so cack appear to their name. Even if they were to do such a thing
I'm sure it would be done with the usual finess with which they approach all
their music.

If people want to sing about Satan they usually do it forwards - this way it
will receive a bigger audience. Since Rush are primarily concerned with getting
messages across to their audiences - thus were they to sing about Satan I think
they would do it forwards.

I didn't beleive that Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne had the things in their
music they were accused of and if I don't beleive it for them I certainly don't
beleive for Rush. In fact one of the reasons that the Judas Priest case was
such a mockery was the fact the Judas Priest themselves played the album
backwards that they had reportedly put all these messages in and it was quite
amusing and a lot clearer than the massively enhanced backwards vocals that
were supposed to be there.

Finally (sorry for boring some of you) Rush spend so much time getting things
right going forwards I would doubt they had any energy to worry about what they
are going to sound like backwards, after all about 99.999% of the audience is
going to play it forwards - why worry about what it sounds like backwards ?

there will be a 'regular' digest tomorrow (on Sat) for today's posts.

One other thing:

Okay.  Another new-comer with a first-time post: Howdy!

In response to several things:

    1)  I'm all for having a poll on whether or not we should have
        any more polls. My vote: Not.

    2)  Rush on the radio in Chicago doesn't appear to be much
        better than the rest of the world.  Our two main 'rock'
        stations: WLUP 97.9 and WBLZ 103.5, tend to play the
        same songs - i.e.:

             Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, New World Man, etc.

        Although we just got a new 'night' station that seems
        to be playing more.  The call-in requests continue....

    3)  Geddy is the best bass player I've ever heard (IMHO, of course).

    4)  Rush Opening Band: Primus or Dream Theatre. (NOT Mr. Big, please!).

That's all for now. Of course, ALL opinions are IMHO.

As well as I remember, Geddy Lee wanted to produce the Master of Puppets
album and of course they wanted him also.  However, due to Rush's very
busy recording/touring schedule time wouldn't allow Geddy to become deeply
commited to the project.  Hence, the thank you on the liner notes

   [ Will, where did you get this information on Geddy wanting to produce
     Masters of Puppets.  Please unless we have specific proof, let's not
     start any speculations.  Geddy has been noted for saying in interviews
     that one of the new groups he likes is Metallica.  Cliff Burton, the
     original bassist for the group (before he died), has mentioned Geddy 
     and Rush as one of his major influences and favorite bands.  I recall
     nothing in terms of Geddy wanting to produce Masters of Puppets.  If
     there's a particular interview you have or something else with
     information about this I'd love to check it out.  :rush-mgr ]

Subject: KSHE

&gt;I personally would recomend KSHE 95 (95.4 MHz) out of St. Louis... by far the
&gt;most redeeming radio station in So. IL, Ea. MO, and that general area.  I'm
&gt;not big into Chicago radio (cause I can't get it) but the AM/FM Loop (WLUP)
&gt;plays good Rush on occasion... B96 sux!
&gt;
&gt;So, if you're in St. Louis for a RUSH concert, dial up 95.4 for pre- and post-
&gt;RUSH tunes... afterward they play the entire concert out (all the songs) for
&gt;that drive home!

I met a few other NMSers (Hey Mike, Dave, Lewis and Tony!) for the St Louis
show and thought that KSHE was pretty cool at first, cuz they were there
handing out Rush bumper stickers. But THEN they cranked up their broadcast
REALLY loud, drowning out the soundcheck we earlybirds had come to listen
to.  :(

Oh well...I'll take your word for it that they're a good station, but
blasting over Rush's soundcheck....sheeez how rude!! ;-)

Seeyas at convention!

Subject: Working Man, Hemispheres LIVE

In TNMS #651, Donald Petrille was wondering about "any songs rush has about
the drudgeries of college life (i.e., working so hard for what seems like so
little)."  There is one song that comes immediately to my mind here, and it is
none other than Working Man, one of my favorite songs of all time.  Besides
a great guitar riff, it seems to describe what Mr. Petrille was looking for.
Whenever I am overworked (which is a lot here at Wash. U.), I crank it up and
relax for the seven or eight minutes of the song.  It does wonders.

Also, someone mentioned a Radio One recording of a live show which contained
Hemispheres.  I have been looking for a live recording of either that or
Circumstances for a while now, and have yet to find them.  If anyone has info
on this, I'm sure that there would be plenty of interest among NMS members.
Maybe we could write to Radio One and get them to rebroadcast it.  I would
love to get my hands on a copy.  That's all for now.

Well, I know how to play it, or at least I did at some point.  I haven't
played that in a while, and right now, sitting here in the lab, I don't
even remember the basic stuff for playing that solo.  So, if in a couple
of days it still remains unposted, I'll put it up, since by then I'll
have a chance to get to a piano or keyboard and relearn it.  Friday's a
definite keyboard availability day.  (Unless anyone at Pitt would like
to let me use their keyboard for a bit??  :-)

I'm wondering who suggested Kate Bush as the opener for Rush. If that were
the case I would drop dead. Kate was my first musical addiction--I've
everything she's done, save the box set that was only released in England.
Hey, any of you guys (or gals) from England who might be able to get a hold
of it for me, drop me a line on e-mail (directly--don't post here)--I'd
really appreciate it. Of course Kate's been overrun by my thirteen CD Rush
collection to date (I've yet to buy COS because I've been "borrowing" it from
a freshman since September, I also don't have any of the live albums). I've
reached a real dilemma at this point because I have a 6 CD magazine changer
and so I have 12 of my CDs loaded in magazines loaded with RTB and the
borrowed COS loose. Do you guys who have ATWAS and ESL... think I should get
them to help fill another magazine (with the upcoming new release--I can't
wait)? I bought ASOH used last year and returned it because I wasn't too
impressed, but then again, at that time I was not yet addicted (now Rush gets
over 90% of my play time).

Last weekend I saw an incredible concert on public television--The Moody
Blues at Red Rock. They might be an interesting opener for Rush. They had the
Colorado Symphony Orchestra with them. Of course I didn't pledge any money to
them. But now if public television did a few hours of Rush concerts I'm sure
many of us would pledge some money. Anyone know anybody in public TV?

Yo Rush fans.  Can anybody explain the "Now it's dark" from the jacket of Roll
the Bones?  My friends and I thought maybe it meant that they were through, and
we panicked.  Also, can anyone confirm for sure that Rush has a new album due
out in June and a concert tour starting in September?  

    [ Sorry folks, let's not get excited over this June deadline for the
      new album, or the tour in September.  This is *FALSE* and can be
      traced back to a posting in alt.music.rush on USENET.  The album
      is scheduled for Sept/Fall '93 release and tour has been pushed

From: Dominic Binks &lt;binks@compsci.bristol.ac.uk&gt;

Hear -n- Aid was a part of that whole Aid thing at that time. It was Ronnie
James Dio's conception I beleive because 'Heavy Metal' bands weren't really
allowed to play in Live Aid unless they were reforming specially for it.
(Basically there were very few hard rock bands in Live Aid). Hear -n- Aid was a
compilation of a whole load of bands and also includes the song We're Stars
written by Dio. The Rush contribution is Distant Early Warning (freaky - see my
post in yesterday's NMS) Live. It's no great deal because that version is
available elsewhere (in fact on the B-side of the Prime Mover single). I think
this version of DEW is from the same concert as the GUP video. I'm sure a
RushHead on this mailing list will correct me if I'm wrong.:-&gt;

     [ You're correct on this.  I've only seen an official tape release
       of Hear-n-Aid and it does indeed have DEW on it live.  I've not
       seen it again for about 4-5 years now.  You could probably find it at a
       use record shop or something.  I doubt it's out on cd.  :rush-mgr ]

In response to L Clator Butler Jr's question regarding Hear 'n' Aid...

This was a project related to Live Aid back in 1985. Ronnie James Dio (one of
the best rock vocalists ever) was the brains behind it, and also wrote the
single (Stars) released with the album. The single had various rock luminaries
perform on it, such as Adrian Smith and Dave Murray of Iron Maiden, Geoff Tate
of Queensryche, Vince Neil and Mick Mars of Motley Crue, Ted Nugent, Blackie
Lawless of WASP, Vivian Campbell, Jimmy Bain and Vinnie Appice of Dio (Viv now
of course wasting his time and talent with Def Leppard)...even Spinal Tap made
an 'appearance'! There are many more, but my memory of those days is fading.
As far as I DO remember, Rush had no part in the single, but instead
contributed a song for the album, which I think (and I stress think) may have
been a live version of 'The Spirit of Radio'. If anybody can confirm this or
correct me I'd be grateful. The rest of the album featured songs from various
other big name (at the time) rock bands. Some of the songs were previously
unreleased. I'm sorry, but I can't remember who they were by, or what they
were! Never mind, I hope this has helped anyway...

	[ The song Rush contributed was Distant Early Warning.  :rush-mgr ]

There has been much discussion recently comparing Geddy Lee and Sting. My own
opinion is that Sting may not necessarily play such flamboyant lines as Geddy,
but he generally plays a fretless, which is much trickier than fretted. I
don't think I've ever heard Geddy play a fretless.

Finally, to John Santore. I'm sorry there hasn't been more interest in the
convention. I would go if I could afford it, but Toronto is a hell of a long
way from the south of England! I wish you all the best, and I'm sure I speak
for the whole NMS membership when I say I really appreciate your efforts. Of
course, that isn't going to make you feel a whole lot better when what you
need is more financial commitment from people who could get there! COME ON YOU
LOT IN NMS LAND! DON'T JUST LET THE CONVENTION FALL APART! There, I've said
it...

Actually, this is the final point - what's happening with the thing that shall
not be mentioned?

Subject: What Critical Mass means
Date: Tue, 30 Mar 93 10:39:10 CST

Someone stated that the new album might be called "Critical Mass" and
wondered what that meant in relation to nuclear physics. Well, I'm no
nuclear scientist, but basically, a "critical mass" of uranium is the
smallest amount of uranium necessary to carry on a self-sustaining nuclear
fission reation. When a uranium atom splits (fissions), it releases a
fast neutron, which will fly around, with the itention of hitting another
uranium atom which will split and release a neutron which will fly around and
hit a uranium atom and .... you get the picture. If you don't have a critical
mass of uranium, this reaction just peters out (hmmm....peters out, Peter
Collins, Critical Mass....just coincidence?). Above the critical mass, the
reaction just keeps multiplying (hmm...references to "Chemistry"?), and you
have to deliberately slow the reaction down or it will melt your reactor and
go to China through the floor.

I'm sure some other readers will post explanations too. One of the most re-
freshing things about Rush is that the general Rush fan seems to be slightly
more intelligent than the average bear. I'm sure Rush is glad that their
fans generally have the brainpower to recognize and decipher all the hidden
meanings in their songs and album covers and nicknames, etc.

I called up John Santore yesterday and talked with him for 10-15 minutes.
The guy is REALLY psyched about the POSSIBILITIES for the convention,
however, he sounded downright UPSET that there hasn't been a bigger
response.  It is obvious that he has spent a lot of time preparing this
for us.  He also mentioned the POSSIBILITY of getting someone VERY
IMPORTANT from Anthem Records.

My deposit is now on its way.  How about you?  Maybe you're wary about
the convention actually happening.  John tells me (and please, John,
correct me if I am wrong) that no one's deposit check will be cashed
until he's sure it can really happen - so you don't have anything to
lose (except 29 cents).

So far the NMS has actually done everything it has talked about (our CD
is coming along) so let's not blow our track record now!

Greetings all,
    This is my first post to TNMS so I'd like to say thanks for having me.

    Also, the reason why I am posting is because of my concern for the
convention.  Mr. Sanatore &lt;sp&gt;? reported that the number of people signed up is
low.  I know I can't make it, but I would hate to see this fail.  So here's my
idea:
    A few people inquired about video tapes of the event.  I am also interested
in one.  If the people who are interested in the tape are willing to pay out
some extra funds perhaps we can raise some money for the event that way?
     Please comment on the proposal.  Maybe we can make the convention happen.
Great things usually start small!

Sorry to post again, but I've been deftly avoiding replying to this thread in
alt.music.rush, but since it's turned up here I hope some sensible discussion
(which has not been covered before) may be started up. By the way just so you
know where I stand - I am a Christian.

        Heavy metal megastars RUSH sing 'All the world's a stage'
   The reversal reveals the words " Oh Satan, you, you are the
   one who is shining wall of satan , Walls of sacrifice . I know
   it's you are the one I love ."

Assuming this is a correct transcription by raghubn@vigyan.iisc.ernet.in (which
I am).

I'm no linguist but this doesn't make sense to me. The words aren't formed into
sentences. In the last sentence there are 2 parts of the verb to be with the
same object and subject. I think that it's fair to say that Rush would never
let anything so cack appear to their name. Even if they were to do such a thing
I'm sure it would be done with the usual finess with which they approach all
their music.

If people want to sing about Satan they usually do it forwards - this way it
will receive a bigger audience. Since Rush are primarily concerned with getting
messages across to their audiences - thus were they to sing about Satan I think
they would do it forwards.

I didn't beleive that Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne had the things in their
music they were accused of and if I don't beleive it for them I certainly don't
beleive for Rush. In fact one of the reasons that the Judas Priest case was
such a mockery was the fact the Judas Priest themselves played the album
backwards that they had reportedly put all these messages in and it was quite
amusing and a lot clearer than the massively enhanced backwards vocals that
were supposed to be there.

Finally (sorry for boring some of you) Rush spend so much time getting things
right going forwards I would doubt they had any energy to worry about what they
are going to sound like backwards, after all about 99.999% of the audience is
going to play it forwards - why worry about what it sounds like backwards ?
