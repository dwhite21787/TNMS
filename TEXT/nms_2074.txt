I've been out of town for the last few days, so no digest till now.
There won't be another one until at least Monday, I'll be out of town
hopefully recovering from my headache I got trying to forge through the
crap that's ended up in the digest mailbox. If things don't improve
when I get back, I might start tossing *all* the posts into the bit
bucket in the sky. So let's keep it Rush-related and cut down on the damn
flames!  (boy that would be nice for a change *sigh*)

Hi All,

Does anyone know the largest attendance for a Rush show?  My guess would be 
either the TexasJam in Dallas (Cotton Bowl ... I was there! awesome to say 
the least) or the Houston equvilent.  Seems like they did some other big 
gigs too though, and I didn't see it in the FAQ.  Later!

Firstly the writer states that this will be his "last word" on this subject.  
Would it that this was a binding obligation!   Secondly, in the TNMS he states 
HIS OPINION, and others state theirs - who passed the title GOD on to him such 
that he is right to ridicule in such a sanctimonious heavy-handed manner those 
with whom his OPINION differs? Thirdly, he is speaking of a band with more than 
an unproven ability to record and perform what THEY F*CKING FEEL LIKE, 
critics (and perhaps even fans?) be damned. If a person likes it, the entire 
lot or just some of it - great.  If they don't, that's really their own
problem.  

The point is, if RUSH were so concerned with performing for the "masses",
they would have been much more like The Stones, Aerosmith, VH or whatever 
to begin with and a lot less like they were and are.  My personal opinion is 
that it can take a while to get used to each new release simply because there is
no effort by the band to try to please weenies who would like to place
arbitrary artistic limits and boundaries on their range of creativity.  
Perhaps the writer assumes that the band are so perfect (in his image?) that 
they have the ability to put together entire albums which will please all 
people, all the way through.  They are human, and this is their stage. We 
aren't even merely players, we are the audience - buy the ticket or don't, but 
don't squawk that there was a scene or two that didn't give you as big a 
woody as the climax.  Geez.  

I'll take back all my comments when I hear Michael's 16th in a row, all perfect 
studio album, no "filler" tunes allowed.  In the meantime, it would be 
instructive to illustrate Michael Hannaman's idea of how one displays how 
valuable a "fan" he 
(or she) is.  The following is excerpted from a submission I just found on
Amazon.com's site as a "Fans Review" of the first album, "RUSH".

This album was released in 1974.  We also know that some of the material was 
conceived a good bit prior to then.  The above review is dated about a week ago.
Wouldn't it be ironic if it turned out that the above writer/critic was not even
a human embryo at the time the boys were putting together the very vehicle 
which would propel them onto the music scene from which we would 
all come to be exposed to their extraordinary talents?   Wouldn't that be the 
very meaning of Chutzpah?  Say it ain't so Michael!  Say it ain't so!
Either way, (and admittedly, the review could have been worse) a better fan
might have considered that the band nets considerably less money when 
fewer records are sold.  Sales of Chronicles and Retrospectives result in less 
sales of more of the original albums, IMO.   And my understanding is that 
the band doesn't even recognize the existence of Chronicles, due to a 
dispute with the record company over it's release.  

2 Stars... And we have to read about how it is a "great disservice" 
to stick up for the "filler tunes", and how it is o.k. to criticize when some 
songs aren't up to their "typical caliber"?   "RUSH" was the FIRST ALBUM!  Just
what was their "typical caliber" supposed to be then, huh?  Mikey might say I
have guano-breath, but I'd say Here Again, Before and After, and In The Mood
were all just bitchin' for circa ' 74.  Anybody else remember the alternatives
back then?  I do.  It's easy to criticize and tear things down.  Far, far harder
to create.  
I'll give an example - I don't happen to care for Rivendell - lots of us don't. 
But I don't go out on the web or even in the TNMS and try to convince 
everyone else it sucks - remember it is OPINION.  Do we really want to 
delude ourselves into thinking that if we, in some self-centered stupor,
criticize the tunes we consider (in our OPINIONS) to be of lower caliber than 
some others, that it will result in the band becoming better than they already
are?  I say we grow up.  These guys have more talent in one little pinkie than
most of us could ever dream of hoping for.  
With "fans" like this critic, who needs critics?   Gollygeewillikers,
thanks for helping out, dude.  Be sure to keep that FF button in good 
repair, o.k.?

Oh, and by the way, remember it was your wish that we "Flame away"...

"Humble beginnings" indeed.

between love and illusion -

Regarding the Rush quiz at the Grand Designs Rush Site:

The question about Didacts and Narpets is correct (and fair) as it
stands. At first I thought the arguement against it was justified until
I realized... HEY, THEY ARE BOTH ANAGRAMS!

So, interpret what the word "didacts" means in the real world all you
want... it's still an anagram for "addicts" (See the Rush FAQ).

Of course, this will give away the answer to those who haven't taken the
quiz yet.

Subject: Who is Neil ? Really ? and does he need/want our prayers ?

   I see alot of us fans are forgetting the obvious again. These are
people we're dealing with here. People we , let's face it, don't know !

What is this supposed connection some of you feel to him ? He doesn't
know you any more than you know him. Why should you send a prayer to
him ? What will he do with it if he gets it ?

   Ask yourself this... You all probably see this same person
everyday. A bus driver, a checkout girl, a gas station attendant, a
paper boy, anyone. You've seen this person every day now for 5 years,
yet you never speak personally, or minimally at best. You know this
person much more than you know Neil. His or her spouse dies...do you
offer flowers ? a prayer ? sincere condolances ? NO !!! YOU GO ABOUT
YOUR PATHETIC LITTLE LIVES WITHOUT EVEN NOTICING DON'T YOU ??? DON'T
YOU !!!

   I wish all these people who feel they can cleanse their souls of
whatever by posting these rediculous rantings would just shut up
already ! Fine feel bad for Neil if you must (I do), but deal with it
on your own time people !!! Why rant on and on about this ? It does no
one any good !

I for one am bored and probably will not read this forum for a few
weeks.

There will be little if any news about the band obviously and if I
read 1 more sickening "my prayers go out to Neil" post, I think I'll
PUKE !!!

All I feel is thankful for ther joy he and his friends have brought to
me and my friends.
I don't know how he feels.
I can't imagine what he's going thru.
I don't care what he plans for the future.
My prayers don't go out to him. (cuz he wouldn't know what to do with
them anyway)
Just my sincerest thanks for all the music over all these many years.

PEOPLE, YOU WANT TO PAY TRIBUTE ?????
BUY DISKS, POSTERS, BOOKS, TAPES, SHEET MUSIC, T-SHIRTS, LIGHTERS,
VIDEOS, BUMPER STICKERS, HATS, UNDERWEAR, SOCKS, MOUSE PADS AND
WHATEVER ELSE THEIR LOGOS ADORN.

That's the best thing all of us could do for the Neil and the band
right now. Immortalize them the best  way we know how...Play their
music loud and proud. Constantly request their tunes on the radio, in
clubs where the F ever.

If Rush ends ? SO WHAT !!! Better to have what we have then to never
have had them at all RIGHT ? They can live on symbolically if we
demand to hear their music. It's up to us to keep their spirit alive
no matter what the future brings.

C'mon folks let's put our energies into something more constructive
like the My Own Personal Red Barchetta, or Best Lerxt solo or Tingle
moments threads again. Song parodies...yeah that's it song parodies.
Why I got a hankerin for something like,,,Different Sinks (the
plumbers nightmare) or The Big Bunny (every toddlers Easter Nightmare)
or maybe even Ballistic Schisms.

(and don't even think of flaming me for being anti-religion... I
ain't) Pray for something worth while like and end to Aids or child
abuse or a more exciting baseball season and how about a swift end to
the devestaion in Florida.

To all TNMS friends from the sunshine state...My prayers go out to
you. May your sufferings end soon.

 -
AND MOST OF ALL...

Please...
Don't forget not to forget.

later...

Subject: Tradegy for Neil

Alhough Neil may never read the NMS, at least we have a forum to put our
condolences and prayers for him.  It is so weird to read The Masked
Rider, reading him discuss his homesickness, seeking to hear his wife's
voice and feel his daughter's hug, and try to believe that this was
written 10 years ago, not yesterday, and now this double tradegy has to
hit him hard, while Geddy and Alex seem to not have any yet. (and lets
hope not)  I bought  The Masked Riders since it was by Neil, talked
about Africa (I studied African history in college) and cycling, all in
one book.   The book made him so human.  I pray he will be well in his
mourning and grief, and not dive over a cliff in Africa or China on his
bicycle. . .

Neil, all i can say that if you withdraw from public after this,  thank
you so much for your 20 album collaboration with Alex and Geddy, and
revealing to me a worldview that is practical and dizzy, atheistic or
agonistic, yet hoping for something else out there besides this _maya_
world of illusion.  Your lyrics touched both my intellect and emotions,
and helped me put my own little tradegies (bad relationships, etc) into
perspective.  May the wheels of life not bring you anymore tears.  . .

Also a quick thank you to the rush manager for not putthing out on the
internet the news of his wife's death until a few days later.  It was
respectful.

Hey all,

I haven't posted in three months and with the complexity of my life
right now, I have been unable to read many editions of the NMS.  Tonight
was the first chance I've had to read the NMS "cover to cover".  I must
say that it is really disheartening to come back to the NMS and find two
tradgedies; the death of a fellow human being and the endless ridicule
of a person who chose to protect the privacy of another.  

We are all saddened by this unfortunate turn of events but please,
please, please let us put our own selfish interests behind us and be
silently strong for Neil.  He knows we are praying for him, but he is
just a man; and like any man he has his own way to deal with life and
the circumstances which unfold before him.  Let's all just give a little
space and time will take care of itself.

I couldn't agree more with the NMSer who stated that he "wouldn't be
surprised and coud understand" if the band were to break up from here.
Neil has to do what's right for HIM at this point in time; not what's
right for his fans.  It is saddly inappropriate to offer your
condolences to Neil and his family and then jump right into rumors of
the future of Rush (as one NMSer did!).  

Please don't interpret this like Neil wouldn't appreciate everyone's
sympathy, but just offer it quietly and move on.  He'll be okay if
everyone doesn't ask every two seconds if he's alright.

I appreciate everyone lending me a kind ear. Stay strong brothers and
sisters of NMS!!! 

P.S. Rush Mngr-Keep up the great work and thanks for putting some one
else's feelings ahead of your own!  If we were all like that, this world
would be a much nicer place to live.

Hello, Rushians.
	Regarding the assumption that Rush will break up over this, ASSUME can
mean making an ASS out of yoU and ME. Basically, you are making one of
yourself and of Neil. Yes, he is alone for most of his grief, although he
does have some people to lean on if he so desires. He DESERVES his privacy!
	Thank you, Meg (the Rush Manager) for being tactful and respectful in
reporting the passing on of Jackie. 
	Whatever each of you believe in as a higher place, let us think that
Jackie has just moved on to a much better place with no suffering or
disease. She moved on to find her daughter, Selena.
	The fact that few knew that she suffered from cancer is irrelevant. Why
should we know this? It is truly none of our business unless it has
something to do directly with Rush's activities.
	So, in another's words,

Why are we here? 
Because we're here.
Roll the Bones.

Why does it happen?
Because it happens.
Roll the Bones.

	Rolling the bones, of course, means rolling the dice. When the one above
rolls the bones for someone and it shows it is their time to go, then they go.
	Enjoy your Rush music, and keep looking forward to the Live release,
whatever it will be called. All we can do is hope for more 
Rush-ing into the future.

Sincerely,
Erica

Kurt Smith made a great post a few days ago which completely echoes my 
personal feelings.  I am deeply saddened by this latest tragedy, and hope 
that Neil can weather this storm as he did the last one.  The music Rush has 
given us has been fantastic.  I hope that this will not drain his creative 
juices, but wouldn't blame him if he wanted to take another break.
Neil, if you read this, you are in my prayers.

Makes you wonder whether the rumours about Neil having the big C were
just inaccurate as to the person affected.

At the end of A Work In Progress there is a photo of Neil (from behind)
sitting on a bench with his arms around two women, presumably his wife
and daughter. It's hard to believe that the guy will now be sitting
there alone.

Hello Fellow TMNSers, 
      Just a thought on the issue 2112, I think it would be really neet to do
a tribute to Neil.  He has lost both his wife and daughter, just like the
character from 2112 lost his guitar, brutally.  His country is going through a
major change and so is his life, to do this along with all of our condolences
would be a great idea.
Just a thought

Hey gang....
Ya know, I've been reading many of the thoughts expressed by NMS members
over the past few days, as well as posts by members chiding them for
expressing their thoughts( and, gasp, prayers). It seems to me, that
whenever tragedy stirkes, whether it's the death of someone famous (Princess
Di, Frank Sinatra) or someone related to them, there is always an outpouring
of sentiment. Look at all the flowers that piled up outside Buckingham
Palace. Thousands of people signed their names to condolence books as well.
Will the families  ever read those books? No. Did they take the flowers
inside the palace? No. 
But you can be damn sure the families appreciated them. People need a place
to express grief. Be it for better or worse, the NMS is a logical place for
Rush fans when something tragic like this happens. One of our idols is
hurting deeply, and for some of you to chide us for expressing emotion is
deeply offensive. What if police had turned water cannons on all those
standing outside the palace and washed away all the flowers and signing books? 
There are many of us on this list who feel the need to express emotion over
the situation. 
If you can't handle it, unsubscribe for a week, to let us get it out of our
systems. 
I'm trying really hard not to start a flame war here, but I'm just tired of
being told not to express myself freely here.. I was to understand this is
an open forum, right? 
Till next time,
Cheers from NM,
Dan

Subject: 'The Spirit of Radio' cover

Being new to NMS, my information may be old, so bear with me.
Buried as the third song on the unlisted 13th track of Catherine Wheel's
new record Like Cats and Dog is their cover of The Spirit of Radio.
Now, I'm sure many a RUSH fan has heard this track, so I'd like to give
my take on the very touchy subject of RUSH covers.

Having read many of the comments on works like Working Man and other
RUSH tributes,  the willingness to give some of the these bands validity
is far from the norm.  In fact I don't think I've read anything positive
on the subject.  Admittedly, it's hard to listen to anyone beside Lee,
Lifeson & Peart perform our beloved RUSH tunes, but in the case of
Catherine Wheel's rendition of TSOR, it's a refreshing take on a RUSH
standard. (easy now, let me tell you why)

    First, the fact that CW consists of 4 active members and RUSH only
being a trio begs the question of it being an even playing field -
meaning, should the fact that CW has that extra (cliche'd yes) guitar
player, do they have an advantage?  The answer is no.  In fact, the
opposite is true: since RUSH only consists of 3 and CW has 4 members,
RUSH must exibit more of the precision that we've come to know and
love.  I mention this because CW's  version of the song is much broader
with re: to guitar resonance, wider tonal ranges due to the simple fact
that they have the extra guitar.   There is no comparison.

When I hear covers of (usually) dusty, old classic rock tunes, my flesh
almost always will crawl because of the lack of originality exibited in
the piece.  Nothing is worse than hearing some other band perform a self
  proclaimed classic NOTE FOR NOTE. It is excruciating.  ( In fact, CW
covers Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here on this same record.  It is a
crappy cover of a mediocre tune.)  Yet, CW's  version of TSOR has a
fresh bent that takes you back to when Permanent Waves hit the shelves
back in 1980.  Raw and unyielding, the song has new breath that I think
is worthy.  But there is another reason.

The true tribute here to RUSH by Catherine Wheel (other than the
influence RUSH has had on this band and others like it) is that not only
does CW not perform TSOR note-for-note, but they can't.  They don't even
try.  Which tells me that CW is saying, "...this song is and always will
be just what it is: a song that stands on it's own, all by itself is
RUSH rockdum."  This cover pays tribute by staying clear of Neil's
intensity; in fact, the entire intro to the song is re-worked because
the original is obviously too complex.  But at they same time,
vocalist/guitar no. 2 Rob Dickinson adds a vocal here, relents to one
there and in the end what you have is a very good, fresh version of a
truly fantastic RUSH song; one of my favorites.

So, for those who take an interest, listen to this track: listen to it
2, 3 or 4 times.  No band, ever, will rival the music of RUSH and its'
members as musicians/song writers/performers.  No one syncopates like
Neil or rocks likes Alex or drives like Geddy.  That's the beauty (eh).

Subject: Thoughts about  Rush, Neil and I

    Sometimes, I think that Rush is the best thing that could have 
happened in my life. The fans of other bands, I think, enjoy the music 
and had good moments with their favorite music. But Rush was for me more 
than a band. It was more like a way of living, to think, a different 
attitude in making music. Neil helped me to take my path to Philosophy. 
The Hemispheres lyrics are like my Bible...

    But how can a lyricist influence a generation of free-thinkers? 
Admiration isn't the word. What I feel is more like the relationship 
between a master and a very indirect disciple. Neil is a very important 
person in my life. And I don't want to say silly things. Neil taught me 
that it isn't the way. If I could, I'd try to make Neil feel proud, not 
for having made a skillful drummer, nor a good poet, but a good person. 
That is what I feel.

    I believe that this isn't the moment to make discussions about 
privacy, or respect or anything else. At this moment, we must try to 
make Neil feel proud of us. If he can read the TNMS, we must make him 
feel that his work haven't been in vain. He gave us more than 20 years 
of laughter, music, joy and tears. And we must be thankful about that.

         My respectful and sincere condolences to him, his family and 
all the Rushians everywhere.

"Stupid and naive"?  Not even close.  Obviously, none of us will ever
*know* whether Rush will end until an announcement is made.  

Personally, I don't think Rush will release another studio album.  How is
my gut feeling (that Rush will call it quits) any more "stupid and naive"
than your opinion (that Rush will not end just yet)?

> Sometimes getting back to something you like to do with people you like

If I had a nickel for every comment like this in the last year I could
retire.  I would guess that for Neil, giving up music, giving up his
friendship with the other members of Rush, and giving up Rush are three
*different* things.  

I'd be surprised if he hung up the drumsticks forvever, and never spoke to
Geddy and Alex again.  

But, I wouldn't be shocked if he simply decided not to record another Rush
album, or tour with the band anymore.  He has always had a love/hate
relationship with his fame, and I don't think it is stupid or naive to
think that the events of this past year may have upset the balance for
him.

Obviously, Neil is a very private person despite his career choice.  What
makes you think that Neil will want to grieve on stage in front of
hundreds of thousands of fans?  Whether or not Rush gets back together and
records more material, I don't think it's very likely that Neil will be
writing any songs about such *personal* tragedies.

> Just don't assume that their music career is over.

Fair enough.  But nor should you assume that it isn't, or call those of 
us who don't expect to see another release "stupid and naive"...

Subject: Is this the end?

About all this stuff where people are pondering whether or not this is
the end of Rush, I have this to say...

"Live for yourself
There's no one else more worth living for."

Neil knew what he was talking about when he wrote those lines.  He should
keep on living for *himself* and not for the fans.  I'd like to say that
I agree with the notion that Rush fans are the greatest group of fans
around, but I can't agree with that, because at least *some* among us
refuse to let Neil have his privacy.  

He's not a god...he's a mere mortal man who makes music for a living. 
And we just happen to buy that music.  That puts him at absolutely no
obligation to us.  If Rush continues, fine, great, I'll keep supporting
them.  If Rush ends, I'll go on with my life, and I'll keep Rush in my CD
collection.  A band ending isn't the end of the world, folks.  I'm
surviving the Grammatrain break-up just fine.  Rush is nothing more than
3 people who make great music together, and get paid to do it.  And we
happen to support them.  It wouldn't be the end of the world if they
broke up.  

Let's just give them all some space to figure out what's going on, and
quit pressuring them, okay?

A local record store in Houston has ordered import copies

Well, I guess that can rest our arguments on just what is on vinyl, huh?
Apparently, someone is producing lp formats somewhere.

 --One question -- I don't have Roll the Bones on anything

this picture also in the CD liner notes?---

Yessir, the liner notes also have the pacodermic buttocks on there,
also...although, I've never really heard the explanation as to why.  I mean,
it's not like an elephant's ass is boney (although it is pretty rolly!) So why
they put it in Roll the Bones is beyond me!

Subject: Favorite song endings...and other matters...

Hmm...that's a pretty interesting thread...and there are many a song that half
really good endings to them...some of my faves would be...

**"You Bet Your Life" (and I seem to be one of the few who actually like this
song) as I've said in earlier posts...I really dig the guitar solo at the end
of this song, because it seems to linger in your head awhile as the CD wraps
itself up--likewise, a lot of people don't seem to be big fans of this
album...but it holds a lot of memories for me...and B-sides...the album is
worth it just for "Bravado".
**Available Light"   Yet another album wrap-up song...and that sustained
guitar note as the song fades out is priceless...
**"Hemispheres"   "The Sphere" is one of the most priceless Epilogues I've
ever read or heard
**"Presto"  Yet another classic Alex guitar fade out...something he's really
good at it seems
**"The Big Money"  I think what grabs me with the end of this song is
primarily the very cool drum fills during the fade out, combined with a pretty
repetitive ending riff.

And I'd have to throw "Mission" in there too, once again because of the guitar
solo at the end...(sense a trend here?)

>>Different subject here.  Does anyone remember a show produced by PBS called 
1985?  If I'm not mistaken the theme song for that was Mystic Rythems. 
 Maybe someone could confirm that.<<

Actually, that was an NBC Prime Time News show (a la Dateline or 20/20) called
1986, originally titled American Almanac.  When they switched names they put
"Mystic Rhythms" on as the theme song, though only hardcore fans like myself
ever caught wind!  If memory serves, Connie Chung was one of the hosts.

Damn. I wasn't gonna write anything about this. I can't help it. It brings
back too much for me. Losing someone you love to cancer is AWFUL. Some of
you ask (rhetorically) "what does this really have to do with us? Its not
like you knew her or anything"

But what about those of us who DID? Now, don't jump to conclusions. I
didn't know NP's wife any more than I know NP himself (actually, much less,
because she never shared any part of her mind with me through song lyrics).
But being someone who has lost a soulmate to cancer, this tradgedy blows me
away. I can, on some level, empathize. It hurts to think about it, and I
can't stop thinking about it. (not about people I didn't know, but about
the loss of someone who makes you feel like a whole, complete person, and
what that can do to you.)

I do not know the circumstances surrounding her loss, but keep in mind that
sometimes a cancer patient's death is actually a blessing. There is so much
pain. So much suffering.

I am at a loss for words regarding the sheer number of people who are dying
from various forms of cancer now-a-days. It's stupifying. If I think too
long about it, something in my mind goes, "boing".

(from Victor).  I believe that to give the music the full and proper treatment

And of course, if we're going to dream this big, the band might as well be
