Just a quickie note today.  I'm mostly caught up with admin. mail, so you
should get replies soon if your mail warranted it.

I've put a new file out in the rush/MacSounds directory; it's called
"force10.sit.hqx".  This was graciously provided by Dan McDonald, an old-

I've about given up mentioning sending administrative mail to this list.

Subject: Gangster of Boats?

Hello again everybody!

I have an exam tomorrow so i'll get right to the
point(s).

One, does anybody have any idea how many more albums
the boys are planning on putting out? I've heard all
different stories. I've heard RTB is their last hurrah.
But they have a contract with Atlantic Records, right?
They only have two albums with them. Who would sign a
contract for only two albums? Also, if "where's my thing"
is part 4 of a "trilogy", does that mean they have three
more albums planned to complete this trilogy? That would
mean 3 more albums, plus after the "second" new one, there
would be a live recording, following the tradition of 4 original,
then a live album. Or is "gangster of boats" just a display
of their sense of humor?  ?????!  If anyone knows anything
about future albums, please post your info.

Two, does Matt Desantis ever say anything positive about
Rush? He always rips them to pieces, then his last sentence will
be "I like them, though." Lighten up!!!

Anyway, I gotta study and listen to RTB some more.

                  Later

To the personal who first opened this can of worms (i.e.
calling The Professor a "pseudo-intellectual"), who would
you consider to be a _true_ intellectual?
I am quite interested in your response, whoever you are.
You attack someone as literally gifted as Peart.  Fine,
you are entitled to your opinion.  But I am curious as
to who would qualify as an intellectual.
I don't mean to get too caught up in terms, but to me calling
Pratt a pseudo-intellectual has a definitely negative connotation,
and I would like a basis of comparison.

If he isn't an intellectual, who the hell is?

If you read yesterday's post, I said RUSH wouldn't hit the SE and SW until
at least sometime in mid-Jan.

BTW, where do all you people get these CD bootlegs?  I've been looking around
for boots and odd RUSH stuff for quite some time and never find any boots.
But wait, I'm from TEXAS, there sould be some boots around here somewhere!

Hey, when anybody finds out when Neil will be on Rockline, let the rest of us
know!

Oh, back to the first part, like I said, dates for specific cities in Texas
and other southern states won't be determined and released, according to
Atlantic, until mid November!

Later...

Subject: pseudointellectual, pshmuedointellectual

In the last NMS, there were two postings referring to me, each of
which missed the point of the posting on which they were commenting.
My point was to give some evidence that Neil is _not_ pseudointellectual.
That's all. The fact that I mentioned the names of some real intellectuals
I've known was just to point out that I have some _experience_ with certified
intellectuals from several fields. And I mentioned my education in order to
demonstrate that I have some basis on which to _judge_ the question. I
pointed out the incoherence of the only _specific_ charges against Neil
(``His lyrics, while showcasing his broad vocabulary, are quite wordy. It's
pseudo-intellectual. If he dares to use such intellectual words,  the
phrases and ideas should follow the intelligencia of the selected
words... I don't believe he knows what he is talking about.'') by
pointing out some lyrics from _RTB_. I discussed the specific words used
by the poster in order to demonstrate that the opinion of the poster
could not based on any authority with respect to such questions; anyone
with any familiarity with intellectuals or basis on which to judge
the question would certainly know how to _use_ the word ``intelligentsia.''
Of course, it's just the guy's opinion that Neil's pseudointellectual,
but it's a _false_ opinion. I had absolutely no intention of name-dropping
to _impress_ anyone or to be hostile to anyone. After all, why should I care?

The value of the NMS is the _information_ it transmits, which is unique,
not the impressions one gets of others through posts, which can be made
to _anywhere_.

Relating to the other criticism: the Nobel Prize for Literature is
_not just_ ``some kind of award'' given to ``obscure old professors,''
any more than Rush is just another hard-rock band! ;)

Subject: Macintosh and Rush
Date: Thu, 17 Oct 91 21:20:00 CDT

The Mac is credited in at least one of the album credits.  I'm not gonna
drag out the CDs to see which one; I THINK it's HYF.  Anyway, the Macintosh
has several professional-level MIDI music programs which sequence music.
It remembers keyboard sounds which can be "recorded" in real time by the
computer.  Neil wears headphones on many tracks to make sure he keeps
the same time the computer keeps.  As I have said earlier, Jack Secret
pops the diskettes in and out of the Mac in the correct order for any of
the boys to trigger.  Sometimes in a complicated song the MIDI is constantly
going, and Neil has to keep its tempo.  In this way the Mac sorta interferes
with live music; Neil can't decide to jam out spontaneously or change
tempos.  But Rush has been like that for a long time; they play straight
sets until the encore, then they turn the MIDI off and jam.  That's why
the encore songs are non-MIDI songs, mostly.

I like early Rush, and I like some bands that are really nothing BUT
MIDI, like DeeLite.  I go either way.  There are some people who prefer
non-digitized sounds.  I agree that a digital guitar sounds like crap.
But then again, digital keyboards used to be monophonic (look at Ged's
Moog from Moving Pictures).  Now they are much better.

One digital keyboard touch I think makes the song are the keys in
the first chorus of "Turn The Page" where the keyboard bends the notes.

Subject: Oh no, more dogs!

After consulting with my veterinarin, I have found out quite a few interesting
things that you may want to make a note of:

1)  At the beginning of 'Dreamline,' the sound is not a plane, but is, in fact
    the bark of a dog!  (Of course it is slowed way down)

2)  By analysing the movements of Alex's mouth in the "WARNING" section of
    the ASOH video, he concluded that Alex was barking into the microphone.
    He speculated that "they probably cut the vocal track because Alex sounded
    so bad"

3)  The so-called "jackhammer" at the beginning of 'Force Ten' is really a
    dog barking!!  I couldn't believe it, either.

4)  In the beginning of 'Witch Hunt,' when the band recorded the
    "crowd" screaming (really a drunk Lerxst, Ged & Neil) they had their
    dog along - it barks a couple of times, if you listen carefully, with
    REAL good equipment, you can hear it.

5)  My vet also concluded that all of this barking came from a Dalmation. I
    think (IMHO) that it was the dog on the cover of SIGNALS.

Well, what do you think?  Yeah, and maybe all of this should be added to the
FAQL!

Subject: stuff

	Michael Sensor - In no way did I compare Paula Abdul to Rush. I simply
said that if one listens to ANYTHING (Be it polar extremities like the
aforementioned) over and over again, one tends to "accept" it.  I was
using this to compare old Rush to new. When I listened to Fly By Night
some ten years ago, It grabbed me - THE FIRST TIME. For me -and this is
just my opinion- I have to listen to the album a few times "to get into
it"
I don't mind, though. I like moving pictures, but it is irritatingly too
commercial. Hemispheres is my favorite album musically.

	Atro, Nice entry ! It's comforting to know that you know about MIDI and
"invisible" synthesizers. Geddy likes to use the Yamaha KX88 for a
master keyboard to run his slave synths and rack ones.

	Rush has done some great MIDI work, and it's amazing that some computer
glitch doesn't ruin a show.  Like what if the sequencer that drives the
arpeggio on the chorus of  "The Big Wheel" got screwed up? 'Twould be
devistating.

	As for Neil's lyrics.... Even Geddy himself said that what was being
said (lyrically) in early rush was nebulous. Even too nebulous (sp?) for
one to interpret the real meaning. He wanted a more concise delivery of
themes (you know, without talking about Dionysus)

	Does anyone know what shows have taken place already? I'm going to the
Pgh show. I don't know if I want to know details of the show or be
surprised ..... HMMM Last year, the rabbits were a howl. Well someone
better tell me if they play By-Tor & the Snow Dog. I'm glad that Eric
Johnson is opening. At least I'll know some of his material.

A fairly new song that I really love lyrically is Second Nature. The
simple flowing chords follow the simple theme that many in life forget.

Gotta go....

Well, I'm still kinda new at this, so please - be kind to your fellow
RUSH fan.  Anyway...

I really like RTB.  When I first heard it, I thought "Wow, RUSH is heading
back toward Moving Pix, Perm Waves, etc.  from the Hold Your Fire
sound."  Now don't get me wrong - I'm a keyboard player and I really
REALLY dig HYF and Power Windows, BUT Obviously PermWaves, Moving Pix
and all those RULE as well!!!  So it seems to me (still) that RTB is
quite "guitar" oriented as opposed to "keyboard" oriented as they
have been before.  This is just an observation - nothing I'm happy or
sad about.

Also - in Jr. High I was into rap.  (I absolutely hate-dislike-loathe-
abhor rap music now.)  But when I liked it, I was into stuff like
Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, etc.  Not any of this MC Hammer,
Vanilla Ice, 2LiveDumbF****** "kill the men" and "rape the women" music.
Anyway, maybe I shouldn't have said that - POINT IS - The rap in RTB
is VERY cool and (IMHO) is done the way that it oughtta be!  Heck, if
all rap music were like this, I'd probably like it!

Ok Ok! I know all about the 'little things' that are going on all around
the stage during a rush concert. All the MIDI hookups and samplers....But
I was trying to hint at the direction I see geddy taking on trying to
reduce the amount of time he has to spend at the keys. Technology has
made it possibe for him to assign a lot of the keyboard parts to triggers
in various spots. This means he can Jam around more! He wants to Jam
around more! We all want him to jam around like he used to! Geddy is a
stud.
To Matt DeSantis: 50% Keyboards and 50% "real" instruments?! Give me a
break! Take a listen to Tom Sawyer or Red Barchetta and then take a
listen to You Bet your Life or Ghost of A Chance. You can't tell me that
there's more keys on the latter two than TS or RB. I've noticed a
significant reduction of keyboards on this album. I mean, there's just as
much or more keyboard parts on YYZ than on some of their latest songs! I
suggest taking ANOTHER listen to YYZ and check out the keyboard part
right after the guitar solo. Or the keyboard partin tom sawyer that makes
it such a recognisable song. Keyboards definately are a musical
instrument and DO add atmosphere to a music. And besides, Don't you think
that ALex, Ged and Neil know what they are doing by now?! THEY like the
music they make. They seem very happy with it. It's not like the synth
parts snuck in there while they slept.
AND to whoever said that on the Presto tour, Neil looked like he was
spending "just another day at the office", BULL! That is the way he looks
when he plays drums. That's the way he looked back in 1980, and that's
the way he'll look when he's 90. It's the look of sheer concentration. If
he didn't care anymore, why would he be playing his drum parts exactly
the same for a thousand nights?
Oh, and his solo HAS most certainly changed from tour to tour! He has
just kept his trademark Cowbell part in and a few other sequences. I
suggest whoever thinks his solo has stayed the same for 16 years, check
out some DAMN BOOTLEGS!!!!
Ha Ha HA!

Subject: Mr. Deeds, Nome, and other Rubbish

Hello all and Good Day!

Haven't posted in a long time but I noticed a couple things that needed
clarifying..

A few days ago cschwabe wanted some info on the movie "Mr. Deeds
Goes to Town" Well I just rented from the Wherehouse. It is a very old
movie that stars Gary Cooper (Yes.. the same one that starred in the
 Fountainhead) as Mr. Deeds. Without giving away too much
it's basically a comedy about an honest country boy receiving a
big inheritance from an uncle he never knew. Later in the movie
he is called jokingly the "Cinderella Man" by the press. It is a pretty
funny movie but you could guess the plot as it follows the lyrics
of the song pretty well.

Also a question was brought up about Nome..
As indicated, our fearless rush-mgr noted the existence of Nome, Alaska

BUT

according to The New Century Dictionary (1948):

nome: One of the provinces of ancient Egypt; also a nomarchy.

What's a nomarchy?

nomarchy: One of the provinces into which modern Greece is divided for
administrative purposes.

So what does this mean? Hard to say...

Can't wait to hear Neil on Rockline... imagine all those quick, snappy,
and aggresive answers we'll hear from those idiots  who are allowed to
get through..
I can hear it now.. "Neil do you have brain cancer?"
                    "Neil are you a Satanist?"
                    "Neil, what time does your watch say on the Presto
                              photos?"

If these questions come up I hope the askers are immediately shot!

Enough rambling...

Until later...

Negative, Ajoy!
	Even Geddy Lee, himself said that Neil was assuming ideas that could be
misconstrued, interpreted a number of ways. I think he refers to
something of this nature in the Chronicles CD. I interpret this as
Geddy's awareness that Neil, although having a superb mastery of the
English language, was pretty far out there. That's why in RTB Neil
chooses love for a more humanistic approach to songwriting. It is my
opinion that Neil is at least a half-baked intellectual. People thought
Dostoevsky was a half-baked intellectual. I muse reiterate, this is a
forum for opinion. I would not subsrcibe to NMS if I wasn't interested
in Rush. Rips on grammar are probably the lowest form of contribution to
the Star. At devote your typing to some type of stand....

Jadester, it's a good idea to suggest questions in case one of us is

solo at the beginning of La Villa Strangiato--my vinyl record sounds
better than that!)  Maybe the boys don't really care; but if someone were
to express our collective displeasure, maybe Neil could do something
about it.  Of course, my suggestion is no more valid than Jade's--this is
all just my humble opinion.

Subject: Question about the record polls?

Does anybody know at what position RTB debuted in the polls?

How long it stayed at that or other positions?

How many albums sold 1)1st week 2) since?

Also, how does this info compare for example to the GNR album release?

It seems like RUSH gets the immediate sell due to rush-fans but then
tails off drasticlly.

Subject: A Few Points Addressed

Hello, I have a few points to make:

1. For those of you who miss the Rolling Stone review of RTB, here
   is their typical review: "Convoluted lyrics" and "Shrieking
   hyena vocals". Who cares what they think? They are just a bunch
   of failed, jealous, musicians.

2. If you want to hear what REAL dogs sound like, synthetic or not,
   get Animals by Pink Floyd. It's a great album with a COS feel
   to it.

3. For those of you college students who don't know where Nome is:
   take a geography course! It's in the USA for chrissakes! ; )

4. I hate Bob Coburn, too. He is the biggest patronizing, ass-kissing
   host on the radio! All guest are "Great" and all albums are "The
   best I've ever heard".

5. I have noticed that alot of RTB reviews have this feel to it:
   "I like it, but I don't like it" What? The rating scales that I
   saw 20 issues ago were clearer.

6. Why bother trying to argue someone's musical tastes OPINIONS with
   your own OPINIONS? I doubt if you will change his/her mind.

7. On a lighter note, in 1999 Rush will be eligible for entry in the
   Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. An appropriate year. But, with their
   luck the entry panel will probably say "Rush-who are they?" and the
   boyz wont get in until 2112! : )

ORQ: "Why does it happen? Because shit happens! Smoke the bones!"

Subject: RUSH - STAR TREK

I have only been "on-line" for a couple months now, but I have talked
to many Rush fans, and many Star Trek fans, and for some reason it
seems that many people are fans of both.....a lot more than coincidence
lone would have. By the way, I too am both a Rush fan and a "Star
Trek Geek" I guess the Rush/Star Trek connection is one of those
things I'll have to think about when I'm trying to fall asleep....

   I've seen most of the Rush video tapes that have been released- ESL, HYF,
ASOH, and also someone's copy of a Rush concert from about 1975.
However, the video that most impressed me was Chronicles.  Although I
enjoy the concert videos and love Rush in concert (I saw them for HYF
and Presto, and am going to Rochester next weekend), I really prefer the
studio rock videos of their songs.  As far as I know, Chronicles is the
only Rush video for sale that features these.

   Does anyone know how I could obtain copies of videos for other Rush
songs besides those on this tape.  I would be particularly interested in
videos for Marathon, Manhattan Project, Prime Mover, The Mission, The Pass and
Show Don't Tell.  MTV and VH1 almost never show Rush videos (at least I've
never seen them) so I haven't had a chance to record any.  If anyone has
any of these or other Rush videos on tape and would be willing to make
me copies, please send me a message.  I would gladly reimburse someone
for the tape, postage and effort.  I realize this is in violation of
copyright laws, but as far as I know, these videos are not being made
available for sale so Mercury, Atlantic and Rush wouldn't be losing
money anyway.

   On a related note, does anyone know if any videos have been made yet
for RTB?  If so, has anyone seen any of them?

   On a separate topic, has Dreamline been released as a cassingle or Cd
single?

Thanks in advance,
