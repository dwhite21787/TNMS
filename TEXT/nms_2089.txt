In answer to all the questions, no I DO NOT know where to get a copy of
the promo sampler. I assume it will be like any other promo, and that you'll
eventually be able to find them in record stores that specialize in that
sort of thing (and I'm sure they'll show up in Goldmine too).

So please don't ask me for a copy (because I don't have one!) or where to
get one (because I don't know!!)

Subject: wait until you hear it

I can't believe the negativity this list has sunk to in expressing opinion on
the live album's song list. And none of you have even heard it!

I have the (gold) advance CDs of "Different Stages" and believe me when I tell
you (I'm a fan since '76), it's an excellent album.

Nearly half of the '78 disc is new stuff, the kind of stuff I've wondered if
I'd ever hear...while the tunes we've heard before (on ATWAS) are much
improved...the recording quality is better, Alex's guitar sound is stunning,
and with Neil in the band for an aditional two years, the older repeated stuff
(like "By-tor," "SFN" and "Anthem") kicks much more ass! (and listen for the
"Working Man" lyrics that Geddy changes as a nod to his Brit audience!)

As for the newer discs, there are some obvious omissions ("Pass" and "Ghost"
jump to mind) but they are much more "rocking" (for lack of a better word)
than any of the previous live albums...and maybe someone was on to something
when they suggested Atlantic wanted to have some hits included to insure more
sales...

also, I imagine a lot of the tunes like TS and CTTH were repeated on the new
set because these are songs that the band continues to play in concert...

As many of you know, several Rush sites have banded together in hopes of
getting Rush inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. By passing
this info around to as many people as possible, we hope to get enough
letters sent in to the R&RHOF. If they receive enough, they'll consider
Rush as nominees.

On a Rush tangent, the Virtual Concert Hall is back after a summer
hiatus.  Tons of Rush boots in mp3, including:

Animated, La Villa Strangiato, Cygnus, Better Beer, Over The Europe,
Mirrors, A Right To Passage, The Three Magicians, Live from Electric
Ladyland Studios, 2112 Days, Mystic Dreams, Autumn Woods & Winter Skies,
Fear, and Red Barchetta.

Visit at the URL below now or from the sister site, Craig's Virtual
Machine (http://www.verinet.com/~craigg) once it is updated.  We have
tried to represent each tour with the highest quality shows we can find,
but we're always looking to fill the holes left by setlist variation and
missing tours (HYF, CoS, GuP, etc.)

Subject: Live Album, New Studio Album thoughts, Rush Remasters

I am also very disappointed in the live album set list - I'm just glad
I've been a loyal collector of Rush CD boots - at least I'll be able to
listen to all the missing tracks everyone seems to want.  By the way
Presto fans, get  the "That's Entertainment" CD from Prism records if
you want to hear the Presto songs live - the CD is of very good sound
quality.

I personally thought T4E was one of Rush's weakest efforts, and I don't
think the next studio release (I'm remaining optimistic there will be
one) will be any better for the following reasons:

T4E was written over a 3-4 week period after a long lay-off where the
band had little professional contact.  I just don't believe you can
force yourself to write 10-12 quality songs in a pre planned 3-4 week
period.  Creativity doesn't work this way.  In the past, many of Rush's
musical ideas were formulated over the length of the tour schedule,
primarily via jams during sound checks.  The pre studio time was then
used to solidify and arrange the already developed musical  ideas.
Usually, only one song was developed in the studio while recording
(e.g.. New World Man, Natural Science, Cygnus X-1, etc.)
It seems that the T4E song writing "methodology" will be the way of the
future.  I hope they did lots of jamming on the T4E tour and saved the
tapes!

By the way, I just got the remastered Caress of Steel  CD- a SIGNIFICANT
improvement!  The guitar bites, and the bass and drums are very clear
and bright!  This was well worth the money.

If you are thinking of buying the remasters, and don't belong to BMG
Music, you can sign-up via the internet and select all the Rush
Remasters as your 12 for 1 initial offer (you only pay about $2.49 in
shipping for each CD.  I just got my initial seven today.  To join go

Subject: Rush sighting

Here is one of the more unique Rush sightings at least in San Diego
(what do you think rush-mgr?)

I was at a Padres-Brewers doubleheader on Sunday and lo and behold the
organ player starts playing Distant Early Warning!  At least I think
thats what it was, I was so shocked to hear an organ rendition of Rush
that forgot to pay attention to the song!

Love your show!

   [ And I love yours! :-)
     The strangest Rush sighting (ok, "listening") in San Diego I ever had was 
     someone on 92.5 (an ALTERNATIVE station) playing an acoustic version of 
     I think "The Spirit of Radio" live on the air... and it was one of their
     DJ's and it was at 4 in the afternoon!                       : rush-mgr ]

Subject: track listing on Different Stages- why the dire tone?

I don't have much of a problem with the track listing for Different
Stages. 3 cds for the price of two, throw out the duplicates from
previous live albums, you get two cds worth of material.

How many bands have released 4 live albums? Let's not get too greedy....

(although I would like to see some Presto material make the cut)

p.s. dada has a new album coming out in early September; it's as good as
their previous efforts.

p.p.s. Zed, my hard drive crashed with your email address. Drop me a

     Michael Keene said in a recent NMS:
     
     "I would be interested to know whom else takes offense at the total
     ignorance and stupidity "Mixmaster Mike" or whatever the hell his name 
     is has said about my heroes. I remember the same type of crap happened 
     in the mid-eighties when Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue said, "I am from a 
     different school of thought than to think that Geddy Lee is the best 
     bassist in the world". Can anybody actually take a washed-up, eighties 
     "band" on a reunion tour seriously? While all of the poseurs from my 
     teen years were busy listening to "Fight for your Right to Party" we 
     fellow Rush fans knew where good, real, authentic music was to be 
     found. Any comments?"
     
     Sure, I have comments! I don't know what Mixmaster has SAID about 
     Rush. He is scratching to them, but I don't think he has said anything 
     disparaging about (let's face it) the heroes of all of us on the NMS. 
     Rap gets a bad....well, rap here on the NMS. Good rap is a valid art 
     form just like good pop music. Good rap can have something to say. The 
     Beastie Boys have progressed since "You Gotta Fight". They are more 
     mature, and their talent shows. The Beastie Boys have sampled 
     Mountain, Pink Floyd & Led Zep with great success. Why not Rush? 
     Really, give me A GOOD REASON. And, a good reason is NOT, "Because 
     Rush has more talent. They are better. They deserve respect." Mr. 
     Keene, I hope you were referring to Motley Crue when you talk about a 
     "washed-up, 80s 'band' on a reunion tour". The Beastie Boys are most 
     definitely NOT an 80s nostalgia act. In fact, there A TON of people 
     that would say the Beastie Boys are more current than Rush. I'm not 
     saying that I like the Beasties more than Rush (that would be untrue). 
     But, I do like them & other good rap artists. As long as Rush isn't 
     pissed about them using Tom Sawyer in concert, I really don't think it 
     matters much if people on an internet mailing list are.

Subject: Live Album Fun!

     There seems to be a lot of discontent over the upcoming live album 
     setlist. It is all very understood. The setlist is weak (to say the 
     least). It's not bad, but it's weak. Now, say what you will about Rush 
     being able to do what they want (damn the fans) & the record company & 
     record sales, etc. The live album is, when you strip away all of that 
     stuff, is still weak. If the packaging is kick ass, it could be 
     redeemed. If there is good info/pictures included, we could break 
     even. But, Rush should really not be proud with the blatant 
     misrepresentation of the last 8 years or so of touring. I, probably 
     along with everyone else here, will still buy it because it comes from 
     the mind that is Rush. However, if that is their line of thinking 
     (along with the record company's), we are just tools; plain & simple. 
     If you are OK with that, then, by all means, have fun! If not, if you 
     have real problems with the consumer/producer relationship, then 
     please don't buy Different Stages. It's pretty simple. Make a 
     statement. I don't like the setlist, but I'll buy it, not because I 
     LIKE the consumer/producer relationship, but because I accept it. I'm 
     OK with it.
     
     That said, someone else brought up that the material that many of us 
     would like to see on the live album might turn up on a box set. This 
     is an extension of the above reasoning. We would be even bigger tools 
     if we buy this proposed box set. Are YOU alright with this concept?
     
     Someone else said that the "official" setlist might be a red herring 
     to throw us off the trail of the "real" live album. That would be 
     interesting & not altogether impossible. I think it would be great if 
     we all walked into our neighborhood record store (no chains please) & 
     found a more daring live set. I don't necessarily think this is the 
     case, but we can dream....

Can any Rush experts out there put into perspective what kind of impact
Selena and Jackie had on the music of Rush and specifically Neil's lyrics?
I know a part of 'Chain Lightning' was written about an experience Neil and
Selena shared together.  Was either of them the inspiration for or have
input into any Rush songs, etc.?  Did Neil discuss lyrical ideas with
Jackie?  I have a feeling that they indirectly touched the lives of many
Rush fans through Neil.  Maybe Donna Halper or others can shed some light.
Thanks.

Subject: My Radio City Mistake!

     It has been brought to my attention that the show I went to in
Sept., 83'  was a preview for the Grace Under Pressure tour, not
Signals, and that the new songs they previewed were 
Red Sector A, The Body Electric, and Kid Gloves.  This is absolutely
correct and thank you for correcting me.  I was confused because I had
seen them in Dec.,82' at MSG and then 
again at Radio City in 9/83 when they did those 
(5) memorable shows.  Hawkfeathr reminded me about marillion being booed
off the stage 
every night; Rush fans have never been too patient when waiting for
their Rush!  Thats why this past tour was so great (an evening with Rush
and no one else matters).  I was listening to Bytor yesterday and the
guitar leads are intense.  Been pulling out the old stuff in preperation
for the new live disks and the old stuff from Moving Pictures on back is
definitely 
their best work with MP being by far their best album..."Nuff
Said".....BobbyV

Subject: Yet another post about the Live Album Setlist!

Attention all planets of the Solar Federation,

There seems to be quite a bit of discussion lately regarding the new setlist.
Like many other posters, I personally could do without yet another version
of TS,CTTH,Limelight, SOR ect. Many people are trying to say that Anthem
probably wanted these songs to increase sales but I think that we should
remember that Rush has, and always has had, artistic freedom. I believe it
is Alex who probably wanted most of these songs. Ever since Victor it seems
like he has been going though a mid life crisis of sorts.  Who remembers
those leather pants?
Anyway if you look at some of the songs included,
(NS,2112,Freewill,Limelight
SOR,YYZ) they are all showpieces for Alex. Now before people scream "not
true!" I realize the drums and bass play a huge part in these songs but for
the most part they are guitar oriented songs. Anyone agree?

As a drummer I personally am very excited to hear NS,2112, YYZ,and Freewill.
Sure we have other live versions but 2112, NS have not been played for a long
time and YYZ, well it's YYZ!!
happily awaiting the new album

Subject: WoW What a Show!!!!

ANTHEM - A TRIBUTE TO RUSH 

I saw Anthem, a Rush Tribute band, perform Friday night at Pinky's in Tucson
Arizona, What an incredible experience!
This three man trio put on a show that would give goose bumps to even the
most avid Rush fan.

I went to the show skeptical yet very hopeful. I had never heard or seen
Anthem perform. I had heard they were good but I was a pretty tough critic,
especially when it comes to covering Rush tunes. I was very anxious to see
what songs they would choose to do. Being a drummer myself, I was also very
anxious to see how well the drummer would play and how accurately he would
follow Neil's complicated drum riffs. 

The band played everything from Dreamline to Workingman.  I couldn't believe
how awesome each band member played. The guitarist was incredible, he
sounded so much like Alex it was crazy. I mean note for note, he nailed
it!!!!!!! 
The Bass player was great too, like Geddy, he sang and played the keys too.
His vocals wailed and sounded pretty damn close to Geddy's, and what a great
bass player he was, his fingers were flaming.
I kept catching myself becoming nostalgic about past Rush concerts. At one
point I closed me eyes and I swear it was just like I was listening to Rush
themselves play. That's how great the band was playing.
The best part was the drummer. He played so amazingly well. I think Neil
himself would have been impressed. When the band played YYZ and he broke
into a drum solo, I thought I was going shit!  He wasn't trying to play
Neil's drum solo, it was his own but you could definitely here strong Neil
influence.  What a performance! 

The songs they choose to play were great. Here are the songs they played:

Dreamline					Zanadu
Big Money					YYZ (with drum solo)
Anthem						La Villa Strangiato
Spirit of the Radio				The Trees
Freewill						Natural Science
Closer to the heart				Red Barchetta
Analog Kid					The Camera Eye
Passage to Bangkok				Half the World
Stick it Out					I think I'm going bald
Lakeside Park					Test for Echo
Something for Nothing				Vital Signs
Side one of  2112 (in its entirety) 		Working Man/Finding my way
Subdivisions					Limelight

What a set list! If you ever have the chance to see these guys, do
yourselves a favor, check them out!!!
Anthem is truly a great Rush tribute band.

I don't know if anyone else was surprised, but I sure as hell was 
when Rush played the Analog Kid.  I thought I was the only guy on 
the block who had appreciated the magnitude of that song.  I now 
hear that it may not appear on the live album.  I hope it is not true.  
I think Rush would be making a serious mistake by overlooking one 
of their sleeping classics.  Does anyone else feel this way, or am I 
all alone in this matter.  Later

   [ I remember going to the Shoreline Amp. show during the RTB tour. We
     knew that "Vital Signs" was going to be played. We knew that "The Trees"
     was going to be played. It was a *HUGE* shock to hear "The Analog Kid";

Rush is notorious for nothing of the kind.

If you're referring to the earlier material, don't forget that it
was never intended to be released on a CD in the first place - and
much of the material which was recorded since the advent of the CD
was intended also to be released on a single vinyl disc.  It's 
only the last two Rush CDs which have not been generally available
on vinyl.  As you may know, sound quality suffers on a 33rpm disc
if you attempt to squeeze on more than 45 minutes or so.

In any case, you don't buy music by the minute - in my opinion, 
albums were better when they were less than 50 minutes long, with
a few exceptions.  2112 and Hemispheres would lose some of their 
impact if they were significantly longer, for example.

I admit that I'd feel cheated if I bought a full-price CD only to
find 25 minutes of music on there, but a lot of bands struggle to
fill an hour-long CD, and you end up with a partly substandard
product.

  I was talking to my best friend, and she'd purchased a new CD. She 
was listening to it, and said, "Oh my gosh, did that just say that?" she 
stopped the CD, went back through and listened to it again- sure enough! 
The band (and CD) is called NerfHearder, the track is called Golf 
Shirt... the lyric?

"I wasn't always a hard core punk rocker- I was listening to Rush and 
trying to feather my hair."   (or some semblance therein- no lyrics 
sheet)
     It was the funniest thing! You guys gotta hear it. (buy the CD, 
it's really good)

Steph
PS There's also a very interesting song about Van halen... (no i'm not 
trying to respark the controversy it's just funny)

>>>>>>
I always thought the name NerfHerder was so cool, because it was
something out of starwars (actually empire strikes back), that only a
starwars fan would pick up on, when Leia calls Han a "stuck up, half
witted, scruffy looking NERF HERDER!", notice how the logo on Nerf Herder
stickers (maybe the cd as well, but I never bought it) is written in star
wars logo writing?  I had only heard "Van Halen" when it was on MTV, I
never got into nerf herder or heard any other songs, interesting to know
they mentioned rush, but it may be to make fun of what they consider to
be "old rock bands", which right now, are NOT considered cool among the
new KROQ "Alternative" crowd, which follows new bands such as barenaked
ladies, 3rd eye blind, Garbage, Beastie (not new but loved in alt scene),
foo fighters, prodigy, stabbing westward, gravity kills etc... personally
I like this new music, and I always love RUSH. I just notice that the new
alternative kids don't tend to like rush. Even though this new stuff is
very trendy, it has to be the best new stuff i've heard in years, early
80's synth new wave was cool, but mid 80's glam rock like poison warrant
and winger got old fast! In fact, there is tons of DM, U2,D2, New Order,
Oingo Boingo and the like being played on the radio now! (I know u2 wasnt
synth heavy).  I wonder why now I like old Duran Duran that I liked as a
kid, but cant stand the poison and warrant and winger that I liked as a
kid, but Love Rush just as much, if not more than ever??!!!???!!! 

metal may come back, but I hope qweeefy glam rock like poison never does,
IMHO. (metal stayed actually by infiltrating its styles into techno and
industrial bands, and some of the heavier alt bands, Korn and Deftones
are pretty metal at times, but since they are "cool", nobody calls them
metal, at least in so cal where metal is "dead", I hear in other areas of
the country that are not as "hip to the times", kids consider Korn just
as metal as megadeth , which comes on the radio right after the Korn
song.

I think music labels are sometimes wrong as you can see, since
alternative is no longer an alternative, maybe it should be called modern
rock more often, or mainstream modern rock, here on Y107 in LA area, its
called 80's and 90's modern rock, I think they have the right idea!  but
now SWING is considered alternative/modern rock!  You can hear the Cherry
Popping Daddies or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, or the great Brian Setzer
Orchestra (stray cats) on the radio on KROQ and Y107 right after a Korn,
Garbage or 3rd Eye Blind song!!   (on Y107 you might hear: "that was some
80's modern rock from Depeche Mode, here's some 90's modern rock from Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy")

Some of these swing bands are really good... the music scene has
progressed out of the "listen to only one style and be in one clique" era
of the late 80's /early 90's, to the mid late 90's style of liking all
different styles, cuz they are all "alternative"... Personally I like
this change, of course some people are only liking it cuz its "in", but
from a musician standpoint, a lot of todays music sounds pretty good.  By
musician I mean me, and not some dream theater fan who can OVERplay the
guitar at 1000 notes a minute, I believe that is Passe' although I
frequently add geddy esque' fills to my bass playing in todays music, but
then again, rush may be technical, but its a good technical, yes I am a
rush fan who is not super keen on Dream Theater. (killer run on sentence
huh?)

What am i trying to say?

I love music, and I love rush

Subject: red star just a symbol

since people have asked yet again, I'll run through a synopsis of star
symbols.  This is a one-time thing, but I'm happy to discuss it off list.
pentacle, point up:  pagan symbol of the five elements (earth, air,
fire, water, spirit.) also the symbol of the microcosmic man in Hermetic
tradition.  It is based on the symbol of the goddess Kore, and was a
representation of the "core" of an apple--a female symbol of life. (cut
an apple crosswise--the core is a five-pointed star) It is also rumored
in Christian tradition to have been on Solomon's ring, and thereby is
one of the seven seals that must be broken to release the Antichrist. 
Hardly an evil symbol, huh?
pentacle, two points up:  representation of the bull, or goat--a male
fertility symbol--the "horned god" that was slandered in Revelations as
being evil.  Used today by the Eastern Star branch of the shriners, and
also used by the Satanic church, as an inversion of the "life" pentacle,
much as they invert the crucifix.
Surrounding it with a circle, either way, protects one from evil.
Wiccans as a general rule arrange candles at the four cardinal points
for ritual, invoking the forces of nature.  the five candles in a star
shape as satanic may be satanic ritual, I wouldn't know, but it is not
used in Wicca to my knowledge.
When the famous scripture "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" came
into vogue, medieval Christians had to stop the folk herbal remedies
(PLANTS EVIL)(I"m not sure why) and use animal cures (ANIMALS GOOD)
This is why they put butter on wounds, allowing them to fester, rather
than tannic herbal preparations that might have helped.   "Ignorance and
prejudice and fear walk hand in hand,"  The words were never truer.
The red star on the cover of 2112 is just a red star, mildly reminiscent
of the communist star--a symbol of oppression.
and no, the boys didn't pick it to be controversial and sell records. 
Every statement they've ever made about their music in any interview
makes it clear they do what they want because they want to, "Art as
expression, not as market campaigns." 

I owe Ryan Waggoner an apology--his careless and unintentional use of
the word "Crap" in reference to Wicca started a flame war.  I should
have been much more diplomatic in my response to him.  Likewise, to the
gentleman referring to "X-tian" ritual: please use the word
"Christian."  It is much less provocative.  You'll never get an opponent
to listen to you by using terms he finds insulting, no matter how
well-intentioned.

Well, how about Rush, hey?
Finally got Victor--sounds like Al was influenced by Lindsay Buckingham,
David Gilmour, Mark Knopfler, and Ian Bairnson, among others.  I like
it.  everything from cruel jazz to NIN sounding techno-industrial to
Floydness.
