Just FYI, the FAQL will be distributed in two sections from now on,
as special editions.  This reverses the previous policy on posting it
because the size limits on mailers (50K and 60K that I know of) will
be satisfied by this arrangement.  The first installment should arrive
a few hours after this digest.

    It's no coincidence that the black hole in the Disney movie was
    called Cygnus.  I believe that Cygnus X-1 was the name given to the
    first astronomical object that was thought to be a Black Hole.
    (nobody has ever proved that they exist, but this is still the
    best guess by astonomers)

Subject:      2112 (Figured out?)

I haven't posted for a while...(or read everything yet, ahem).
I hope I'm not covering settled ground here, but someone mentioned a few
issues back that the syrinx was a part of the throat, and that sparked
my conclusion to the theme of 2112.  Even if this has been presented
before, I'll share my experience--rare as it is--of self-enlightenment
on a RUSH lyric.

The temples of Syrinx are the media.  The priests are the people in high
places in magazines, broadcasts, and telecasts.  These may be editors
and programming directors, etc.  It's just my opinion, but I can back
it up with the 2112 insert.

"...then watching Templevision or reading a Temple Paper..."

The media is a voice that ultimately controls everything we hear.
(Except for word-of-mouth for which I am grateful, introducing me to
RUSH 'n' all.)  The song says that there is an elite group editing
what we should(?) have the right to choose to be exposed to.  That
includes things like music, all types of data, trains of thought,
art, and truth.  The priests decided that destroying the guitar
would be best for the people (or best for the longevity of their
reign).  That brings a parallel to Which Hunt, of course, but I'm
not going to get into that because I think (and hope) I've already
presented by points and thoughts with brilliance and ease.

                          YEAH RIGHT!!!

E-mail or post any of your own thoughts on this classic.

[ Reading "Anthem" by Ayn Rand will go a long way to explaining the 
  source of the song...                                    :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Album Title

    Hello! Yes, I am the guy who revealed the "Throwing the Stones" title.
Again, this is what I read last MARCH in _Metal Hammer_ magazine(I had
previously stated my source as KERRANG, I checked again and I found that
the album title was found in _Metal Hammer_). Again, I just relayed ifo that
I read to other Rush fans. Forgive me if my info was incorrect, but that's
just  what I read.
    Also, what is it about new releases that they get delayed for so long.
METALLICA seems to be very effective when it comes to delaying albums(like
the new one, which I heard would be out last Feb. Now they(?) are saying
it will come out either in July or August). Rush, I belive seems to follow
the same route. Guns and Roses has already started their tour for their new
album, which won't be released for another month(I hear). Any comments on
the reasons for these kinds of delays??
    I drink to "Perfect Parkinglot!!"( sorry, UCSB joke).

Subject: A syllogism and the odd occurence that Females don't like 'the boyz'

I was 'rush'-ing through the list and noticed the message about women
not liking Rush. I liked the syllogism that one (apparantly living,
breathing woman) wrote on the subject. She states something like:
I like Rush and I am a woman; therefore all women must not hate Rush.

Well, ever since reading an incredably stupid French book for a class
(The Rhinoceros), I have really liked syllogisms (all you out there
who had to take French as a requirement know what I'm talking about).
   Thanks for the message though. I'll try to think of a 'doosie'
and post it soon.

Subject: RUSH Fortune File

Hello everyone --

	Since the new album is coming out soon, I thought I'd take this
opportunity to spread around something fun ...

	I have a short fortune script and a RUSH quotes file that I am
willing to distribute to people if they are interested.  The quotes are
only from songs through the album _Presto_, plus a couple of miscellaneous
quotes.  The nice thing about this file is that it is easily updatable when
the new album comes out, plus it's easy to add your own favorite quotes to
make it more of a generic fortune ...

	Anyway, if you are interested in getting a copy of the script file
and/or the quotes file, let me know (through email - *not* the digest).
The script file is not originally mine, it is modified from an old Star
Trek script file (so my sources tell me...)

	By the way, people at jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu can run the program from
their own account.  The full path name of the fortune file is:

Subject: Fritz Leiber's "Gonna Roll the Bones"

Hello,

   Ben Ragunton writes:

	Wow, a friend of Neil's, eh?  Pretty cool (even if
   once-removed =^).  If the new Rush album was inspired by "Gonna
   Roll the Bones," by Fritz Leiber, we may be in for a wild ride.
   Here's some tidbits about "Gonna Roll the Bones," a story I first
   read half my lifetime ago and just finished re-reading.

	"Gonna Roll the Bones" is a short story, or novelette, that
   came out in 1967, and won the Hugo and Nebula awards for that year.
   It first appeared in Harlan Ellison's anthology _Dangerous
   Visions_.

	The story is indeed all about gambling, crap-shooting in
   particular, and rolling the dice figures prominently in the tale.
   The bones are the dice in gambler's slang, but bones are used
   throughout the story in several different ways.  For example, as
   the main character, Joe Slattermill, walks by a cemetery one night,
   feeling depressed, he thinks of his own bones:

             The feeling of deep misery stuck with Joe and deepened
             and he was tempted to turn aside and curl up in any
             convenient tomb or around some half-toppled head board
             and cheat his Wife and the other two behind him out of a
             shared doom.  He thought: Gonna roll the bones, gonna
             roll 'em up and go to sleep.

   Previously, Joe had made other references to bones:

             ...he heaved up himself and his heavy, muffled clanking
             pockets and shuffled straight to the door, muttering,
             "Guess I'll roll the bones, up the pike a stretch and
             back," swinging his bent, knobbly-elbowed arms like
             paddlewheels to make a joke about his words.

	I'm sure you'll all be thrilled to the bone to hear that the
   story has more than one layer of meaning, and that the themes of
   hell, the devil, and Christianity are played upon.  There are also
   some interesting characters in the story like Mr. Guts, Mr. Bones,
   and Big Gambler.  Here's a couple of metaphors that are the
   clinchers: "...by now the waves of pain had stopped running up his
   left arm and his nerves were like metal-wrapped new guitar
   strings..." and "...with the power surging in his right hand like
   chained lightning."  So, it certainly seems plausible to me that
   it's a story Neil would really like.

	Theodore Sturgeon said of this story in a review, "Fritz
   Leiber is at his cadenced, ringing best in a completely successful
   blend of science fiction and myth, and adventure and horror."
   Personally, I'd say the story's more myth and horror that it is
   science fiction or adventure, but I still recommend reading it.

Just doing my sci-fi duty, gonna roll my bones outta here,

Subject: Women, Men And RUSH

Hi, out there. I just thought I'd add in my two cents worth on this women
and RUSH thing.  IMHO it is all kind of pointless, we all like RUSH, wether
male or female.  And that is what counts, I guess.  Actually though, after
reading the past couple of NMS's, there seems to be alot more women out there
that listen to RUSH then some people think.  I don't usually make
generalizations, and won't now.  I know about the same number of women that
listen to RUSH as men who listen to RUSH.  So the only generalization that
I would make is that people who listen to RUSH have a similiar mind set,
or outlook on life, no generalizations as to what sex listens to RUSH more
or less.  Well, that's MHO, and enough babbling on an early wednesday
morning.

p.s. After 4 years, I funally have gotten my sister to actually want to
listen to some RUSH songs, she even wants me to make a mix for her.  SEEYA

Subject: cygnus x-1

you're all in trouble now... the fountain of useless knowledge runneth
over.

back some time ago (sorry, don't know the year) when radio telescopes
were new, a massive, and i do mean massive, x-ray source was found in
the constellation cygnus. since this was the first x-ray source
located in cygnus, and astronomers are what they are, it was named
cygnus x-1. catchy, eh. black holes are still a theory; but, there is
large body of information supporting the theories.

now that we've go that out of the way, we can get to the real trivia.
the event horizon of cygnus x-1 is about 9.1 miles in diameter. the
event horizon is the point where light can no longer escape and time
stands still. :-&gt; it is quite possible that the star is even smaller
than the event horizon. cygnus x-1 is orbiting epsilon eridani. this
is a blue star about three times the size of the sun, or roughly 2.5
million miles in diameter. currently cygnus x-1 is playing the role of
cosmic vacuum cleaner. hard to imagine something that small will
eventually suck up something that large.

whew!. enough.

hmm... rolling the bones?

I was quite suprised to see that the title was gotten from
the Fritz Leiber story. I've read it a few times over the years,
so thought it was pretty weird. Anyways, it is basically about this
miner who comes from a drab industrial town who decides one night
to go gambling with the high rollers, one of which turns out to
be death! Very good story, I advise it. Might give someone new
speculations about the upcoming album. (Gotta wait til sept :( )

Subject:      RUSH Party--How's about Midwest?

I've heard about these Rush parties every now and then, and I'm jealous.
I have never seen one person that is into RUSH as much as I am.  I live
in Mayville, North Dakota (or as I say -- "Middletown").  I'm also an
amateur guitarist looking to meet some RUSH fans and have a party to jam
and celebrate the existance of the boyz.  I would be willing to set up
something at a hotel or something in either Grand Forks or Fargo, ND.
If someone else would be interested, I would attend (but not plan) a
party in Bismarck, ND   Winnipeg, Manitoba   or Minneapolis, MN.

PLEASE, I have a severe need to jam one whole night of RUSH tunes, and
I'm sure there are a lot of listees who wouldn't mind hearing some live
RUSH for "almost free" (wow, a whole two-word quote from The Spirit).

You can help me get this thing going by e-mailing me at:

            MV012791@NDSUVM1 (bitnet or something)

[ or "MV012791@NDSUVM1.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu" for those Internet-ers out 
  there.                                                        :rush-mgr ]

If there is a chance to have a Rush party in the Upper Mid West, let's
do it.  I'm not sure how these things were set-up or run before, so if
there is someone who has planned one of these, please send me any ideas
at the aforementioned address.  I have a few ideas of my own; let me
know what you think of this:

[ We basically just threw a party in our own humble abodes.  Party/BBQ
  type food, equipment for tapes/CDs/videos, varieties of drinks, etc.
  A band would be nice, but we couldn't pull it off in two tries.  Maybe
  the third time's a charm?  Ya gotta be willing to drive a few hours,
  and the host might want to consider crash space for long-distance guests.
                                                                 :rush-mgr ]

We could get advanced registration at a hotel after we see how many
people (on the list, fans in the area, friends who are interested, and
otherwise) are going to show up.  We can save some money on the rooms
by sharing rooms (I would bring my sleeping bag and sleep on the floor
in a room if we could keep the cost per person down).  We probably
wouldn't be using the rooms much anyway.  Then, we would get one of
those "special" rooms in which to have the shindig.  Beforehand, I
and the other musicians (if there are any on the list in this area)
would converse through e-mail and establish who will be playing, a
song list, what equipment we will need (hopefully whatever each of
us has will be fine), and exchange music if anyone needs any hints
on how to play some of the songs.  The way I see it, we could have:

  1. Me and another guitarist so we won't get tired and we can
     meet some people instead of being on stage the *whole* night
     and we can do some stuff that has more than one guitar in
     it (see my other post in this issue).
  2. A keyboardist so we have someone specialized in that area
     so it can sound good.  A keyboardist will also usually have
     better equipment than me with my Casio CZ-101.
  3. A bassist OF COURSE! someone who can handle Dirk's stuff.
  4. Maybe a singer if none of us can sing.  I'm alright, but
     I would probably want to concentrate more on guitar and
     having a good time instead of screwing up the guitar parts
     while trying to sing.  If talent permits, we can have just
     about anyone present come up and sing their favorite song.

[ Hey, what about a drummer????                               :rush-mgr ]

As you can tell, I've put plenty of thought into this.  That's
because it seems like a damn good idea to me!  I urge anyone to
contact me if you are interested.  There's no one around here who
understands the magic of Rush (even the other guitarist in my band).

I was wonder how Alex (I love the name King Lerxst) does _Chain
Lightning_ live.  Since I became a RUSH fan late last summer with
the first listen of MP, I did not have the chance to see RUSH on
the last tour.   As if I had a chance of them coming close to here
anyway.  The end of this tune has a (possibly very slightly distorted)
guitar doing the  G C# D  thing and also a (definitely) distorted
guitar doing the synchopation unison to the bass.

Does he let Ged do the heavy chords on the bass?
Does he do both at moderate distortion?
Is one of the parts sampled?
Who says "That's Nice" and do they use a voice modulator? live, that is
And is the rhythm guitar on _Passage to Bangkok_ sampled? live, that is
