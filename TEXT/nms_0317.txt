  Seen some pretty interesting things in this edition!  I am
looking forward to getting RUSH's new Album (Sept 3rd, right?),
and Metallica's new one (when I can find it).  But right now, who
cares about Metallica! IT'S A RUSH DIGEST!!

  Since how I live in the You Pee (U.P) OF Michigan, you don't
hear much Rush up here.. So I seem to be the only on that hasn't
heard the new one (but I can always call the radio station that
plays RUSH once in a while)..  But it sounds pretty cool!

 I've also met a couple of RUSH fans on IRC (International Relay
Chat).  I can name a couple of people (they'll know who I'm
refering to).  Lets see, theres Rocinante, wow, and I can't seem
to remember anymore..  Hey dudes!  It's PEART!  (or Supra,
whatever).

  Anyways..  Just thought I would do my once a 3 month post.  :-)

the announcement said nothing about the new release.

they have a continent-wide 800 number (us & canada) 1-800-ont-rock

it's the same number they are using for their fledgling satellite network

Subject: Neil and his ugly alter ego

 Thanks to the FAQL, we all know the various projects that Geddy & Alex
have done with other artists throughout their careers. But, sadly, there
is a significant absence in this list that we all continue to deny. I think
all of you know what I mean. It is a black dot on a once pristine image - an
ugly stain that we can not wipe away. But, to be a true fan, we *must* accept
the good AND the bad of our favorite group. It is painful, yes, but no one
seems willing to even *acknowledge* the other band that Neil has been
performing with for many many years. It's rather embarassing to the die
hard fan, myself included, but we must confront *and* accept Neil's now
infamous southern alter ego. Please - support me...

 Since his big haircut in the late seventies, Neil has been performing
under the alias Fred Schneider as lead singer of the B-52s. Yes, yes - I
know. We've all tried to ignore it. We've been hoping that he'll come to
his senses and give it up. No one talks about it. No one even implies
that it exists. But considering the success of 'Cosmic Thing', we must
accept this alternative creative force as a permanent fixture. He has,
in fact, released his own solo work under this alias, as evidenced by the
single "Monster (in my pocket)" currently on cable's Video Jukebox...

 Ladies and gentlemen, Fred Schneider IS Neil Peart. We've been silent for
far too long...

Subject: "Dreamline" info

Here's some "Dreamline" info courtesy Beth Kepple, Music Director at WKLS-FM
in Atlanta.  She called me (!) at work (!!) in response to a message
I left on a BBS here (see below), and was remarkably candid.  Of course,
in a sense they owed me a bit.  :-)
"Dreamline" has been released to SOME radio stations across the country
-- officially anyway -- as of Monday 8-12-91. of Monday 8-12-91.
  Other stations, notably Atlanta's 96rock and (I think) SC's 96wave,
have NOT been granted formal permission to play the single, and
were sent the album only on cassette.  Some stations have been
jumping the gun and playing the single anyway, after dubbing it
from the cassette to tape-cart.  These stations could also be
playing other songs from the album, again probably without Atco's
okay.
  Reportedly, the single will be formally "playable" in two weeks --
perhaps one week by the time this gets out over the net.  The
album, of course, is due out c. 9-2 or 9-3-91.

  Rumour has it that the single was officially released only to
stations with heavy metal in their format.  Possible reasons:
effort to market the new Rush album to a metal audience as well
as/instead of the more routine AOR crowd; attempt to give the metal
industry a 'boost.'  Still, this is only a rumour -- so far.

  96rock here in Atlanta began playing "Dreamline" -- against
Atlantic's wishes -- Thursday evening 9-15-91.  They'd received the
tape, but were unsure WHICH song was the first release single until
I happened to mention it by name ("Where is Dreamline!?") on the BBS
operated by the station's CE, RockRoll Atlanta.  Another success
for electronic communications -- and with some thanks to moi,
Atlanta can now hear the Rush single -- fairly sparingly, 'tis
true. &lt;g&gt;

Wow...something definately sounds messed up with those radio stations out
there.  After I logoff, I'm going to call up WDVE Pittsburgh and ask the DJ
if he can explain why most places are completely ignorant...  (If I can get
through--the line was busy all morning)  Maybe I'll get a free complementary
copy of RTB for giving him new info or something (Yeah, right... :)

BTW, all of you in Pittsburgh:  Let's swamp 'DVE with requests for "Where's
My Thing?", the allegedly excellent instrumental that I haven't heard yet.
I still haven't heard any rap either.  "Heresy", "Dreamline", and "Neurotica"
are in very heavy rotation, though.

I'm also going to look into getting my New_Rush library digitized for you
other deprived people out there...

Remember:  call (412) 333 - WDVE and demand to hear "Where's My Thing"!!

Subject: Dreamline and Roll The Bones

Hi there,
	I just heard Dreamline on the radio for the second
time.  For those of you in VA, MD, and DC it's on DC101.
The first time I heard it early this morning, I called the
DJ and our conversation went something like this:

"Is this the first time you're playing Dreamline?"

"yes"

"When will you get the whole album?"

"Next week..Do you want a copy?"

"YES!!!!!!!"

"Ok, just give me your name, address, and phonenumber
and we'll call you when it comes in.."

So i get the CD before Sept 3..I'm very excited
to say the least!!  I was bummed because the
third is my first day of school and I wouldn't
be able to listen to the album until I got home
but I guess I don't have to worry about that now!! :-)

--Supriya

P.S. A big thanx to the rush-mgr for playing Dreamline
over the phone for me...:-)

From: "Chris Webster" &lt;cwebster@rodan.acs.syr.edu&gt;

Perhaps this is an obvious question, but please answer it anyway. :-)  I'm
one of those poor souls that lives only in the range of sucky radio stations.
But, I've got a soundblaster card, hooked up to my stereo!  So, if I were to
get the soundblaster format of dreamline onto my PC, I'd be able to hear
dreamline on as good of audio equipment as when I can get it on CD....
The only problem is that the file is 2.2 megs.  The biggest file I can copy
to my PC is 1.44megs (3.5" disk).  I do have a modem to download it with, but
it is only 2400 baud, and I have call waiting; it's likely that someone will
call in the five hours it will take.  Sigh.  (It is a rotary line, so I can
not turn it off.  Sigh.)

So, how does one split a file into two parts (on a SunOS box) and then
recombine it into a single file on a ms-dos pc?

Sorry that this wasn't really rush related, but I figure that there might be
at least one other person out there who also needs this answered.... :)

What a joyous day Saturday was.  I was driving back from Boulder to Colorado
Springs, listening to "Fly By Night", when the DJ says, "You're in the middle
of a Past and Present Double-Shot."  I immediately cranked the volume, and
was quite impressed, except for all the static I was eating, being far away
from the station.  Later that night, waiting in the long parking line to see
Sting at Red Rocks, it happened again, and this time we had a recorder!  
Howeverwe once again had static, and even a little bit of top-40 dance music
spliced into the middle as well!  Much of the song survived, but I still must
listen to the damn radio until I can get a better copy.  Hope these two weeks
and two days go by fast!

Subject: RTB radio premiere in Pittsburgh...  NOT!

Bums me out, man.

The DJ's on WDVE had been pushing it all week, leading me to believe
that they were going to broadcast the premiere of the whole album on
Friday night, from some lucky fan's house.  Well, they *did* play the
whole thing at someone's house, but they didn't bloody broadcast it!!
Hell, for all I know, they only *claimed* to play the whole thing.  In
any case, for those of you who asked me to tape it for them, I guess
we'll have to wait like everyone else.  :-(

On the broghter side, for those of us *in* Pittsburgh, at least they're
still playing various cuts from it.  I've heard four now: Dreamline,
Neurotica, Ghost Of A Chance, and Heresy.  (But no, I haven't taped
them, as I usually hear them in my office or on my walkman).

Soon, soon....

I converted the "dreamline.au" file to macintosh FSSD format and played

   Well, they finally played Dreamline here in Denver!  Last night (the
17th) I heard KAZY play it at about 11:45.  Heard it again today around
3:00 p.m.  I must admit I was expecting something a little less pop -
oriented, but I still think its a really cool song...  Hopefully the
rest of the album will be killer.  I can
't wait!  [sorry about the skipped line there, I'm so excited]

   How do the other songs compare with Dreamline?  I'm especially
interested in Where's My Thing?  Has anyone heard that yet?

   p.s. KAZY said that the album would be out September 3rd as previously
reported.  Hopefully there won't be a delay...

Since we would all like Rush to tour our fair shores, The best way

                    Let Frank do it.   (OB Murphy Brown quote)

Yes, since Frank is oh so priveliged in getting to opportunity to
talk to Geddy, if we all ask him very nicely (hi Frank! :-) ), then
maybe he could slip this query into his list_of_things_to_ask.

Subject: Back from Canada!! :-)

Hey hey people! I just got back from an absolutely fabulous trip to
Canada (Montreal, Quebec city, & Toronto)!!! Aside from marvelling at
all the tress & water - it was a really neat feeling to hang out for a
bit in the guys' homeland! It was also kinda fun to bug my travelling
partner (a friend from high school) with Rush quotes & trivia & the
need to take pictures of anything that was remotely Rush-noteworthy!!
The only annoying part was that we kinda had to listen to her music
most of the way since she was driving - and she doesn't really like
Rush.  :-(   I was stuck listening mostly what I've termed "The
Manchester Shit." Oh well...

1 question though - why isn't there any Rush paraphernalia in Toronto?
I figured there'd be a little bit since it's their hometown - maybe I
wasn't looking in the right places... Did they stop making posters &
such a while back? Oh, I was able to find _Visions_ - but that was it.
Speaking of which, I agree with wilkinso@darkside.com (Sean Flanegan)
from a few issues back, referring to the B-Man in _Visions_:

&gt;He talks like he is sooooooo special because he knows the band!!!

It gets pretty annoying at times...the pictures are pretty cool
though...

Anyways, since I couldn't find Rush 'stuff,' I instead went on an
Anthem buying frenzy & got a few CDs of the boyz & of Max Webster.
That was about all my pocketbook could handle. Blast the G.S.T.!!!!!

Hmmm..I guess that's about it... Can't wait 'til the third!!! I doubt
any of the stations here are playing Dreamline, but I haven't really
been around to listen for it anyhow! If anyone gets a Mac version of
this thing working, please lemme know!

Pat

ps - I think the Willowdale subdivision of Toronto looks like SW
     Houston...strange though that may seem....    :-)

Hello everyone!
	Well, I just thought I would add my two cents about the whole
RTB thing.  I called WMMR last night to find out what the deal with
the single is.  The DJ said that he saw it around the studio a few
days ago but that he hasn't seen it since!  (Gee, I wonder if someone
made off with it!)  He said that they had played it a couple of times
when they got it.  Funny, *I* haven't heard it!  (Believe me, I have
sat through a lot of crap to not hear any new RUSH.)  They hadn't even
heard about it when I called last week.  Oh well, anyway, he said he
would try to find it and play it for me.  I listened to the station for
about three hours but didn't hear it.  I guess I get a bit more nasty
tonight.  :-)
	Also, I had called Tower in Center City but although they had
gotten a shipment on Tuesday, the single wasn't in it so they told me
that they MAY have it next Tuesday (the 20th).  I find it hard to believe
that Tower only gets shipments once a week!  Anyway, a friend and I
decided to go to the Tower in Cherry Hill, NJ.  Well, they didn't have
the single either.  (Although I did see the wicked box Yes thing.)
However, RTB was listed for Sept. 3 release on their upcoming releases
list.  This is, of course in reply to the person who was worried that
Tower doesn't know anything about it.
	Well, one last thing.  If anyone figures out how to play
"Dreamline" on PC, PLEASE post (or e-mail me privately)!  I can't
say how much I want to hear it, even if the sound quality isn't that
great!  (Somehow, I think that a lot of you out there know how I feel.)
	Well, guess that's all.  Sorry for all the rambling but I am
feeling a bit frustrated about this whole thing.  :-)  Take care.

DC-101 (Washington DC) has, and was playing, Dreamline, but I still haven't
been able to hear it.  I got some phone calls from friends who mentioned that
it had been played several times on Friday, but never when I was listening.
Ah well...

I've found ONE local record store that's heard of RTB, and their release date
is Sept. 13th (NOT 3rd).  Dunno about that one.  And no one has a date for the
singles.  It appears that (around here at least) the album will appear before
any single cuts from it.

Well, here in Pittsburgh, I think we've been the luckiest with respect to
hearing Rush tunes...

I've heard: Dreamline, Heresy, The Big Wheel, Ghost of a Chance, Nuerotica.
They've played, but I missed: Roll the Bones, and one other, which I heard
about 20 seconds of but couldn't tell which song it was.

First impressions: Tight, smooth sound, very sharp, quite "mellow", intense
sounding, lots of energy, but not loud/raucous/heavy.

I'm sure it will grow on me.
(I've got Dreamline/Heresy/Neurotica on tape. Didn't like Neurotica. I'd
digitize, but I don't have the equipment, sorry!)

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Can anyone confirm a later than Sept. 3rd release?

     This is another 'you know you're a Rush fan when...' but first a bit of
context.
     I've managed to get every Rush album on the day it was released from
Permanent Waves to Presto (inclusive).  Now that I've heard "Dreamline" here
in Baltimore, and thanks to the enthusiasm of the readers of the NMS, I've
discovered I'm in a quandry.
     You know you're a Rush fan when you are torn between spending ten days in
Puerto Rico (ie. Paradise) and missing the release of the Boys' new album!!!!

			Oh Well...that'll happen

well, the wait for DREAMLINE in Lexington goes on.  On Saturday, 98.1 WKQQ
The "Mad Dog" asked if anyone had any information about the new album.  Well
thanks to all of you for posting the information I was able to let everyone
in on the information.  They did not even have the name of the first release
or the name for the album.  Well, I did give  proper credit to the National
Midnight Star and he said to keep up the good work.  He did take my name and
phone number so he can call me back this week and slowly release the new
information about RTB.  He did say that they were expecting the new
released some time this week.  Would anyone like to mail me a copy of the song?
I think that would impress him if we gave him a copy of the song before
the record company does.  Oh, BTW, the "Mad Dog" once did a 4 hour long
block of just RUSH, so this guy is a BIG fan.

And finally, Is September 3rd. still the release date for RTB? and has
anyone heard anymore about the tour?

It seems as though `Roll The Bones' is going to be the first single
released in the U.K.  The D.J. I heard play it sounded surprised by
the rap section!  Presumably the record company see a different
market over here. I haven't heard Dreamline yet though, so I don't
know why it wasn't considered appropriate for a first single.

What's this?  I'm going to have to wait ANOTHER WEEK to
hear a single off Roll the Bones in the Bay Area?  That's
the word I got from a DJ at KOME at about 11:00 AM (PST)
this morning. I guess the people at Atlantic have put off the
release date for the single another week.  Boy I tell ya,
these people at Atlantic are really starting to piss me off.
I decided to take matters into my own somewhat capable hands
and call these Jokers. My first call went straight to a phone
answerer at Customer Relations.  Ya, they'll be calling me right
back, sure they will.  Then I got a little bit lucky.  When I
called again I goofed and asked for the PUBLIC Relations
department.  I was able to talk to a real human and she was
giving me almost any information that I wanted, until (you know
there had to be one of these) she asked me if I was from a
newspaper.  Of course being the upstanding young nipper that I am
I put my brain in neutral and drooled the death phrase "uh, no, I'm
just a guy..."  Boom!  Off to the phone call graveyard.  This
did, however, "Set the wheels in motion" (ooh, good one).  I
thought if I called back under the guise of a reporter from the
official Rush Fan electronic daily news I might get a little
bit more...

"Hello, Atlantic."

"Yes, can I have your Public Relations Department please?"

"Publicity."

"Hi, yes I'm calling for some information about the new Rush
album."

"Are you affiliated with a newspaper?"

"Well funny you should ask that.  I am a 'reporter' from
the Rush Fan electronic daily newsletter the National
Midnight Star, and I'm curious about the details
of the release of the new Rush album "Roll the Bones."

"Well the album is scheduled for release on September 3."

"What about a single.  Which song, about what date...?"

"At this time we have no date or song title for the single."

"What can you tell me about the 'illegal' broadcast of the
album on the east coast, and what is your policy on such
things?"

"Well, I think someone in promotion should handle this..."

End of conversation number 1.

I should say that I also got the number for the Publicity
dept. of Atlantic in LA (1-213-205-7412), and my overall
impression is these people are taking me very seriously.

Now that I was starting to feel extremely self-confident, I
called the LA office and asked them which stations had the
exclusive rights to play the album first.  Promotion people
on both coasts are getting back to me about this stuff.
I think there is a definite angle here to get some prime
info.  I plan to ask them about the station in Pennsylvania
that is playing the entire album (won't mention the call
letters to avoid screwing you Pittsburgh people out of
your sweet deal...) and how the hell these things are
decided.

Anyway, thus ends my foray into investigative journalism.
If I hear more, so will you.

In my last post, in which I announced I was moving in with another
Rush fan (and TNMS reader), I neglected to mention that this is not
the first Rush fan I've roomed with.  It has been brought to my
attention that I haven't given credit to Dan Dickerman (another
TNMS reader), one of my old roommates, for "fostering a healthy
interest in Rush" in me.  In fact, I didn't listen to any Rush on
a regular basis before Dan, and it was his _Signals_ and _GUP_ CD's
that changed my music tastes forever.  In exchange for this brief
moment of appreciation, Dan will wisely keep quiet about my former
musical interests...
