Date: Tue, 28 Mar 95 20:06:45 PST

Anyone notice that most obscure, classic Rush songs are the last song on the
album?  I know that no band saves their best song for last, but at least to me
it's been turning out that way (HYF and Signals are exceptions).  Iron Maiden
seems to be the same way (remember those classis IM hits like Mother Russia,
To Tame a Land, and Alexander the Great?)  Anyone else notice this?

Also, I know Rush is not a *singles* band, but has anyone else notice that the
songs they have been picking lately have not been the strongest the album had
to offer (Stick It Out?  Show Don't Tell?  Good song, about fifth/sixth best
on the album).  I think Nobody's Hero or even Cut to the Chase would have been
a much better choice.

Or maybe it's just me ;-)

[ to all Rush fans who find it hard to wait more than a year for the next
  album, try being a Yes fan.  According to their recent schedule, their
  next album should be 97/98. ]

On the Eric Johnson / Eddie Van Halen battle they are both excellent
guitarists with their own distinctive sound. I don't think it's fair to
compare them because of their different styles. They play a different style
of music, and that also makes it difficult to compare them.
My fave's (in no particular order)
1) Michael Schenker
2) Eddie Van Halen
3) Randy Rhodes
4) Steve Vai
5) Alex Lifeson

Could someone please clarify for me what the difference is between the MFSL
Discs and the Gold Ultradiscs II?  Or is there no difference?  In the FAQ it
seems to refer to them as separate entities, but on the MFSL home page it lists
MP, Signals, and 2112 as MFSL released discs.  Ironically, those are the discs
that are out on Ultradisc.  Could someone please help?  I would like to get my
hands on the ones that have the original liner notes.

Subject: First post, long post, lamp post?

Hello, all you happy people,

I've been lurking for a week now, and I can no longer stand it.  I've got to
post for the first time!  There are so many things I want to include, so if
this turns into a novel, don't flame me too bad.  :)
First, I'll gab about myself.  I discovered Rush about five years ago, thanks
to some friends who couldn't play Chronicles enough.  My favorite album is
ASOH, wherein lies the single most bitchen performance of "Closer To The Heart"
that I have ever run across.  The video is even better.  If live albums don't
count, then by golly, I must say that _Presto_ (yes!) is my personal favorite.
*WHAT!?!  _Presto_, someone's favorite!!?!?*
Yep.  But don't get me wrong, I love every album--- I just play those two more.

Strangely enough, I'm kinda partial to any Rush song with and acoustic flavor
to it (Presto, Nobody's Hero, Making Memories, Closer To The Heart, In The End,
Lessons, and a bunch more).  I WOULD LOVE to see a Rush album with a majority
of the tracks done acoustically.  That's not a flame against the synth era or
any other era.  It just seems like it would be cool to hear.  NOT Rush 
unplugged or anything, but the idea of a few simple, quiet acoustic Rush 
tunes seems appealing.

My first (and only... :( ...) Rush concert was the last tour, when the Boys came
to Indianapolis with Primus.  Incidentally, Primus ruled.  However, I noticed
several people leaving after the Primus show, and not even staying for Rush.
That is SO STUPID.  Anybody who would pay for a full price Rush concert ticket
and then waste it by watching 45 minutes of Primus and then leaving surely is in
need of therapy.  I'm not flaming Primus fans, I'm flaming those fools who took
off.  Enough on that.

Let's see... random comments.  I can't get women into Rush (something about
Geddy's voice just runs them off--- I don't get it, but that's the complaint I

seem to get on them--- pardon the line skip).

If I have a least favorite song, I think it would be a toss up among a few.
Emotion Detector (PoW), Available Light (Presto), and Open Secrets (HYF) just
don't do anything for me.
Some of my other likes in the world of music include Bob Mould (or any Bob Mould
derivative, like Sugar, Husker Du), R.E.M., +Live+ (damn those guys are cool),
Frank Zappa (yep), The Police, Traffic, and a cast of thousands.

YKYARFW:  (for some reason, I thought this was obligatory)

1.  After spending your paycheck on Rush CDs instead of groceries, you say, 
    "Who needs food?"
2.  You're not from Rush county, Indiana, but whenever a Rush fan asks you, you
    say you are, just to be cool.
3.  You read Huckleberry Finn right after MP hit the charts, hoping that the
    next album would have a sequel to MP, track 1.
4.  You were disappointed when Huck Finn didn't appear on _Signals_.
5.  You've actually juggled balls of flame.
6.  You check your top hat every day for rabbits.
7.  You find rabbits.
8.  Your phone number is 100-1001.
9.  You think you're going bald.
10. Your bedroom window opens every time you turn on the TV.

Well, I've gabbed enough.  Time for me to bolt.  Next time I won't write such
a novel.  :)

Thanks and stuff,
John

Well I wouldn't say god, but he is respectable.  And he is not a session
player. He is a performer.  Session players are known for their
dedication and precision in the studio.  Geddy was never about that.
I've noticed  that the more experience you gain in playing out, and the
more people you meet who can really rip - Ged's playing was definitely
good, but It's not like _nobody_ can do better...

Yes, but he became versatile in the rock genre.  Look at somehing from
the debut album. The level of difficulty and style is on par with the
stuff I used to bang out on the bass when I was in 9th grade.  Then
compare it to, say something on Hemispheres -> Moving Pictures ....
there is an evolution there. There are more subtleties in his lines now.
 Again, he is a performer, he does not have to play Jazz.   (he probably
tries to at home :-))

>	Further, Geddy's basslines are very "guitar like".  That is, it
>is obvious to a serious bass player that he began as a guitarist.  Many
>(not all) lack the rhythmic focus basslines are supposed to have to

Correct-a-mundo! sometimes they would make a _better_ guitar part!
this is the primary reason why Rush is hard to stomach for some listeners,
(note that I said *some* listeners, because I do stomach and enjoy all
of his Bass lines, as well as other bassists)  the basslines are too
detached and melodic.  Unseasoned listeners get confused and eventually
lose interest.

But  those people who _learned_ the bass from listening to Geddy, learn
a lot in a small amount of time, and when you go back and try to play
along with most other rock tunes, it's boring... like riding on that E
for half the song!
You know what I mean.

I am a jazz keyboardist who turned to the Bass after listening to way
too much Rush.

Totally. Couldn't agree more.

Too many people do around here.

Exactly! I'm glad someone had the balls to finally point that out.  I
play just like that. It is a *very lazy* way to play.  It depends how
you started to play bass.  I had no formal instruction on the Bass, only
on the piano.  But I can play almost anything I want on the bass, so it
really does not matter from a performance point of view.  I learned bass
from translating what I knew about scales on the piano, and the melody
of Ged's lines to the bass.  It was more fun than going to another set
of lessons!!  Plus 5 years of Jazz piano gave me some extra improv
skills.

Yes. he does stab at them, but it is a pretty aggressive sound, don't
you think?
He can make the bass have a 'poppy belch' to it and it sounds cool in
much of their music.

>agree wholeheartedly with the individaul who respected Geddy's
>musicianship.

I do too.  However, many of you should check out _lots_ of different
bass players.   There are more conservative bass players out there who
deserve a merit award just as Geddy does.  There are lots of players out
there who can dog Geddy, too. Especially session bass players. There is
a big difference between session playing and performing.  A lot has to
do with chance, but once you are getting big, it has less to do with
ability. (Although Ged is an exception to that, he actually did maintain
a good deal of integrity throughout his career, regardless of popularity
or wealth)

Oh yeah, Stephen, I'm wondering what other Rock bass players you dig...

I personally like Duran Duran bass lines... what the hell is his name again.
He sounded better than your average rock bass performer!
I think he is the unsung bass hero of early '80s rock.

What did you think about the bass player for elton john in the 70s, when
he had a _real_ band.  Shit I forgot his name, too! what's wrong with me
today!
Anyway, he was another one of my inspirations. Especially his work on
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road!

Sorry about any unrelated Rush content.  I think most of it is appropriate

Rush-anz,

How are you doing?  I am at The University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, and I am the MC for our India Nite 1995.  Whenever I
MC a show, I always close with a quote from Rush lyrics. (Basically for
good luck) For example, one show that I did just a few months ago had
the theme "Instill The Flame."  It basically meant that we must not lose
sight of what is important.  So for that show I ended it with a quote from
"Available Light" from PRESTO.  That is just an example.

For this show, the theme is "Retracing Our Steps."  This theme is more
personal, and can mean different things for different people.  EMAIL ME
AND TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU.  My interpretation is that it is a look
back at our heritage/ancestry...and that humans should not lose sight of
who they are and what they stand for...something like that.

ANY IDEAS FOR A RUSH LYRIC THAT FITS THIS MOLD???  I am really stuck.

Also, if any of you have any jokes that I would be able to use on stage
(in front of 5000 people), then I would GREATLY appreciate it.  I hope
that I can count on my fellow RUSH-anz/RUSH-headz to pull me out of this
mess!

Help me Obi-Wan...you're my only hope.  -Princess Leia

Subject: Monsters and stuff

     This is in response to whoever said that they heard the SNL band play
"Monsters" from Villa.  This melody is some kind of old jazz-swing
standard.  I'm not sure what it's called or who originated it, but our boys
definitely did not come up with it.  You can hear it on old cartoons,
among other things.  I doubt that G.E. and the SNL band had Rush in mind when
they were jamming that melody.

	I agree that Ged is excellent at what he does, but is not a great
technical bassist.  Although I am a drummer, many bass players that I've
played with have told me this, although most of them still idolize him.

	I was one of the people who said that the 2112 and Anthem stories
aren't completely the same.  There are similarities, but only vague,
general ones.  To whoever suggested that I read Anthem:  I
HAVE, or I wouldn't make any comparison in the first place.  I was
actually let down that there wasn't even a guitar in _Anthem_.  That's a big
part of what makes 2112 so cool, IMO.  Yes, it is quite likely that
Neil's subconcious mind was at work because he had already read Anthem.
He has said many times, however, that he didn't conciously base 2112 on
Anthem, and didn't realize any similarity until he was done.  (The 1991
Rockline interview comes to mind --If anyone who doesn't believe me wants
to trade something for a copy of it, e-mail me.)  I'm really sick of arguing
about this, but dammit, I'M RIGHT!!  :)

     Rushians,

        Do any of you ever have dreams about the band.  For example,
     getting to meet them, or getting to go on tour with them, or helping
     Neil write a song etc.  Just curious.  Please share no matter how
     bizarre.  Heres mine that I had last night while sleeping:

        I was going to a Kings game and Rush was performing before the
     game.  (weird isn't it)  They started the set by playing Thriller by
     Michael Jackson and the crowd loved it.  Then they proceeded to play
     songs i have never heard before and they claimed it to be new
     material.  It sounded weird.  After the concert I watched Neil take
     down his drum set and I offered to help him but he got so defensive.
     He was afraid I would mess up his system.  So I went to talk to Alex
     and he was smoking a cigarette and he had really long hair and he
     didn't say much.  When I went to talk to Geddy he was so busy watching
     the Kings game that began after the concert and he was eating a pizza
     and I felt that I shouldn't bother him

     Well, their is my dream last night about the band.  I have had others
     but I can't remember them.  Am I weird?  Do I need help?  Please share
     your Rush dreams or nightmares no matter how bizarre.

  I don't presume to answer for all "born again's" or Christians, but for
me, as a very soon-to-be Lutheran Pastor, I don't see that being a Christian
and being a Rush fan as mutually exclusive. I can understand how people
would feel this way, but I've always seen this as a type of lazy
Christianity. It's so easy for some Christians to say that Rush is
anti-Christian and evil, or you can insert the usually subject for the
argument here. But if you took the time to investigate or just give some
things a chance, anyone can see that much of what lazy Christians say are
inherently evil are really not. I don't pretend to understand all that the
members of Rush stand for or believe in. And I don't agree with all that
they openly say about what they do believe in.  But I can understand their
point, and I can still be a fan.
  As for so-called "born agains", I see what you describe as far from an
isolated incident. Many "born agains" are so enthusiastic about what has
happened to them, but just as much "in the dark" about Christianity and have
to rely on what others say and teach, especially from those they see as
being "experienced" Christians.
  So, to sum up (sort of), there are Christians AND Rush fans out there.
They are not necessarily exclusive of each other.
  BTW, I've been a Christian all my life and a Rush fan since 2112 (I just
turned 30 this month.)

Subject: re:  rush on SNL

	I heard the SNL band playing the tune (part of La Villa
Stragiato) also, but I do believe that that particular part of the tune
is also popular in many warner bros. cartoons (especially in scenes of
mass production).  I did not think that they were trying to imitate
rush's aspect of the song.  I am of the opinion that SNL needs a new band
anyway, along with a new studio where the actual talent they do get in
there can sound half as good as they do in real life.  Anyways, back to
rush.  I don't mean to offend by saying that rush probably got that part
of LVS from a bugs bunny cartoon (check for yourselves) because they are
without a doubt my favorite band.  They do choose some weird associations
though, with the three stooges and such (its amazing how many people can
despise the stooges!!!) so it seems that cartoons, and Ayn Rand just go
to show the extremes in thought (or lack thereof:) that we love to hear.

Subject: adam clayton and other stuff

wayne-
	how can you say that adam clayton is a stiff?  just because u2
plays what tends to be more slower, laid back music than rush, doesn't
mean adam isn't a good bassist, he's just a different type of bassist
from geddy.  if you listen to songs like "the fly" and "salome" you can
really be impressed by adam's bass ability.  i think of the three
instrumentalists in u2, adam is the most talented.  sure, the edge sounds
good, but most of his guitar is pretty easy and he uses a lot of pedals
and other technology to enhance his playing.  larry is, well, he's okay.
of course, we all know that bono has possibly the best voice in rock and
roll.  please don't anyone tell me geddy's voice is better, okay?  i
still haven't decided which band i like better, u2 or rush...  i think
their next albums will decide it for me, though rush has the momentum
right now.  _counterparts_ was MUCH better than _zooropa_.
	okay, i decided to list the top 5 people at each instrument and
vocals that i could think of.  i'd be interested in what other people think:
BASS				DRUMS
1. Geddy Lee			1. Neil Peart
2. Adam Clayton			2. Matt Cameron (Soundgarden)
3. Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers)	3. William Calhoun (Living Colour)
4. Les Claypool (Primus) 	4. Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater)
5. Stanley Clarke		5. Lars Ulrich (Metallica)
GUITAR				VOCALS
1. Eric Clapton			1. Bono
2. Eddie Van Halen		2. Anthony Kiedas (Red Hot Chili Peppers)
3. Nuno Bettencourt (Extreme)	3. Gary Cherone (Extreme)
4. Jimmy Page			4. Chris Cornell (Soundgarden)
5. Vernon Reid (Living Colour)	5. Rivers Cuomo (Weezer)

okay, that's it for now....

I've almost driven off the road a couple of times listening to Available
Light. That seems to be the only song that makes me lose control
of my car (on a regular basis, anyway). I probably shouldn't even let
myself bring Presto along in the car when I drive, but it's my favorite
album, and it comes out ahead when I weigh the lives of myself and those
around me against the sheer listening pleasure....

I also got pulled over for speeding while listening to Power Windows (Grand
Designs, I believe). Rush was with me on that day, because I was doing 70
on a 55 highway and only got a warning.

Subject: Trees, YYZ and "Norm"

Well, from what I've read, Neil has got a lot of you thinking of the Oaks
and Maples as humans. In the FAQ, Neil is quoted as saying, "...I saw a
cartoon picture of these trees carrying on like fools. I thought, 'What if
trees acted like people?'" He goes on to say that he wrote it as a cartoon,
he thinks the listeners conjure up these images of people-like trees and
that it is a "very simple statement." I guess that means Neil thinks
people are fools (at least when he wrote it), and I'd say the trees were
acting like fools who were foolish enough to let themselves get chopped
down for the sake of equality. Actually, when I first really listened to
the song, I thought it was a cool story with cool music, then I thought, hey,
they (Rush) are Canadians, they have a maple leaf on their flag, maybe
its a political statement about Canadians maybe feeling overshadowed by
the United States. But after reading all these other interpretations, I think
I'll just think of it as a cool song with cool music.

YYZ is the airport code for Lester B. Pearson International Airport which,
from a previous post, I'm guessing is not in Toronto, but serves the
"metropolitan Toronto" area, much like Detroit's Metropolitan Airport (DTW)
which is really in Romulus, MI. Those codes aren't just for the pilots, the
ground crews use them to make sure luggage gets to the right planes. Really.
I'm not kidding. And YYZ isn't just for Air Canada, it's for all flights,
commercial and private. Oh, and while I have the FAQ here, Neil says he
smacked the plywood on a wooden stool. "Very demanding, technically - took
years of practice," said Neil. Tongue in cheek, yes?

This last part may seem weird, but lately, whenever I listen to "Vital
Signs," I can't help getting these mental images of Norm Peterson from
the TV show "Cheers." That would be George Wendt's character. You know,
"elevate form the norm" and "deviate from the norm" and such. Stuff like
Norm at the bar or in his painter's clothes. Maybe that could be a video?

Later, David

I doubt I'm the first one to mention this, but I haven't seen it yet:
Neil Peart is a Tom Robbins reader. I think that's his name...anyways
my dad bought a book by this guy (I'll let you guys find the name of
the book) but its main characters include a can and some guy who
turns slowly.
Anyways, for those of you fanatics that have to have everything Rush,
no matter how little...(like buying Master of Puppets for Metallica's
Thanks or Burning for Buddy) you might want to check this book out
'cause it has a quote of recommendation by "Neil Peart-drummer for Rush"
Can't remember his quote (I'll let you find that too)...

In the April 3rd, 1995 issue of Maclean's magazine
there's an interesting article written by Neil Peart.
In case you don't know, Maclean's is a weekly news
magazine published in Canada.  The article is about
one of Neil's bicycle tours of Africa.  Very
interesting really.  There's also a picture of Neil
sitting inside one of those portable collapsable tents.
He has a strange looking grin in this picture.

BTW.  I know this is a Rush forum but I would just
like to suggest something to all Rush fans...
Check out "Dream Theater" if you haven't already.
Their sound is kind of heavy but their style will
probably appeal to fans of Prog Rock.  I like 'em.

Subject: Ghost of a Chance

Hi all,
	This is a follow up post which has come from an
email discussion about religion.

Basically the discussion touched on Ghost of a Chance, and how
the line in the chorus about not believing in angels was against
religious beliefs.

I had been listening to the song in the car, with my 18 month old
daughter singing along (she also sings along to Barney, so the taste
element covers a wide range at the moment).

I realised that perhaps what Neil is getting at, is not so much that
he doesn't believe in the things he mentions in the first lines of the
chorus (destiny, guiding hand of fate etc), so much as whatever I choose
 to believe, there's always someone out there who loves me. Perhaps this
fits in more with Christian beliefs, rather than taking it at face value.

I thought this gave a new angle on that song, as it always seems to be
a very pessimistic view of life.

I'm sure there are some Neil lyric analysts who have something to add on
the matter.

Subject: If Geddy and Alex still helped with lyrics...

     I was just thinking about Rush's first album, with such profound
     lyrics as "Well hey now baby, well I like your style... ooh yeah, oooh
     yeah."  Such a change when Neil Peart came into the picture!

        But just think if Geddy and Alex still had input, we may have been
        subjected to some of the following classic lines:

        Closer To The Heart--
        And the men who hold high places, must be the ones who start
        Well hey now baby, let's get Closer to the Heart.  Oooh yeah, oooh,
        yeah.

        Grand Designs--
        Against the run of the mill, static as it seems
        We break the surface tension with our wild kinetic dreams
        Hey baby, well I like your curves and lines
        You drive me crazy, you're a grand design

        Distant Early Warning--
        An ill wind comes arising across the cities of the plane
        It's a comin', yeah baby it's a comin'

        Mission--
        Spirits fly on dangerous missions
        Imaginations on fire
        I just wanna rock and roll you woman
        Until I fill my desire

        Xanadu--

Folks,

Using WorldCat on the net, I can give you some more information about
the two book titles that were mentioned a few issues back.  Check a
library for these titles:

Deena Weinstein  *Serious Rock:  Bruce Springsteen, Rush, Pink Floyd*
Montreal:  New World Perspectives, 1985  -  27 pages.

Carol Selby Price  *Mystic Rhythms:  The Philosophical Vision of Rush*
San Bernadino, CA:  Borso Press, 1995.  This is obviously brand new.

I'd be curious to see if anyone can find them.  I'm going to try to
order them inter-library loan from here and see what happens.

Subject: Peart's name and Woody Allen

Rush fanatics-
	I've been seeing a lot of stuff about how Neil's last name is
pronounced and was thinking I could not really call myself a rush fan
without even knowing how to say their names.  If someone could spell it
phoenetically and either send it to me personally or post it that would
be lovely.  I was also wondering what the name of the movie that has been
discussed about Woody Allen who can't spell things like "gun" and "act"
on a bank robbery note.
	In response to someone referring to Geddy's bass skills as not as
good as the average Rush fan believes them to be, I have to beg to
differ.  I don't know much about the bass but I have friends who play and
look up to Geddy's style and innovation.  I also have to believe that he
must be pretty good considering he has not only been featured in many
musical magazines, but also that he was positioned neatly on the front of
the very first bass player's magazine back in 1985.  It seems as though
he has been well recognized in the music world for what he has done and
therefore his abilities might have been played down by the person that
described his skills as technically rudimentary.  Just a note, please
keep the flames to a minimum.

From: RED BARCHETTA <gros0466@uwwvax.uww.edu>
Subject: The Cross of Holy Fire

     After all this talk about this song, I thought I'd add my two cents.
This could be rather long, so bear with me.  I took that whole part
(Wilderness of...holy fire) and thought about what Neil could have meant
by it, keeping in mind he was talking about decision making and dreams,
along with KGB references.

Wilderness of mirrors:  You are trying to make a very important decision,
  and you're not sure how it's going to turn out.  You try to see ahead,
  but you can't.  You're also afraid you're going to make the wrong one.
  If you think about a house of mirrors, you can get so confused and
  disoriented that you don't know which way you're facing anymore.  I
  think that's what he meant there.  You run all your choices through your
  head and look so many different directions that you get yourself all
  turned around and you don't really know what's going on anymore.

Streets of cold desire:  Let's look at cold desire.  I think the desire is
  wanting to make the right choice so bad, you want it so bad.  The reason
  why it's cold is because you also have to be realistic and pragmatic about
  it.  You can't just pick a choice and go with it, you can't afford to act
  heedlessly and without thinking.  You know you have to really think about
  what you're doing and be absolutely sure that what you're going to do is
  the thing you should be doing.  Pretend you're in that haunted house of
  mirrors, and you want to get out of there bad.  Just heedlessly picking
  a direction isn't going to help you get out of there.  You have to keep
  your wits about you and try to keep track of where you are and where you
  turned last.

My precious sense of honor, just a shield of rusty wire:  Neil's talking about
  making decisions while asleep, that you just work it out at night and wake
  up knowing what you should do.  You want to keep your sense of honor, or
  make a choice that will not go against your moral standards.  But, since at
  this point you're so confused, your sense of honor or morality or whatever
  isn't really doing you much good because you can't see the outcome of any
  of the choices you have.  Things can just slip right by it.  That's why
  it's a "shield of rusty wire."

I hold against the chaos and the cross of holy fire:  Finally, to the part
  you've all either been waiting for or will never read because you got sick
  of this.  This can really be looked at in two different ways, given Neil's
  love of double meaning.  The first way is that the chaos represents the
  bad choice and the cross of holy fire represents the good choice, and since
  you're so confused right now, you don't know which one's which, so you
  choose neither right now.  The other way is that you are finally coming out
  of being confused.  You're fighting against the chaos that you've been in
  for so long, but yet aren't really sure of yourself and still are a little
  bit afraid of the consequences of the choice you will make, so you are
  hesitant about heading into the light.  You are caught between these two
  places and you're not sure about either, so you hold yourself right in the
  middle of the two.

     I hope this is helpful to anybody who decided to read this all the way.
Keep in mind I thought of this at 2 AM.  What else is there to do at that
time of night?  Sorry to go through this long diatribe, but I wanted you to
know where I was coming from.  These are just my opinions and I'm not
expecting them to be taken as dogma.

Two more little things:  I'd like to thank the ones who were having the
  discussion on the periodic table.  Because of it, I answered a Jeopardy
  question right.  "This element has the symbol Li."  It was a 1000 point
  question, too.  Too bad they didn't ask any with Alex.  "Spell Alex
  Zivojinovich's stage name using the periodic table."
     The other thing is for all you Camera Eye lovers, you should have been
listening to the radio station I was yesterday.  My mouth fell open in shock
when I heard them play The Camera Eye.  I heard that earlier that day they
had played the Prelude to Hemispheres.  Talk about obscure Rush!

Until later,

Kelly
