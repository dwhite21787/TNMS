Also thought some of you may find this interesting. I know everyone
knows about "The Defenders" comic dedicated to Rush. But if you pick up
the first 7 issues of "Astro City", you will see little Rush icons
sprinkled throughout the pages. And if you pick up the latest issue of
"Wizard-The Guide to Comics", you will see a picture of me! with a copy
of the caricature I drew of Alex for A Show of Fans. Except it's in
color! Issue 81, May 1998. Yes, it's a little self-promotional, but it's
still about Rush, right? We just found a way to get them exposed to
comic fans, that's all...

One last thing- the "Little Drummer Boy" on 'Merry Axemas'. Is Alex one
of the most underappreciated musical geniuses ever? This is a tasteful
little ditty. Totally in control, lean, and savory. I think the thing I
appreciate the most about Alex is that he can wail like Eddie Van Halen
or Eric Johnson, but has poured his efforts into becoming a piece of a
3-d puzzle, not an accompanying solo pretender. If you listen to "Caress
of Steel", my all-time favorite album, you'll see what chops and licks
and vibrato and arpeggios and all those other guitar terms this guy has.
But Rush is a group, and while they all exceed expectations as
individuals, as a whole they "are a genius". Check out "Merry Axemas".
It's well worth the investment.

I'm amazed at the number of Impellitterri and Malmsteen fans on this
list.  Everyone's entitled to an opinion, I guess.
I say Yngwie in Danville, IL, trying to impress the crowd by throwing
his guitar over his shoulder.  At one point, his wireless transmitter
came loose and flew across the stage, shattering.  The concert stopped
for 45 minutes while they found someone to open a guitar store and get
him a cord.  The rest of the performance was subdued.  Lousy
profesionalism on stage.  His playing is technically flawless, and
totally lacking in emotion, IMO.  Just an opinion.  I've only heard one
Imp album, and he sounded like a cheap clone of Yngwie.  Has he anything
recent?  I'd be willing to give him another listen. 

Has Geddy's leukemia and throat cancer been cured?  I heard that was why
he was so skinny.  About 15 years ago.  And Bryan Adams was dying of
AIDS ten years ago.  And the boys are heavily into coke, too, and have
several women on the road.  Why do people dream up these rumors?  And
why do other people believe them?

Just a few hundred points raised.
1.  I should like to apologise to everyone for torching Presto. 
 I had another listen, in a darkened room, with a glass of Chivas 
Regal.  Okay.  Mea culpa.
2.  Analog Kid didn't seem to get my point about Rush songs for a 
wedding - call it old world man irony
3.  This "not Rush musicians we like listening to" thread can be 
reduced to a few basics.  We all listen to Genesis, Yes, ELP, King 
Crimson etc, plus Pearl Jam - I bet they did not get their name the 
way Rush are alleged to -  Queensryche, plus some jazz stuff.  Quelle 
surpirise. If anyone cares, I'm listening to Copland, the new Elgar unfinished, 
John Tavener, Rush etc.  As far as great musicians go, no one lays 
down a lute line quite like Couperin, and that includes Alex on 
Rivendell.  And don't flame me, but I love the Waterboys.

Subject: Apologizing in advance

I received an angry email this morning from a gentleman in Wales by   
the name of Mark Hancock. Mark and I had attempted to trade some 
material via mail. He was generous enough to send a copy of one of the 
TFE Toronto shows. In return I sent him tapes of several boots.

Unfortunately this exchange occurred during our Canadian postal strike 
and his material never made it to him. My video did eventually come to 
me, though. I sent a second set of tapes and did not here from him one 
way or another.

This morning he informed me that he was still waiting. He mentioned that 
he would post to NMS to 'warn' folks about what a bad person I am. 
Thought I would try to get my side of the story in first so as not to be 
on the defensive.

I have met several people through NMS and have had no problems at all if 
we decided to swap info or goods of any kind. I was able to get great 
seats for the Toronto show through NMS. I was then able to sell my extra 
tickets through NMS (hey Pete!) all with no trouble on either side. I 
have developed a very close relationship with a particular NMS'er and 
have even visited them and their family. We swap tapes, videos and grits 
regularly.

So, sorry Mark. I am in the midst of sending yet a 3rd copy to you.
I apologize for Canada Post and our good friends at Canada Customs.
All you had to do was ask. Not point fingers.

Subject: Spinal Tap meets Rush

Spinal Tap
I think that Rush and a host of other bands who were doing the 
'concept' thing in the seventies were all implicated in Spinal Tap... 
but the disintegrating band and the trouble with Dave St Hubbins' 
girlfriend were pure Black Sabbath (by the way, listen to early Sabs, 
Led Zep and the first Rush album and play spot the difference).  Also 
the bass player, Derek Smalls, seems to me to be a deadringer for 
Geezer Butler (Sabs).  Others see UFO in there, so you pays your 
money and you takes your choice.  By the way, for lovers of metal 
spoofs, check out Bad News and More Bad News - exquisite send up of 
the late seventies NWOBHM - New Wave of British Heavy Metal (Saxon, 
Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Tygers of Pan Tang...)
While I think of it, the band I have heard which sounded most like 
Rush were a group which came out of the British progressive rock 
outbreak of circa 1982 (Marillion, Pallas, Twelfth Night) called 
Trilogy, only in this group the lead guitarist doubled as keyboards 
man.  I've got a demo somewhere, but I can't play it to you can I?
Oh, and finally, really, if you thought Ged's voice was, er, strange, 
check out the lead singer of Budgie.
I love this

With apologies for the spurious NP message to British fans

Well, gotta go pick up the wife now.

<<  I know the majority of us love each and every
Rush song for its brillance in music and lyrics.
A lot is posted about a favorite solo or Instrumental  etc.. but not
as much emphasis is put on the lyrics.How about your top ten Rush
songs in terms of the lyrics. >>

Even better, here's how differently I see the lyrics to some of these
songs:

>1.Subdivisions- We all can relate to our growing up with this song.

I can't.  I grew up in the inner city, and I feel that this tune
refers to suburban teens.  I was busier trying to stay alive, unraped,
and out of gangs than worrying about anything this song mentions.  But
I love it nontheless.  

>2.The Pass- A beautiful reminder that life has both its ups and downs.

When I was suicidal, this was one of four songs that helped pull me
back from that brink.  Just hearing that "What have you done?" made me
realize truly what I was contemplating.  Hearing this takes me back to
that time, and helps me never to think like that again.  

The rest I agree with. Unfortunately I'm writing this from work and
don't have my CDs here, otherwise I'd mention a few more songs that
have special meaning for me.  Might do that tomorrow, if all hell
doesn't break loose here like it usually does on Friday at 4:25 pm (I
leave at 4:30).  And yes, I'm one of those people who find special
meaning in lyrics... I'll never understand folks who get irritated by
that.  My boyfriend's one, and I have to be careful not to mention it
around him... yet he's got the 2112 cover tattoed on his arm!  Talk
about special meaning...!

Until next time,

I'm surprised to read this.. as far as I can see, Rush's direction has 
pretty much been straight-ahead, mainstream, corporate rock, since 
Presto.  Sometimes it's well written and enjoyable, like T4E, sometimes
it's very bad indeed (IMO), like Counterparts, but nowhere is there a
hint of the inspiration or sense of adventure of the late seventies 
/early eighties, these days.  I don't think they're interested in
establishing a new direction or breaking new ground anymore.  I think
they're content now to stay within the profitable, safe boundaries of 
mainstream rock music, which is why "The Camera Eye" sounds so much 
more distinctive than (say) "Virtuality".

By the way, to the idiot who flamed me for asserting that the Police
split up more than five years after "de do da da", claiming that they
ended effectively in 1984, you may be interested to know that they 
went into the studio to record an (aborted) album in 1986.

Subject: Rush sighting on the NMS...

Did anybody else notice that one of the posts in #1995, "The English Pub", 
was sent in by "Neil Peart <npeart@anthemsro.com>"?  I'm guessing that that 
wasn't really _the_ Neil Peart, because 1) the content of the post 
suggested that the author had been reading the NMS fairly faithfully (fess 
up, rush-mgr!  IS NEIL A SUBSCRIBER???); and 2) that sort of thing just 
doesn't happen, it just doesn't.

   [ It wasn't Neil folks, just someone posing as him.           : rush-mgr ]

In fact, since nobody said anything about this in #1996, I'm guessing that 
everyone else came to the same conclusion.  What I wanna know is:
How was that done?  How does one manipulate what the recipient of an email 
sees in the "from" window?    Is this just some bunghole with the same 
name, perhaps an Anthem or SRO employee?  Is someone at Anthem/SRO (or a 
server _named_ "anthemsro", perhaps for this very purpose) yanking our 
chain?  Did the rush-mgr fabricate this post just to wake us up?  Is it 
even remotely possible that Neil really did break both cover and character 
and post to the NMS (mmmph! heehee)?  And why did "Guitar for the 
Practicing Musician" pick the song "Ceremony" to transcribe off Joe 
Satriani's new album "Crystal Planet", when there are so many superior 
_and_ more instrumentally interesting songs on the same disc? (sorry)

I missed this the first time around, and good fucking thing too.  I
probably would have gone ballistic and gotten myself kicked off the
list by Rush-Mgr (my apologies on this post to you anyway).  It was
bad enough to spot it in a reply and have to take a few deep breaths
before I was unable to resist making this reply.

(Visualize Tom Hanks in "A League of Their Own" as he tries not to
SCREAM at the outfielder who threw wild during the Series:)

Mr. King, you are welcome to any point of view that floats your boat. 
But it would be most kind of you to NOT subject others (namely, ME) to
your homophobic rantings and ravings.  Perhaps you can find a list for
homophobes and vent your spleen there?  You know, be among others "of
your own kind".

Perhaps you should listen to some Rush lyrics.  Try "Nobody's Hero". 
(See, I kept it *kinda* on topic...)

This is all I'll say on the subject; I won't go on and on; no more OT
about it.  I would have posted this directly to Mr. King only I don't
have his Email address. 

Now, how's that for a polite not-quite-flame?

Subject: Hey

Kudos to everyone on the list!  the last two have had pretty good Rush
content.  I didn't mean for my first few post to be so brazen.  Anyway-
In response to Caress Of Steel, I agree about Geddy doing some of his
best singing on this album.  I haven't listened lately, so I can't
comment on if his "worst" is also prevalent.  I just love the sound of
"They bow defeated"  (waayyy 70's rock voice)  I love Nec. and Lamneth
but I think fans would have had a better reaction if they appeared on
separate albums.  Overall, I think it's the most underrated album
(although Presto and HYF have come under attack lately).
For the HYF dis-likers, listen to the Bass.  Not out front and hard to
hear, but some of Geddy's best stuff is on HYF and Power Windows.
Listen for it close, he hides some great stuff.
I too am getting married this year, and have been working Rush into my
fiancé's palette.  She now makes a game at guessing song titles and
trying to match it with albums (she gets excited when she gets it
right...very cute)  As for Rush at the wedding, I joked about how I was
going to play a bunch of non-wedding stuff at our reception (using
Warrant's cherry pie and Def Lepards pour some sugar on me as jokes)
and she told me that she wants Rush played because it is part of me and
that she feels it is important.  I don't know what song(s), but I'm not
looking for just romantic or slow, I think too many people are looking
at this question from a bride and groom first dance type thing, and I
don't think that is what was ment by the original poster.
One last question....I've always wondered why magazines and books have
always refereed to early Rush as very Led Zeppelin-like.  I'm an avid
fan of both groups and own the entire (commercially) recorded library of
both groups and have NEVER understood this comparison.  If someone could
point me to the Rush song that sounds inspired by Zep, let me in on the
secret!  AGAIN, incase people are not reading...I love both groups and I
admire the talents of all the members and I'm well aware of Zep being
around longer, Bonham's great....yada yada yada  (this post is flame
retardant for my safety)  I just don't hear the connection that seems so
relevant to the critics!

Subject: A second guitarist

 A lot of bands benefit from having two guitar players ,along with the 
ususal rhythm section of bass and drums.If Rush were ever to have a two 
guitar lineup who would you pick to be that second guitarist ? consider the 
players style and personality before determining who the lucky one will be.

For me it would be Andy Summers, formerely of the Police.
He uses a lot more harmonics than Alex but it would fit in well and the two 
would complement each other.Personality wise he is a little zany at times 
which again would complement Alex's style.

I would be interted in hearing who others pick for their second guitarist.

It just...moves me I suppose.  Red Sector A conjures up images of a Nazi =

When that album came out, I ignored any other rumors.  Now I read the

Hey gang..
Read with interest the post about Geddy doing some Syncing at an early
Dallas show during the CP tour. I don't seem to remember that. I was at the
first Dallas show. I think it was only the second show of the tour. I
remember Geddy had to really reach down to hit some of the high notes, esp.
on Analog Kid, but don't remember him singing 20 feet away from the mic. Not
flaming here, just don't remember anything like that. Had pretty good seats
too. Nick Hocky arena!!!

Regarding Geddy getting bagged while synching to "Double Agent", he must 
have completely abandoned the effort when I saw the Counterparts tour because 
he just let the tape do the talking, just like the rap in "Roll the Bones".  
Speaking of that, during the last tour, the "Roll the Bones" video/rap got 
jammed for a second midway through.  It righted itself on an off-beat, but 
the boys played right through it perfectly.
 
Lyrically, I'm a big fan of the "Fear" trilogy, "The Trees", "Losing It", 
and my all-time favorite Rush tune, "Natural Science".

Hello,

  I just want to thank those who have been positive about a recent
thread I proposed concerning playing RUSH at a wedding.  My intention
was just to see what songs other folks would feel appropriate for such
an occasion.

  I believe Mar hit the mark with her comments in NMS #1997.  I too am a
fan (some may say FANatic) and find it a fitting way to celebrate. 
Besides, my friends would be shocked if I DIDN'T play a RUSH song.

Take Care and keep the suggestions flowing,

I have noticed that many material on this list is un-rush-related, or in
shorter terms: URR-CRAP!
I am angry about the crap about wedding songs, fav drummers other then
neil, and the worst of them all;  favorite other bands then RUSH.
I have also gotten e-mail frommany others with theie flame throwers
ready on the URR-CRAP. I will try to hold your fire by asking if people
could come up with some real rush threads. For example: What do you
think oare some the most inspirational songs by Rush, like ones that
just bring a smile on your face no matter what: 
(Mine would be either SPIRIT OF RADIO or EVERYDAY GLORY)
If you don't like this thread come up with some more. Maybe some of us
can Hold Our Fire for a bit longer.

Hi all,

Hey cool another equipment question, Have I pissed anyone off yet (let the
flames begin!) 

To answer Christopher Palo's question Geddy was using a Wal bass.  They are
made in England and are about as far from a Fender as you can get.  They
have two humbucking pickups and a longscale neck that runs through the body
on most models.  They are expensive and hard to find in the states.

That's all for now,

Personally, it was a Steinberger.  I nearly
pooped a brick when I first saw Ged playing what
I had thought was just a new-wave fad bass.  Then
I played one myself, and absolutely loved it.  I
didn't buy one though.  I remember it being very
easy to really fly on the fingerboard, great action
for some reason.  The drawback is that you have to
stand while playing it.

I think Geddy did some pretty good equalization
with his Steinberger, since it sounded much more
rich on GUP than I could make it sound in real
life.

Or, HPFSFPRF for short.

I would like to welcome you all to the new not very secret rush
organization.  Our goals are noble.  We will, as a group, fly to Canada,
kidnap Neil, Geddy and Alex.  We will then force them to tell us, in
comlete detail about their family histories, health and real names.  We
will then take them to offices of Anthem where we will make them pull
out absolutely every recording they ever made and play them for us.  We
will them put Rush on a very rigid schedule.  Once a year, for two
months, they will record.  The rest of the year will be spent touring
and/or having dinner at the houses of HPFSFPRF members.

Well I think it is a good idea. :p

I would like to voice my opinion on COS.I love it,it is raw,heavy,and
loud.While the lyric's ,overall, are not the bands greatest,there are
still some well written and meaningfull moments lyric'ly.Lakeside Park
has great lyric's,it brings back fun childhood memories for me,and it is
IMHO a classic "summer" song.Bastille Day has a very cool concept,i'm not
too fond of the lyric's,but musically I think it is a kick ass tune.I love
the drums,it's a personal favorite of mine to jam.I Think I'm Going Bald
also has a neat concept,also I love the bluesy riff's in it.The
Necromancer is my favorite song on the album,it is one of RUSH's heavier
songs and reminds me of BLACK SABBATH in places.It has haunting guitar,and
Geddy's vocals gie me chills at points,especially early on, 'and southward
journy on',and 'spector's never fear -they bow defeated'...are two of the
best sounding vocals on the album.FOL always puzzles me...I never quite
know what to think of it,it has odd timing and some crazy changes.I am
always left wondering if I really like it or not.It does,however, have
a few moments where Geddy does some serious wailing vocally,which is cool.

   Overall I think COS was a very ambitious album that never really
reached it's potential for several reasons.It has a different sound
than most of their other recordings .It probobly did not turn out 
as they wanted it to,but it is still a solid effort which exposes a
slightly different side of the band.

First, to my good buddy Scott Chase..."Something strange is afoot at the
Circle K" is from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (Excellent!)

Second, Christopher John Palo asked about Geddy's bass on p/g.  To the
best of my knowledge the Steinberger was the only instrument he used on
that album; a sound no Fender can reproduce (for better or for worse).

Third, Grand Designs - You're right, the Sec Soc society thing is old.
But heed my mother's advice, "If you ignore him, he will go away."

For what it's worth, I am very much enjoying my freedom from the KAR
(now with Scott's company).

WELL, mighty WHIZard! (you are the most clever one, aren't you!?) It would
certainly not be the first time I was called that (maybe the first time
since the 6th grade...). I'll bet you couldn't stop giggling to yourself

Frodo did not ultimately need the ring, that's why he cast it in the fire.

I think that if an elephant got incontinent on my keyboard, there would be
a lot more wrong with it than the F acting like a T, don't you? I certainly
wouldn't type with it anymore, except maybe to write YOU email.  =)

Besides, you're puny flaming device couldn't hold a candle (pun intended)
to my Elephant OR my Tinkle!!!! 

<okay, enough with the (f)lame device>

Rush content--They rule, plain and simple. I was listening to Animated in
my car today. I think for my new cd-r project, I'm going to take all of the
funny intros they do live,(or as many as I have available, anyway) and
intersperse some of the studio cuts. Let them intro Country Cold Fahyre,
then play the studio track. That sort of thing. Should be amusing. Like
this list, of late.

I think the whole SecSoc and KAR thing is because people aren't eating
enough bran these days. Once you get your sphincter all bunched up, it does
strange things to the rest of your body, including your thought process.
For some folks, (like Gandalf, perhaps) there's not much separation there
anyway.

Great thread on favorite song lyrics...here are a handful that tickle my
cerebellum....

A.  Emotion Detector - "When they lift the covers from our feelings, we
expose our insecure spots, trust is just as rare as devotion..."

B.  Kid Gloves - "Anger got bare knuckles, anger play the fool, anger
wear a crown of thorns, reverse the golden rule..."

C.  Red Lenses - "And the mercury is rising, barometer starts to fall,
you know it gets to us all, the pain that is learning..."

D.  Losing It - 'nuff said.

E.  Mission - to hear Neil Peart write "I walk through the beautiful
buildings and I wish I had their dreams." is very, very humbling.

F.  Bravado - "We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost..."

G.  Spirit of Radio - The power of the all-too-familiar "glittering
prizes and endless compromises..." line is often overlooked
(overheard?).

H.  Something for Nothing - "What you own is your own kingdom, what you
do is your own glory, what you love is your own power, what you live is
your own story."  Amen.

I.  Hand Over Fist - "Take a walk outside myself in some exotic land,
greet a passing stranger, feel the strength in his hand, feel the world
expand."  Take that challenge to heart.

J.  Cold Fire - For some reason the line "A phosphorescent wave on a
tropical sea is a cold fire" has always created an intriguing image for
me.

K.  The Fountain of Lamneth - the picture I see in my head when I hear
Ged sing "Yet my eyes are drawn toward the mountain in the east,
fascinates and captivates, gives my heart no peace.  The mountain holds
the sunrise in the prison of the night, till bursting forth from rocky
chains.... The valley floods with light."  is very, very vivid.

That's enough for know.

Play nicely, share your toys.
