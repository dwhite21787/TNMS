We've been fooling around a bit with the website, and have set up our own
Rush radio station! It broadcasts random MP3s of Rush 24 hours a day, we have
all the studio and live albums up (many of the studio albums we used the
Japanese releases of, and we have the Japanese version of DS up as well).

To get the station on your computer...

Go to the NMS website front page, there's a big beautiful link that'll 
start up the streaming for you. We have tested it with WinAmp, we're not sure
if it'll also work with MacAmp or other MP3 players, so your mileage may
vary. Enjoy, and post your feedback! Just remember that it is STREAMING MP3
so the quality won't be all that great, don't bother giving me feedback about
that :-)

Also, I was informed that Different Stages has been nominated for a Juno
under Best Album Design! It's up against The Hip's "Phantom Power", New
Meanies' "Three Seeds", 54.40's "Since When" and Barenaked Ladies' "Stunt".

Subject: Fisheye lens defined

Dear Rushians,

    As a photographer, I would like to enlighten all the readers about =
fisheye lenses. This lens takes in 180 degrees, with barrel distortion =
around the edges to accomodate the extremely wide view. Some fisheye =
optics have a circular image in the centre, like the teeny round mirrors =
within the regular passenger car side mirrors. Anyway, the fisheye was =
born with Stanley Kubrick's classic "2001: A Space Odyssey," almost a =
quarter century ago.

    These lenses are special purpose and very expensive. I believe that =
Nikon once somehow produced a 6mm fisheye that took in 270 degrees, =
costing over $10,000! Given that one of MP's themes was photography, I =
have know doubt that this was what the boys were referring to: "Living =
in a fisheye lens, stuck in the camera eye."

    I hope this will end this stupid thread.

Subject: Fisheye lens

I really hope that everyone who was responding to the question of the
meaning of,.....I can't believe I'm going to say this...."Fish Islands"
were all just kidding and really do understand that the lyric is
"fisheye lens" in the song Limelight.    A fish-eye lens is a
wide-angle, anamorphic photographic/motion picture lens that distorts
the image in a somewhat round, more dense fashion.  The term fish-eye
comes from the fact that the distortion of the image may replicate that
of what a fish might see.
    These lenses are very popular and are used readily in music videos.
The only example that comes to mind is a video by the band
Bush...(pardon my ignorance in the title, but I don't listen to Bush,
but do know the video)...where they sing, " I don't want to comeback
down from this cloud"...It was the first thing I heard from them.
Anyway, in that video the lead singer sings into the lens, swinging
around on a rolling chair etc.  Well that is a fish-eye lens that was
used in that sequence.
    But what bothers me the most is the fact that people put thought
into "Fish Islands"...I mean, this is truly disturbing.  Read the liner
notes for Christ's sake.  I mean, when I was in film school in San
Francisco, I thought I saw truly one of the most ignorant things in my
life: a college student who spelled "serial killer" CEREAL KILLER.  But
this is a close second.  Thinking man's band, uh?
    Also, I agree with others that the question asked on Rockline the
other night were pretty bad, but did like alot of the responses.  Both
Geddy and Alex were very open and didn't seem to disturbed.  The talk of
songwriting, bootlegs, the quintessential Rush song being "Tom
Sawyer"..."plus, its' got a really cool bass part in the middle" - Ged.
    That's all

Subject: fish-eye lens

Look in a photography magazine. A fish-eye lens is simply a lens with a VERY
wide field of view. They are very similar to the little peep hole that's
probably in your door! They typically have a 180+ degree field of vision.
This is so you can see someone hiding up against the door, and why your
friends look even uglier through it!
I would think "living in the fish eye lens" means having every thing you do
under constant scrutiny, but i'm no poet.

What do you think, gang?  Was DS really "necessary"?  What a stupid f---ing 
statement.  Is any album from any artist "necessary"?  Further proof that, 
when it comes to Rush, you either get, or you don't, and it's not worth 
trying to explain it to those who don't.

I'm loving the "stepped-down" 2112.  Very rich and full-sounding, particularly

Subject: Re:Fish Eye Lens

Just to clear up some confusion, a "fish-eye lens" is a camera lens that
gives the effect similar to looking into a glass Xmas ornament (ya know,
BIG nose, forehead and chin way back). Many photographers use them in
wide distance shots, such as a mountain and plains, kinda to give the
mountain (the main focus of the shot) a little more umph. My dad used to
have one but could never find a good shot to use it on

Hey fellow Rush-Heads.

>I'd like to know why Neil Peart can't loosen up on his kit.....[etc]

Wow.  Now that is an interesting point of view.  Really, I am not being
sarcastic.  

This post has had my old brain-box working overtime!  First, I doubt you can
play 2.5 to 3 hour gigs without being truly relaxed, but granted he may not
look it.  Then again, someone else Iinferred that Bruford looks so relaxed
whilst playing?  My impression of Bruford [who's playing I enjoy really very
much], is of a man with an iron rod up the back of his suit.  Relaxed?  No. 

Rubber wrists?  Oh yes.  Anyway =>

I have tried to make view known on NMS that comparing apples and oranges is
less than productive, in my humble opinion. Yet, like the pain in the butt I
most certainly am, I feel drawn into responding to this PC v. NP debate......

To me, at first glance, the idea of suggesting that PC is technically better
than NP is......well, if I am honest, laughable.  But, I wanted to think about
this for a while, as to think such would be without acknowledging respect for
other peoples' views.  I don't have too much to say on the issue, but some
thoughts do occur to me.  For example: Supper's Ready [eg. Apocalypse in 9/8],
Brand X, and PC's Big Band [sorry don't know their name?].  The first two may
indeed have been influences on Rush [Geddy]?

The latter reminds me of the "NP swings like a rusty gate" comment that
someone made, and which made me smile.  I inferred similar thoughts a while
back by saying that Steve Smith swings a whole lot better than Neil on Vox
Humana [you see, I am doing a comparison EVEN though I know it is ultimately
without point].  Now, I have not yet heard Burning for Buddy, only Neil's
"jazz" work with Jeff Berlin,  so for me the jury is still out on the "Neil
plays swing debate".  Anyway =>

Where am I going with this?  

Well, 10 yrs ago, if you had suggested to me that PC could play "better" than
NP I would have laughed/cried/argued all night.  But, thinking about PC's
swinging, and some of his unique contributions to contemporary drumming, I am
left ultimately left only to agree with my opener:  that comparing apples and
oranges, although interesting, is eventually quite futile.  It may be
interesting and fun, but I think the issue remains that these people play such
different music, and we really have NO idea whether they could play each
other's chops, that I am left with the conclusion: why bother even asking
about the comparison?  

An example if I may.  For a long time I thought that Neil had the book written
way beyond Bruford, I even had vehement arguments with my drum teachers about
it!  Imagine the arrogance. Still, please, let's put that down to youthful
arrogance.  But, I say it again [for the last time? And I will try and stick
to this] - they are all people at the upper limits of their art.  To try and
do direct comparisons is in the end not useful.  "What is good and what is not
good.....?"  To quote a rather famous book.

A final point to try and illustrate this.  The details in this anecdote are
perhaps inadequate as usual, so please forgive me for that.  However, in the
very early 1990's I was fortunate enough to see a drum master class by, I
think, Jim Kilpatrick - the then world champion snare/field drum player.  He
performed with his drumming colleagues.  What an eye opener that was.  I am NO
expert in technique, but let's be honest - Jim had [has?] pretty much everyone
licked on the old marching drum/rudiments gig.  My point, if I need to say it
yet again, is that there is no point comparing Jim Kilpatrick [I hope that is
his name?] to NP, PC, BB, VC et al.  

Apples and oranges.  

Neil and Phil?  Different eyes see different things.

Are we not lucky to have so many tremendous drummers working and recording
today?

Bye for now -

Subject: Re: Re: Conservative Hypocrites

Greetings fellow Rushians,
I should have made my argument a little more clear, I have just recently
become a member of this digest and only now realize that I may have caught the
butt end of the conservative/liberal topic.  

It was not my intention to talk politics!   I will be honest and say that I
am only 21 and live in Vermont.  Vermont, while being the most white state in
the union, has more political parties in office than any other state in the
union.  I am not saying this as a democrat, just demonstrating the open
environment I live in.  

When I said liberal, I meant someone with an open mind.  I thought I made
that clear when I quoted Rush, "But Change Is".  I figured in this forum, this
digest swore by Rush lyrics, I certainly listen to music with lyrics I don't
necessarily agree with, I was under the impression that Rush lyrics in this
digest were the rule.  Therefore, a conservative, some one that wants to
"freeze time and ideas", according to "but change is" is a big fat hypocrite.
Ah, a political conservative is different, I was not talking politics.  When I
said conservative, I was talking of people that feel they have ideas on life
and living, death and the unanswerable thereafter figured out.  Someone who at
some point decided they had all the knowledge and answers they needed to live
with and thus, closed their mind.    
	I live my life openly and explore each side always.  For example, I am
reading Karl Marx's, "The Communist Manifesto" and Ayn Rand's, "We the
Living".  At the same time, I read passages from the Christian bible and John
Barth's "The Floating Opera" - a nihilist novel which argues that life and
suicide both have no intrinsic value.  I write songs for commercial potential
yet listen to bands like Mahivishnu Orchestra, Gentle Giant, Ozric Tentacles,
and Frank Zappa exclusively. 

As for "Jim's" friendly reply, who implied that liberals are not "welthy",
take a look at some of the great people in our society with free minds,
certainly there are many welthy people with open minds.  Perhaps you should
reevaluate what "welthy" means <farts>- personally, I have a big nose (if the
size of my nose is any indication as to my economic standpoint) (is Geddy
Jewish?) but I would say the welthiest person in the world is a person reading
a book.  If you were talking politics, how can you both be a conservative and
believe in individual thought?  Surely the government decides that
prostitution, gambling, drugs, and alcohol for minors are  not allowed.  How
can you take a real politically conservative stance and say that you believe
in individual thought when the government thinks for you on these issues and
many others?  <scoffs>  <snorts>  <snickers>  <does something>
	
	Anyone looking for amazing custom electric guitars and basses?  I got my
6-string fretted bass from a guy in East Windsor, Ct, his company is called
"Ellseworth Guitars" - they are expensive, but the sound!!!  

Love,
Nick

Perhaps.  But have you ever met an American Liberal who could count

A land where everyone is rational and reasonable.  But it does get

I cite the above as proof that liberals can be at least as stupid as
conservatives.  Besides the obvious bigotry and stupidity of that
statement, let us consider the mindlessness that allows people to
continue dividing political beliefs as left/right, black/white,
either/or, 30 years after the Nolan Chart was developed.  And how to
categorize people in countries other than the US, where (GASP!  A stroke
of sanity!!!) they have MORE THAN TWO political parties?

I see Neil's lyrics are still ignored by the great unwashed masses of
fans.

Hi all,

I just wanted to say that I`m tired of those recent

four posts all arguments are exchanged and there is new

"Mr. xy or Mrs. abc and ... are definitly the fastest 
guitarists on earth. There was, is and will never be 
anyone faster then Mr. xy or Mrs. abc. Believe me."
As an answer to this you can be sure that a HUGE
amount of people really hate Mr. xy and Mrs. abc
even more. "They are totally lame. You better start
listening to Mr. Z if you want to hear a fast guy."

This is endless and leads to nothing. You all can be sure
that there will always be a person who doesn`t agree with
your opinion on who is the fastest. This thread will go on
as long the TNMS exists. But it has one minor flaw:
It is totally boring. Take it to private email, if you want to
continue discussing this issue. I bet these are the same
people who could not see that "Supertanker full of irony" 
in  Bryans Post. 

You should not get me wrong: Everybody can start any 
threat he or she wants to start and talk about the things
he or she wants to talk about as long as the rush-mgr
lets it go. So it is my right as member of the NMS to ask
you all that one question I always wanted to ask:

Who do you think is the fastest singer in the whole universe?

Anybody? I bet.

Subject: some more examples of Rush influence in modern music

Keeping track of the bands that claim Rush influence is something I try to
do...  This post is a response to watsond@idirect.com.

Smashing Pumpkins:
	Billy Corgan, singer,lyricist, and lead guitarist, has been known
to quote Rush on stage and in interviews ("Glittering Promises and
endless compromises...")

Queensryche (particularly their former guitarist Chris DeGarmo)
	QR has used lots of people who helped Rush in the past at various
points, such as Peter Collins, James Barton, Hugh Syme, Howard
Ungerleider, and Matt Mahurin.
	DeGarmo remarked in an interview before his last album with QR was
released ("Hear In The Now Frontier") that he admired Rush for basically
putting out albums every year.

U2 
	The Edge has said that Rush were an influence on his music.
	Members of U2 were in attendance at Rush's "Grace Under Pressure"
preview shows back in 1984, according to Bill Banasiewicz's "Visions."

Van Halen
	"Tom Sawyer" was used as pre-show music on their latest tour.
Also, VH made sure that Ray Danniels and SRO became their management after
their longtime manager passed away a few years ago.
	
Toad The Wet Sprocket (no longer in existence)
	Rumored to have played "Closer To The Heart" in a few
performances.

Barenaked Ladies
	Now the most major Canadian band in the eyes of the commercial
public, they have included snippets of "Tom Sawyer" and "The Spirit of
Radio" in past songs. 
	They have jammed with Alex Lifeson.

Shania Twain
	Another famous Canadian- she had remarked in an interview that
when she was in high school she listened to music like Pink Floyd
and Rush.

The Tragically Hip
	A third Canadian export, and a real good band.  They have
performed "Limelight" at the Juno awards several years ago.

Phish
	Trey Anastasio, guitarist in this jam-band renowned for their
playmanship and devoted following,  has supposedly cited Rush as an
influence.

Nerf Herder
	This one-hit wonder band supposedly had lyrics paying tribute to
Rush on their album.

Pavement
	They had a lyric asking how did Geddy Lee's voice get so high. 

Possum Dixon
	The drummer from this New-Wave influenced band told me that he had
listened to Rush years and years ago.

Linda Perry (formerly of 4 Non-Blondes)
	Remarked in a Rolling Stone interview that people thought she
sounded like Geddy Lee.

Hootie and the Blowfish
	Bassist has said that the instrumental on their second album was a
nod to Rush and Led Zeppelin, some of their influences.

There should be some more bands that can be listed...

Subject: Rushian roulette and live albums

Greetings fellow Rush fans, I was wondering, does anyone know where I
can order a copy of a Rush bootleg cd entitled "Rushian roulette"? It is
a live recording from the Hemispheres tour. A friend of mine had this cd
at one time, but traded it to a used cd store for another cd. For the
life of me, I don't know why! But then, he isn't a huge Rush fan like
myself. Also, to the guy who wanted suggestions for live albums, yeah I
know, you have gotten a bunch already, besides Rush, you might want to
consider checking out Jimi hendrix "Band of Gypsies", and Black Sabbath
"Reunion", along with all the other suggestions you received. Both of
these albums are top notch live recordings!

Subject: mostly distortion/the phantom menace

Hey!

Echoing comments by mike z.:

 snip-
>and cranking up the distortion to cover it (sloppy
>playing) is "groundbreaking?????"

mike z. made a pretty fair assessment when he said
covering up sloppy playing with distortion is by no
means "groundbreaking" (look at this new sound we
created, the kids all love it so we *must* be talented).

IMO, if you want to 'become" talented with the electric
guitar, learn how to play well on an acoustic first. There
are no cover-ups with an acoustic. I you play sloppy,
you sound like shit. You can't turn a knob or press a
peddle to sound better. At this point, continue to practice
on the acoustic until you no longer sound like shit. Then
get yourself an electric guitar. You'll be doing yourself
a favor.

Myself? Well I'm only seven months into the acoustic
phase of my learning, so my comments on distortion
are only theoretical. Using the above progression to
the use of an electric guitar, I expect to buy one sometime
in 2001!

Question. Is there such a term as "clean" distortion? With
exception to Rush (the album), I would use that term for
the distortion used by Ged and Al. Ged also uses some
nice distortion with keyboards.

 snip-
>examples of good use of excessive distortion:
>Randy Rhoads
I've been learning Diary of a Madman (the song/intro) over
the last two months. IMO a perfect example of this.
>Norman Greenbaum
Ummm, isn't he a comedian of sorts? (I"m reaching here

Subject: Guitarists

Hey Rush soulmates-

There's been a lot of talk lately about guitarists, and I noticed an 
interesting post about Steve Vai and Eddie Van Halen last time.  Here are 
some thoughts, what does everyone think?

First, I'm informed; I've been playing guitar for 16 years and have been in 
three bands.  I'm not a 15-year old kid with an Electra Les Paul copy in the 
closet and a Gorilla amp by the bed.  :)

I used to spend a lot of time comparing and contrasting guitarists, because, 
like most Rush fans I suspect, I'm a digger and analytical about stuff.  I 
grew up on Townsend, Hendrix, Skynard's guys and all the 80s metal guys.  I 
fell in love with Eddie for life when I heard "Dreams" in 1986 and saw VH at 
the Worcester Centrum.  I then ran out and bought all of Van Halen's albums 
from 1978-84 and absorbed them.  When I went to college I was exposed to 
Sabbath, Cream, Maiden, AC/DC, ELP, Fripp, Steve Vai, Satriani, et. al. I 
patiently listened to Yngwie when all my buddies were raving over him but 
just was not moved.  Impressed, oh yes; but not moved.  "Crazy Train", 
now THAT moved me.

There are millions of phenomenal guitarists out there who I have not listened 
to and could never judge anyway.  How can I compare the playing of two 
people?  It would be like saying the Soft Watches are better than the Last 
Supper, or comparing Grieg's Concerto in A minor to Beethoven's Ninth.

All artistry is unique, even if you are copying somebody.  I can play the 
solo to "Limelight" note for note.  Every time I play it, I play it like 
ME, not Alex.  But I didn't write it!  So we have to put creativity into the 
formula.  And when Alex wrote it, he had others helping him.  Page, Hendrix, 
Clapton, Beck, and everyone else he loved growing up.

So...all guitarists are extensions of the other players they have learned 
from.  And some guitarists have exceptional creativity.  Those with that 
creativity inspire others.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

When you combine great creativity with great intellectual working knowledge 
of music theory and technique, you have virtuosos.  Joe Satriani, Robert 
Fripp, Al DiMeola and Les Paul come to mind.

But does this make these guys 'the best ever?'  That's like saying Jim Brown 
was better than Walter Payton or Barry Sanders, or Neil Peart is better than 
Buddy Rich or Keith Moon.  All artistry is unique, even when copied from 
somebody else.  Sure, Peart could play the Overture from "Tommy" note for 
note.  But it was Moon's own personal creativity and orchestral style that 
made it beautiful, just as it's Peart's own creativity and intensity that 
makes the three sharp tom blasts in "A Farewell to Kings" special, right 
before the second verse ("the hypocrites are slandering...")

So, what I'm saying is this: while comparing and judging guitarist is fun and 
interesting, it's basically pointless.  I love "Stopping by woods on a snowy 
evening" for what it IS, not because it reminds me of "Do not go gentle into 
that good night."  I love "A Tale of Two Cities" for what it IS, not because 
it reminds me of "The Red Badge of Courage".  When I listen to guitarists 
play, the beauty of each artist becomes a separate entity to me.  I don't 
WANT the solo from "Johnny B. Goode" to remind me of "Crazy Train."  Each is 
beautiful when left alone.  Even more beautiful is how artists give to each 
other.  The very fact that Randy was a rock guitarist means that a little 
spark of "Johnny B. Goode" was with him when he wrote that magnificent solo, 
which blends rock, metal and classical styles in a lovely frenzy.  Just as 
Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and BB King were with Berry when he wrote 
"Johnny B. Goode."

If you want to rate guitarists, I suppose you could rate them for how much 
influence they had on their genre.  On this basis and this basis alone, I 
would put Hendrix at the top of the rock list.  But is Hendrix better than 
Steve Vai or Eric Johnson?  Come on.  

Each solo is a painting.  Some are just haberdash, filled with a thousand 
notes that don't really say much; most are forgettable and redundant (like 
mine!) :)  But there are solos out there that have inspired and lifted others 
to copy them- the sincerest form of flattery.  When a solo reaches a huge 
audience, you have a Mona Lisa, a "Henry V", a 55-10 blowout of the Broncos. 
 A master work.  My choice for that solo: "Jessica", by the Allman Brothers. 
 Three men playing as one, and smooth as a silk prom dress on the floor of a 
'67 Mustang.  :)

By the way, here are my top ten favorite solos of all time: you'll find that 
some of these guys are in the "Where are they now file".  But I like these 
solos for how they make ME feel, not because they're the fastest or the 
smoothest or because they did 'point A = point C divided by point B" on some 
musical theory chart in a Berkeley classroom.  Music is not calculus.

In no particular order:

Eddie Van Halen- "Jump"
George Lynch- "Burning Like a Flame" (first solo)
Andy Taylor- "Some Like it Hot"
Allman Bros.- "Jessica"
Alex Lifeson- "A Farewell to Kings"
Neil Schon- "Who's Cryin' Now"
Chris Hayes (from Huey Lewis & the News)- "Walking on a Thin Line"
Robert Fripp (on the Roche Sisters' 1st album)- "Hammond Song"
Randy Rhoads- "Crazy Train"
Tom Scholz- "More Than a Feeling"

and on and on..."Sultans of Swing," "Comfortably Numb", "Celebration Day", 
"Machine Gun".........................(this was like choosing the ten best 
diamonds from a DeBeers catalog...)

Not exactly - Tommy Vance used to play Rush on his Friday Rock
Show, (National BBC radio one) many years ago - I remember hearing
a few tracks from Moving Pictures for the first time one Friday
night in 1981.  I'm sure a lot of local radio stations used to have
rock shows which played Rush too - Metro Radio, based in Newcastle,
certainly did (any North Eastern readers remember the 'hot&heavy 
half-hour?)

Apart from shows aimed specifically at Rock fans though, I have 
only ever heard Spirit of Radio played (and then, only twice) with
the exception of The Analog Kid which was played on a quiz show
where contestants were allowed to have their favourite song played.

I love your subject line. I also agree with most of your content, which
is why I'm on the Rush mailing list not on Yngwie's (if he has one!).
The only thing is that I don't agree that you have to be able to
write great songs to be a good player.  This would mean most
classical musicians can't play. Different people have different strength's
and Yngwie can play. Listen to 'Millenium', his classical orchestral
piece. There's no lyrics anywhere. 

> George Live at Wembley <ferndoc@rocketmail.com> said:
>
> But who (other than our hero Lerxst) would you say has the best tone?

Ok, lets move away from the speed thing, apart from those
already mentioned:

1) Ronnie LeTekro. Who? Plays/played for TNT. Worlds most
ignored underrated guitarist. 

2) Gary Moore, same reason as Stevie Ray Vaughan - HEAVY
STRINGS, sounds good, hard to play.

3) ok flame away - Mr Malmsteen. Very fluid tone but you can
hear the differences in picking of each note. Ignore the lyrics but
listen to 'Soldier without faith'. Uses loosest strings & tunes down.

4) ok flame away part 2. George Lynch, some great sounds on
'Sacred Groove'. You may all hate the music, but he always has 
a great tone.

If you are from a jazz/pop persuasion, I'm sure you'll have a 
different set, but I like metal, so there.

Thanks for listening (if you bothered),

Martin.

P.S. Isn't the rhythm sound on DS:2112 wonderful? also DS:Force Ten.
They should do loads more of the 80s stuff with heavier guitar. 
Imagine, the whole of ASOH, with the DS sound! Wow.
