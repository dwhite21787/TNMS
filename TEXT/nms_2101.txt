Subject: Producers

It seems like a while ago there was a thread about possible producers for
the next studio album, if there is one.  (As I recall, the thread died
almost immediately after someone suggested Rick Rubin, and called him
something along the lines of the God of all producers.  :) )  (I've never
been a fan of Rubin's work...)

Anyway, I was thinking about this last night...Collins has sort of lost
his touch, I'm afraid...he did *excellent* work on CP, but T4E *does*
sound rather muddy by comparison...so, yes, maybe it's time to change
producers...

I was wondering about possibly for the first album of the new cycle, do a
co-producer thing, between Terry Brown (help recapture the old sound) and
Trent Reznor (help them maintain the edginess they have now, and maybe
help them regain some raw power in their sound).  The reason I want Terry
in their for the first one is just to make sure Trent doesn't try and
turn the new Rush album into halo fourteen for his Nine Inch Nails
catalog.  But I think after Trent has one album under his belt, he'd be
fine working on his own with the boys...

This really *was* an interesting thread...anyone else have any ideas?

Probably triggerd by Neil's MIDI--that way, Ged jsut follows the drum
tempo.  And those would be "samples," not truly sequences. As I
understand it, they are no longer using sequencers.

I don't think he uses a harmonizer or any similar effect to accomplish
this,

I've heard that he is starting to use harmonizers. The catch is, if the
sung note is off, the harmonies will be, too.

C'mon Dan,

Be fair.  (Boy, Ayn really gets a lot of unnecessary bashing in this list.)
I've read most of her work and she never said contradictions (in one's
thinking and emotions) were easy to deal with or solve.  God knows she had
her own emotional contradictions, and while she did explain them, some of
those explanations were simply wrong.  She wasn't perfect.  But her
philosophy, Objectivism, is certainly worthwhile to explore and adopt --
and to many on this list -- controversial.

If you're interested, her point about there being no contradictions in
nature applies to the metaphysical branch of Objectivism.

Subject: Free will

Dear fellow rushians,

Oh good a philosophy debate!  Will is one of those questions which 
baffles philosophers and theologians alike.  But is our will really 
free?  I say no and I will tell you why in a sec.
First, will itself (voluntas) is one of the trinity composing the mind 
(along with memoria and intellectum).  Man cannot function without will; 
it is sacrosanctitas.  Will is only free if governed by righteousness.  
Therefore we cannot choose to have free will, but have our will acted 
upon as to make it strong and free again to choose rightly.  Will itself 
is only a medium good, which means that it is required to live rightly, 
but so often it can be turned to bad use.  How often do we do the right 
thing?  HOw much more often do we do the wrong thing?  Also, there is no 
such thing as a coerced act.  If that were the case, will would become 
null and void because coercion strips us of our innate ability to 
choose. Yet, as I said before, how often do we choose rightly?  If you 
would like more details, I suggest you consult On free Choice of the 
Will by St. Augustine.  It's fairly short and answers a lot of 
questions.

I can attest to the Rush/bowling connection.  A couple of tours ago a
friend of mine had a friend who knew of a private party at a local
bowling alley after a Rush Concert.  She said she could only bring one
friend and invited me.  Unfortunately, my brother was with at the time
and he doesn't drive and it was last minute, so I couldn't go.  But my
bro and I always see Rush together so it was like, oh well.  My friend
said it was the band, roadies and family for the most part.

How about these live albums?  To my shock no one has mentioned them yet (I
think).

Kiss - Kiss Alive II  - I was seven when it came out.  "Ace Frehlley: Shock
me!"  "Calling Dr. Love!"  Kick ass!

Neil Young - Live Rust.  Absolutely phenominal!  I can listen to it over and
over.  Starts with five acoustic songs with only him on guitar, then plays
eleven or so more songs with crazy horse: "sugar mountain," "the needle and
the damage done," "cinammon girl," "my my hey hey," "cortez the killer,"
"when you dance I can really love," etc.

For those Pat Matheny Fans, is not Metheny, it's Matheny.  But I have
to agree, he and his group are the best jazz group right now.  I've
been listening to them since I got into college, in 1985. That Lyle
Mays is one good SOB on the keyboards.  If you have listened to
Travels, their first live album/CD, "Song for Bilbao" is one of their
bests.  I miss them when they were touring early this year.  They
stopped in Atlanta and Melbourne, FL.  But I still have the chance to
see them.

Geddy may not be sequencing live. I know, at least nowadays, they have 
vocal effect processors that automatically harmonize vocals in what ever 
harmony you select (ie.-3rds, 4ths, 5ths, etc.) I suspect this is what 
he is doing. It would be much easier than sequencing them.

     This is just an example of Geddy's sense of humour.
     
     Geddy frequently plays around with some of the lyrics, like throwing 
     some baseball references in "The Spirit of Baseball(Radio)", and in 
     "Tom Sawyer" he sometimes says "catch the baseball" in place of "catch

Subject: Sorry Arnie - it's MEtheny

I'm sure he believes he's correct for some reason, but I hate to see people 
misled.  In TNMS 2100, Arnie Vincenty states "For those Pat Matheny Fans, is 
not Metheny, it's Matheny."  Sorry Arnie - I doubt all the albums and websites 
have the spelling wrong.  Check out www.patmethenygroup.com.  Aside from 
the spelling issue, I'm surprised no Metheny fans have mentioned the group's 
latest album - Imaginary Day.  It's fantastic.  And believe it or not, they 
can really rock for a "jazz" group.  The Roots of Coincidence (track 7) is 
amazing!  A quote from Pat about it on the above website: "It unfolds over a 
couple of minutes into something that would sound appropriate on a modern 
thrash-metal album, for lack of a better term."  He's not lying!

Continuing on the other favorite groups idea - are there any Flecktones fans 
out there?  Don't let the fact that Bela Fleck plays banjo throw you.  It's 
not at all Beverly Hillbillies (although he sometimes plays it in solos).  The 
bass player for the Flecktones is Victor Lamonte Wooten.  A remarkable 
musician.  Last concert tour he actually played "The Flight of the Bumblebee" 
on his bass.  He also does some mean variations on Bach.  For you bass

Not being an expert in Greek mythology, I remember from my high school
Mythology class as well as from my teenage Dungeons and Dragons days that
Dionysus was the also the god of wine.  I've always thought that the lyric
"Draw another goblet from the cask of forty-three" alludes to someone who
wants to drink- HARD!  Dionysian wine even, if you will.    How about "Bacchus
Plateau" as the tavern our hero goes to to drown his broken heart after
leaving his love, Panacea...
Other than that, I never saw any real connection with Hemispheres- that's a
bit of a stretch.  
As far as REAL stretches go, ask me about the 2112/Al Capone/Chicago streets
connection sometime.  Pretty bizarre!  Maybe I'll even post it for you Chicago
NMSers.  I used to have WAY too much time on my hands...

I was at the library today, picking out a new book.  I couldn't make up
my mind.  I was checking out "Skinny legs and all" by Tom Robbins.
Inside, I was looking at the quotes about the book.  Then I saw:
"Writing that is funny, sexy, imaginative and playful, yet has an
underlying texture both beautiful and profound."-Neil Peart,lyricist,
Rush.  Needless to say, that is the book I got.  I haven't read it yet,

For years, I always thought this was a weird lyric in Subdivisions.  I
spent much useless time trying to understand its meaning. Even though I
thought I heard it right and it did make *some* sense, it never did feel
*quite* right:

"in between the bright lights
and the Bar unlit, unknown"

This screwed the meaning all up, because I couldn't equate the bright
lights to downtown or the inner city.  I instead equated the *burbs* to
the bright lights and the "Bar unlit unknown" to the seediest, darkest
part of the inner city.  Almost completely bass ackwards.  The idea of
being perched in the middle of the two extremes of the inner city and
the country thus was only half there and I could never put my finger on
it.

Obviously, this scarred me for life. :-|

>I know Neil doesn't wear headphones (except during Red Sector A), so they

Neil wears headphones much more often than that. And the click is the only
thing ever on the click track :)

Ok, enough of me being a smartass. Answer to your question(s)

How does Geddy do this live? He hires someone to do it for him! :)

Ok, ok, ok, really now...

First he takes the master tape of the album and samples the parts he needs.
He then sets them up as seperate events on a sequencer. What that means is
he has, say "Capture my thoughts, carry them away", which is about 4
seconds of vocals, set up in the sequencer as Event 1 (sometimes the
labelling is different, but essentially he has that be the first thing
sequenced). The sequencer is then programmed to play that event and then
stop, then set itself to play Event 2, which would be the next backing
vocal part Geddy needs. the other option is they set different events on
different notes, so Geddy triggers them from the MIDI pedals. So, to sum
up, Geddy records the parts to a sequencer, then sets them up to play in
order when he triggers them, or sets them up to play from different notes.

It's exactly like triggering a sequenced keyboard part, except it triggers
only one note: Event 1. They have a note, say, middle C, programmed to play
whatever sound they sample, so they sample a sound that takes 4 seconds.
You hit middle C, and the it plays: "Capture my thoughts, carry them away"

How do they pull this off live?

1) Neil IS wearing headphones or has a little flashing light or SOMETHING
that gives him the tempo off the album, which is where the backing vocals
are from.

2) Geddy stomps on the sequencer trigger (a switch that starts the
sequence) EXACTLY in tempo, then sings along with himself.

3) They practice this for weeks. No kidding.

Ged has never used a harmonizer for that kind of backing vocal. Rush has
used harmonizers to thicken voices to reduce overdubs (Dreamline "When we
are young"), but not live to add a third or anything like that.

Rush's roadcrew actually invented the midiswitch that triggers when the
switch is pressed down. Before that (this is circa 1980 or around then),
switches were activated when they were pressed AND RELEASED, so it was
nearly impossible to synch the stuff as accurately as Geddy needed to live,
so they rewired his switch for him.

I hope this answers your question, Jeff. If you still have questions, or I
just confused you, e-mail me privately and I'll try and answer your
questions better.

At least that is better than being a Ram fan and living in San Diego. 
People have been trying to recruit me for a year to be a Charger fan.

Anyways, overall, I am pleased with the live album setlist.  Though, I have
never been a fan of 'Animate' I definitely cant wait for it to show up on
the radio for sake of listening to what the DJ's have to say about it. 
This will weed out how many DJ's are ignorant to Rush.

I finally was able to watch the Pop-up "Limelight" video.  i do have have
to say I was real disappointed in real Rush content.  It was like they
didn't even try and did for any info.  They probably just took content from
the bantering we call "Rolling Stone" and went with that.  It seemed to be
that superficial.  0h well, what can we expect.  Ive decided not to be too
bitter about it.

Well that's about it.  Yes, its all about the rambling.  Long live the

You're absolutely right Paul, Yessongs is superior to Yesshows...although they
BOTH kick some serious butt. I must admit I really dig this thread idea, cause
I really enjoy live albums and usually have at least one from every artist I
even moderately like. Not to mention, I love to rank things...
It is very hard to narrow the list down like you have (excellent job, BTW),
but after much ado, here is mine for your amusement. To be fair (and keep at
least a small slice of my sanity) I did not include bootlegs.

1. Thin Lizzy- Live and Dangerous.
Everything Paul said and more. "Still in Love With You" never fails to send
chills down my spine and is my fave live song bar none. The rest of the album
is just as good.
2. Cheap Trick- Live at Budokan 
I recently bought The Complete Concert edition, which includes a great
remastered version of the full concert, including missing jewels from the
previous package. Not to mention two PC videos of "Auf Wiedersehen" and
"Surrender".
3. Led Zeppelin-Song Remains the Same
This was my first CD....I will never forget all the pilgrimages to see the
movie at various midnight screenings. This was the next best thing to seeing
them live, which I never had the privilege. Although, the Plant/Page show is
in 3 weeks here... 
4. RUSH-All the Worlds a Stage
Yes Paul, there IS room for a RUSH live album here. Their first is the obvious
choice because of its raw energy and power unabaited by the future overdubs
that spoil subsequent live efforts. Plus it has "2112" in its entirety,
something we only saw here until now. I CANT WAIT!!!
5. Genesis-Seconds Out
This has made everyone elses posts on this subject for a reason...it's
AWESOME! Phil and Co. proved that they could survive without Peter Gabriel and
even improv quite well on their own. Not that Gabriel wasn't a genius on his
own...his "Plays Live" is another excellent live album, but doesn't make my
list.
6. Peter Frampton-Frampton Comes Alive 
Just like every other teenager living in the suburbs, I had this album and
wore out two copies of it before finally getting it on CD years later. Every
time I hear "Do You Feel," I have to restrain myself from going into an air
guitar frenzy. 
7. Robin Trower-Live
The live version of "Daydream" from this 1975 concert is also one of my all-
time fave songs, and the rest of this somewhat short live release (7 songs, 41
min) is good as well. What keeps it from challenging Thin Lizzy for the top
spot is its lack of "Bridge of Sighs" and "Long Misty Days." 
8. Jethro Tull-Bursting Out
Another two album set that I wore out...the CD version omits three cuts,
including "Sweet Dream"...you bastards! 
9. Yes-Yessongs
The one thing I'll always remember about this one is the cover for the
3-record set with Roger Deans mind blowing artwork. Fantastic songs like "And
You And I,"
"Close to the Edge" and "Heart of the Sunrise" dont hurt either...
10. Ted Nugent-Double Live Gonzo
Everybody's gonzo..including the Motor City Madman. The guitarwork on "Great
White Buffalo" and "Hibernation" is worth the price of admission. Here's one
for those of you who like to listen closely for hidden stuff, faux pas, etc:
at the end of "Baby Please Don't Go," Ted is saying thank you to San Antonio.
In the background, you can hear someone informing Mr. Nugent that he is NOT in
fact in San Antonio (actually Abilene, as verified by the liner notes) Ted
immediately responds "Thank you"....VERY FUNNY!

I would HIGHLY recommend that everyone run, not walk to buy all these
immediately if not in your collection...all very worthy!

"Hey cookie it's a quarter to eight and I feel I'm in the mood."  I didn't

O.K. - Hanstones, excellent!  I'm sure everyone else is writing the same

got to say about the new information.  I've somewhat been in the dark and not
reading my nms' lately, so if this is old news - so be it.

I can't understand why the new live albumn isn't sort of like the old ones
were.  I'm wondering why the previous ATWAS, ESL, & SOH all have ONLY there
four previous albums on them, yet when it comes to Presto, RTB, Counterparts,
and T4E, we can't have just songs from those albulms.  I understand that the
previous albumns have sold a few more copies, but I got into rush with the
past four albumns.  Call me a late bloomer, or what have you, but I feel the
last four albumns have plenty of excellent stuff on them.  I suppose the whole
ordeal of putting a three disk albumn toghether was to ease the pain that the
late bloomers like myself will feel and to make the fans which weren't fond of
the last 4 happy.  

Don't get me wrong, I love every Rush albumn like I love my parents, but I
just want to hear live songs that I never thought I would.  I suppose
"Everyday Glory" would have been nice, "Presto" would be cool and who could
forget "The Pass."
I'd like to hear "The Color of Right" live before I die and I know everyone
wants a nice produced copy of "Ghost of a Chance" at their fingertips.  There
are more folks, yet you most likely either hate my guts by now, or agree, but
if you do agree, who am I?                                                    

Hey everyone, I'm gonna' go now and I'm gonna let you know that I will pay the
$40 or $50 dollars, or more that rush asks for this triple CD set, but I'll
have you know, I'll be wanting more.
