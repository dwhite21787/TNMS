at 6:30pm Eastern time! They'll be showing both "Limelight" and "Tears Are

Haven't played that game, but I know that two of the cheat codes for
WarCraft II are "glittering prizes" and "hatchet, axe and saw."  So it's
obvious that some of the programmers at Blizzard are /2ush fanatics.

Oh boy, just three more days 'til "Limelight" on Pop-up Video!  I wonder
what interesting li'l factoids they'll turn up.  Did anyone else see the
bubble that popped up with the boys for Paula Abdul's "Rush, Rush" video?

Has it been _confirmed_ that the upcoming live album will be 2 CD's??

/2ush listening assignment: maybe it's just me, but the music at the
beginning of "In the End" sounds a lot like a slowed-down version of the
music at the beginning of "Fly by Night."

Keep it real, counterparts...

Subject: Issue #2112

Yo  -

The "Selena posts"  idea was a good one but I don't think we need to go
there again. I get this "sick" feeling just thinking about that horrible
tragedy. I can't imagine a whole ISSUE dedicated to it.

Obviously, if we could get one of the guys to post - Alex is the likely
choice- that would be the best. Even if the issue is just 1 post. That
would be acceptable. This is not likely to happen as nobody here knows him
to ask him (or do we have someone?). I doubt we do, other than Rob M., who
does frequent the Orbit Room and does talk to his son at times. He MIGHT be
able to do something but once again, not likely. Alex probably wouldn't do
it anyway.

Info on the new Victor album or the live album (already mentioned) would
also be WONDERFUL. Confirmation on a 2 or 3 CD package would be nice too
(with hopefully the 3rd CD being the rest of the TFE show and the remaining
space dedicated to the enhanced CD they have been working on - which BTW,
could be the reason that it is delayed til the fall -  pending completion
of the enhanced portion - lets hope). Who can get us this info?

Unfortunately, I haven't found that Genie bottle I've been searching for
and thus, my wishes above will NOT be fulfilled.

So, what to do?

Maybe this, 2 issues before its released (i.e. when everyone gets issue #
2110), everyone can post just ONE word. Whatever you like, but only ONE
word.  The Rush-Mgr can then take the posts in order and list them out like
any other issue and we could read the secret message that the "Elder Race"
has sent us!!!!

ha ha ha!

Basically, I have no idea, so its best that those who do, keep posting them
and eventually we'll find something suitable before its too late. One thing
though, it should be related to the 2112 album or its theme.

So long for now.

dpm.

Does the "Gaia" theory presuppose regulation or does it exclude it? There
are some who think that they are destined to be Gaia herself.

 I take it to mean that some higher force is controlling the Earth and it's
inhabitants.It is close to complexity theory and chaos theory.Does this
conflict with freewill?Place this alongside marxism as another mystical
attempt to control people.

Sometimes I used to buy into that garbage, but reality suits me so much
better.Hopefully,Neil was just using it objectively.

Did anyone catch VH on the 10 spot?I thought they were terrible.There was
no energy or charisma.Who thought Gary Cherone would make a good front man
for them.He is way out classed by the rest of the band.Maybe it is another
tony Iommi, Ozzy relationship.I can't belive that R Danniels is their
manager.Maybe Eddie makes all the decisions.I was disappointed.

I am hearing more and more of Keith Moon in Neil's drumming everywhere on
all the recordings.

Subject: Rush albums and their respective songs

Dear fellow Rushians,

OK, whoever this guy is that posted his list of Rush "Do'hs" has either 
been invaded by a body snatcher who listens to Third Eye Blind or he has 
just gone completely insane!  I know Rush isn't perfect and hell, the 
guys have admitted it themselves, but to come out with a list that bears 
a title of "Doh" (which is the contracted form of Damn and Oh!) means 
that these songs are so bad that no one, save the idiot could admire 
them.  You could not be more wrong.  There is a Rush song for everyone, 
I believe.  I have my own less-liked songs, but I don't throw them in 
the trash.  And I still can't believe you actually dissed the Camera 
Eye.  What the hell were you thinking?  Were you just so desparate to 
find a song off of MP to go on your list?  MP is nearly as flawless as 
you can get!  PW is good, but to say that it has no bad songs is 
inconsistent with your whole line of thinking.  What is wrong with 
Circumstances?  Sure, Hemispheres had only four songs, but they were all 
great (it kind of narrows your selection since you couldn't pick the 
title track and you sure couldn't pick the two songs which make all the 
compilations).  And Time and Motion?  I'm not going to entertain that.  
I think you completely missed base with the point of Rush albums and 
their songs.  You are supposed to enjoy them for what they are and not 
just choose the one or two songs of which you do not approve and tell 
the world.  The more people concentrate on the negative, no matter how 
small it is, it diminishes the postive aspect. But who knows, maybe this 
trend will continue.  From now on, everyone, just post Rush-negative 
feelings, like the times you thought Rush was going to play that one 
song you wanted live, but didn't and how angry you became or how Rush 
didn't record their last album the way you wanted it to be, etc.  Let's 
ignore all the postive things about Rush and just concentrate on the 
negatives and we can continue to flame each other until we are all dead 
and buried in the cold, cold earth.

I apologize for the overall tone and length of this post and I mean no 
personal offense to the original author of the post which sparked this 
debate.

Go Sabres!

Subject: FBN and other song stuff

Yo Yo -

Ok. the remastered FBN is by FAR, the best sounding of all the remastered
CD's. Yes, it beats out CoS by a nose. It is my favorite album right now.
Dam, there is not a bad song on it.

I think to really appreciate FBN, one must compare it to the first album.
Ok, there is no comparison. The first album is very good but it not even
close to FBN and they were recorded practically in the same year. Neil's
impact on the band is HUGE. This album is AMAZING. One of the best
follow-ups to an initial release that I can think of. Now, I'm not just
realizing this, its just that after hearing how good the remastered version
was compared to the original (which is very muddy and lacks crispness), I
wanted to share my thoughts. Lucky you. :-)

I've got all the remasters thru Hem. and ESL. I have not listened to 2112
or AFTK yet, but I must say that although Hemispheres is MUCH improved, it
still has alot of tape hiss. Does anyone else hear this? I mean, it is ALL
throughout the songs, both loud and soft parts. I guess they couldn't
totally repair it but I thought it would be much better.

Oh well, looking forward to a quick run through of 2112 and AFTK on the way
home tonight.

See you all in RUSH land.

Oh (again), no ending song stinks except You Bet Your Life.

And I agree with the poster who said that "Face Up" is the quintessential
throwaway song. RTB is bar far the weakest album as a whole in the entire
Rush catalog. There are 3-4 not so great songs on it. Although it was a
great tour. I miss the bunny's.

LATER.

dpm.

P.S. Does anyone know where I can find soundboard recordings (CD boots) of
Jethro Tull shows? Private email please. This is NOT a trading forum.
(sorry for sneaking this in Rush-mgr).

Like most others into music, (including fans) many influences
regarding taste and style can be cited. It is safe to say that
Genesis "helped" Neil develop into a more rounded drummer.

[Hang on it's long and it's got some technical stuff in it...:)]

Granted, TCE is a killer song... Granted at least 95% of Rush songs kick
all ass, but I have a problem with "Time and Motion" Don't get me wrong,
T4E is a great album, but I've got a problem with the chord structures
that Alex uses during the verses almost make me cringe... (bear with me
we're gonna get techincal now)  I don't have a problem with the first
set of chords that he appreggios (Dm11 [X530XX], and C#b5 [X430XX]) but
the second ones at the lines "Fill them up with precious cargo" he uses
these sickening intervals, and it just sounds horrid (Fm9 [X860XX] and
Fm9/E [X760XX] just make my stomach turn, whenever I play it I can hear
it, and whenever I've got the CD in, I can hear it too, but it's burried
inthe mix so it's not that bay... just the fact that he's using a minor
2nd in a ringing appreggio makes it all the more worse... and the
solo... personally, I detest the solo... It just isn't pleasing to my
ears... that's all...

Well, this newsletter is about discussion and points of view, as well as
praises, We're not bashing the Boys, but we're just talking about songs
that just aren't as great as the other ones... personally I like Red
Lenses, and almost all the other songs there's like 2 I really don't
like out of the (I haven't counted latley, I guess I should) number they
have, I'm not a huge fan of Rivendell and I don't care for Time and
Motion (as you can probably tell from my previous comment.. that's it..
everything else is good... minimum... to the Almighty (2112 and Cygnus)

On the Contrary, I don't think so, I would imagine that the things we

be considered their biggest fans, you know the ones who talk about them
and their musical and lyrical content and talent on a daily basis... IF
(obviously, I'm not, but IF) I was one of the Boys, and I had this
emailed to my Box every day, I'd be very interested in what my fans
would 
have to say...:)

Saw this thread and had to contribute: Losing It!

Losing It has to be one of the saddest songs around.  no joke - on occasion
it can get me teary-eyed!  My musical tastes attract me to timelessness...
I heard "timelessness" in Losing It the first time I heard it... I KNEW it
was going to be something special that first time, and it has been ever
since.  

I'm trying to come up with reasons *why* Losing It just does it for me, but
the words escape me!  I've pretty much got the feelings & emotions down pat
though..

Anyways, Losing It... Saddest Rush song I know... Come to think of it, it's
better described as the most Emotional Rush song I know..

It's has a pretty convincing set of clips and a story that it wasn't

Am I the only one who it took so long to notice that on the subdivison

Hello hello to all you die-hard rush fans there.  Can 
somebody help me out here if they can?  On their first live 
album (ATWAS) on by-tor & the snowdog, does anybody know 
were the growling noise is coming from just right before 
the song slows down towards the middle?  Is alex making 
that sound via foot pedal, or is geddy triggering somehow,

Subject: new poster...

Greetings, fans, this is my first post.  I've been a fan of the boyz 
since MP- i was in the sixth grade, my younger brother was loaned the 
dark vinyl and when i first heard that all-to-familiar intro to Tom 
Sawyer, i was hooked- previously being brought up on the beatles, Yes, 
Zeppelin, fleetwood mac and the like (and the who's Tommy and the Wall 
from floyd- that's why im demented i suppose) When i absorbed Witchhunt, 
i became a rush fan for eternity, I'm sure.

Keep up the great work mgr.- may TMS continue and thank you fellow fans 
for reminding me why i have lived with this band at my side for so long 
(as have most of us). The power trio has touched all of our souls for 
better or worse and we are thankful to the band for that...

As for the D'oh awards- have to agree with the majority of the responses 
i've read- how could a fan dislike the Camera Eye (i played it on the 
local watering hole's juke 2nite) ? incredible song.

Also, wanted to say thanks to Chris 9991 for the question- what to do 
about issue 1001001....lol smiles abound....

and thanks to Suze for the quote from A n OL - nice touch

Truly a fine thing to see the fans gather...btw- at the show at the 
Gorge in Gearge, WA last summer they played a song from Victor over the 
pa just b4 the show- probably done at all of em, eh?

Subject: Issue 2112 once and for all

Rush Mgr:
   Would it be possible to get the guys to help us on this one?  I really
think they owe us something here...we don't ask very much of them.
   Issue 2112 clearly must involve Rush or else it shouldn't be anything of
significance.  A repeat of issue 1 is dumb.  Nothing else makes sense...it
should involve the band itself for it to mean something.  
   A tribute to Selena (as one person suggested) is retarded because none of
us knew her or are truly affected by her death other than its impact on Rush.
We all feel bad, but that's all.  I'm not trying to be insensitive...I feel
for Neil, but no one here had ever mentioned Selena until she died.
   The only real thing that would make 2112 special would be questions
answered or a message from Rush.
   Rush MGR...can this be done????

   [ As I said, I know no one in the Rush camp or anyone associated with
     them, so don't look to me for help with this!          : rush-mgr ]

Subject: Rivendell

On the subject of songs which we do not like, fast-forward etc...  I 
got Fly By Night down from the shelf and had another go.  Back in the 
seventies I wore it out, or rather, wore out the copy I first got 
with Archives, largely due to In the End.  By-Tor sounds really 
dated, though I know I loved it at the time (hey, I was 14 years 
old).  But even then, I couldn't stomach Rivendell.  I was/am a great 
Tolkien fan when the mood takes me, but Rivendell (the song) just 
stuck in my craw.  My vinyl copy still has scratches at the beginning 
and the end where I used to lift the needle and put it back down 
again.  My non-Rush fan mates used to use it as a reason not to like
 Rush - so I used In the End to blow them away.  Count me among the
 Rivendell torching brigade.  I think we have the right to say what 
we do or don't like about the Boyz' music.  And I think Zed is with 
me when I say that one of the things I least like is having to fork 
out around a cool $600 to get to the States or Canada  to see 
them play live.

Hi JJK,

I don't know, I can't tell you. My father died a couple of days ago, and
I can't find one Rush song to relieve me off the pain I feel. There's to
my knowledge no Rush song that handels the subject of losing a beloved one,
maybe accept for "The Pass", but this handles suicide. And that's not the
case in my sad event. Or am I missing the point on that one ?

Now I know a little bit on how Neil and fam. must be feeling. My sympathy
towards him has grown, and hope that something good comes out of Selena's
death, (and this could be selfish) a great song to help people to deal
with the loss off a close friend/family-member.

Maybe there is a fellow rushfan out there with the same experience, who can
tell me what to listen to. Preferably Rush.....

Cheers,
Dirk,

Subject: Star-man and art criticism

Sorry Chris, but if only the artist him or herself is allowed to 
interpret art, then we are really shafted.  That does not, of course, 
mean that anything goes, but your reasoning means that 
we cannot attempt to interpret anything.  That denies man the right 
to interpret his world and the symbolic messages we each send to one 
another.  The writer, the musician, the artist, each knows that 
others will project all kinds of meanings onto their work.  The crass 
part comes when the Philistines ask the artist what he or she means 
by such and such a symbol, to which the artist replies, you work it 
out.  By the way, I think most of the interpretations of the 
starman have been off-beam: I have my own theories, but they do not 
really matter.  Nevertheless, in a hundred years time, anyone picking 
up the lyrics to 2112 and setting against the background of the 1970s 
will put two and two together, whatever we might think.  I am afraid 
the associations are far too powerful.  It is not far off claiming 
that a swatika is an Assyrian peace sign, or whatever, in the context 
of the twentieth century.  It would simply be bloody stupid to try to 
sustain the argument.
And by the way, being left-wing does not mean you had to like the 
Soviets.

Hey!

Thank to all who responded to the Vital Signs and
Geddy's bass question I posed. Here are the results:

1-Steinberger (sp?)
1-Rickenbacker
3-Fender Jazz
1-Fender
1-Fender P Bass

I'm sure more answers will roll in, these are the
early results. Like I said, I have no clue, just
love the sound of it during the shape-shifter chorus.

Geddy toured Moving Pictures with these basses.

>From the MP tourbook:
>Two Rickenbacker 4001's, Fender Jazz Bass,
>Rickenbacker 4002, double-neck Rickenbacker,
>incorporating 4001 with twelve-string guitar,
>double-neck Rickenbacker, incorporating 4001
>with six-string guitar, Ovation acoustic.

I think that kills Steinberger. I had heard he only
used that guitar for p/g. On stage beginning with
the "Tour of the Nadars" (pre-p/g album release
mini-tour).

New question:
Why was it "dubbed" the Tour of the Nadars? Just
something to think about over the weekend. :-)

I figure with shipping and handeling included, he owes me about 20 bucks a

Subject: Dream Theater

	I just wanted to tell you all that I had the opportunity to see Dream
Theater in concert last night at the Vic in Chicago.  It was my first time
seeing them, and I was absolutely blown away.  It is certainly not a show
on the scale of Rush, but I have never seen such a combination of
musicianship and showmanship before.  I was riveted during the entire two
hour show.  If you are looking for something to fill the void when Rush is
not touring, go see these guys.  They will more than fill that void.  

During the show, that spiced things up by adding bits of cover songs into
theirs.  Early in the set, after their song Take the Time, they broke into
a Freebird Jam that lasted a few minutes.  When I thought the jam was over,
Mike Portnoy the drummer breaks into this incredible but familiar drum
beat.  I was thinking,"Could it be?"  And yes, it was Hot For Teacher by
Van Halen!  John Petrucci, the guitarist, did the whole tapped intro thing,
and it was awesome.  From here they launched into the main groove for Led
Zeppelin's Moby Dick.  And just when I thought,"What else are they going to
throw in?" I heard Mike portnoy start tapping out that familiar Morse Code
signal for YYZ on one of his croatales, and they played the whole opening
of that song to end the jam.  Later in the show, during their song Peruvian
Skies, they seemlessly blended in a verse from Pink Floyd's Have a Cigar,
and at the end of the song, launched into a bit of Enter Sandman, before
closing it out.
	Definitely go see these guys.  You will not be disappointed.

Hey gang..
Cool thread.. No pun intended..(really!!)
The chilling moments I can think of come from MP. One is in Red Barchetta,
when they play into the solo and you hear that "acceleration noise."  The
other is on Camera Eye (one of my all time favorites, so there). Off the top
of my head, I think it's the part that comes right after the "Focus is sharp
in the city".....da da-da-da---whoosh. Man that part always get me. I'm
getting a shiver just listening to it in my head. I'm sure there's more, but
I can't think of them. The only song that really comes to mind is Lucky Man
by Emmerson Lake and Palmer. The last line of the last verse.. "And he laid
down, and he died." I don't care how many times I hear it, and even when I'm
playing it on my guitar, I get a massive shiver.....Anybody else get that?
Cheers from NEw Mexico..

Except, after converting 1001001 to decimal, that would've been issue #73, and
we've missed it by about 1,960 issues (maybe there's some meaning in *that*
number?  Who knows anymore).  Or, I know, we can all go crazy about issue #2073
and completely forget that #2112's coming up.  Of course for the real #2112, I'm
completely for trying to actually get Rush to contribute somehow.  Who knows?
Maybe one of them is a subscriber to the list and is laughing at our feeble
debates whilst planning the ultimate surprise.

A backup plan wouldn't hurt, though.

Gotta reply on #2112
I Agree with a "blank issue"  no matter what was posted, someone would
rip it apart, and god forbid, a word be misspelled!  you know how this
group gets!
And in response to vol 2 #1... this is also a good idea and should
happen right after the 2112 blank issue, this way, something different
can be attached to every blank #2112 issue that would ever come along in
another 8 years(or so) :).

I do think the blank issue should have none of the admin. subscription
stuff at the head or foot, but simply "For Selena" (or something to that
effect and maybe the address of the fund after a screen or two full of
carriage returns.

Great Idea.

Subject: Gaia hypothesis

Gaia might have two meanings IMO. The first of course centers on the
mystical aspects of the New Age and an ancient deity.

The second was formulated by James Lovelock as a hypothesis. He's got a
book or two about this concept and I'm sure the web is loaded with
resources for those who are interested. I'm not thoroughly familiar (or
comfortable) with the idea, but I know it involves some higher level
ecological abstraction. In a nutshell, I think that Gaia is based on
global homeostasis mechanisms. If I had more time I'd do some digging.
Hopefully someone on TNMS can fill in the cracks and post some good
references.

Unfortunately, I assume, The New Agers have latched onto the scientific
Gaia to promote their mystical Gaia. I'm not too sure how mystically
oriented Lovelock himself may have been.

I haven't posted in so long....I hope I remember how.

Anyways...I've been thinking about the Rush on Pop Up Video thing this
Saturday evening.  While it is a real cool thing to see Rush on TV, am I the
only one who wishes the Pop Up folks had selected a different video?

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Limelight, but if memory serves the only video
for this song is a concert performance that aired for years on MTV.  Sure
the Pop Up folks can make references to lyrics, band facts, etc. but it will
lack the "story behind the video" (i.e., "the guy tending bar in this video
is the drummer's Uncle Ned") stuff that makes PUV so interesting.

Personally, I would have preferred one of the concept vids be Popped-Up like
Big Money, Countdown, Half the World, Subdivisions, Distant Early Warning,
etc.  I particularly think Subdivisions would have been primo with all the
Canadian/Rush related scenes throughout.

   [ I was thinking that HTW or Driven would have been great! Especially

Subject: T4E

Just wanted to respond to the post concerning the lack of enthusiasm 
shown at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee for the T4E show.  I have 
been lucky enough to see the last 4 tours that the boys have done. 
 For Presto and RTB I saw them in Florida.  I moved up to 
Wisconsin(don't ask why) and saw them both times at the Bradley.  I 
would have to agree with Gary's comment on the lack of enthusiasm.

Don't really know what the explanation is.  I was certainly not one of 
the people who "sat" back and watched.  I yelled every word to each 
song and stood the entire show.  The people in front and in back of me 
didn't move the entire show.  I sat with a group of friends that made 
as much noise as possible.  Sadly we could see down about 10 rows and 
see everybody sitting.  I don't have any gripes with sitting for the 
show.  Everybody enjoys concerts and shows in there own way.  But I 
would have loved to have moved down 10 rows closer and switched with 
the people that were sitting and talking with each other instead of 
being "in tune" with the show.

Maybe its just me.  When I go to a Rush show, it is much like a 
religious ceremony, especially the last go through(2+ hours).  I cant 
sleep the night before thinking about the set list and hoping they 
play certain songs.  But then again - different strokes for different 
folks.

Lot's or rambling on this post.  But bottom line is - the Bradley 
Center is pretty lame for the past shows I've seen.  I have not been 
lucky enough to see them play at Alpine, but have heard plenty of good 
things.
