Ok this will be fast. Because of my vacation, there were NO digests sent out
last week (sorry, just didn't have time).

In other news, Rush's lawyer finally got around to contacting syrinx's
owner, saying we have illegal audio files on the site (plus images). So for 
the time being, the NMS web site has been disabled until they can fax us 
exactly what is illegal.

Subject: Didacts and Narpets

I strongly encourage everyone to visit TNMS web page and read the
transcription of the Backstage Club newsletters.  In one of them (I beleive
RTB, but perhaps not), Neil answers the question about the lyrics to
Didacts and Narpets.  Therein, he states that he could not recall the
exacts words, but that they were intended to illustrate contrary positions
between (and I quote) "our hero and the Didacts and Narpets - teachers and
parents."

Therefore, even though "didacts" is, in fact, an anagram for "addicts," the
song actually refers to teachers.  Think about it!  If it's supposed to
illustrate contrary positions between "our hero and the Didacts and
Narpets," it would stand to reason that our hero would disagree with a
teacher, but not with an addict.

>C'mon. Its not that hard to figure out. Primus does the music for the show.

Primus are Rush fans, to some degree. Ayn Rand is an oblique reference to 
rush, at best, but if you were going to infer that it was a Rush reference 
at all, I would think that Matt Stone and Trey Parker have probably listened

to Rush at some point, if they like Primus enough to ask them to do the
music for their show.....mm'kay??<
  

What I was trying to say was not really communicated I guess.  YEAH, no duh,
I know that there is an obvious connection between South Park makers and
their
possibly listening to Rush/Primus/whatever.  However, South Park is just so
LACKING
in "Intel" and in tact!!!!! - to have Rush fans making a   I mean, you'd
think Rush

Subject: Sod all Rush relevance but amusing

Given that the world's most important sporting event is due to kick off in
a few days, I figured that appreciators of The Beautiful Game may find this
re-working of Three Lions somewhat amusing. (Editors Note- Three Lions was
originally out during the Euro '96 soccer tournament, while Gazza is Paul
Gascogne, who just got dropped from the England squad after spending too
much time on the beers. But you all knew that already)

To the tune of Three Lions, altogether now

He's coming home, he's coming home,
he's coming, Gazza's coming home
He's coming home, he's coming home,
he's coming, Gazza's coming home
He's coming home, he's coming home,
he's coming, Gazza's coming home
He's coming home, he's coming home,
he's coming, Gazza's coming home
He's coming home, he's coming home,
he's coming, Gazza's coming home

Everyone seems to know the score
He's out til half past four
He drank lots,
he drank more,
and Gazza's gonna throw it all up,
gonna blow it all up
Now he's out of the cup
Cos Glenn remembered

Three pints down his shirt,
plastics tits still gleaming
tried to force a burp
after beer and kebab evening

So many Jokes, so many tears,
but all those fags and beers
wear you down,
through the years.
but I still see that tackle on Charles
all those flash poncy cars
Gazza playing the flute
and Sheryl crying.

I know that was then,
but he'll go out again

He's coming home, he's coming home,
he's coming, Gazza's coming home

Rush relevance- well Three Lions was written by Ian Brodie who plays
electric guitar, as does Alex Lifeson.

COME ON ENGLAND!

Someone wrote regarding Limbaugh: "the guys [Rush the band] actually think he

Ahem..., lets not go spreading rumors now.  For those of you in Rio Linda, in
no way does Alex give any opinion at all of Limbaugh.  In fact he says "we
wouldn't write a song that had anything to do with him."  A fairly bipartisan
comment, as they wouldn't want to open themselves up to lawsuits, etc.

This comment, by the way, is my first "entry" into the NMS ... I've been an
NMS'er  for quite a while but,
have never written in ...  Anyway, to the point,

I recently read an entry from:

>>>Subject: Rush Sighting at Van Halen Show

and thought ... I definitely had a RUSH SIGHTING at THIS show, too ... and
it's a pretty 'vanilla' one... nothing prolific but ...

HOW 'BOUT THE !#@$!%~ DRUM SOLO BY THE WAY ?!  Geez.  I could swear that
guy Howard
Ungerleider must have infiltrated and leaked to Alex THE WHOLE NEIL PEART
DRUM SOLO CONCEPT !!!
I mean, all the 'cymbal-horn hits' he was either triggering or sequenced
with ...
STOLEN !  ...  But, still HUGE, by the way !  (as it was the first time I
heard Neil do it !!!!  : )
And...  Alex actually (as far as I'm concerned) HAD a 'SOLO FORMULA' i.e.,
a "solo that made sense" ... "a solo that was musical" ...
(that is, he's come a long way from that solo he did on "LIVE WITHOUT A
NET" don't 'cha think?!)
THE SOLO WAS GREAT ~  but, again, sort of "STOLEN !"  : )
Just my 2-cents.
Overall, I had a blast at the show... and, VH are monsters on the stage for
sure !!!  (I'll always be a Hagar fan, though.)

Anyway, I just had to comment on the fact that ALEX' DRUM SOLO definitely
kicked off a 'RUSH' feeling that:
"I'VE HEARD SOMETHING QUITE SIMILAR TO THIS BEFORE".

So, for what it's worth, "Thanks Neil !"  You've obviously had an influence
on even one of YOUR peers ...  Mr. Alex Van Halen.

The tour was not advertised much in North Carolina (or at least
around the Triangle) as far as I remember.  It would have been
easy to miss the Charlotte date if you weren't on the look out.  
I would have known a tour was in the works, but could have easily 
missed the first day of ticket sales or conceivably, the whole
show.

By the way, what is a TRUE Rush fan? 
Just enjoying the music apparently isn't enough ...

Subject: atheletes and Rush

To the fellow who was taking about "Wallen Cromartie", who was apparently 
a famous baseball player in Japan, his name is actually Warren, not 
Wallen.  As well, Rush knew him from his playing days with the Montreal 
Expos.  Cromartie was a major part of the powerhouse Expos teams of the 
late 70's/early 80's.  Just thought I'd let everyone know, as it is my 
duty as Manitoba's #1 Expos' fan.

Obligatory Rush Content:
ESL (remastered) is in my CD player right now, along with Yes-Going For 
The One, Iron Maiden-Somewhere In Time (their best!), Neil Young and 
Crazy Horse-Broken Arrow, and Led Zeppelin-Presence.

Regarding T4E tour:
I've been a huge Rush fan for years, but I've only had internet access 
for the past 3 years.  Prior to this, despite my devotion for the band, 
I didn't have access to much news on the band, so it is possible to be a 
true fan and still not know everything that's going on with the band, 
especially when you're at the mercy of the papers, TV, and radio.

Go Stars! (and Caps too).

Dear All,

In response to the new thread on best Rush song to wake up 
to, I would go for The Spirit of Radio.  Not only is it 
rousing and vibrant, but you get to truly 'begin the day 
with a friendly voice'.  To expand the thread a little, I'd 
like to put in my nomination for worst Rush song to wake 
up to, that being YYZ - the morse-code bell would wake you 
up and you'd feel it like a time-bomb, knowing that any 
minute you're gonna get blasted by those opening chords.  
My vote for worst non-Rush song to wake up to would have to 
go to Waking the Witch, Kate Bush, simply for the intensely 
scary whispered 'Wake Up!' at the beginning of the track - 
that one freaks me out so much that I'm not even brave 
enough to try setting it on my stereo.

Testing 4 Echoes,

Greg Sanderson

P.S.  Deep Rush Thought for the day:  If the Garbage song 
'#1 Crush' had that 'C' replaced with a ':', that'd be the 
best!

Subject: Marillion, Scarred & Stuff

HELLO-O-o-o!!

Just a few words.

Marillion: I would recommend This Strange Engine from 1997 as a good choice.
The whole album is amazing and considering they were dropped by EMI just
before this album, it makes it all the sweeter. I like both eras of
Marillion (both eras of Rush, anyone). Fish was a character all right (still
is) and he wrote some cracking songs (Clutching at Straws, Misplaced
Childhood etc) but H (Steve Hogarth) is an exceptional vocalist and
songwriter. Faves on TSE are 'Man of A Thousand Faces', '80 days' and 'This
Strange Engine', a 26 minute track (sort of) that is just awesome. The band
are about to release a new live CD that spans the last 2 tours (including
the US tour financed by the Freaks Digest last year). if you go to The
Racket Club Online www.marillion.co.uk , the official Marrillion site, where
you can buy it over the web. There are also some Real Audio soundclips of
some of the back catalogue including the 'Ambient Mix of TSE'. Tasty!

Check out some of Fish's solo stuff too, a good buy would be Yin & Yang (2
seperate CD's) which are reworkings of some of his more famous works
including 'Sugar Mice', 'Lavender' and a superb cover of 'Boston Tea Party'
played with the remaining members of The Sensational Alex Harvey Band (who
penned the original).

Scarred: Just received my copy of 'Run faster' from Ryan at Scarred. An
excellent CD (not mp3) recorded in London on the RTB tour. Listening to
Xanadu you can hear the audience singing along in unison (it's a sounboard
recording so they are LOUD). Is it any wonder they recorded CTTH over here,
no luck this time round though! Ryan is about to release his second Rush
>.mp3 compilation any day now. It is called 'Spiral' and will feature some
amazing stuff, kind of makes living in the UK bearable. He only has a few
copies of watchful.eye left. Snap it up now! Check out his website
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/2236/

Talking of overdubs on live albums (was I, perhaps not), I was listening to
a tape that I made from the laserdisc of The Grace Under Pressure Tour video
and, although there appear to be no musical overdubs, the crowd noise is
obviously added on. If you listen closely to TSOR at the beginning, the
crowd go freakin' mental, as you do, but as the song progresses, the crowd
noise remains at the same level. There is some guy in the background
whistling and it repeats at regular intervals well into the show. I think
that the video director, (David Mallet, I think) looped a part of the
audience going wild and repeated it ad-infinitum. It is bloody annoying but
as the disc moves on, it becomes less apparent. This is more upsetting to me
than Geddy (maybe) fixing the 'Fate of man' line on a recording (such as
Animated) of the Hemispheres Prelude from the CP tour. Anyone who has heard
that will know what I mean. Man, it could shatter glass, start dogs howling
etc.

Hope that post about the New live album is true, can't wait!

Sorry for the long post guys but it had to happen after 18 months as an NMS
member.

Subject: Ayn Rand -- Let's get it Straight

I just read Alex Smith's recent post to the NMS about Ayn Rand and had to
comment. Like so many others on this list who have commented on her in the
past, Alex obviously doesn't fully understand Rand or the philosophy of
Objectivism.  I've been a fan of her works for over ten years now (thanks
in part to Neil's reference to her), and while I understand people who
didn't like her on a personal level (I hear she could be rather nasty), I
take issue with his summation of the philosophy she espoused.

Alex says:

"I don't like Rand anyway... She is interesting because she was able to go
from ardent libertarianism :-) to quasi-fascism :-(. She started to get too
much in the idea of a "superman" who could stomp all over others to achieve
what they "deserved." basically, she took Nietzsche (sp?) to an extreme,
and, in the process, created such a strong form of individualism that it
became almost fascist... ironic, ain't it!"

He couldn't be more wrong.  First, Rand didn't go to libertarianism.  In
fact she didn't care for it because it only dealt with politics
(capitalism) without the moral base of a fully developed philosophy.
Objectivism is much deeper with different branches dealng with metaphysics,
epistemology, ethics, politics, and aesthetics.  If anything,
libertarianism as it is formally organized today is an offshoot of the
Objectivist movement of the late 60's.

As to the remarks about fascism, she never espoused the idea of the
"superman" who could stomp all over others to achieve what they deserved.
That's a correct analysis of Nietzche, not Rand.  Get it straight.

Rand said "Man is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others.
He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor
sacrificing others to himself."
(Key phrase there is "nor sacrificing others to himself.")

Lastly, Alex states:

"individualism is extremely important, but not to a fanatical degree that
others suffer."

Again, anyone who follows individualism to the degree that they are hurting
others is following the Nietzche model for individualism, not Rands.

As to Neil Peart, he s not an objectivist, but he has stated that Rand is
definitely a part of his thinking and the way he has lived his life is
proof of that.  Heck, in The Masked Rider, he is carrying a copy of
Aristotle's works. Objectivism in many ways is based on his teachings.

     It looks like Allan is one of Revolver Films' Executive Producers. A 
     quick search through the web site shows Allan as the producer of the 
     Driven and Half the World videos. If you go to the Dale Heslip page, 
     you'll see some vid caps from Driven and Nobody's Hero (I think). I'll 
     tell ya, the dude driving the car in the Driven video looks alot like 
     Geddy. Is it?
     
     Also, if you look at the Creative Talent page, you'll notice Andrew 
     MacNaughtan listed as a Music Video Director. Obviously, being the 
     official photographer for Rush isn't exactly full-time work these 
     days.
     
     Other Stuff:
     
     - Boston radio generally sucks for Rush. New Hampshire radio (100.3, 
     101.?) is marginally better.
     
     - Marillion - I've only heard Misplaced Childhood (Fish) and Brave 
     (Hogarth). Enjoyed MC much more.
     
     - I have a gut feeling (with nothing to back it up) that the upcoming 
     live album will be the last we hear from Rush. If they *do* release 
     another studio album, well...what the hell do I know anyway.

Subject: RUSH, radio, and the ridiculous

I see some of the most ridiculous drivel in here, it's a good thing that
the subject matter and the positives far outweigh the pathetic.

Rushme000@aol.com wrote:

"Rush are a classic example of this sheer laziness and brutal arrogance from
its fans.i hear nothing but bitching from all of you and some on the streets
and phones about how much test for echo sucks and how geddy needs to go back
to the stienberger,or how Rush was great in the moving pictures days or how
neil hasnt played anything worthwhile since hold your fire ,etc"

How completely offensive. Does this person even read the newsletters? I
have been reading for quite a while now and most everyone here seems to
agree that T4E is probably one of their best all-around efforts in a
while...not that they were slouching before that. Not only that, but if the
RUSH fan base is so arrogant and lazy, how do you justify their longevity?
Their plush lifestyles? Their devoted fanbase of how many years now? The
TNMS?

I also notice that most of what I see posted generally seems to be positive
and inquisitive (even if it is ridiculous drivel), rather than bitchy and
dissapointed, as he later implies.

He went on to complain that if RUSH is underpublicized, it's OUR fault.
I think everyone in here has more time/money invested in RUSH's
music/paraphrenalia/literature than most people would believe. So to act as
though anyone involved in the reading/posting of this newsletter might be
at fault for not supporting what is obvioiusly one of their favorite bands,
seems completely ludicrous. The shows here in Houston usually sell very
well, though it sometimes takes a while due to the lack of publicity. But I
think the band knows it's fans very well and usually have cleverly
calculated the critical point at which additional advertising dollars won't
produce sufficient return on investment (I still think they fell short on
publicity on the T4E tour) I, too, agree, that the show's are far less
publicized than other less talented bands with more "media appeal". But
Rush has never been the type of band to build their work solely around
"media appeal" or what other people want.I personally would like to see the
boys put on a show with minimal stage lights, no inflatable bunnies, no
movies in the back, no explosions, playing the songs that THEY want to
play.....Just the boys playing the music (can I see that live in my living
room please?). Save the special effects money for profit, or cheaper seats,
or better beer,  or publicity for the shows. I understand that they have to
hype it all up for the people who can't just go to see the boys, they want
a "rockshow" and I think we all understand that, just can't help wishing.

>...IMHO, a good portion of the posts here talk about their lack of airplay
and want that changed. Personally, I could care less if they get airplay on
the radio because I've (And I know all of you have) been there....13-20
years old, waiting on hold for 30 minutes for the "best" rock station in
town and then finally

"K101, what can I play for you?"

"Uhhhh, man I would be indebted to you forever if you would just play a
little RUSH, not just right now, but once in a while, "

"Hey, Great!!! What would you like to hear? TomSawyer? Limlight? Uhhhhh Tom
Sawyer?"

"How about La Villa Strangiato"

"What album is that on?"

"Hemispheres, "

"Uhhhhh," <checking songlist> "Ohhhhh that's way too long, How about Tom
Sawyer"

"Awwww man, c'mon, what about 'Different Strings' on Permanent Waves?"

"OK, We'll Try to get that on for ya', just keep listening"

Well, this was not a one time occassion and after a few years of this, I
quit trying. I finally came to the realization that Radio, as you stated,
must cater to the masses. Problem is, The Boys aren't built to focuse on
being played on the radio. RUSH doesn't write music on the lowest common
denominator for the mindless numb masses. The write music which offers
something that the mainstream "playlist" can't contribute, consistency in
talent and a certain level of intelligence...and not everyone is hip to it,
and not everyone can get past the things that "normal" people consider
"snags" or turnoffs e.g. high voice of Ged for some, loud rock guitars for
others, pentagrams and naked people for others...and due to their closed
mindedness, they are those who never know what amazing things the band has
to offer, but I don't think that the masses will change, and if they do, it
won't be because they got to hear "TomSawyer" 2 extra times a day over the
once a day (every day mind you) that station i mentioned has played for 17
yrs now (that 6205+ plays roughly, for you people keeping score at home).
If you do have a station that has an audience that appreciates RUSH enough
to hear what they really have to offer, then I envy you, those stations are
far and few between.<Congrats Seattle>

I know a lot of you are shaking your head in agreement, and a lot of you
are shaking your head in disagreement but the people agreeing have felt
this, i think, and the people disagreeing are probably the ones who sit
down in the stadiums (if they show up at all) and wait for Tom Sawyer to
clap and get excited, and are mad if it doesn't get played (which it always
does, because the boys understand the temperament of their fans.) Nothing
wrong with the song,it's great, they just have so much more to offer.

So I realized that if I wanted to hear good music, I better find it myself,
because if I wait for my entire city and indeed the nation to vote on the
type of songs/bands that *I* want to hear on a typical rock station of
today, I'll never get there....NO MATTER HOW LOUD I YELL! <not to mention
those irritating commercials! :) >

I guess what all that means (and I do mean ALL THAT, Sorry) is that, to say
RUSH is a classic example of ...sheer laziness and brutal arrogance (?)
from its fans....means to me you don't know your product or market very
well.

I would like to add that this is the first "flame" oriented post for me,
and was brought about by this person's bitching,  so I think to say that he
hears "nothing but bitching from all of you" is a bit of an overstaement of
the facts. Sure, you hear a lot of people comment on this or that about
what the band is or is not doing, but most of it at least tries to be
constructive and there is a definite lack of random "slammers" knocking
everything like you find on a regular newsgroup." TNMS is a good forum
,even if we do ramble a bit.

final word? RUSH is a fantastic musical experience, and as a fan-base, it
seems we have served them nearly as well as they have served us (I feel
like I still owe them, how about you other folks). Their need to create and
not recycle keeps us anxious with anticipation, even if whatever album is
not our favorite. We still buy them...because you know there's something
about them that you will love. I, for one, will continue to observe and
listen as long as they are willing to give us a piece of what they
create...but I won't call my radio station for it....I'll just get it
myself and hear the songs I want to hear when I want to hear them. Nothing
against radio, just hard to get what you really want out of it unless you
want to hear what you just saw on MTV. Ack!

Man, I'm awfully sorry about all of this, but some of these things just had
to be said. My guess is I'm not the only one typing up a response to some
of the weak issues put forth.

I'll probably be sorrier that I typed all of this when I read it...too late
now!

Hell, just send it.

Scoots asked: "I recently noticed the remaster cover has quite a bit of
brown/tan overtones in it. I own the original album and no tan just blue."

This was brought up a few months ago.  Maybe the printer was wearing "Red
Lenses"? :)  Close inspection of the images shows that the image is identical,
therefore my guess is that the printing is the only differnce.  The other
possibility is when they reprinted for the remasters, they reshot the original
painting changing the cast due to different lighting.  

It is easy to make changes like that during the printing process, either
intentionally or errorneously.  Who knows, maybe the original was supposed to
have the brownish cast (personally, I like the old color better).  I'd like to
hear an official explaination, btw.

If anyone that has been to my website would like me to scan the new cover, let
me know (as I said, I like the old color better).

Hey all,

Just a question.....does anyone out there have or remember a poster
advertising the Presto tour described like the following:

It's a black and white picture of the three of them standing together. 
It has PRESTO TOUR (in Presto font) at the bottom of the picture.
Underneath is a section of white with the words VENUE: and DATE: in black
lettering.  At the very bottom is the Atlantic Records symbol and the
words On Atlantic Records, Cassettes, & Compact Discs.  Poster is dated
1990.

Unfortunately I do not have a scanner so I can only write about it.

I had obtained one of these at the start of the tour and was wondering
how rare (or un-rare) it is.  Feel free to privately e-mail me. 
Thanks!!!!!

Subject: Re:Country Music

Al Willig was responding to some negative posts about country music.  I have to 
agree with Al in what he says.  I am also not a fan of country music, or 
Marilyn Manson, or Shania Twain, or whoever else is the artist slam du jour 
on this digest.  All I know is that if somebody says that artist X is the 
greatest artist in the world, they are correct.  Correct because they are 
stating their opinion on a matter where only opinion exists.  While some 
people love broccoli, I am living proof that there are people who do not.  
While some people love (insert band name here), some people simply do not.  
Nothin' wrong with that.  

I have had people come up to me while I was wearing a Rush shirt and tell me 
that Rush sucks.  For no reason.  I think that they think Rush fans are easy 
to piss off with statements like that (I agree with that to a certain extent, 
too).  The thing is, I don't care what anybody else thinks about them.  Why 
should I?  I listen to certain songs just because of the way it makes me feel, 
not you or anybody else.  There are certain songs I will listen to just because
the singer will hit just the right note to make the hair on my arms stand up.  
I am certain that all of you have songs that make that happen to you too.  
Whether that singer happens to be Geddy Lee or Buddy Guy or Gwen Stefani or 
even Tiny Tim for god's sake, it does not matter.  Sure, it's nicer when 
people around you feel the same emotional twangs that you do when you hear 
the songs you love, but when they don't, don't jump all over them just 
because they have a slightly different taste.  SLAGGING OTHER BANDS DOES NOT 
MAKE YOUR BAND BETTER!!!!  

I think most of you will agree that if a non-Rush fan would give Rush a real, 
honest listen, and try to get in to the music, that their conversion to 
Rushianity would be inevitable.  If only they would listen, you think.  They 
are missing out on so much!  I am sure that the fans of these bands that have 
been trashed on this digest believe the same thing about their band.  I wonder 
how many of you that do the band trashing have given some of these bands a 
real, honest, open-minded (eared?) listen.  Probably not very many of you.  
I think just the fact that you trash a band, not matter which one,  makes 
you somewhat closed-minded.  Think about why we have music to begin with.  I 
assure you, it is not meant for competition.  That is what it has become 
today, though, and I, for one, think it is sad.

Alex Gray asked:
 -- Jimmy Page played guitar with a _violin bow_?  Does that _work_?

yes, but not well. He basically swiped the bow across the strings.  Not
really a bowing technique.  I have seen a custom made guitar for
bowing--extreme radius on the fretboard and high string action.  But
why? Get a violin and a cello.  Retune to taste.  Much cheaper--for that
effect, that is.  Violins and cellos can be extremely expensive.  But a
cello is better than a violin--it burns longer.

First of all Al, do you have a sense of humor? The deprogramming
comment was in jest. I imagine the response you quoted was also in jest,
at least I took it in that context. I felt that my post reflected this,
as most all of the private mail I recieved on the subject was in the
same joking tone (Al,...please remember this reference "private
mail"). 			
	The fact that my son listens to Garth Brooks and Shania Twain would
indicate that I must allow it to happen eh? There are actually many new
country artists that I myself enjoy listening to, which is how my son
had access to the music in the first place. I'm not smothering his
interests in any way, shape or form. I recorded the tapes he listens to
(...did you even wonder how he heard these artists, or did you imagine
another "inmate" smuggling in his copy of "Sevens"?). 
	Our houshold listens to Rush, and others in that genre. I am proud that
my kids enjoy it, because that shows me they have an appreciation of the
musicianship on this level. I'm glad they decided that a band like (just
as an example) Bush, wasn't worth their time. They made that decision on
their own, however. I don't censor my children's artistic likes and
dislikes. We have everything from Prog to R&B to Rap to Jazz to CCM to
Metal to Classical to (...dare I say) COUNTRY in our home. It's all
available to my kids.
	I thought all of this would be quite obvious, but I guess that got past
ya Al. Thanks for the "parenting 101" lesson (...being as you have so
much experience), but I've been doing this labor of love for many years.
If my son decides to buy a Stetson hat, and play pedal steel guitar,
I'll be just as proud of his choices as I would be if he became the next
Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart or Geddy Lee. Next time, why not make your
attack in a private e-mail (...remember this reference?). I promise to
do the same.
	Sorry for the brief mostly OT flameout, fellow Rushians. Back to

Bullcocks. Twelfth Night, fronted by Geoff Mann (a true poet), as a lyrical
force, smokes IQ/Nicholls, Pendragon/Barrett, and even Fish. Fish's stuff,
while fabulous, *appears* to be more angst-ridden and mutli-dimensional,
but Mann's edges it out. _Fugazi_ is just about as good as _Clutching_, and
better than _MC_ (overrated), and _Script_. Instrumentally speaking,
Pointer/Trewavas/Rothery weren't necessarily better back then, than Devoil,
Mitten and Revell. I will agree that Mover and Mosley are better than
Mover, and Kelly is/was/will be a far better keyboardist than Rick
Battersby (it was Clive Mitten, not Battersby, though, who handled all the
keys on 12th Night's classic _Fact and Fiction_). 12th Night, of course,
are defunct (too bad), so Rothery/Trewavas/Mosley/Kelly are *definitely*
better, now.
