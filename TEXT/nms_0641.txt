you've been asked to be unsubscribed please be patient. I'll have them all
done by the end of the day. And we're over 1700 subscribers now! Also, check
out David Arnold's post (2nd to last) for some important information. This

I'm pretty sure that the guitar solo on "Chain Lightning" is recorded
backwards.  One of my old Walkmans only plays backwards now, and I've spent
many an hour checking out tunes in reverse.  Also, in the Rush interview in
the March 1990 issue of Guitar World (which should be at the ftp site
somewhere), the following statement appears:

"Both Alex and Geddy will carry extensive MIDI gear with them on tour.  Whether
Alex will be able to reproduce the studio-enhanced backwards gutar parts
on "Chain Lightning" remains to be seen."

Alex solved this problem nicely: don't put the song in the set!

Other Rush tunes with backwards guitar:  The Necromancer (just about all
of In The Valley, nice forwards/backwards duet starting around 3:05.
Basically, all the backwards stuff is on the right channel, and all
"Solo" lines before 3:05 are backwards.  Either Alex got real lucky doing
this, or spent lots of time arranging this part!).

Mystic Rhythms:  The little ascending line at 3:39 on PoW, 3:36 on ASOH.
I think they sampled it for ASOH (obviously!).  Alex isn't playing while
these samples are heard, and his gutar tone is different between the
"backwards" part and what immediately follows.

That's all I can think of right now!

Hey John,

It seems to me that you forgot one very obvious choice for city names:

	Shmeng (Borough of... Subdivisions)

But that's OK.  :-)

Hmmm. Anything real to say?  Well, yes.  I have the CD singles for Roll the
Bones w/ "It's a Rap" parts 2 and 3 (Geddy and Neil).  Anyone have a copy of
the single w/ Part 1 (Alex) they'd be willing to part with?  Have these
interviews been put in the archives?

  [ This is the same interviews as found on "Roll The Bones Radio Special"
    which I have on my account, but haven't had a chance to look over yet. I'll
    try to get it out in the next week or so.			: rush-mgr ]

Well, I'll keep this short.  Rush On!

Subject: About the convention

I'll like to make two observations.......

1) I seriuosly doubt we are going to get more than 100 people to sign up
to the convention from this list alone.  Before you flame, let me explain.
Alot of people in this mailing list are from places that are really far
away like Australia, or the UK.  Alot other people cannot justify (or
afford) to go so far away (like people in California and Texas, florida, etc)

2)Lets make this convetion open to whoever wants to come.  By this, I mean,
let call the Toronto Radio Stations to advertize it for free.  How about
the local radio stations from NY, and nearby states.  By doing this,
we can have hundreds of fans that will help pay for the Convetion hall,
and the cover band.  This will reduce the cost on everyone, and will
allow us to mingle with hundreds of other local fans that are simply
not aware of the existence of this mailing list or the internet.

The only reason that I'm going (other than the obvious one) is that...

    I'm not a student and make pretty good mone, and I have vacation
time comming up, plus I know a few peole in NY that would be happy
if I visited them!

So please think about the above suggestions...I don't want this thing to
die, due to lack of funds which I'm sure we could get from the thousands
of local Rush fans in Toronto!

any comments write me at : frick@cs.utexas.edu

Subject: The Spirit Of Radio Used in another song!

Hi Everyone,

Now here's a strange thing,
The other day I was at a friends house just talking and listening
to some music 'n' stuff. When a familiar sounding song came on to
the player. I thought, it sounded very like _The Spirit of Radio_,
so I listened a bit harder.
It turned out to that there was a RUSH SAMPLE in this song, it was
the guitar piece right at the beginning of TSOR.

                                     ^
The tape was by a band called _SAINT ETIENNE_
the album _SO TOUGH_
the song was _CONCHITA MARTINEZ_ (I think)

So I looked in the tape insert, there was no mention of RUSH,
by there was a credit to the record company something like:

The Spirit of Radio
thanks to &lt;record company&gt; (atlantic was it ?)

I prefer short posts, so thats all for now.... bye

&gt;I think many on TNMS would agree that lyrics
&gt;are the ONLY great thing about Springsteen and Dylan.  This is NOT
&gt;meant to insult S & D fans, but I would guess (Hey, Dan, how about a
&gt;poll?) that MOST Rush fans would rate S&D fairly LOW on their list of faves!!!

					^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nope, The Bob Man comes second only to Rush I'm afraid.

Greetings Fellow Rushians,

 As to the name for a city in Civilization, how about Mandrake (Cinderella Man)?
  But, I guess all the citizens would have to wear goofy black capes and have
  pencil mustaches and top hats....

  In my home town of Nashville (well, actually right outside of Nashville), a
  local UHF station used to carry those really cheesy kung-fu movies on Sat at
  about 4.30am or something.  Anyway, in the advertisements for the "Kung Fu
  Power Hour," they played the intro to "Show Don't Tell" along with several
  high-energy clips.  I was surprised to see how well it worked.  Or maybe,
  it was just the high-quality dubbing that all those movies have :)

  In my hometown station's "Superbowl of Rock," Rush got put out by Lynard
  Skynard.  Oh well, maybe the South is backwards.  But, here in Tuscaloosa,
  Rush is constantly in the top 3 of the most requested list on WTYD.  They're
  learning...

Subject: YYZ Tab
Date: Wed, 10 Mar 93 11:17:47 CST

Last night I finally sat down and forced myself to learn YYZ.. (it's about
time, I guess.)  Well, I can get the whole thing down, except for Geddy's
second fill.  The first fill is easy to figure out, but difficult to do
quickly enough.  The second fill is slightly muffled at the beginning and
while I normally have an excellent ear for this type of thing, I found it
very hard to place individual notes, although I know the scale it's done
in.  The third fill, while it sounds like the most difficult one, really
is the easiest..

Has anybody ever seen bass tablature (or sheet music) for this song?  I
can improvise my own little second fill, but Geddy's is so terrific I'd
love to know what the notes are.

Right then, that's all.  Oh, I think a fanzine is a good idea, but I might
suggest that because we already have the NMS, maybe incorporating more
than one band into it might be a good idea.. Yes/Rush?  Those two seem to
go hand-in-hand with a lot of people.

Just a thought.  (Any YYZ info, send me email!)

Thanks,
Ben

PS:  Teemu Selanne with another hattrick last night.  That would be 102

Subject: Re: Chain Lightning Guitar Solo

Hey-

Some talk about the backwards guitar solo on Chain Lightning has
come about here on the net. I seem to recall reading a guitar
interview where the interviewer wondered whether Alex would be
able to play the solo live because it was recorded backwards..
So, this may or may not confirm anything, but I am almost positive
that I read it. It was a Guitar Mag right when Presto was released,
maybe the one where Alex and Perry from Aerosmith and SRV were
inducted into the Guitar Hall of fame.

Another neat little interview I remember, was when Neil had his
picture on the cover of MD, and it was about Presto. The interviewer
asked about Scars and the paradiddles Peart plays on the Octapad..
The interviewer asked if he would be able to play it live, and
Peart responded in typical fashion "Oh, absolutely!" or something
along those lines.

As always-
Chris

Subject: Passage to Bangkok on the radio

     Last night I was driving home and I heard "A Passage to Bangkok" on the
radio!  I couldn't believe it.  I thought it was the first time I heard it on
the radio, but then I remembered something a few months ago which was even more
amazing.  It was a Two-For Tuesday, which means they play 2 songs in a row
by the same artist.  Anyway, they did a Rush 2-for of the entire 2112 followed
by APTB!  *That* was amazing.  Granted, it was about 3 a.m., but still...
     While I'm here, I'll post an observation.  Has anyone noticed that in the
GUP Tour video, during Finding My Way, instead of singing "I cried some sad
tears," Geddy sings "I drank 12 beers"?  (1500 cries of "Yes, you idiot!")  :)
I know the thing about "catch a fish" from the ASOH vid is in the FAQ, but I
don't recall seeing this there.  Well, later.

Neil has apparently been cut out of the Moving Pictures CD jacket.  There is
a time-delay photo of him on the record jacket of MP.  It's a really nice
picture too--his expression is incredibly intense as he is beating on a
cymbal.  I don't know why they didn't put this on the CD--in my opinion it is
the coolest picture of the three.

Notice of possible network outages with respect to Syrinx.umd.edu!

The Computer Science Center at the University of Maryland is undergoing
a reshuffling of the IP addresses for many/all of it's machines.  Seems
we've filled up a domain of the network, so we're being moved into a
bigger domain.

This is expected to happen over the next few days, but at this point
we have not been given a definite time.  While there shouldn't be any
problems, during the change-over period there may be losses of con-
nectivity with the network.  Actually, the connections won't be lost,
but name resolution might be flakey for a few hours until the hostname/IP
address change propagates out through the network name servers.

If you attempt to mail or ftp to syrinx.umd.edu and get a bounce (especially
if it's due to "name resolution failure"), please be patient and try the
operation again after a few hours or the next day.

With any luck the changes will be totally transparent, but I believe that
forewarned is forearmed.  :-)

    Good poll man! Surprising winner! Anyway, I think what would be beneficial
to all us maths-heads out here is if you could publish the list with the
POINTS each song scored (in their final order) and other things like TOTAL
number of voters and TOTAL points available.

    This way we can find out how representative a sample the poll used and we
can put into perspective the results.
