About "The Spirit of Radio," Paul Ackerman III says that the modified S&G
quote is "The words of the prophets were written on the studio
walls, and concert halls". Actually, Neil (being the consummate, witty
writer that he is) changes "prophets" to "profits," making the
statement even more bitingly sarcastic, and essentially quite
accurate, especially these days. Too many salesman in the halls, and
not enough musicians. This theme shows up in "Superconductor" as well, but
in a different form.

Subject: P/G

	Being new to this Digest, I've just caught the tail end of what
appears to have been a long P/G discussion, but I thought I'd throw in a
couple of random comments which I hope aren't repeats.  I was intrigued by
the idea that the album is an over-reaction to the synthesizers of Signals.
Although it seems obvious to me in retrospect, I think I never noticed it
because of what I can only describe as the overproduction in most of the
album.  It's as if every "hole" created by the lack of a synthesizer had
to be filled in with something else.  This is something I had never exactly
put my finger on before, but in that light it does seem to me that Rush
evolved from a band that used silence very effectively to one that rarely
ever uses it any more (although I suspect that a lot of the blame here goes
to producers).  For that matter, the band has moved away from the trading of
short solo licks (YYZ being an obvious example), which I for one have been
sorry to see.  I think that this all has a lot to do with why I've always been
dissatisfied with P/G.

	Vocally, I would say that P/G was Geddy's most subdued album ever
(something that seemed to please the critics at the time).  Does anyone out
there know why?  I've heard various theories, including the fact that he was
smoking to much at the time (which seems fairly unlikely, since he seems to
have the range back now), the producer insisted on it, and that they were
looking for a wider audience.  On the plus side, I think that Geddy made up
for teh subdued vocals of the album by coming up with some pretty interesting
new bass concepts.  At that time, Geddy said in an interview that his favorite
bass player was Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and I can hear a bit of the influence on
P/G, although their styles overall are quite different.

	Lyrically and conceptually, I agree with those who say that the album
has its ups and downs.  I'm definitely fond of The Enemy Within, and I think
that all of the man-vs-machine songs work quite well [BTW, has anyone commented
on the fact that 1001001 converted to ASCII is "I" and 100100 is "$"?  Coin-
cidence? Maybe.] On the other hand, most of the first side of the album never
did much for me.

	'nuff said.....

	Yesterday GREG GORING &lt;CS110255@Sol.YorkU.CA&gt;
mentioned the new Gowan album.  Alex Lifeson
is credited with guitars, and he plays on most
(if not all) songs.  You can only really
tell by the solos, but that doesn't mean that
Lifeson or Greer aren't playing aren't
playing rhythm on a song.  The album isn't
all that great, but I'm a Gowan fan, so I
like some of it.  Last year (or 2 years ago)
Lifeson produced an album for a band called
Clean Slate.  Not all that hot.

	By the way, where HASN'T Gary L. Dare
lived? Montreal, New York, Toronto, Winnipeg...
Is there anyone out there who has not
lived within, say, 100 km of this man? :-)

Just thought some of you out there might want to know...

In the new (Sept. '90) issue of _Modern Drummer_ magazine, Ludwig is selling
Neil Peart posters for $3.  The picture in the ad looks like it was from the
same photo session as the ones on page 8 in the Presto tourbook.  Here's the
address to write to:

Neil Peart
PO Box 310
Elkhart, Indiana 46515

Subject: SAGA anthor great Canadian band

People have been talking about Triumph, which if a good band, but no one
is talking about SAGA.  They were the opening act for my first concert
ever (Eddie Monet).  They we AUSOME!!!

If you like drums, you have got to see them.  Their drummer used a
regular drum set thought the show, but once another member of the band
came on stage with a synth drum set no larger than a suitcase.  And they
had a battle of the drums, oh my was that great!!!

If you want to get an album by them get Worlds Apart of Heads Or Tales,
they're both great.

Anyone know what happened to them?

Subject: questions galore

   Hi, I'm new to the Digest and I can tell I'm gonna have a great time 
discussing my favorite band! Here's a slew of questions I have:

o  Could someone give me an interpretation of the lyrics in Tom Sawyer? I don't
   understand them.

o  What does that symbol with the man looking at the pentagram-type symbol 
   stand for? It's on the front cover of All The Worlds A Stage. I think 
   it might have something to do w/2112 but I'm not sure.

o  Why didn't Broon continue to be RUSH's producer? Was there a fight?

o  What other bands do the guys in RUSH like? I know that Geddy is a really big
   Metallica fan [like me].

o  Why did they put that cheesy ending in War Paint. "Boys and girls together,
   paint the mirror black." I hate that! It seems to me Atlantic or Hine made
   that commercial demand.

   I think that they should make at least one instumental/heavy hitting song 
that will show that RUSH can still rock heavy.

   Here's another Canadian Band: Voivod. A wonderful progressive metal band. 
Kinda weird, but cool. They remind me of a cross between RUSH, Pink Floyd, 
and Metallica.

   Sorry about all of those darn questions, but I'm a curious guy...

&gt; to do with the rest of the album?".  And as I think I've heard, "New
&gt; World Man" was thrown together at the last minute, and the boyz never
&gt; planned on it being a hit (are there other songs from the past several
&gt; albums that were, shall we say, extemporaneous?)

I recall reading somewhere---it may have been in the HYF tour
program---that "Force Ten" was just thrown together at the last
minute.

Now I have a question inspired by the recent discussion of p/g. It
seems to me a lot of the zealous defenders of that album mentioned
that it was the album that turned them on to Rush, etc. etc., and
we've talked before about the special place everyone has in their
heart for their first Rush album. What I want to know it this:

For people who got into Rush BEFORE _Exit,_Stage_Left_ came out, what
is your favorite album to come out SINCE ESL? And why?
