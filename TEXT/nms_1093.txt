I don't care what anyone's "valid interpretations" are, this is Rush
blasphemy for one, anti-Semitic for another, and overall, disgusting.
Nice to see in this day and age there is still people as completely
screwed up as this wallowing around in their own filth.

Gee, thans for unleashing such pathetic garbage on us, America Online.

Subject: RUSH heading in the wrong direction?

Greetings!
     This is my first post so please pay attention!!! :)
I've been a RUSH fan since half of me had a flagellum, but I
question the direction that Alex, Geedy, and Neal are heading.
I think everything from 2121 through Moving Pitchers is great.
Jacob's Bladder and Yzz are a couple of my favorites. However, I
believe that with Singles and Grace Under Fire things really
started to fall apart.  Songs like Distant Early Morning
Red Gloves, Kid Lenses, and The Enema Within were BIG flops.
Things weren't any better with Role the Bones either; the song
Hershey was a disappointment. But then there's Counterparts!
What can I say?  This album was great.  This album instilled
a lot of hope in me.  Then all this joy is torn apart when I
hear that the new album is going to be Country Western!
This is going to be the biggest mistake of their careers!

     Now, to all of you who are actively participating in the
thread about the trees.  I think everyone is missing the point
on this one.  Obviously it's about Lumberjacks who can't decide
which kind of wood is best for making log cabins.  I'll admit
that the first time I read the lyrics they went right over my
head.  If you read really closely, however, the TRUE message jumps
right out at you...especially if you are an English major like me!:)
Hopefully this will put an end to this whole debate!

     I'd like to thank rush-mgr for a job well done.  Also,
thanks to all the RUSH fans with a sense of humor.

Subject: Alex Van Halen solo/Neil

Someone in a recent issue sais Alex's drum solo on this tour was a
"blatant" rip off of Neil's.  I wouldn't go *that* far.  I just saw
the show and the solo.  The last 20% (and the only interesting part)
of Alex's solo did seem *quite* similar to Neil's.  There was the
ostinato, the triggered horn blasts, and that whole African feel.

I wonder what some of the drummers think?

Oh yea, the overall concert was good...

Subject: The Chinese Police of Fish Island

While catching up with about a month of unread TMNS's, I noticed that the
misheard lyric thread kept popping up, so I thought I'd add my best (or
is it worst?) cases......
LAKESIDE PARK
ME:	"Midway hawkers, calling China police.....
REAL:    midway hawkers, calling "try your luck with me"
This one is still plauging me, even after seeing the lyric sheet....the
worst part is that I never stopped to think about what I thought I heard...
LIMELIGHT:  there's a line in there talking about "Living in a fish-eye
lens", which I always heard as "Living in a fish island"
As for my best non-Rush mistake: I got "Soup-and-Salad Bar" out of the INXS'
line "Suicide Blonde, go figure
OTHER STUFF:  As a "Congrats, another school year in the books" present, I
got myself the first three albums ($15, new...good deal, says I).....I
wasn't sure what to expect, because of some comments on this forum....
I enjoyed them immensely, especially COS....(I think I like it better
than "2112"...sacrilege, I know)
I have to put in a good word for "I Think I'm Going Bald", which has been
savaged in previous TMNS....once you get past the inane 1st verse, and
the repeated title/chorus, I think it's a great message...."even when I'm
grey, I'll still be grey my way"
and one more word for "Didacts and Narpets"....listen to this song as a
Neil Peart drum solo, and it gets a hell of a lot better (ignore the
accessory noises/crap in the background)

Sorry about the length of this one, but thanks for the chance to ramble,

Subject:       lifeson goes solo!

"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation......  ...... Alex
Lifeson has assumed control!"

So begins a very interesting interview in the new May issue of the
British 'Guitarist' magazine. I snatched it down off the shelf on
noticing Alex's name and lo and behold we have Mr. Lifeson in
conversation about all things Rush and solo.
So folks, listening up?

Concerning the solo project, Alex says he has been working on new
material since last autumn (sorry, Fall!) and currently has about
eight songs.
  "Most of it's written and arranged, we'll probably start laying
down tracks in the next couple of weeks."
Referring to collaborations with other artists Alex says that there
is a possibility of working with Les Claypool on a couple of tracks
although he is considering playing everything himself.
The interview moves on to talk about musical direction without
actually giving too much away and Alex says he hasn't given much
thought to the possibility of including vocals.
I don't know when the interview was actually conducted but Alex does
say he's hoping to get the album done by June.

Sounds good so far eh?

They then move on to talk about Rush. According to Alex the original
plan was to get back together around now, but instead they've put it
back to september.
"We are starting to get really,really excited about it . We wanted to
take a long break, because we haven't ever done that. It's been
really important and good for our collective souls to do this,
because we are a lot more enthusiastic about getting back to work. "
"I'd like to see a change of direction next time. Personally I'd like
to hear it much heavier and maybe a little darker. I think there is
room for the guitars to be up front even more. I listened to
Counterparts the other night for the first time in almost a year and
there a lot of holes in it for me. There wre many places where I
thought the songwriting could have been stronger. I wasn't very happy
with that record, but I was glad to hear the guitar up front, rather
than have that mix of keyboard and guitar. I just want to stand out a
bit more, not only in the mix and the overall feel of the record, but
in my playing as well. I think I need to work harder................
I just think there's room for me to make the guitar sound more
interesting."
It then goes on to talk about playing live and Alex's return to
Marshall Amps. He also says he'd like to record the next album live
in the studio, as a band ,rather than everybody doing their tracks
seperately.
The final topic is the bands choice of material to play live.
"We all have different opinions; I'd like to do a little more of the
older material, Neil tends to lean towards doing the more current
stuff and Ged is somewhere in the middle."
He goes on to particularly mention Cygnus X1 and AFarewell to Kings.
"Theyre the kind of songs that I'd like to bring back in, songs that
we haven't played since 1980. I think with a 1995 approach to them
they would be really quite powerful, certainly more powerful than
they were back then."

Finally to prove that we Brits are justified in complaining,
"I know that there are some really die-hard Rush fans in Britain
especially. To be honest with you, I feel very guilty about not
coming over and playing more often"

Thats a quick blast of the main points. I hope most of you find it
interesting. It's certainly a worthwhile interview to get hold of. I
don't know if the magazine is available in North America though.
I think we can assume the Rush machine is coming back to life!

Cheers for now,
                           Dave.

Subject: King's X and Alex

Hi all!

Sometime back, I said:
>> Obligatory RUSH: King's X is very RUSH influenced, especially the bass
>> sound
>> and the guitar work.

And James from Toronto replied:
>Apparently the band resent being constantly compared to Rush. They are not
>"very RUSH influenced" although their music has many of the same sort of
>qualities, which makes them appealing to many Rush fans. I doubt they will
>ever open for Rush, although Neil has said (can't remember where) that he
>did think they were a good band and they are managed by Ray Daniels at SRO
>here in Toronto.

In the spirit of debate, and not intending to flame, I will attempt to
back up my assertion:
8-)
(BTW, I envy you very much living in Toronto.  Great city - go Leafs!)

I am still convinced that at least Ty (guitar) has been influenced by
Alex in a lot
of ways, along with Indian music.  I'll concede on the bass, though.

Why do I say this?  Because, as a guitarist who greatly admires both
guys, their chord structures and approach are so much alike.  Alex was
the first guy I
heard use a lot of chorus and open strings to fill out his sound and make
things
bigger.  It's difficult to explain, but easy to show someone on the
guitar.  Alex a lot
of times will pick one or two open strings (usually G and B) and use a
sequence
of chords that leaves those strings open; he then arppegiates (sp?) the
chords and makes
sure to hit those strings.  It gives kind of a drone effect - the middle
of Trees, chorus
on Tom Sawyer, and chorus on Subdivisions are all examples of this
technique.  It's actually
pretty simple once you know how it's done.  This was the key to Alex's
rhythm style for
me.  Once I figured this out I could play 90% of PW, Hemispheres, and MP.
(Yes, I was
a hardcore Alex freak - even played Tom Sawyer at the high school talent
show).

Ty from King's X uses a variation of this: he tunes his low E to D and
uses the D and G strings
as the pedal points.  Other than that, it's virtually the same trick.  It
pops up a lot on
Gretchen goes to Nebraska (verse section of Mission, for example) and
here and there
throughout their work.  Same technique, same effect: it fills out the
band and makes
the guitar sound bigger.

This is a proof by induction, but the only way IMO Ty could have copped
something so
close without studying Alex is if there is a common ancestor that they
both were influenced by.
If such a Missing Link exists, I am unaware of it (but always looking to
expand my horizons).

Speaking of missing links, anybody ever hear the King Crimson album Red?
I believe it was recorded in 1974 (I have a tape of it, so I'm not sure).
 Bill Bruford
plays drums like a 16 tentacled octopus, and executes several drum fills
that show up
in Rush tunes almost verbatim years later!  There's also some very
Neil-like playing on
King Crimson's Discipline (around 1981?).  I can heartily recommend both
of these to Rush
fans.  Red has John Wetton (later of Asia) on bass and vocals, and the
bass on the album is actually
quite good.  Discipline features the AWESOME Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel)
on Chapman
stick and bass, and Adrian Belew on guitar and vocals.  The
Discipline-era incarnation of
Crimson was Les Claypool's blueprint for Primus (although I think Crimson
does it much better).

Sorry for the length, and as I stated in the opening, this is not a flame
but an exchange of opinions
and information.  Let's keep it civilized, folks!

Hi again:

Scott said an issue or so back:

>don't think it's childish to debate this, in fact I enjoy it.  If you

Cool!  Me too......

We got stuck with Primus.  Liked 'em, but Eric's better.  Steve Morse or
Gary Moore would have to be my choices for opening bands I wish I'd seen.

>pheonominal.  Ah Via Musicom is perfect from start to finish, and he
>doesn't dub in extra guitar parts. Everything is done on one take with one
>guitar!  He has about 10 more years to go though before he can be held at

This isn't entirely correct.  What you hear as one guitar part is
actually a series
of takes comped together to sound like one part.  From what I remember,
Eric
wanted to get it all in one take live but wasn't happy with it, so he
ended up
overdubbing a bunch of stuff anyway.  On High Landrons, right at the end
when the
guitar is soloing, you can hear the guitar tone change drastically right
in the
middle of a line.  This is where a "punch" was done to edit two different
parts
together.  Eric is such a perfectionist in the studio it's a wonder he
gets anything
recorded........

Anyone know when a new album from Eric will be released?  You can Email
me
if you'd prefer.

Subject: NMS Stats!  Finally!

Well folks, here it is!!   The results of the First Annual  Unofficial
NMS Stats list!

Sorry it has taken so looooonnnnngggg,  but work has been REAL crazy lately.

I'm proud to say that I have gathered data from all over the world to
include within this list.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank
all those who were kind enough to send in their data so that we could
get as accurate account of the readers of the NMS as possible.

I realize that this list will be biased somewhat due to the fact that
the request only appeared in one NMS and most of the people on this
list have access to a computer.  (Duuuhh)  This still should have
some interesting information for those of you out there who are
interested.

I had 73 responses that made it into the spreadsheet with only 4 people
forgetting to put the word Jobs in the subject of the message.  Since the
time that I stopped taking info, I have received an additional 5 entries.
All of these were Computer type people so the list didn't change.  I have
updated the age info, though it changed only marginally.

Finally, a disclaimer...   Now, I am not a statistician, nor do I play one
on TV.  I do realize that 73 person sample does not make an extensive
cross-section of the fans of Rush. Furthermore, since the list goes out to
3500 people, it doesn't really make a good cross section of this list.
But, you have to work with the info you get, so I did.

Also,  since I agreed that these messages would not be used for any reason
other than for the stats, I will post here that if any of you software
engineering types are good C/C++ people who want to live in Atlanta,
Washington DC, St. Louis, or LA, feel free to send me some E-mail.

Within the US :
  This was tough.  I'm not overly smart and did not know how to break up
the US.  I did the best I could so don't hit me.  The East includes places
like Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Northeast covers areas like New York,
Mass. and New Hampshire.  The Mid West covers Arkansas and others, while
the North handles Michigan and Wisconsin.  The Northwest covers Alaska and
Washington state, while the South West covers places like Arizona and New
Mexico.  California takes up most of what I termed the West, while Texas
makes up most of the south.  Sorry if this bothers anyone, but its the best
I can do for now.

        North East :    20%
        North :         18%
        North West :     7%
        Mid West   :    13%
        East :          10%
        West :          11%
        South West :     5%
        South East :     7%
        South :         10%

State Stats :
        The most popular state was California, with 11.5 % of respondents.
Texas followed a close second with roughly 10% of the entries.  Most other
states were singles or doubles with the exception of New York with four
entries, New Jersey, Ohio, and Colorado each with three.
I was the only entry from Georgia!  :-(

Well, that's all I can think of.  If anyone wants any other stats, with
the info that I have available, let me know and I will try to comply.
This has been an interesting experiment.  I wish we could have had a
little more coverage, but that's life.

I want to thank everyone who responded once again, and thanks to all of

Subject: the trees

Well, you know, I've been reading for a few months now and never
submitted my opinion on any thing, so here goes. I know everyone's sick
of reading about the trees, so I'll try to make a point that will allow
most of the readers to still be able to get a good nights sleep. It is
obvious that there are some basic principles involved with this groovy
metaphorical statement we've come to love called "The Trees". There is no
arguement that at some level it is about one group of people's oppression
over another. No argument that the oppression eventually resulted in a
tradgedy for both parties involved. Now, one basic and very notable point
that this song makes is that oppression is bad and therefore people
should not oppress eachother. I think that it is a point that stands on
its own, whether you agree with it or not. You can go off into a lot more
specific theories on what the song is about, but, the fact is it can be
interpreted many different ways. I say, no matter what the song means to
you, Neil has satisfactorally made another brilliant point in life, and
now it's time to stop arguing about it fruitlessly (is that a word?) and
just sit back and enjoy this great song.
Sorry for spouting off, I just wanted to get my two cents in. Please,
just enjoy The Trees and let it affect you as it does.

My 2 cents worth about the post on 5/2/95..  Rush uses sequencers as
everyone knows.. OK.. Big deal.. This isn't like rap where they sample
someones stuff ( like EVH's Jamies crying, and loop it over and over and
make millions$$)...  Rush uses technology as a lets say a virtual fourth 
member..  They still got to program it.. Still got to learn it,  still got to 
learn to play *exactly* with it, cause computers ( in most cases ) don't 
screw up, they just do what you tell them to do..   I play guitar and keyboards 
myself, and sequence myself, just due to that is the only "band" I have 
time to play with anymore.. It amazes me that they have so many ways of 
triggering the sequnces live.. One Geddy might do, Alex with his feet the 
next... I would LOVE to see the MIDI interconnections to see how they do 
this..  I find it simply amazing!

Fellow rushheads,

aaron wrote:
>Anyone know why Neil chose Paul Simon to refer to here?
Well, Neil discusses the reason in a Cream interview kindly available on the
wwweb (http://syrinx.umd.edu/rush/HTML/articles/creem82.html)  His answer is
that it takes a sense of humor to understand the parody.  Don't read the
article if you don't want to have high blood pressure though since the article
is written by a loser that didn't like RUSH at all.  Anyway, Neil doesn't
explain it much better than that but the connection as I see it is clear:  The
"Sound of Silence" was played in the movie "The Graduate" about coming of age
and selling out one's ideals for profit.  This is what SoR is all about, only
with respect to musicians and bands.  In the interview Neil notes that Paul
McCartney doesn't have artistic integrity since in the later 70's he began to
write and play songs that play well on the radio and make a lot of money but
didn't advance the state of the art like the Beetles did in the 60's.  "But
glittering prizes and endless compromises shatter the illusion of integrity" .
 Radio promises a wonderful gift of art since the airwaves are free and you
can choose to listen to what ever you want to.  But, the fact that salesmen
get involved with selling music leads to artistic compromise if the artist
listens to the salesman's advice about how the music should sound, instead of
making the music sound as he the artist wants it to sound.   Neil is pleading
for the Music world to live up to the  natural and free spirit of radio by
playing music that is free from commercial intent.  This is the essence of
SoR.

Subject: Picking on Geddy

There seems to be some ongoing confusion about Geddy's
use of picks.  To clear all speculation...up until
Counterparts, it is true that Gedd avoided picks except
during double-neck situations where he was playing
guitar.  On CP, however, he DOES use a pick for bass
on a number of songs (Animate being perhaps the most
obvious...just listen to the attack and tone of the
notes; though it must be noted that he does use his
fingernails to simulate that quality in his playing
at times, this time it really is a pick).  To support
this theory, all one needs do is track down a CP video
boot and watch.  I have two such boots, and except for
Obi Wan telling Luke that his eyes can deceive him, there
can be no question.  Now to add some additional
speculatory material here...does anyone have any ideas
as to the validity of the rumor that there is a CP video
due out around August (a legitimate video...not a boot).
A local freebie paper in the area lists upcoming music
and music video releases.  There was no mention of any
live or studio albums, but they listed a live video
from Rush tentatively titled "The Other Parts".  It kinda
sounds Counterpart-ish, but I'm hoping that the other
parts might be some OLDER live stuff that we've not
heard or seen commercially released.

A big greetings to all.  Since I haven't posted in awhile, I thought this
would be a good time for a few reflections.

First - to all of you who are working on the book I can't say much else
	but thank you.  This will be a great gift to them - expressing
	how we as fans feel about their work.

Second - New material.  I should say that I was certainly hoping to see a
         new album this year.  But - if they are choosing to lay off for
	 bit - then that is fine too. After all I do have a bit of their
	 music to tide me over.  One other thing to remember is that Neil
	 was working on the BR project during this time.

	As someone noted here a bit ago - if you think this is hard - try
	being a YES fan.  Besides _Union_ the last album before _Talk_ was
	done in 1987 or so.

Subject: Red Barchettas, TNMS 1087.

<snip>
>Yep, the new Fiat Barchetta is definitely available in RED

Of course, remember that Ferarri also made a "Barchetta" - means Little
Boat I think.  There is a review of them in an issue of Cavalino (a purely
Ferarri mag) from a couple of years ago.  Anyone know what the _actual_ make
was that is described - Ferarri, Aston, Fiat?

Finally - King Crimson.  I have listened to them "In the Court of the
	  Crimson King."  They are old Brit art rock - like Floyd, YES,
	  and Genesis were/are.  Good stuff if you like that sort of thing.

Well I guess this post is a little late, but for any of you older folk out
there,you might remember this one. Dino? Are you listening, buddy?

CBS had a TV news magazine, back in '86. It was called of all things, "1986".
It was hosted by Connie Chung. During the opening credits, Connie would walk
out and sit on a diamond shaped diaz and the background music was none other
than the musical intro to "Mystic Rythms". They played the whole musical
part, stopping before Ged's vocals started. It was very cool. The show
grabbed my attention immediately. (for obvious reasons.) I used to watch the
show every week. It went off the air in a few months. It was funny though,
they never listed the song in the closing credits. Also during the last few
shows, they switched from playing Rush during the opening, to a different
tune. Maybe they didn't get the proper legal permission to play "Mystic
Rythms" in the first place.

So...does anyone else remember this, or did I just dream it all?

Rush on....

15" just to his left.
        snare tightness depends on lots of things. for the ultimate crisp
sound, a 13" piccolo is your best bet.  I use a 14"/5.5", which can
certainly be tuned "tightly."  To avoid buying a new snare, try different
heads, a different strainer, or just fiddling with tensions. Deeper bass
sounds can be achieved either with deeper drums or muffling. Again, I use a
standard 16/22 bass, but use a pinstripe batter and ebony front side with a
fair amount of muffling to get a great low thump.
        by the way, the toms are pretty much standard, ranging from 6" down
to the tymp/bass which i believe is 20".
        The key to a neil sound is not the drums. it's the tuning. using
the right heads (remo clear ambassador batters w/ ebony ambassadors on the
bottom work really well) at well-spaced pitches is the secret. hope this
helps a little.

Subject: guy with keyboards on stage

In response to the question about a guy on the sound wing with a
"keyboard"...  The only person who would be on the sound wing would be
the monitor engineer or drum/guitar techs.  All lighting, house sound,
and pyrotechnics are controlled from front of house because that is
where the effects are centered.  I suppose from a certain angle the
sound board could appear to be a keyboard, but the dimensions would be
totally off.  Rush typically uses Yamaha PM-4000's customized for their
shows.  In the front of house, one set would be used to record for live
albums and one for the actual house sound.  Im not sure what they were
using as a monitor console, but judging from the number of inputs that
they need to do house, they would need at least as many to for monitor
mixing and I'd guess around 50 or 60 inputs.  Neil's drum set must use
at least 35.  Im not sure who or what you saw, but to mistake the
monitor engineer for an offstage keyboardist is kinda wacked.  Unless he
was playing a 6 foot long keyboard...

Subject: Alex Interview Reveals All !!!
Date: Thu, 4 May 95 9:20:52 BST

        May's issue of Guitarist magazine has got an interview with Alex
Lifeson in it.  Here's some of the highlites.....

        There are about 10 songs ready for his solo album, he wants about 12
or 13 to choose from before it's released.  It's going to encompass a range of
styles but the guitars should be a bit heavier than on recent Rush material.

        The boyz are still writing new material individually and hope to have
about half an album worth of ideas by the time they get together in the
summer.  Possible release in September.

        Alex also mentioned a lot about digging out some old tapes of the
Hammersmith Odeon shows from the early 80's with live perfomances of Cygnus X1
and AFTK on them.  Possible live album ?  He seems very eager to tour on the
old material again.

        Although he couldn't speak for the rest of the group, Alex says he

Interesting little aside in the british magazine Q. In the section called
'Labatt's guide to canadian rockers', Rush were described as
'Ambassadorial right wingers'. Maybe they were referring to 'Red Tide' :-)

	Anyway - right wingers...to explain, anyone with politics slightly more
right wing than karl marx is described as right wing here, so I shouldn't worry
too much about it.

	In response to Art Blevins in #1091 :
>IF the boys want to take some time off, fine.  I understand the need for
>down time.  BUT, the boys should also recognize the musical appetites of
>their fans.   IMHO - this would be the perfect time for Rush to release
>a live BOX along the lines of Metallica's Live Binge and Purge box

	Yeah! cool idea...I've seen a few bootlegs of the last tour kicking
around, but never bought them for two reasons :
	(1) I didn't have enough money
	(2) I wasn't overly sure of the quality..
	So, A new live set of all of the classics plus the new songs IMHO would
be ace!

enough of my mad ramblings!
catch y'all later!
