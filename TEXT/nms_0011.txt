 What exactly is Stellar Dynamics ? Sorry if this has been covered before or
is irritating , but I'm stumped and would like to know more about it.

I have heard from a couple of friends that the PRESTO CD available at the
BMG CD Club is not the best available in the market. It seems there is silence of about 3-4 seconds in Superconductor. If anybody else has had this problem, do let me know, since I wish to order it.
I'd rather listen to my tape than buy a screwed up RUSH CD.
Thanks in advance.

        Greetings RUSHans -

People,...  I'm more than a little dismayed at some things here.  Basically,
this:  the 'List, the RUSH Mailing List has turned into a forum for
administrative matters.    I know, that this is ALSO an administrative matter,
but this needs to be done..

The way I see it, the 'List is to express ideas/opinions, etc. about the music,
not the 'List.  I can understand another argument.

                "But, the 'List members should hear about these
                        ideas of the Gods!"

I'm sure that if there are any good ideas presented to our faithful Manager, he
(it IS a he, right? :) will be more than happy to post a little blurb in the
opening!  If not that, he could e-mail you and get back to you to gab about it.

[ I confess I'm a bit confused as to what you're referring to here.  I
  checked through several back issues of the Digest, and the only thing 
  I could find which might fit your description was the invitation by Jeff 
  to keep an archive of the list mailings.  This would be a welcome addition 
  to the Digest (especially if *I* don't have to administer it also :-) ), 
  and he specifically requested comments via e-mail, not to the list.  If 
  you are referring to something else, I must've missed/forgotten it.  Re-
  member, I peruse all postings before I send out the digest, so most of the 
  true administrivia will be removed before you see it...
                                                                 :rush-mgr ]

This was just one guys' opinion (hopefully there are some agreements out there)

This was the LAST administrative that I shall post.  You can take it or leave
it..........
