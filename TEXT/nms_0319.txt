Hi all!

Well, I've called 98 Rock twice since midnight of the 14th.  My
conversations (!):

10:00 am August 15 --

	"Hi, 98 Rock!"

	"Hi!  I was wondering if you guys had the new Rush album?"

	(very softly)  "Sure do."

	"Oh, great!"

	LONG PAUSE

	"Soooo, are you gonna play it?"

	(laughs)  "Well, I would think so!"

	"O.k. great!  I'll be listening!"  (&lt;-- my hint...)

After not hearing a single song, nor mention of the album:

3:00 pm August 15 --

	"Hi, 98 Rock!"

	"Hi!  I was wondering if you guys had the new Rush album?"

	"The new Rush album."

	"Yeah.  The new Rush album."

	"Uh, I don't think so; I haven't seen it, but I'll check..."
	(rustle, rustle, shuffle, shuffle, search, search)
	"Well, I don't see it, but it may be in the main office."  (or
	something like that...)
	"Why, do *you* have it?"     (ha! don't I wish...)

	"Uh, no, but I was just wondering if you guys had gotten it
	yet.  Some stations on the mainland are playing it already."

	"Oh, well, we haven't received it yet.  But if there's
	anything good on it, we will play it."

	"O.k., well thanx a lot.  Bye."   IF THERE'S ANYTHING GOOD ON
	IT!!!  IF THERE'S ANYTHNG GOOD ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!  Whaddya
	Mean?!!!!!!  Of COURSE there's something good on it!!!!!!!
	It's a GIVEN...!!!!!!!!
But he *was* rather nice about it...

At any rate, that's the Island Update for you in this part of the
West.  I wouldn't ordinarily have put the transcriptions on, but it
seemed the best way to get the point across.  I think I'll try again
tonight.  Of course, I'm probably the only person calling them asking
about this and they're going to realize it's me and they'll *give* me
the album for free just to shut me up... Hey, not a bad idea...

I got the new issue of Modern Drummer in the mail today, and they are
advertising a tape with a whole bunch of stuff that originally appeared
as Sound Supplements in the magazine, including "Pieces of Eight."
This could be a chance to get a copy of it that isn't a copy of a
tape dubbed from a flimsly little flexidisc that was mailed across
the country.

The cost: $19.95 plus $1.50 S&H

Well Backwards Buffalo Radio Stations (well so far 1 station) have finally
played a track off of RTB...  I was on my way home from work and the DJ on
103.3 WUFX in Buffalo says "I got the new one from Rush coming up"... so I
floored it to get home and pop a tape in my tape deck...  he played Wheres My
Thing...  my reaction... AWESOME TUNE!  To me it sounds very jazzy, very
uptempo...  if this any indication of what the album is to be like we are
definetely in for a treat!

So what if school starts September 3rd... at least after classes I can go Roll

        Well I too talked to KOME again, on the morning shift and for two
days in a row he told me that they should have the single on Thurs or Fri
of this week.
        This was about the 5th time they had changed their minds.  I
really don't blame them but find that Atlantic is at fault.  Cummon
Atlantic, get a clue!

        Now for the twist!  On the afternoon of the first day I called I
decided to call back and talk to Loose Lewis, and we had a conversation
that went like this.

  The call was made monday the 19th

 D: "Hey you guys playing the new Rush single yet"
LL: "Should have it tomorrow afternoon"
 D: "Well someone this morning said Thurs or Fri."
LL: "Well things are all fucked up and we should have it then"
 D: "Yeah I know what you mean, I talked to KSJO and they said that their
     copy had been delayed two weeks, and that the release of the album
     was also delayed, but I guess that's not entirely true."
LL: "Well it seems that some stations on the East coast got a hold of
     illegal copies, so Atlantic put out a ceast and dissist order on
     I think they are just waiting to clear the airwaves for an official
     release."
 D: "So when you play it will it be a big deal?"
LL: "Oh yeah!  Actually if we get it in, which we should, I will do an
     entire Rush block around it tomorrow night (Tues) around seven."
 D: "Rock on!  Yeah I have heard about all this east coast stuff from a
     disscussion group I'm a part of on a computer net."
LL: "Well it's just bad that all this ilegal stuff had to happen to a
     band like Rush. They are so easy to work with and very
     accomodating."
 D: "Well thanks and I'll be listening."

  Well for some reason I still do not expect to hear it today.  And I no
longer rely on reports like "We WILL have it on friday", let's hope that
Lewis knows something we don't!"

  I'm also upset a Tower Records.  They have no listing of the new album
on their upcomming new release chart, but they have other alternative
bands.  Ain't it great when little alternative companies have better PR
departments than Atlantic!  I wonder what the boys would say to all of
this!?

  Well I must go now, but I will post the letter that Sean, Matt and I
received from The B-Man, quite interesting!

Subject: New Rush single: Where's my thing?

I heard the new Rush for the first time today on KGON (Portland, OR)
and it was "Where's my thing?"
Maybe the radio stations won't be able to figure out which song is
the first single, and they'll just keep playing different songs off
the album!

If they're playing the new Rush out here, it must be available everywhere
by now.

Subject: Playing dreamline.voc on a PC - here's how!

Having problems playing the dreamline sample from syrinx?  Hope this helps.

If you're working with dreamline.au, go back and get dreamline.voc
instead, it was just posted there and should work a lot better.  The .au file
is for Sparcs and NeXT's, the .voc is for the SoundBlaster..  The
conversion utility I had to change .au to .voc bombed when I tried..
(Obviously it can be done, but it's easier just to re-ftp the .voc
file :-)

2400 baud modem folks, sorry, it dosen't compress much..  Unix
compress only makes it bigger, and PKZIP shrinks the 2.2 meg file to
a 2.0 meg file..  Unless you have 2.8meg floppies, or your PC is
hooked directly into Internet, you're out of luck, as far as hearing
the ENTIRE song goes...  Call Waiting folks, do the download at
night, or dial *70 (on Bell, 70# on GTE if you have the option) before
calling to make the download..  It took me about 40 minutes on my 9600
bps modem to download the thing.

Anyway, once you have it on your machine, the program you want to use
is VPLAY, which came with your SoundBlaster.  If it dosen't work
(mine complained about 'wrong file type') run VOC-HDR on it, giving
it a new name..  Use 8192 for the sampling rate and 8 bits for the
bit count, when asked..  Then try VPLAY on the new file, and voila!
Bill and Ted would say the song is most excellent.  &lt;grin&gt;

If you don't have a soundblaster, you can still play it on the internal
PC speaker (ick yuck gaaaaag...)  Look for remac, replay, or sounder
(for Windows) or something similar that plays Macintosh samples - the
sampling rate is 8192, and the .voc file plays directly as a Mac
sample, without any conversion.  (Yes Macintosh folks, if you can get
your sound player set to 8192 hz, you can run the .voc file on it)

Still stuck?  Email me and I'll try to help...

     I am still pondering the idea of rush having a rap section.  I know
that some of you have heard it (  I am not sure of his name but the guy
who is going to do an interview with Geddy is one of them)   I remember
that he said he liked it but what was it??   I heard that it is a low,
processed voice  " Thats Nice "   am I right???!!!??

Subject: Asian copies of our favorite Doodz...

    Yahey to everybody out in Net-Land! I've just come upon some shocking
    news! You all may be familiar with the widespread practice of making
    copies of music/books/software, in certain Asian countries... Well, I've
    just come upon a strange discovery! While browsing in an independant
    music store round the Chicagoland area I found a tape by a group called
    RASH, entitled 1221!! According to the liner notes, the members of this
    Hong Kong-based trio are Geddy "Bruce" Li, Alex Chung, and Patster Choy!!!
    Please show your support for the Boyz by ignoring this blatant attempt to
    finagle RUSH fans, and only listen to the Real Thing(tm)! ;p

    Actually, all I *really* found was a cassette recording of 2112, created
    overseas by Mercury Int'l-Korea! It appears to be a legit copy, sounds
    good, and has both English and Korean print. For some strange reason
    however, the red star is conspicuously absent from the cover picture...
    Just wondering if anybody else has run across any other neat imported
    items such as this..? (ahem)... Patster, perhaps?? :) Talk at ch'all
    later, and keep Rolling them Bones...

Subject: Dreamline; the Altar Boys

From: dougo@soda.berkeley.edu

Finally heard Dreamline on the radio.  (I had been listening to it on my
Sparc before...)  I like it even better now that I can hear the bass!

I definitely think it sounds more like GUP-era Rush than anything else.  It
has that "wall of sound" quality that I loved about GUP.  I'm very impressed
with its speed and energy (compared to the last three albums especially),
and Geddy sings in a very low register (for him), which gives it a darker
feel.  I'm very excited about the new album, especially after reading Neil's
exuberant preview.  After the disappointment of _Metallica_, I need a
picker-upper...

On to more esoteric issues:

A while ago (I think it was on Rockline), Geddy mentioned that he was
producing a band called the Altar Boys.  Anybody know about this?  Are they
any good?  I may have my info wrong, it's been a while.

Thanks,
DougO

        Well they finally did it, they played Dreamline the first time at
seven o'clock on tuesday, and the second time on the nine most wanted at
nine.  The cool thing about the second time that they played it is that I
had called in and said "Hey can you play the new one from Rush?", he said
"How about right now."  He told me he would play it in 20 mins.  They ran
those tow lines before the song, yup I was on the radio requesting
Dreamline, it was fun, some of you may have heard it.
        My thoughts about the song very, but are overwealmingly positive.
 I was actually expecting something a little more Presto, but the more I
listen to it it reminds me of three things, Presto, the crispness of it,
Power Windows, the level of the keyboards, reminds me of Manhattan
Project a little bit.  But it is really difficult to pin it to any
specific album or style.  I think it sounds new, and that is the way it
should sound.  If anything it sounds like Presto but fuller in sound, if
you understand what I mean, more complete.
        One thing I was wondering about specifically was the about of
keyboards (sorry amount instead of about) on the single.  I would say it
sound like a little more then Presto but much less sequencing than say
HYF or PoW.  Actually I think the keyboards could have shoone through a
lowder on Show Don't Tell, there are some killer arrangements in that
one.
        The way the bass kicks in in this song and the intro is cool.
But it would be cool to hear it and the guitar a little better in the
actual body of the song.  I sould still wait to hold judgement until I
can hear the CD.
        I also was praying that the song would not fade out and would
instead end strongly at a good cut off point, and it did just that!
That's how a power cut should end!
        Well overall I really like it, a somewhat new good sound, and I
love some of the imagry in the lyrics, I still want to hear Alex better.
The more I hear it the more it seems like it has been a part of the Rush
collection this entire time.  But it also pushes Presto back into
history, it is no longer the new album, finally the bones will roll!

        Well enough about that (actually not enough but..) The following
is the letter from the B-Man that Sean had mentioned before, it was send
on a sheet of paper with zeroxed tickets and passes on it, very cool.
The first section was typed, almost form, the second section was very
specific to us and was hand written.

        Dear Dan Matt + Sean,

        Sorry it has taken a long time to get back to you, but work must
come first.  I just finished up the first phase of my next book project,
a dateline of Rush's entire career.  IT only took three years to complete
and should be available in the next year.
        NEW RUSH!!! NEW RUSH!!! NEW RUSH!!! NEW RUSH!!! NEW RUSH!!!

        The new album _Roll_the_Bones_, should be in stores September
3rd.  It is awesome RUSH!  I love it! Ten new songs including "Dreamline"
which is the advanced radio track.  You will be able to hear it about
August 20th on a radio station near you!  The album is along the lines of
_Presto_with Rupert Hine producing once again, however this record is
better because it seems more cohesive!  Yes fellow fans there is an
instumental on the record entitled "Where's my Thing?" (Part 4 of the
Gangster of Boats Trilogy). Let me tell ya, Lee, Lifeson and Peart wail!
        NEW TOUR!!! NEW TOUR!!! NEW TOUR!!! NEW TOUR!!! NEW TOUR!!!

        Yes that's right fowlks!  The band will embark on a world tour,
which will start Pctober 25th in Hamilton, Ontario.  The opening leg of
the tour will see RUSH preforming across stages in the Northeastern part
of North America! See ya there!

                All the best,

        (the following concerned a request for help with a fanzine!)

        It's a great idea, but there is already a good fanzine out.  "The
Spirit of Rush". Don't use any photos from by book, my publisher will sue
you... sorry.  I would love to take part in an issue, but I am really
busy working on my next book.  I have a week off now, and can just barely
catch up on my mail.  My friend Ray Warzniak runs the fanzine in the US.
I'll give you his address. So you can see what they've done.  Tehy have
been doing it for a couple of years and it's gotten quite good.  See ya
in Oakland.  How about dem A's!

        I'm excited!  While riding home yesterday, I flipped to WVBR (93.5
in Ithaca, NY) and within one note, I *knew* I was in luck.  At first, I
thought it was the intro to Dreamline, but after a few phrases, I figured
out it was _Where's_My_Thing?_!!!!!  AWESOME!!!  I loved it!  Tonight, I
called the station and spoke w/ the night DJ.  She told me that they've got
both Dreamline *and* Where's my Thing?.  She just played Where's my Thing?
for me again! (she'd already played Dreamline)

        WMT is mostly in 4/4, tho' it does vary a bit.  Geddy kicks butt!
Drums are good, but I wasn't really impressed w/ the guitar.  The song
flows together nicely and seems kinda "uplifting".  Much more laid back
than YYZ (a personal fav) or La Villa  (my all-time fav).  There is one
repeated section (verse?) which is kinda heavy and is quite funky (the bass
reminded me of Force 10).  All and all, an awesome song!  Exactly the kind
of instrumental I'd have expected from the "modern Rush". Hope you all get
to hear it soon.  I can't wait for the 3rd!

        Would someone be so kind as to e-mail me the list of other
"fan-clubs" that are out there (ie. Yes, Genesis, King Crimson -- if they
exist).  Thanks in advance!

        In case anyone's interested, here are some other favourites...

Observations & -- Billy Cobham (a drummers dream)
Gradually Going Tornado -- Bruford (another drummers dream)
Music for Piano & Drums -- Moraz/Bruford (Wow!)

Hi,

   For the last two weeks or so NMS has been filled with postings which
all   say approximately the same thing in approximately the same way. It
seems that their are two distinct camps, those that have heard Dreamline,
and those that haven't. Having read all these postings, I've found that
it would be easier and quicker if subsequent postings along these lines
could be standardised using the following pair of stencils. These
handy 'cut-out-and-keep' stencils are easy to use. If you *have* heard
Dreamline (or any other Rush song off RTB) then fill in and post stencil
A. If you *haven't heard it yet, use stencil B. Enjoy :-)
--------------------------

    --- Stencil A-----

   Wow! I heard Dreamline (or insert name of other RTB song here) today!
It was totally awesome! I couldn't believe it. I was just sitting there
in my car/in the bath/on the toilet (delete as appropriate)
listening to the radio when the DJ said "And now a treat for all you
Rush fans. Here's a song off the new Rush album"...and he then played
Dreamline (or insert previous song title). It just blew me away! I've
actually heard new Rush! I taped it off the radio & have played it
non-stop ever since. It is the best song I've ever heardin my
entire life, ever, honest! I simply can't wait till Sept 3rd.

  I can't believe it! I still haven't heard Dreamline yet!
I am soooo jealous of you guys that have heard it. I rang up
my local radio station **** (insert name of radio station, KOME, KRAP,
WANK, etc), and the conversation went something like:

  "Hi, are you going to play the new Rush single"

  "Never heard of it"

  "You know, Dreamline?"

  "Oh that...yeah we've got it. I think it's at the bottom of a pile
of dirty laundry locked in a closet in the bathroom"

  "So are you going to play it?"

  "No can do. The record company won't let us play it till (insert
date here)"

  "But what about the radio stations on the East/West coast (delete as
appropriate) who are playing it illegally?"

  "Um...er...they're breaking the law"

  "Bummer. Bye"

  "Bye"

So I still haven't heard Dreamline!

  eliminate the verbatim transcriptions with radio DJ's, Atlantic execs,

  We're running 20K-30K per issue as it is...  Thank you for your support.

    Well, I just heard "Dreamline" on WAAF in Boston.
    They said something like "we're finally allowed to
    play it...". Sounded pretty good.

    If this is being released to mostly metal stations
    does this mean the video could be on 'headbangers ball'

Que pasa amigos?  For those who haven't heard, I am trying to organize
a Balt/D.C. are RUSH party, sort of to celebrate the new album.  The date that
sounds good to all the people I've talked to is the 21st of September.  The
only thing is that now we may not have a house.  The guy who might have been
able to is going to be out of town (which means we lose a few musicians also).
Unless we get another house, I *may* be able to talk my house mates into 
letting us host it (big maybe though).  And that's the story.

To keep this from going over the NMS, please post me, Rio, at the above address
(dege@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu).  I'll then send out info as it is finalized to those
who've contacted me.  Also I'll post again in Sept. so those just returning to
school will know.  Hope to have a bitchin' party, and SEEYAS!!

Hey all

I just recently got most of the lyrics to Zep albums on that mailing
list. (Hi Ron R...noticed that you were on this list too!) Reminding
me that I do not have the lyrics to RUSH, FBN, and CoS. Is there a place
for a VMS poster to get these lyrics? I have the Arhives albums instead
of the originals, so no lyrics!

Oh yeah....all you people in REAL radio towns, thus hearing new Rush, can

Hi,

Does anybody here know whether the boys are going for a European
tour after Roll The Bones. Since there seem to be some members here sitting
close to the fire, someone might have a clue, eh?

Ok, this is just a lousy excuse to put my non-Rush favs here on the
list:-). I stopped playing Rush lately because I think it will take
a bit (about a month at least) longer here in Holland for RTB to be
available, and I turn more and more jealous when playing Rush. No hope
for a tune on the radio either, I never heard Rush on radio here. Whine,
whine, complain, complain...

Subject: Ahhhhh.....

Finally...  I turned on DC-101 at lunch, and caught Dreamline sneaking into the
middle of a WorkForce Block.  Now I don't feel so left out any more...
First impressions:  It seems to be a bit more top-40'ish than most of their
other songs.  The vocals are more controlled (contained?) than what I'm used
to.  I think it's about average for them.  Hopefully the other cuts are 
better; if tis is the best the album has to offer, I'll be very disappointed.
  Then again, I've been listening to Chronicles for three days straight during
my commute, so I've been caught up in their best.

Subject: RTB - Dreamline and Where's my Thing???

Well, I finally heard both of these songs on 94.1 WHJY (The station everyone
talked about that got in trouble from Atlantic) in Providence.  They played
both songs back to back.   I though Where's my Thing??? was awesome.  Very
funky song.  I love Geddy's bass playing.  I heard it on a cheap boom box,
so couldn't really hear the dynamics (spoiled from CD's on Infinity speakers)
but it sounded great, albeit a little short.  As for Dreamline, I also heard
it today.  I like it, but not as much as I thought.  The lyrics sound very
forced to me.  Neil has his great lines in it, but overall I wasn't thrilled.
Musically I liked it.  A more basic song, less complex, just a lot of energy
and a very good sound.  Oh well, here's to waiting until Sept 3rd!!!

Oh yeah, I guess I should contribute my "Top 10 besides Rush" list...

Hey DC folks,

If anyone here's about when RTB is going to be premiered in DC
(presumably on DC101), please let me know or post it to the
list.  I don't imagine any stations other that 101 will be playing
it.  Rush is a little too established for WHFS (the local 'progressive'
station).

Thanks for the dreamline.au file!  I never even knew my SPARC *had*

Date: Wed, 21 Aug 91 16:28:41 EDT

After requesting _Dreamline_ once an hour for two straight weeks on WBCN and
WAAF and taking a day off from work, I finally heard it! WAAF played it at 
11:15 Wednesday morning, 5 minutes after I called. It went something like this:

- Hello, WAAF!

- Hey, are you guys playing Rush's new single Dreamline yet?

- We sure are!

- Any idea when it's coming up?

- Within the hour!

- Holy shit!!! ( Abrupt disconnection )

As for the song itself, it was well worth waiting for. I could hear lots of
Presto, Signals, and p/g influence in the music, and the lyrics are cool.
Wish I was in Pittsburgh so I could hear other cuts, but I think this will hold
me over (barely) until Sept. 3.

Hi there RUSH fans!
	Well, it's about time.  WMMR (in Philly) FINALLY played "Dreamline"
today.  Unfortunately, I heard it at work so I wasn't able to tape it.
Guess I'll have to hear it tonight when I am at home and next to my
deck!  :-)  It doesn't sound anything like I expected it would.  I have
decided to reserve judgement until I hear it a few more times.  (Besides,
I never like anything the first time I hear it.)  Ged's new Wal does
stand out, though.
	Ken Renard (:-) mentioned hearing about a laser show in Philly.
For the record, I heard about this show on WMMR (while hoping to hear
the single).  As far as I know, the show happened August 9 and/or 10.
There was a show in Jersey and one in Philly, although quite far from
Center City so I didn't go.  It was a laser show with music from many
bands, RUSH included.  (Had it been entirely RUSH, I would have found
a way out to the place!)  The second half of the show featured Pink
Floyd.  So, I think it is over and done with rather than running for
some span of time as is the case with the Laser RUSH in Pittsburgh.
Gee, I am beginning to get the idea that I am living in the wrong city
in PA as far as RUSH is concerned!  :-(  So, that's the news.  Thank you
and "GOOD NIGHT!"

   Well, it finally happened-  96 ROCK debuted "Where's My Thing" yesterday
