Hmm...

Yes.  That's exactly what he's doing.  These people crave attention, and
they love to get a rise out of people.  Something very similar to this 
happened on the Pink Floyd mailing list about a month and a half ago.  I
didn't follow it very closely, but basically there was this guy who poste d 
these completely inane messages of bastardized Floyd lyrics and 
schizophrenic ramblings claiming that he was like Syd Barrett and so on 
and so forth.  It got such a rise out of the whole mailing list that ever y 
single digest consisted entirely of people talking/complaining about this
guy.  For about two weeks there was almost no Pink Floyd related 
material on the list at all!  Well, mission accomplished dude.  He did it for 
attention, and once the all out war began,  he just sat back and laughed,
proud of the emotions he stirred up and probably thinking how easy it is 
to get a rise out of people.  Remember back in grade school there was 
always one kid who acted like a total goofball and annoyed everybody 
with all sorts of crazed antics?  Usually people would respond, either 
positively or negatively, and he/she absolutely loved it.  Do you 
remember what happened when nobody paid attention to it?  It stopped.  

Almost immediately.  As far as I'm concerned this kind of behavior 
isn't even appropriate in grade school, but at least back then there was 
the excuse of immaturity.  The bottom line is, if someone's antics are 
annoying you, ignore them completely.  Once this person doesn't get 
the attention they crave, they will go away, quite quickly I might add.  

Sorry to waste a lot of space with non-Rush content, but that's actually 
the reason for my message, to try and get people back to talking about 
Rush related topics.  If the secret society annoys you, ignore it rather 
than contribute to it.  Once Julien sees that nobody gives a shit, he'll
take his stupid-ass secret society someplace else.

Subject: The Rush SecSoc

Welcome to the Rush Secret Society.

One day in the near future for all of us, we will rise and reawaken to
the Rush Dreams that first inspired us to love the band. However, it's
understandable that not everyone can accept their true Rush guidance and
its path.

What can we do? SecSoc members believe every Rush fan has the power to
tap in to a special force or energy which can help us override any fear
of anti-Rush mentalities we might have.

Take a non-Rush signal for instance, and instead of being immediately
thrown off by it, try and take the time to feel its energy. Don't be
overwhelmed by it, but acknowledge it and then progressively understand
it in order to overcome it.

Rush onward friends from around the beautiful world,

Julien

COS is my favorite early period Rush for "The Fountain of Lamneth" alone
and while I'm not so keen on the recorded version, "By-Tor..." has always
been one of Rush's most fun live songs. I don't care for "I Think I'm Going
Bald" or the other more metal-ish stuff on COS but "Fountain..." more than
makes up for all of it. That album was way ahead of where the public wanted
Rush to be and they wisely backed up a step next with 2112 (in style if not
in form) before returning to more experimental pieces on AFTK. I also think
they had absorbed more ideas and were more ready to become a progressive
group after 2112. I recall Alex talking about how he was influenced by
Steve Hackett on the solo to "No One at the Bridge" which probably caused
some puzzlement to those into his more straight rock stuff.

Christopher John Palo wanted to know...

>What bass did Geddy use on GUP, in particular, "The Body Electric?"

I know he had a Wal around at the time but I'm pretty sure most of that
record is the evil, dreaded Steinberger (boo! hiss!) I was so happy when
Geddy finally ditched it. The current Fender sound is so right for him.

I'd like to apologize to Bill <bkholbert@MCI2000.com> for the smartass
comments I made about his web page address.

Without double-checking, I assumed that since double-clicking on the file
in Eudora brought up "This page does not exist" from home.mci2000.com (and
on only one occasion), that the url was incorrectly listed by Bill.  Nope,
my bad.

Though it *is* a weird looking url.  Again, sorry 'bout that Bill.  I was
wrong.

I committed one of the classic blunders.  Of course one is never engage in

Subject: Rush & Wedding Songs

Friends,

Since I'm getting married next week April 1st. I think the appropriate
band would not be Rush, but the band Ac/Dc, and the wedding song would 
be 'HighWay To Hell'....:>

J/K (wife to be) -- 

If I was to pick a wedding song(s) from Rush the following order is:

#1. Bravado
#2. Presto
#3. Entre Nous
#4. Losing It
#5. Tears

Subject: Re: Caress of Steel

Occasionally, I'll throw in a tape I made of Fountain
of Lamneth.  To me, the song sounds like it comes
from an ancient era.  It's a song that I can't actually
visualize being recorded in a studio for some reason.
The fact that I taped it off vinyl adds to the antiquated
feel - that subtle hissing of the needle at the lead in
of songs is more prevalent in the more spacious and 
quiet sections.  I like the dynamics of the music, too,
as well as the story.

When, I first heard Caress of Steel, it was on this 
cassette I had which had all the songs jumbled up
on it.  All the pieces of the Fountain were mixed in
with songs on side one.  Didacts and Narpets 
followed Bastille Day!  This was actually put out by
some idiot at Polygram. 

So you can imagine, I didn't really get the whole 
effect of the song story-wise as it was intended by 
the band.  Talk about a record company's indifference
and cluelessness about a new band they weren't sure
what to do with.

Subject: this aggression shall not stand

fellow KAR members:

Yes, I had gone AWOL from my post with a case of KAR's beer and was
promptly demoted for it. The reason for my transgression was my
frustration that no-one had heeded my warnings. I thought it would be a
good idea to go on the offensive, but my superiors thought me mad. They
kept saying, "Scott, hold your fire". I hate to say "I told you so".

KAR intelligence has informed me that Julien's SexSock has shown up on
radar accross the Distant Early Warning line. We must come together to
fight this aggression. If we splinter into tiny factions, Julien and his
brother will be victorious. I realize that it is so hard to stay
together passing through revolving doors. While we still have our vital
signs, we must make it our mission, our "Manhattan Project", so to
speak, to topple Julien's SexSock and free the prisoners, who clutch the
wire fence until their fingers bleed.. Come hell or high water I will
hold my position as your newly appointed General. I do not care for the
limelight too much, but it is my duty to rally the troops and coax them
into taking off the kid gloves. This is not a witch hunt, but a war
against Julien's dark forces. We have possession of the sacred "Lost
Book of Cygnus X-1" the only way by which the One can be conjured. If
this sacred text falls into the wrong hands (i.e.- Julien's hands), the
battle of armageddon will soon be upon us. This cannot happen. I guess
I'll be a prime mover in this counteroffensive, but Ike and puanani have
assured full support. 

I will stage a news conference very shortly...

hallo all,

Pete! I can't BELIEVE you! You had a chance to really
get to know the whole band! You blew it bud. Instead
of getting on their good side, they kicked your ass then
shot you. Bummer. Thought you had learned your lesson
in England. ;-)

ok - top ten rush tunes (lyrically speaking):
1. TSOR- lyrics represent "my sentiment exactly" in regard
to the temptations of selling out. I applied this theory to my
personal life long ago and feel I'm a better person for it.
2. Red Barchetta- I love the story line. I feel like I'm in the
car- passing in the wrong lane around a curve at 115 mph!
3. Subdivisions- high school sophomore when Signals hit. I
really identified with this tune. Probably 'cause I didn't fit
into the popular group.
4. Losing It- very tragic, brings a tear. : (
5. Red Sector A- Is this tune fact or fiction? History or a
look at the future? I'm not familiar with any historical reference
to the song title (help). Anyway another tragic story (trend?)
that can play on my emotions.
6. Manhattan Project- Possibly the largest tragedy of all time,
but that's not why I dig the lyrics.  The historical story line is
perfect from the beginning of mankind to the pilot of the Enola Gay.
7. Tai Shan- Because of all the steps and when the clouds are
parted (jacob's ladder!) I expect to see blue skies not landscape and water.
8. The Pass- obvious. Great lyrics, great use of metaphor and
of course "Christ what have you done?"
9. Cold Fire- you don't get a "love song" ("this is Not a love
song, this isn't fantasy land") too often from Neil. I like it.
10. Totem- I too am free to browse among the holy cows!

I was going to include A Passage to Bangkok from my smot
poking days but it got edited. :-o

How about favorite instrumentals? Mine's Leave That Thing
Alone, with La Villa coming in a close second.

later all,

scoots

Subject: No, the *other* Rush

Last Saturday I was at the Arizona & Aerospace air show at Davis-Monthan 
Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, when an older gentleman, I'd guess in 
his early 60s, came up to me to ask me the significance of my shirt. I 
was wearing my white Test For Echo shirt with the cover picture on front 
and the tour stops on the back. I told him it was a concert t-shirt, and 
he replied that he thought it meant something about Rush Limbaugh, but he 
couldn't make the connection. I then explained to him that the shirt was 
for a band called Rush.

Of course, when he said, "Rush Limbaugh" the first thing that popped into 
my head was the picture in the TfE liner notes of the dog with the 
"Rush/Limbo" tag.

I just thought that was kind of funny. It was the first time I've 
directly experienced any Rush confusion with a stranger, though I've read 
about it happening to others here in the pages of the NMS.

By the way, the Canadian Air Force sent a couple CF-18 Hornets to the 
show. One was for a ground display and the other did a aerial 
demonstration, though they cut it short because the US Navy's Blue Angels 
were there, and they also fly the Hornet, so they didn't want to 
duplicate too many moves. I definitely thought of Rush, especially Alex, 
when I saw that. 

Later, David

Wed with Ged. Who first started this wedding song
thread? Mar was it you? I been lurking on it for a while,
but with the introduction of non rush music I've decided
to join the fray. Cold Fire was a must at my reception.
Also for the Zep fans Thank You HAS to be there. Also
Hearts from Yes 90125. My wife's taste in music is total
mainstream pop/top 40 (obvious I didn't fall in love with
her for her taste in music), hell I opted for 2112 Overture
to be substituted for the Wedding March at the Church.
(complete with the "Hey's" from the Congregation!) Any-
way Amey (my partner in life) listened to all three of my
requests with much objectivity and they were there.

Have fun at your wedding and make sure to tell us about it!

They did wipeout at the Detroit show (T4E). Can't remember
if it was first leg at the Palace of Auburn Hills or second leg
at Pine Knob or both. Anybody from Michigan remember?

   [ Many venues have a curfew at 11pm, with a nearly 3-hour show, they
     had to open at 8 or risk going over the curfew (and incurring HEFTY
     fines). Some venues even have a curfew at 10:30pm (esp outdoor venues,

CoS is my favorite album. I don't know if I necessarily agree or not
that it might scare a first time listener away though. I think lyrically
it's pretty good, and instrumentally, maybe Alex's strongest effort.
"Panacea" may be one of the most beautiful songs I have evr heard. While
parts of the album may seem grandiose, I don't mind self-indulgence when
it's so damn good! By far, the greatest rock album of all time(even
though I think TfE is the greatest album of all time, and that
Hemispheres thingie, well, that's pretty good too,hmmm....).

Subject: true Rush sighting!!, personal thoughts on KAR "leader"

Here I am, sitting in my dorm room at 1 in the morning, when a
commercial comes on for a music store called "2112 Percussion."  Just
percussion and it's accessories, no guitars or anythning else.  Me
thinks that Rush's percussion carries real weight with at least part
of the public.  The store is in Raleigh, North Carolina if anyone was
curious.  

To whoever wrote the "Would you want Neil to read your posts" post,
good call.  Julien is going against what Neil's lyrics are about.  In
fact, he reminds me of little kids who make up imaginary friends and
places.  It's fun for a while, but if people don't humor you, then you
come back to the real world.  And the Moral is.....don't humor Julien.

A couple posts per digest, rambling with his own insanity.
It never seem a thread that would ever interest me.
Why would you want to be a part of his Secret Society...?

As the days rolled by, we flamed him a lot,
Everytime he's logging on, I feel the need to groan and nod.

Cause Julien's a Ze-ee-ro.
Wasting all our time, with his utopia
Ze-ee-ro oh.
A fan who's gone fanatic, drowning in myopia.
Ze-ro ho.
Inbred in his delusions, against the rest of us - -
    Is anyone as trying, as this Zero-hoh!

Some people think he's Alex, and others think I'm Neil...
But why would I allow all of this flaming if it's truly real..?
Have you ever seen a Lerxst suffer through such an ordeal
Or spend so many posts as an ignoramic heel..?

If it truly was, the one we hold dear...
He would have called us to the Orbit Room and offered us a beer.

But Julien's a Zero
Filling needless e-mails, with his grand designs.
Zero.
Is the population, with whom he resides.
Zero.
Is the chance in Hades, of his Society.
Zero.
Is the pointless purpose of this parody.

Subject: Phil Collins!/ BYE!

Hello Secret Society,

"Mark D. Ehlke" <ehlkemd@mlc-wels.edu made a good point about Phil
Collins.  I think he's generally omitted on the 'top ten drummer's'
lists and the like because he sort of cheezed out in the past decade -
not that Susudio wasn't a great tune and all, but he just got a little
too Casey Casem on us.

Yet, Mr. Collins is to be lauded as a drummer for two primary reasons:

1)    He does some very, very complex stuff ala Neil, and if you don't
believe me listen to 'In The Cage', or, better yet, watch the thing,
it's on the 'Mama' videotape.

2)    His drums SOUND very, very good, and I know that's largely a
result of producer/audio engineer, but if you listen to the entire tone
and content of his first solo record (the one with 'In the Air
Tonight'), you'll find that the drums had to be designed to sound a
particular way, to get at a particular FEEL that Collins HAD to think of

himself.

That make any sense?

p.s.

You know what?  Over the last year, I've read the NMS a lot, and,
despite the intelligent posts and the funny people, not to mention the
'meaningless' bric-a-brac' that is also very amusing (viz, the wedding
thread), there's too much darn noise here.

The 'secret society' crap, the on-going 'debate' about how Neil must
feel at this stage of life, etc. etc..  It's so annoying that  I've
decided not to recieve the NMS anymore.

I know nobody cares about what *I* decide to do, but I'd just like to
point out that the din of moronic crap is not worth the few kilobytes it
takes up on my harddrive, and that this is simply another example of how
some morons have invaded yet another sector of life by choosing to open
their mouths before bothering to think.  And, it's a shame, since I
thought that, while listening to that really, really cool Rush music,
some of the principles that should nullify that sort of thing might have
leaked in via the really, really, really, really, really cool Rush
IDEAS.

In all honesty, a large cudo to the rush-mgr, whoever he is, for
bothering to do the work of getting it distributed anyway.  Sir, I would
have stopped a long, long time ago, and you are to be lauded.

Everyone I started correspondences with here on the NMS, please stay in
touch.

So long and thanks for all the fish,
Peter A. Geissler

p.p.s.
Anybody who bothers to start a secret society generally does so because
they've already failed at their first attempt at starting a 'secret
society', which is always one involving a hand and other parts of their
body that I shouldn't mention in mixed company.

p.p.p.s.
If you wish to express your discontent with the p.s. sections of this
post, please don't bother.

Subject: Re:non-rush fans

I have been noticing for a long time,as many of you have im sure,that the
general population(that is those who do not like RUSH)have a serious bias
against the band.Case in point-the other day i was talking to a friend of
mine ,I was waering a walkman at the time,and she asked what I was
listening to.I proceeded to tell her RUSH and she almost had a heart
attack.She said,and I quote,How can you listen to such a nerdy group..
I tore into her for this of course ,telling her that her attitude was both
shallow and misinformed,and that in fact Rush is the absolute best band
in the world...her response-Don't you know they are all gay?..at that
point I gave up and considered her a lost cause .I felt not exposing her
to the music of RUSH was punishment enough for her ignorance.

    I always feel that I have awareness of some great secret when it comes
to RUSH's music.Also,i really want to share it with other people.I  can
tell an awfull lot about a person by their response to being exposed to 
RUSH's music.You notice right away that many people won't give them a 
chance,and this really speaks to their close-mindedness.I
,however,continue to this day to seek out people who I think will
understand and appreciate their music.I recently exposed my cousin to
most most of the bands material.He already had some rutamentry knoledge
of the band,ie Tom Sawyer-CTTH,nobody's hero,ect...,he had not really
paid much attantion to the band in general.I knew ,however, that he had
good musical taste(Black Sabbath,Led Zepplin,Soundgarden ect)and perhaps 
more importantly an open mind when it comes to music.I am happy to say
that he is now one of the biggest RUSH fans I know.He has bought all their
cd's in under a year.He said something to me yesterday that I have thought
myself for a long time....RUSH IS ADDICTIVE...the more you listen -the
more you want to listen.Sorry bout the long post but I just wanted to
relay my thought's on that subject.I will end by pose'ing a question

Does anybody else have similar stories involving non-RUSH fans,who either
made very wrong asumptions about the band or were converted to fans as 
result your influence?

play alot in the N.Y./New Jeresy area.I could make it to Conn. no problem 
for any shows they may be scheduling.Do they ever make it to Conn. ? Are 
there other fans from the Northeast that would be interested in seeing them
