Subject: German "Import" MP album

In regards to the message posted about the Moving Pictures album
from West Germany. You have a gem there. Most albums that come
over from Germany, or are imported are usually better quality when it
comes to manufacturing. Simply because there are fewer/deeper grooves
in the vinyl you'll have a better, fuller tone. My friend in Albuquerque bought
the Metallica black album and it was I believe 4 discs total... Like 2 songs per
side! But, it was thick vinyl, and had a great sound. Hang on to that.

Ooops, I goofed.  Paul (greenpd@seraph1.sewanee.edu), you're right about
the last tour in this area (CP Tour).  CandleBox did open for the Boyz.
Primus opened for the Bunnies tour.  Sorry about that, got my tours confused.

Your little side note reminded me of a situation from back in the mid '80s.
At the time I was living in Hope Mills, N. Carolina (just outside of
Fayetteville), there were a couple of bands that did some RUSH covers.  Man,
both bands were awesome.  One of the bands would start with the "Peanut's Gang
Theme," first the keys, then the bass, then the kit, then the GTR... then these
guys would break into "The Spirit of Radio."  These guys also did YYZed,
La Villa, Red Barchetta to name a few.  The other band covered SubDivisions,
the percussionist had a MIDI trigger pad that would kick a sample voice during
the chorus, very tasteful.  Also, these guys did an excellent cover of
Natural Science (All three segments)!!!  Anyhow, the folks that live/lived
in that area could not comprehend the music.  They would sit politely, but
you could tell that they were not into that sort of music.  Oh well, maybe
the RUSH C&W thang will convert those folks.  :->  (Har, Har)
Thanx Paul...

Also, to Chris Pardua - I dug out my old vinyl collection, which contains
an original pressing of Judas Priest's "Sin After Sin."  There is a Simon
Phillip's listed for drums/percussion.  SAS is found on the Columbia label,
recorded back in 1977.  More than likely it is the same guy, after all Simon
has been around for quite a few years and has done many gigs.

Keep an eye out for the new group RUSHOLLICA, they'll make your lawn die... :)

well, I am not all that new, but I will anyways. I got into Rush around
Thanksgiving of 1992, mainly because of a friend that praised them to no
end (I however got him into TNMS... hey Dinesh...). Anyways, he always
told me how good they were, but I never really cared. Yeah, I had heard
_Tom Sawyer_ and a few others on the radio, but I never really listened
because I had friends that always made fun of Rush. Continuing, I finally
heard _New World Man_ and something clicked. The next day, I asked Dinesh
where the song was from, and coincidentally ended up at Zia that night. I
did see Signals, but also saw Chronicles used (in awesome shape) for $6. I
really got into them on our families annual Thanksgiving camping trip,
with alot of time to really listen to stuff. I have only been to one
concert, CP, but I definatly wanna go again
   another really weird note, I also got into the other Rush [Ralph :)]
on that trip, but I still listen to the band...

ummm... yes. I always listen to music whenever I can, and just get into
listening to the music way too much. I could spend less time on stuff,
but I just don't care enough. Just a few minutes ago, I was studying for
a test, and _Leave It_ (Yes) came on the radio. While I did resist the
temptation to blast it (being 2am and all), I did just stop what I was
doing and sit there. Writing an English essay with Counterparts in...

I've read quite a few comments from some RUSH fans in the NMS that feel
hair length and being a RUSH fan go hand in hand.  Excuse me but I have all
their CDs and even quite a few Albums (Remember those vinyl things?) and I
have SHORT SHORT hair.  Besides, Alex and Neil both have fairly short hair

Subject: The usual awards type stuff

Well, once again our dear Rush has not won an award for best instrumental.
To this I say, oh well.  That is because I know that the others who were
nominated are equally as good as Rush.  Floyd's instrumental simply kicks
ass.  There is nothing more to it.  We know how good Rush is, and we
know that they never have been much on the way of awards.  So, while we
can be a bit miffed at the fact that they didn't win, let's not harp on
it too much..after all we are simply preaching to the converted.

Subject: Re: 03/02/95 - The National Midnight Star #1062

Jon mentioned a "Rush-bashing syndrome" that I am quite familiar with.  It
would invariably come from those friends of mine who liked bands with
names like "Snoopy the dog," "Bippity-Bop Crap Music For People With NO
Taste," or "Just Plain Crap." (You mean you've never heard of those bands --
they were very big in the '80's!)

Occasionally, though, I get a similar response from people whose opinions I
actually respect, and this troubles me quite a bit more.  I have gottne
responses such as "Rush has no soul" or "Those guys are so pretentious."
At first such comments just infuriated me, and tended to elicit nothing
more than incoherent rage and violence.  But then I realized that such
a reaction only lends credence to these moron's (oops -- sorry, I slipped)
comments.  So I've thought about this a long time, and here's what I've
come up with:

I think it has something to do with the fact that we are all so completely
consumed by our love of this band that we sometimes lose our objectivity.
I mean, Rush IS just a band (albeit the best band ever), and not everyone
is going to like them.  A diamond shines all the brighter when it's
surrounded by crap.  I think also that sometimes our rabid devotion to this
band scares people just a little -- it tends to induce backlash, similar
to what Deadheads experience (relax! I'm not comparing us to Deadheads,
but we are similarly devoted to our respective bands).

Another thing I've noticed is that this criticism almost always comes from
people only familiar with one particular period, album or song from Rush, and
that they usually don't have any idea Rush wrote "slow songs" or that they
can rap, or that many times they are even funky.  In many cases, what we
need to do is educate these people -- most such negative comments stem
from ignorance, and, contrary to popular belief, most people will learn
if you give them the chance.

Sorry for the length of this, but I am that most deadly of combinations:
An English grad. student/writer/Rush fan/musician, which tends to lead
to verbosity!  (BTW, any flames, please e-mail me direct!)

     I don't remember who posted this, but I understand completely what
he/she means.  I used to be able to study to Rush when I was first getting
into them, but the more I listen to them, the more impossible it is.  I
used to be able to halfway study to everything, then just Rush and COS.
Now I can't even do that.  Oh, well, maybe it's better that way.  That
way I can say that I don't listen to Rush ALL the time.  Just 99.4% of
the time.
     Ditto to the YKYARFW you use only Pert Plus.

       I do this all the time and not just with Rush songs.  If a song
I really like comes on the radio I stop and start singing or
daydreaming.  Unfortunately this also happens with a few songs I don't
like.  Songs I know all the words to because I've heard them so much.

	Are you saying it doesn't start that way??!!  Until you wrote that I
thought it was sung that way!!   Ack!  Fooled all these years.   ;)

   On another note.  Does anyone know if we are going to be able to see
what the Rush book looks like and read it's contents??  I don't
remember if this was covered or not.  It would be really cool to  see
some of the things people said to the band.   We could just take off
the names if anyone was worried about privacy.    Well that's it for me
(for now) I suppose I should go look like I'm working or something.

Subject: Lifeson solo album?

Hello,

I was reading the latest issue of Island Ear, a local entertainment paper, and
something totally took me by surprise.  The following is taken from an
interview with Sebastian Bach (singer of Skid Row):

	As the conversation runs down on the allotted time, I ask Bach if the
	green grass of a solo album beckons?  Solo album, yes, solo career, no.
	"I'm thinkin' about doing a solo album, I just did some recording with
	(ex-Hanoi Rocks') Andy McCoy and I did a song on Alex Lifeson's (Rush
	guitarist) solo album and that was a total honor.  I liked working
	with different people, it was a great experience."

Woah!!  This is the first I've heard of Alex putting out a solo album!  Does
anyone know anything about this?  I suppose this could just be the track Alex
is contributing to that guitar compilation CD, but he did say *solo album.*
With Geddy wanting to be with his family, well, it almost sounds feasible.
Can't wait for more info...

Subject: Re: Opening Bands

Someone was talking about opening bands a while ago, and I just thought
I'd pitch in my 2 cents.

The Melvyns opened for Rush in Sacramento on the Counterparts tour, and
they were the worst act I'd ever seen.  Seeing them gave me sincere hope
that maybe I could open for Rush someday.  I don't know what happened to
Candlebox, does any one else?  Didn't they open for Rush in other cities?

Incidentally, I don't know how good the Melvyns studio albums are,
because I've never been inspired to listen to one.  My point is that
they sucked live.

Subject: 2112, yes or no?

Hey there all--
I was really glad to read Patricia Evans' post about Rush's future music
direction.  It is true that all fans have different tastes or favorite
songs, and Rush cannot possibly please them all in a concert.  It seems
as if the song/album in question was the epic 2112; well as I posted
previously, I love the album and the song, but IMHO the OTHER songs
on the disc make it a winner.  Just goes to show you how we Rush fans are
all different.  Also goes to show you why Rush plays such a wide array of
songs in most concerts, from Cold Fire to YYZ etc.  I also like the point
she made about how Rush is not driven by its fans, rather I admit we follow
Rush because we love their music.  Anyhow, on a lighter note YKYRARF when:
 --you wake up every morning with a different Rush song in your head (happens..)
 --you named your cat Rocinante

Subject: CoS

  During lunch, I finally bought CoS on CD today (I have the tape..so dont
  flame me :-).  I must admit that I was disappointed that  *no* liner
  notes or lyrics (tho I expected not to get the lyrics) came with it :-((
  I was looking at the album cover, wondering what was going on.  I once
  read that some1 felt that it was about the Necromancer.  But IMHO I think
  its about The Fountain.  One of the songs mentioned walking up stairs,
  there are stairs in the lower area of the picture.  The guy in the
  picture looks kinda old too.  I looked at the metallic looking triangular
  object, and tried to match it to a lyric on the album...or to *any* Rush
  album :-)  What came to my mind was:  "The Sign of Eth is rising in the
  air"...I think thats from Bytor..not sure.  I thought of that line
  because the object appears to be moving into the air.  I used the
  thesaurus of MS-Word (version 6.0a for you techies :-)) and looked up
  "Eth", and some of the results were: eternal life, eternalize,
  eternity...which fits theme of The Fountain quite well.  Therefore  the
  old man had a brief touch (caress) of eternity (steel, or the sign of Eth
  in this case) which startled him as it rose.  Any opinions? :-)

  One more thing, why isn't the song "I think I'm going bald" on the
  Fountain...for its a part of life..that is for most men :-)  I thought
  the audio tape was in that order due to time constraints on the tape
  sides.

Please forgive me (that was NOT a reference to another Canadian artist!).

Just a few random thoughts/responses...

Andy Logue asked...

>p.s. Am I the only one that thinks 'Before and After' from the first album

	No, I think it's probably the best track on the album.  Sorry, it's
	just not my favorite album.  I don't think I even have one!  They're
	all good for different reasons, even the less popular ones, such as
	_Caress of Steel_.

Dino the hog-loving dinosaur noted...

>If you don't like a particular band, either do something (like go to the
>concession stand) during their set, or don't go to the show at all.

	Amen, brother!  I'm a little older than the average concert goer (with
	the gap widening as we speak!  :-))  The one annoying concert I
	remember most is when I saw Boston in 1987, either in Worcester or
	Hartford, and I was lucky enough to be seated in front of a gaggle (or
	whatever you call it) of 13-year-old girls who saw fit to shriek every
	time they recognized a song, then sing along in that shrill voice that
	I'm sure everyone can picture in their heads.  Not the best musical
	experience in my life.  Fortunately, I think the most annoying thing
	I can think of that happened at a Rush show I've been to (seven, so
	far) is that the people sitting in front of me won't sit down when
	things start to settle down.  Not a big deal, really; much better
	than the Boston show!  That should be a testament to the courtesy of
	Rush fans...keep up the good work!

>Hey Chris-- I, too, listen to Yes, although I much prefer their older
>stuff from "The Yes Album," "Fragile," etc. Never heard of King Crimson? Are
>you kidding? One of the all-time classic rock songs is "In the Court of the
>Crimson King!"

	Me, too.  The "newer" KC is pretty good, too.  I hear it used as filler
	space sometimes on NPR...scary!

Phil Zinn was curious...

>Lets do a reader's poll of you guys' or gals' 2nd favorite band.

	Don't have a favorite...but others keep getting played more than
	others...such as Concrete Blonde, Sugar, Dire Straits, Who, King
	Crimson, Richard Thompson, Bill Bruford, Moodies, Genesis...

And Garrett Young made a list of drummers on the BfB project...

<deletia>

>Kenny Aronoff
	John Mellencamp
>Bill Bruford
	Everybody (Genesis, King Crimson, Yes, solo)
>Bill Cobham
	Mahavishnu Orchestra, solo
>Steve Smith
	Journey, Vital Information

	At least those are the ones I can fill in!

And to all who have responded to my query about MoFi discs...thanks!  Keep
'em coming; one of these days I may just bite the bullet and buy one of 'em
when my wife isn't looking!

Sorry for the length!

I was driving home from work today around 1645, and the 4 radio stations I

weird song.  Soooo, I started radio station surfing.  I stumbled upon 101.5
(pleeeease don't ask me the call letters...if I remember right, they are
WCWT, but don't hold me to it!)...  They were playing a cool song (can't
remember what it was because what they played next made me almost faint!),
so I left the station there.  Well, GUESS what they played next?!  XANADU!!!
 And it was the LIVE version off of ESL even!  Maaaaaaan, I was in seventh

presets in my car!  I urge anyone in or around south Dayton (Ohio) to listen
to 101.5!  Hey, any radio station that plays Xanadu has MY vote for

Subject: lurking et al.

Hello all, I've been lurking for about six months, I tried to post once
before, but it never showed up, so here's another go round...

obligatory bio: I'm 30 and have been a fan since 78 or 79 when I first heard
"Closer To The Heart".  I've caught every tour since the MP one and I'm
always amazed at how The Boys just keep getting better.

A previous poster asked about the three Gold disks.  I've got them all, and
think they're all worth the dough.   But I do think that Signals & MP were
the greatest beneficiaries of the remix process.  I'm really hoping for Gold
(or at least remastered) of Hemispheres and PeW.

I'd really love to see "Presto" and "Kid Gloves" live on the next
tour...maybe an impossible dream, but I still hope.

YKYAARFW:
You root for the "shots on goal" counter at a hockey game to get to 21:12

You flip through all the cd's in the Rush bin, even though you have them all,
and imagine how much fun it would be to buy them again.   (I know, sad, but
what can I say)

Sorry for the length and thanks for reading!
Eric Martin "quicklad@aol.com"

PS.  That post about the band "Echolyn" is right on, these guys are
tremendous.  I think their sound is a bit more like Kansas or old (pre Steve
Hackett leaving) Genesis than Rush,   But since the aforementioned are 3 of
my faves, I'm not complaining.

Subject: Re: 02/22/95 - The National Midnight Star #1058

Hello, folks :

This is my first correspondence to TNMS. I very seldom have time to read
any of the e-mail that comes my way, but on one ocassion I had an hour to
burn, and read the 2/22/95 TNMS mail. In it I found some comments which
moved me enough to force a reply out of me, so here it goes :

  (a) Ron Bratis - when I was in high school back in '81, I used to spend
most of my time in class writting the lyrics to songs like The Trees,
Xanadu, Limelight, Natural Science, A Farewell to Kings, and In The End,
amongst others. At that point in time, I got more about the world around
me and my place in it from those songs than I did from my clases. School
is great and necessary, but sometimes the world of a youngster needs more
inspiration and less discipline.......
  (b) Arvid Hokanson - while I agree with you that Rush is a phenomenal
band which has no peers, I dont think anything is won by ridiculing Ms
Tori Amos, Ms Sara Mclaughlin, or Concrete Blonde. These artists/bands do
deserve credit, and at a very minimum deserve respect, as well as the
fans who listen to their music.
  (c) Aaron - on the subject of Rush fillers, I must admit I'm as
offended as fans of Tori Amos and Sara Mclaughlin must be to Mr.
Hokanson's remarks. Your comments are absurd, and for your information,
I'm one of quite a number of individuals who feel that all those songs
you mentioned cannot possibly be improved. As I stated before, Rush is a
band which has no peers.
  (d) You know you are a Rush fan when you make a statement like this :
Rush is not Rush until it's all you are holding on to (a great example of
plagiarism, but a true statement none the less!)

  And one last comment for you all out there: please keep in mind one of
my favourite sayings when stating your opinion in public,

     Opinions are like assholes : we all have one !

Flame me if you must,

This is my first post!  I have been a Rush fan since the power windows tour!
Since getting the NMS I have notice that quite a few of you are pretty
down on Rush Limbaugh?  I personly think the man is great (my opinion)!

I think that Neil would probably like Rush Limbaugh, and agree with many
(not all) of hiw opinions.  I once hear Rush Limbaugh advise a caller to
read any of Ayan Rands books, that they were very good.  I know that Neil
is a fan of Ayan Rand's books.

I have heard Rush Limbaugh play Bravado on his show.

Wonder what Rush Limbaugh thinks of Rush (the band)?

Just thought I'd chime in.

>>Nitrogen) are going to release a country album...come on, people...

>But, the periodic table has several elements which begin with the letter
>"E" (Aaron apparently you forgot about the Lanthanide which has Europium,
>and Erbium and the Actinide series which has Einsteinium.

I'm just pointing out that what the origional meant was that the symbols
for the elements on the periodic tables spelled LIFESON.
Lithium= LI
Iron= FE
Sulfer= S
Oxygen= O
Nitrogen= N    Therefore LI+FE+S+O+N = LIFESON

Granted, by using just the first letters of any group of elements you can
spell almost anything, but the idea was that the symbols did.  I just
checked, you can't, however, spell Lee or Peart using symbols.
This is NOT a flame... just a clarification for the people who thought
the origional poster meant to use first letters.

Subject: ....and some Rush stuff

Sorry 'bout that total non-Rush post, I just decided to split this in two
It's about _2112_, and the struggle between the protagonist (Does he have
a name?) and the priests (rather one-sided)....based on the music/lyrics
(kid=soothing, nice; Priests=harsh,arrogant) it seems we are supposed to
cheer for good 'ol whatshisname....but, if only for the fact that I like:
I) Overture and II) Temples of Syrinx better than iii) Discovery and
vi) Soliloquy, I find myself uplifted by the kid's downfall....
maybe that's a bit harsh.....I feel little sympathy for the protagonist
 ......anyone agree?
And no, I'm NOT A SOCIALIST, i just the priests' music better, that's all
A few more questions:
A) Is it two-one-one-two, or twenty-one--twelve?
B) is the *other*  National Midnight Star real? If not, which Canadian TV
show does the FAQ refer to?  (and BTW, here in Michigan, we get CBC just
fine, but I still don't know which show.....I watch Hockey Night in
Canada regularly......GO RED WINGS)  Talk about a non-sequitur.....one

background drooling.....It was just an amazing show, and I highly
recommend a) going to see them live, b) buying their album, which John

In 1066 taylor@uiuc.edu wrote that he couldn't tell how Lithium + Iron +
Sulfur + Oxygen + Nitrogen spelled out Lifeson. Well, connect the atomic
symbols: Li + Fe + S + O + N. Bingo!

Hello everyone,

	This is my first posting -- I've been a Rush fan for about 5 years
and a subscriber for a few weeks.  I'd like to clear something up
concerning Russell D. Taylor's post (TNMS #1066), if I may.  Sure, you can
spell Lee, Lifeson, and Peart with the *first* letters of elements in the
periodic table, but Lifeson is the only name you can spell using the
proper IUPAC abbreviations for lithium (Li), iron (Fe), Sulfur (S), oxygen
(O), and nitrogen (N).  I believe that was the original intention.
	That matter aside, I'd like to share a brief story: in April, I
was in Italy for ten days with my Latin class.  We were due to arrive back
in the States on Sunday the 24th, the same day Rush was playing the
Hartford Civic Center.  Of course, I had no intention of missing the show.
 We flew out of Milan at on the morning of the 24th, arrived at JFK around
2:00 in the afternoon, and left for Connecticut shortly after that.  I was
biting my nails the whole way home -- I didn't want to miss any of the
show!  Well, needless to say, I made it there with time to spare, and
caught an incredible show.  On the whole, it was undoubtedly one of the
best days of my life.  Of course, I had jet lag for the rest of the week,
but it was a small price to pay for the thrill of seeing the boys in concert.
	Oh well, I've rambled on long enough.  I hope at least someone
found this story mildly exciting.  Until next time...

Buck

Subject: Temples of "THE" Syrinx - St. Louis 1980 Bootleg
Date: Fri, 10 Mar 95 00:01:48 EST

Well, now that I have everyone high on stress because I got the name of
the song wrong...hear ye, hear ye.  Yes, I know it is not Temples of THE
Syrinx, but rather Temples of Syrinx.  Let's move on shall we.

My question is about a bootleg recoridng I own called Temples of the
Syrinx, a live recording from St. Louis in 1980.  The songs it contains
are the 2112 Overture and Temples, Natural Science, La Villa, In the
Mood, and something called More??!!??  Wow sounds like a Ronco add.  And
much much more!!!  I believe the MORE refers to a drum solo by Neil.  IT
seems that I may have seen this recording mentioned in the FAQ once, but
I don't recall for sure right now.  Anyway, you are all wondering what
my questions are.  Let's begin...

1. The album is copyright 1988 by LEE Music, Ltd. out of Toronto.  Does
anyone know if this Lee Music is related to one Geddy Lee?

2. If you own this album, and I do mean vinyl, (remember that), just
prior to Neil's solo, Geddy says "Okay kids, it's time for
Doctor ______________."  Can you fill in the blank for me.  I have never
been able to figure out what he calls Neil.

3. There is one spot in the middle of In the Mood, when Geddy says,
"Alright St. Louis, let me see all your hands".  That's the only proof
that this is from St. Louis.  You don't by chance think Geddy sat in a
studio one day and just recorded different city names and they dubbed
them in on a lot of different albums do ya?!?!

       "Alright Cleveland...."
       "Alright Chicago...."
       "Alright Detroit..."
       "Alright Dubuque..."

Okay, well maybe not Dubuque!

And finally YKYAARF when you find out what hotel the band is staying at
during the P/G and you bake a cake and frost it with the circle/star and
put happy 10th on it.

I am not making this up!  Too bad the icing melted in the humid St.
Louis summer.  They never got it, but we did meet the band.  Aaahhh, the
joys of adolescence.

peace--

Actually, no. He is using the symbols of the elements.
Lithium=Li, Iron=Fe, Sulfur=S, Oxygen=O, Nitrogen=N
which together gives LiFeSON.

Per the last NMS:
You CAN spell Lerxt's surname (the band version of course :) with the
periodic table if you use a little Chemistry (electricity, biology, etc) -

Li    -    Fe    -     S     -    O    -     N
(lithium)   (iron)     (sulphur)  (oxygen)   (nitrogen)

Lee and Peart are somewhat more troublesome, unfortunately (maybe THEY'RE
the electicity and biology, and Lerxt is the chemistry .... nah.)

See you folks later,

Subject: Sweden?

I don't know if they are coming to Sweden in the near future,
but they were here in -79 and played in Stockholm (Groena Lund)
and in Gothenburg (Concert House).

If you live in Sweden, as I do, you have to travel to see Rush.

Me and my brother went to London in -92 on the Roll the bones
tour. Need I say that they were GREAT(?).
Primus were opening for them. (Pretty good bassist)

So long...
