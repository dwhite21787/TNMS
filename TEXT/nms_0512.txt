Subject: First time RUSH

Date Entered: 09-12-92 03:25

I suppose I should fit right in here with my "first time I heard
RUSH" story.

I was about 6(!) when I decided to look at my older brother's record
collection,which he kept in one of those red milk crate things. I was
mmesmerized by the covers of AFTK and HEMISPHERES, along with
Genesis' NURSERY CRYME and FOXTROT. I began listening. I loved it! I
was in about Grade 1! Anyway, I began listening to each album as it
came out. PERMANENT WAVES, MOVING PICTURES, SIGNALS, etc etc etc... I
love them all!  My Top 5 songs would be:

1)The Necromancer
2)Natural Science
3)Available Light
4)A Farewell to Kings
5)Here Again

As with Genesis and Yes, Rush is one of the bands that I buy
EVERYTHING I see by them. Bubblegum, old CIRCUS magazines (God, Geddy
was U-G-L-Y in the mid-70's! he looks like a buzzard!), posters, ALL
bootlegs I can find, etc etc etc. I see every show I can see!
Whenever I walk past Massey Hall in Toronto I kinda go "Wow! That's
where ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE happened!!".. i suppose that's the
benefit of living in Rush's Territory (&lt;---No pun intended).

Anyway, I love all old and new material. The way I see it, it's
divided into several categories:

1)The RUSH/FLY BY NIGHT period
2)The CARESS OF STEEL/2112/ATWAS period
3)The A FAREWELL TO KINGS/HEMISPHERES period
4)The PERMANENT WAVES/MOVING PICTURES/EXIT... period
5)The SIGNALS/GRACE UNDER PRESSURE PERIOD
6)The POWER WINDOWS/HOLD YOUR FIRE/A SHOW OF HANDS period
7)The PRESTO/ROLL THE BONES period

Well, this is enough typing for now!

Subject:      Enquiry about The Pass

Fellow Rushians:

Several observations...

Sorry I have no cool story to tell about how I became a Rush fan...

No, I am not a female fan, either...

So, I think I'll start a new thread:

Listening to _Presto_ tonight, I was caught by "The Pass" (my favourite on that
disc), especially the line "Christ, what have you done?"  I began to wonder,
is that reference to Christ only as an exclamation (similar to "Damn!" or
"Shit!") or might it mean more?

I think perhaps it might represent Neil's frustration with suicide, and
associating it with Jesus Christ, who I feel somewhat made more honourable
suicide, by allowing his execution to happen...

Could Neil feel that since Jesus allowed himself to be crucified, that he was
saying "Suicide is okay?"  Then, one might somehow blame Jesus for any further
suicides, especially like the one described in the song.  I know of Neil's
extensive research in writing the song, as well of his frequent use of double
meanings; and this reference to Christ could very well be a double meaning, in
classic Peart style...

Before you all flame away, hold your fire and let me state that I am in no way
a Biblical Scholar, nor do I claim to have any basic, rudimentary or analytic
knowledge of the New Testament, or the situation surrounding the death of Jesus
other than what common knowledge has taught me.... Sorry, no Sunday school for
this Jewish look-alike of Geddy...

Well, I hope this posting sparks a somewhat intelligent thread on the NMS, and
is treated somewhat well, in other words, don't flame me unless you can
justify an argument that the reference was just an exclamation, but I think
Neil's history of double meanings speaks stronger than pure coincidence...

I don't think I was able to get down on type exactly my interpretation of the
Christ reference, but I think you will get the gist of what I am trying to say
(I hope!!)

Thanks...

ORQ: "The sun walks by, on the horizon"---my initial interpretation of "Chain
     Lightning"   :)

Subject: First Experience..

Yes, I must admit that my first experience was the typical listening to Tom
Sawyer on the way home from high school with a car full of buddies, all
of us doing air drums to imitate Neil's great rips in that song (although
we didnt know who Neil was at the time :)..

One thing lead to another and now I am a devoted fanatic.

Subject: Rush videos

	I agree with the fan who wrote that Rush videos are clearly not
at the same quality level as their music.  This has been discussed very much
on alt.music.rush during the summer, but i don't recall a recent discussion
on the NMS.  Geddy has a cute son, and the DEW video starts out neatly enough,
with the band's shadowed faces and half-lit sandbox scenes, but then quickly
gets almost comical with Julian riding that "rocket" or "missile" over
the "landscape" -- with a wad of tin foil in the end to represent a flame!!!!
	I know the Boyz have said that they don't like doing videos .. but
anyone want to venture a prediction on what the future holds for Rush videos?
I don't know if having a new label will affect their video production at all..
(by the way, i DO think the Big Money video is fun..)

Subject: trivia answer, videos

"The Body Electric" song (and video) were inspired (in the case of the video,
ripped off of) by the movie THX 1138, which was director George Lucas' first
film.

For whoever asked, the video "The Camera Eye" is a collection of all-studio
videos of songs from Moving Pictures, Signals, and Grace Under Pressure.
Last time I saw the tape was Fr. year in high school (1987), but the vid.'s
were so cool that i remember them well.  vids included: subdivisions, the
camera eye, afterimage, distant early warning, the body electric, vital signs,
and  a few others.

The rush vids that I know about are ESL, chronicles, P/G, the camera eye,
ASOH;  what others exist?  which have the studio vids for Tom Sawyer and Red
Barchetta? (it's been about 10 years since i've seen them).  oh yeah, i'll
always remember seeing distant early warning on friday night videos.  what a
cool vid.

Subject: First time on Rush....

My first time? Hmmmm...(Oh no! I've fallen into the trap!)

I was in 8th or 9th grade and had just started delivering newspapers in
my(quite small) hometown. I got to talking about music one day while rolling
papers with a guy who had a "regular" job there, even though he still delivered
papers mostly. He tells me I should check out Rush, especially 2112. At the
time I got all my 8-tracks(Yeah, well, I was stupid) from Columbia House, who
didn't have 2112. But one month they had AFTK, so I ordered it. Well, once it
came, I listened to it, but without a lyric sheet, I was lost. Still, I thought
they were OK. But I soon stopped having money to spend for tapes, since I was
playing football, and then my 8-track died on me, and I heard no Rush for more
than a  year(not only is my hometown small, it is also a backwater when it
comes to radio). While in high school I was a Boy Scout, and in between my
junior and senior years in high school was the National Jamboree. We had a
"shakedown" for our council in late May. One guy had this fantastic tape
collection, and his prized new tape was MP! As others have noted, the openeing
chord of Tom Sawyer just blew me away. By the end of this very hot weekend the
tape was trashed from overplaying it. But I still had no money, and no radio...
Finally, I visited my cousin later that year(Christmas) and she had ESL. One
listen and I was hooked. I spent every dollar I could scrounge and bought the
ESL, AFTK, MP, PeW, and ATWAS LPs. Then I went to college! A radio station that
*loved* Rush. Signals, p/g, PoW!

Sadly, I lost touch with what they were doing for a while. I went graduate
school, and the only stations in the new town that played Rush played little
but Bon Jovi the rest of the time. I was getting into a different direction....
Still, when I heard that the Presto tour was coming to town, even though I knew
noone that would go with me, I went(carrying a copy of the Koran for light
reading...). I am happy to say that today, thanks to a wife that graciously
accepts my fanaticism, and occaisionally participates in it(like agreeing to
wait up all night to buy tickets outside of May D&F[a relatively classy
department store--- you should have seen the looks we got from employees the
next morning] freezing our butts off, then freezing them off again at the
show), I have most of the discography. Maybe when I get a real job my CD
collection will look like I want it too, and I'll see a tour from really close
up like Jimmy, but until then...

Subject: A new Rush Bootlist

Hello everyone! I'm planning to create a new Rush boot list, and all I need
are your submissions. Only people who are interested in trading Rush or other
live recordings and WHO WILL NOT SELL THEM should submit a list. It can be as
detailed as you which, though if you have a long list and you have set lists,
name duplicates of tour lists as such, w/o repeating them for every show. This
list will also serve as a starting point for those interested in starting a
collection. People w/o shows should be able to contact submitters of lists and
be able to send tapes and postage $ for shows, and NOT be charged some kind of
"labor fee" for pressing the record button, know what I mean? This list will
also double as a Rush CD and LP bootleg info place. Reviews of either can be
sent to me for compiling. (I know at least 1 person is doing it already)
Lastly, this list will not be affliated in any means with the NMS or its
editors. This is a totally independent project aimed at bringing together
Rush collectors, helping begining Rush collectors along, and helping buyers
of Rush CD and LP bootlegs choose wisely when spending HUGE amounts of money!!
So, if you're anti-bootleg, don't make use and ignore the list. Period. Once
this list is compiled, it can easily be attained by me through a request on
e-mail. I will post a message in the NMS when it is ready. Once again, this
list is totally independent of the NMS. Send all lists, CD or LP reviews to:
(internet) stu_neshue@vax1.acs.jmu
(bitnet) stu_neshue@jmuvax
Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to creating this list!

Subject: The First Annual Rush Convention...

Hello all,
	For those of you who don't get alt.music.rush, much talk has
been going on about having a rush convention next spring or summer.
Looking at the lack of posts in NMS, I would guess that this is news
to most of you.
	After a drawn out debate of location it seems that Toronto
will be the location (thankfully those proposing New York have quited
down...). The debate now moves to the date of the convention. I think
that the summer would be best since many college spring vacations
don't line up. Around late June or July seems to be best, as those
working can easily get vacation time and college students are out for
the summer.
	I would like to hear about what people want as events and
functions during the event. Does anyone know the schedule for the
band around these dates? We might be able to get them to come by (and
perhaps a set at Lakeside Park) if we start organizing this soon.
I'll help to organize this, but since I live in the Northwest I can't
do a lot about logistics. Is everyone interested in this, and can
people help to organize the event?

	This may be old news already, but Stairway to Heaven went out of
business a while ago.  I don't know when, but I also went to check in a few
months back, and found that it became a shoe department for some stupid men's
store.  Stairway was the only place I know where you could get Rush stuff in
the Boston area, now I would guess that the place to try is Newbury Comics.
Though they won't have the selection that Stairway did.

Subject: Assorted info....

	Howdy again, just wanted to make a few comments about recent threads.

	1) On the subject of women and Rush, I don't think that there are as
many female fans as their are male fans, I would definately say I don't
believe it to be a 50-50 ratio.  I was talking to woman about it yesterday,
and she commented that in maryland (where she's from) there aren't very many
feamle fans at all, and she said that they are a small group indeed.  I can't
verify this, but it's what she told me.
	Personally I would like to see more females enjoy rush (as well as
more people in general) because they are a good band.

	2) I want to make a point of the fact that the 500th issue of the NMS
came and went w/o much fanfare.  I would like to thank Dave, Meg, and Jimmy
for the hard work they've done in entertaining the lot of us that hang on what
they publish each day.  Kudos on a job well done.

	3) The other thing I want to say is talking w/ a friend of mine the
other day about what songs we thought Rush were going to put on the next live
album.  We figured that from RTB there would Bravado, Where's My Thing, and
Ghost of a Chance for sure, and that Show Don't Tell, and Superconductor would
show up from Presto.  We weren't sure what else because the live albums is two
studio albums away, and they haven't released them yet (though someone said
they would be starting the next one soon ;) .)

	Well th-th-th-that's all folks.

	Frank.

Subject: BCOLBY returns

Howdy, fellow Rushians!
For those who do or do not know me, I am Brian Colby.  I first subscribed to
TNMS back in early Jan., and I enjoyed it so much that I subscribed for
the entire year!!
(I'm not usually *that* perky.  I'm much more mellow than that.)

My first exposure to Rush was in Jan 1990, during my senior year in
high school.  My first tape was Moving Pictures, and I was simply
amazed about the music, guitars, etc.  Some time later, I had
bought Rush and Fly By Night, and I thought, "s&%$, this must be
Robert Plant!".

The real "hook line and sinker" that made me a current Rush fan was "Presto,"
and the lyrics that Neil Peart wrote about vanity (War Pai ('War Paint'), 
suicide ('The Pass', which qualifies as the best ballad for me; somehow the
top 40 treatment makes we very ill!), and time ('Available Light') captivated
me into buying more Rush albums.  I have everything except "Show of Hands,"
"All The World's A Stage", and the two volume Archives with the first
three albums (I'm not sure about this...)

I hope Rush comes out with another album soon.  "Roll The Bones" was a great
album, but it's not as good as the classic Rush, IMHO.  Any flames, praises,
etc. can be directed to this E-mail address.  Thanx, and remember this ORQ:

This is regarding the first time section...I was orignially a closet
Rush fan.  I said that I didn't like them, because my brother liked
them, and in those days I just couldn't like anything my brother
did.  Those with siblings should understand.  I listened to them
all the time because my brother and father did.  I knew all the lyrics,
and eventually, I came out and admitted it.  I LOVE RUSH!!!  I would
take my brothers tapes and listen to them when no one was around.
 My first concert was Power Windows.  I loved it as anyone can imagine.
 Rush concerts are so amazing, especially when you are only twelve
years old.  Since then, I have seen them every chance I get.  My
entire family loves the band.  My nine year old brother went to see
them on this past tour for RTB.  The hardest part for me now, is
getting the money to buy the rest of the tapes, because my father
wouldn't let me take them all.  I have the first eleven, except for
All the World's a Stage...I want that one!  I had it and something
got messed up and it won't play.  That was my first RUSH experience.
 I still wonder,"...how does that rabbit feel going under those speeding
wheels?"...Later Rush Fans...Jason

&gt;recommended by a fellow NMSer.  At the end of the first song, "Pull Me
&gt;Under", the song ends abrubtly.  He thinks that it's the way it's
&gt;supposed to be, but I think it's a skip.  The CD player also says that
&gt;2 seconds still remain when this occurs.  Anyone who has the album know
&gt;if their copy does that?  Thanks.

My CD does it too, and it was pressed in Europe. I think the very
abrupt ending is deliberate. Like Rush, Dream Theater are perfectionists,
so I can't believe they'd let the CD be released with such a blatant
flaw in it, unless it was intentional. The song has a very similar idea to
Rush's _Between the Wheels_, in that IMO it's about how modern life can
be so fast & hectic that an individual feels swamped and powerless as the
world 'reels by on celuloid'. The character feels he is being pulled
under and is 'drowning' in the impersonal world around him (a lyrical
theme which occurs very frequently in Rush songs too). To emphasise this
fact the song gets faster and faster towards the end, with layer upon
layer of complexity being added, and then abruptly ends. It gives me the
impression that something in the character has finally snapped; he or
she could only take so much, and no more. Sort of like the straw that
broke the camel's back. What happens to the individual afterwards is
left to the reader's imagination, suicide, catatonia, changing to a
quieter lifestyle..? Your guess is as good as mine. Anyway, apart from
the tenuous lyrical similarities, this has little Rush content, so won't
waste any more space and stop here.

Subject: Rush Tapestry Revisited

     I've had a few responses from people interested in the tapestry I wrote
about last week.  One person suggested that we try to pool the money together
and purchase it through someone on the list.  I think it's a great idea because
with the list being somewhere around 1300-1500 people I'm sure there's enough
demand for a measly $100 order for this tapestry.

     I know they don't just stock this tapestry.  When I spoke to them on the
phone their representative told me that they deal with a lot of metal bands (he
mentioned Metallica most notably).  So even if you don't want that particular
tapestry I'm sure they have something there for you.  I'm thinking that since
my brother purchased the tapestry at around $10 retail then the tapestry
probably sells for around $4-7 dollars wholesale.  (Does that sound right?  I'm
a much better programmer than I am a businessman.)

     Now since I don't have a dealer's license they wouldn't even send me a
catalog.  Is there anyone out there who has a dealer's license and is willing
to put this thing together?  You could even make a project out of it.... yeah.
Be like Tom Cruise from "Risky Business."  What better market is there than a
bunch of drooling fanboys?

Subject: New Concert Recordings

Looking through John Young's new CD catalogue, I spotted a couple of new Rush
CDs that I haven't heard mentioned before.  I don't intend to order anything
from him, but I am curious if anyone has heard these yet.  They are:

Bravado - Nassau Colliseum  3/92
Over The Europe - Europe '92

Both were double CDs, I believe.  I still haven't picked up any live Rush so
I'm am interested in finding out what to look for.  Sorry, I mean I haven't
got anything other than the official albums.  I'd really like to get some
recordings from this tour as well as past ones.  I don't have any Rush to
trade, but if anyone is interested in trading for Genesis, Pink Floyd, or
Grateful Dead stuff (primarily - though I do have a few others), please
contact me via email.

I know this is kind of burning itself out, but I've got to put my two
cents in because I just luv thinking about live Rush.

Yo, Yo, Yo! I was the first one to say By-Tor would be back! You stole
it from me! Just kidding. Actually, I did make a semi prediction that
they would bring it back for the RTB tour (yeah, right, along with
FBN-oh well.)

Anyway, I could see Tom Sawyer being cut down, than be cut away totally.
Maybe blend the last half into something-like BY-TOR! By-Tor rules! It's
such a cheap, cheesy song, but so much power.

Oh well.

&gt;To whoever said it:  I think you're right, By-Tor will be the song to be
&gt;revived next tour.  Personally, I'd like to see In the End brought back...

Not too surprisingly, I overlooked this song.  You're the 3rd person in
the last digest to mention "In the End", I've always liked that song and
the version on ATWAS is great!  Love that power Alex guitar rift.

&gt;Subject: Tour Gripes and Hopes
&gt;
&gt;I was extremely pleased to see Subdivisions and The Pass retired in favor of
&gt;The Trees, The Analog Kid, and Vital Signs on this past leg of the tour.

Agreed, when they did play Subdivisions it was short a verse anyways.
What was surprising is they cut 1 complete song, and 1 semi-complete
song and replaced it with 3 FULL songs!  Guess they had a lot of energy
towards the end of the tour adding more time to the playing set, then
the little snippet of Cygnus at the end of the medley.  Anyone like the
animal noise touch by Geddy during The Trees?  (The frog and the cow
sounds really crack me up.)

&gt;I'd love to see Tom Sawyer, Closer to the Heart, and Time Stand Still 
&gt;retired--they're about due [.....]  Oh, I almost forgot to get rid of 
&gt;Show Don't Tell (IMHO the weakest song on Presto).  As for the opener, 
&gt;Force Ten is dead.  

Are there any other fans out there who think it's time to retire "great"
Rush tunes like Tom Sawyer and Closer to the Heart?  I am *not* knocking
the songs, don't get me wrong, but just curious as to what people
thought if they did go to a Rush concert and not hear those popular
tunes?  There are arguments to both sides I'm sure and I'd like to hear
some.  Naturally, for the new(er) fan or one who listens to radio a lot,
he/she might be disappointed.  TS and CTTH are Rush's most popular tunes
(esp on FM), and I'm sure plenty of people come to hear them.  Then
there are the long time fans who must have heard TS and CTTH one too
many time, not just in concert, at home, on the radio, but everywhere in
general.  You can imagine they want to hear something else.  Then there
are the fans who claim TS and CTTH *is* Rush.  To not play those songs
is just pure not right, regardless of how old they are or how often
they've been overplayed.  A Rush concert has to have TS or CTTH
somewhere in the set.  I'd like to hear other people's thoughts.  Is it
wrong to want no more TS, no more CTTH?
