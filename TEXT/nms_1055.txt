Hi,
        This is my first post.  My boyfriend got me interested in Rush so I
suscribed to the list and WOW thank you very much for the FAQ section!!  I
still keep it for reference.  Yet I still have an inquiry:  What is the
rarest, most valueable Rush item around and how can I trade, or buy it for
someone?  E-mail me privately if you can help me with this.  Thanks.

Subject: My reactions....

	Hello Fellow Rushians-

	As I was reading in the last NMS, I saw a few things about
Rivendell.  I really like that song quite a bit.  I think it is well
written. I know that people have debated it before, but I think it shows
a lot of maturity by the band at such a young age.  They were all about
22 years old when they wrote it.  Just had to say that.
	Next, where is everyone getting this March 28th date for a new
album?  I hold Rush-Mgr as the best source, and he says that that date is
wrong.  It seems to me that Atlantic would print it in Rolling Stone or
some other industry magazine like Gavin etc.  Whoever started this date
rumor must be a pro, cause he has a lot of people fooled.
	Next question.  With all this talk of what Ged and Alex use on
stage to hear themselves, what is Neil using?  I would imagine he has
something that is the same for his electric kit.
	I just want to say the Rush-Mgr is doing a hell of a job right
now.  It seems he is quite busy, or syrinx is, but the NMS is still alive
and kicking.  In my internet resource class, we talked about mailing
lists today.  The prof said that when the lists get into the hundereds,
that they are really hard to handle, well the NMS is in the thousands, so
good job Rush-Mgr :)
	Last..on the lighter side.  I live in Bellingham, Washington,
about 45 minutes to an hour from Vancouver, British Columbia.  Well my
friends and I were going to a pub, but we didn't want to tell the border
guard that.  My friend who was driving said that we were going to see a
friend of ours.  The guard said "where does he live"  I quickly blurted
out..."Old Dirke Road" from the 'Signals'album liner.  I said it was in
Vancouver on the FRINGES OF THE CITY, and hey we got right thru.  Cool
Border guard.
	Sorry about the length of my post, hope you didn't mind too much :)

	Fellow Rushians-

I live in Bellingham, Washington...about an 40 minutes from Vancouver,
B.C.  Well my friends and I were going to a pub for the evening, and at
the border they want to know what you are doing.  Well, we got to ther
border, and the guys I was with said to tell the border guard we were
going to a freinds house.  So my friend said that.  The guard asked where
this friend lived.  Everyone was silent for a second, when I blurted out
"He lives on Old Dirke Road, it's up north on the fringes of the City"
the guard said ok, go one ahead.  Boy did Signals come thru in the
clutch.  My friends just thought I was the man. So, for the rest of the
evening I got them to listen to a Rush Tape I had.  I still wonder if the
guard is a Rush friend, but just didn't say so.

Subject: Pye Dubois' poem

"Say yes say yes ahh say yes to self-esteem?"

Thanks to Paul (94matesp@wave.scar.utoronto.ca) for posting the poem.
It's very interesting to see some of the, ahem, chaff that Neil
uses as raw material for his lyrics.

Personally, I don't think much of Dubois' poem.  But I think it's
clear that Neil has changed its meaning significantly.  I don't claim
to fully understand the poem, but lines like the above and these:

> Do what you want to do in no ordinary way
> Say what you need to say in no ordinary way
> And sing what must be sung in no ordinary way

> Never give up and never say die

make me think that the subject is the courage or self-esteem needed to
make an honest statement, fully participate in life, change the world, etc.
In the context of an AIDS benefit, I'd say it has a kind of "stick to your
guns, live the way you want to live" message.  At any rate, it's a call to
action of some sort.  It seems very different from the song's references to
love ("fine line between love and illusion") and rest ("we just need a break
from the headlong race").  I think Neil was inspired by the imagery and took
it in a totally different direction, specifically the love/sex meaning I
wrote about before.

	Thanks to all who have participated so far on building a rush
radio list.  Again I am trying to establish some sort of orderly D'base
of the kinds of radio is out there.  I am going to have to draw the line
on the stations that only play Rush once a day, however, that just isn't
enough.  In my book they are rush-phobic!

	Again it would help if the format of this was kinda like this:

City, State		Freq. callsign		Rush-rating
example
Syracuse, NY		100.9 KROK		Rush-philic (loving)

Later, 		ejmcclan@mailbox.syr.edu

P.S.  Ido need much more input before a list will be available, all I
have so far is Seattle, Pheonix, Manitoba, Syracuse.  keep 'em comin.

	there is not a new completed studio work.  Personally, I am
	more excited about the promise of live video than a studio

Subject: Dream Theater covers Rush

Hello,

Been a while since I posted, and I hate to start out with a beg and plea,
but here I go:

A week ago Dream Theater played an all-covers show in the U.K., which
included songs by Yes, Metallica, Pink Floyd, Marillion, U.K., etc.
I nearly died when I read that of all the Rush songs there are, they played
"Tears"!!!!  They were also joined by special guests (no one from Rush that
I've heard), including Steve Howe and the singer from Napalm Death!!

Of course, the plea is that I'm looking for a tape of this show. I've heard
it's being broadcast in England, so I'm sure they'll be floating around.
Supposedly it's likely that the show will be released in dome form at some
time, but I'm really curious to hear this stuff.         ^^^^
                      (that's "some form", not 'in the form of a dome')  :)

If anyone can help me out, I'll let you have my Focus Guitars tee-shirt,
which is from the store where I used to take guitar lessons and where the
members of Dream Theaterd (some of them) worked. :)   Okay, maybe not, but
I have a list and I'm sure we could work out a trade!!!

Thanks a lot to anyone who can help me out.

I think you hit the nail on the head.  I was thinking about how well it
ties in with the album's theme; that of counterparts.  The sun and the
moon have traditionally been identified with the male and female by many
different religions.  Jung did studies on this.  He called the two
principals "anima" and "animus."  I think the so-called "lake" between
the sun and moon is a sort of happy medium, a balance, if you will.  It
is what everyone has the potential of having but never realizes they
have because they insist on dividing everything into opposites.

Subject: Between Sun and Moon (paul)

	First off, this is my first post, and I really enjoy reading about the
greatest band in the world and seeing what others feel about Rush.
I just wanted to say thanks to Paul. I have been wondering about the
lyrics to BS&M (that sure has a different meaning when written that way)
for quite a long time. That poem, while rather esoteric like the song,
gives one another way to look at that song. Thanks Paul.
	As for me, I have been a Rush fan for seven years now and have
seen them 5 times. The first time I heard Rush was when I was in grade
school and heard "TOM SAWYER". I never really got into them much (sadly I
must admit that I liked pop music, though Twisted Sister was my favorite
band). IYears later I saw the "BIG MONEY" video. I did not like it, yet I
could never bring myself to change the channel; something was strangely
captivating about the music. A friend later made me a tape of Permanent
Waves and after that I was hooked.
	In college at Illinois Wesleyan University, I was a dj and my
show was called RUSH HOURS, and we played at least 5 Rush songe every
time we were on. My airname was Geddy and my partners was Neil. Now in
graduate school in Miss. I no longer have the show, but my Rush devotion
and colection grows weekly. I recently picked up a perfect copy of
"ARCHIVES" on vinyl, and I will keep it preserved well.
	Anyway, that is me. Keep making new Rush fans wherever you go.

II was doing a little surfing on the net and came across an encyclopedia of
progressive rock music.  Naturally, I went straight to the Rush entry.
Much to my dismay they gave Rush (and Rush fans) a mixed critique.  You
might want to check this out:

http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~philkime/r.html

The GEPR lists many progressive bands, most of which I have never heard.
If you're looking for info on Queensryche they don't have any.  I think
I briefly saw something about ELP, which I know many NMSers like.

Subject: Now I get it!

Actually several things:

1.  Mahogany Rush?  Yes!  Frank Marino...it's been awhile, but yeah.
Unfortunately, whoever told you (the poster in the last issue) about the
MR/R connection was wrong.  Check a more reputable source than me for the
story (although I bet it has something to do with John Rutsey's brother).

2.  Someone in the last issue, James Noble I think, made a very
interesting statement concerning MTV and particulary, Hole.  What I find
interesting about the whole MTV sucks debate is that's exactly how I
discovered Rush in the first place.  Right around 81, when MTV was still
showing those Saturday night concerts, I caught Rush one week.  Little did
I know this was their ESL home vid (I was real young, but impressionable).
I was so impressed by what I was watching, I haven't stopped watching and
listening since.  Not to flame the poster or defend Hole, but I would be
wary of condemning Hole.  Even though I don't really care for Courtney's
music and rantings, I hardly believe she is famous only because of Cobain.
Many moons ago, she actually sang for Faith No More.  She also did worlds
of other jobs I couldn't even begin to list and has racked up more
frequent flyer miles than I can imagine.  She's led a hard, rugged
life--surviving a suicide and an overdose, plus trying to raise a kid is
damn hard.  Give a little credit, even if you can play guitar better than
she can, and even if you can play better with a body part she doesn't
have. :)

3.  Now I understand.  Stopped off in a music store today for the heck of
it, and test-played a Rickenbacker, brand new one.  Yowza!!!  Now I get
it.  That *burn*...man, you just don't know.  Had I the $$$ Mr. Salesman
wanted, I'd be playing it right now instead of wasting time.  I've been
told repeatedly to go play one, and now I think I get it.  Good feel, good
grrrrr tone...mmmmm.  Also played a Hohner, which looks like a Steinberger
("boat paddle").  Ugh.  I did like the extra frets, though.  But no match
for that Rick...Bass players!  Go try one!  I'm serious, it's the
proverbial golden opel...

Rush forth...

This disc will be very hard to find.  Even at a record convention.  I found
mine in a mall in Baltimore about 6 years ago.  The audio is fine, but like a
lot of you other guys that own it, the video is not so hot.  It pops and has
some snow.  Great collectors item though!

Anyone else out there have the "Where's My Thing?" CD single?  What's it

Get real.  If you're talking about Randy, the manager of Record Theatre on
Marshall street, don't count on it, cuz he knows as much about a new Rush
album as my Grandmother...and Media Play will tell you anything to get
you to buy one of their Interview With the Vampire t-shirts...and
considering that the average age of their employees is about 16 and the
only thing they listen to is Green Day I wouldn't take their word too
seriously either.  Face it dude, the first place you'll hear about any
new album news will be on TNMS.

Subject: Re:  Am I a Dinosaur?

Hello, this is my first post to NMS, so ignore me if you want, but I was
really scared by this "dinosaur" thing. Is it bad to be 19 and a dinosaur?

DRFULLER@ualr.edu said

        You are a dinosaur if you can correctly answer five of the following
questions or can identify with five of the following statements:
                (1) Who was the 5th Beatle?
                (5) Do you find yourself asking the question "What the
                    hell is this garbage on the radio?" in much the same
                    way your parent(s) asked the same question about the
                    music during your teen years?
                (7) Do you know that Ed King, one of the original members of
                    Lynyrd Skynyrd, was also a member of the Strawberry Alarm
                    Clock, who's one claim to fame was the song "Incense and
                    Peppermints?"
                (8) Did you ever see Led Zeppelin live in concert?
               (15) The purpose of attending a rock concert is to enjoy a
                    band making a spectacle of itself instead of making a
                    spectacle of yourself.
               (17) Can you name at least 10, "one-hit wonders" from the 60s
                    and 70s?

Actually that is 6, but I really would love to be able to say that I
saw Zeppelin live, so I put it in anyways. The problem is that I was 5
when John Bonham died. Anyways this Dinosaur Test was cool, but it is
scary to hear that I fit these criteria. However, for a few of the
questions, I am not even close to answering, for example I have been to
9 concerts, and have never even seen the Ed Sullivan show. Maybe I am
proof that there is hope for young(er) people. Actually probably not.

	I was wondering if any other bands (not including tribute bands)
besides Skid Row had covered any Rush songs.  I think it would be great
if a bunch of bands got together to make a tribute album.  Maybe in 10-20
more years when they retire (i wish).

Hi gang!

Just thought I might share something I noticed which may be
interesting for some of you.
I hope nobody has posted this observation already. Apologies in
advance if this is the case.

In the liner notes of Presto, there is an old reproduction of a
painting of a brown rabbit. This is a work done by Albrecht Durer
(1471-1528), a German Renaissance artist. Similarly, the pictures
of a sun and of a moon with faces superimposed on them from the
collage in the liner notes of Counterparts are creations of Durer.

These images, which I assume are related to BSAM, are found in a
painting of Durer called "The Day of Wrath". This painting was
intended to be a visual representation of the Book of Revelations
6:9-16, in which "the sun becomes black, the moon becomes as blood,
and stars rain down from heaven....."

This may spawn a number of pet theories, but the FACTS are that Durer's
painting of a rabbit appears in Presto, while the "sun and moon" from
from his "Day of Wrath" appear in Counterparts. Anybody have the lyrics
handy for comparison? (grin)

Hi all,
	Firstly thanks to all who replied about the harmonics.
I know what I'm playing, and listening too now.

Mahogany Rush was a different band, fronted by Frank Marino, I
think. He later had a band called Marino.

As to being a Dinosaur, well perhaps not quite, but I'm banging
on the gates. I can answer some of the criteria, and do remember
some of the events, but a lot of them are perhaps more relevent
in the States, not England! Do they still make Mousetrap, the
game that took hours to set up, and less time to play.
Perhaps i'm a pseudo Dinosaur (like Barney :)).

Thanks

Its about time that the general public has the opportunity to hear the

I sent this once before, but I don't think it ever made it...
so I will spew again:

Greetings!  Having been an NMS lurker since 1991, I'm finally
taking the plunge...

I am 27; the vinyl Archives reissue set was my first Rush venture.
I eventually had all the vinyl through Power Windows but I traded
them all in for CD's (tho I still have my tri-fold ATWAS).  I also
still have the cassette version of Archives, in addition to myriad
collectables, boots, vids, etc.  I'm one of a million Rush bassists,
as well...have the standard Rush bass gear: White-on-black Rick,
Rotosound Round Wounds, Loe Quann bridge with a plastic plate beneath
to cover the hideous marks and holes left by the stock Rick bridge...
Employed as the I.S. Manager for a company in Dallas, TX called
IT Network, Inc.

I had the good fortune to be sitting almost directly behind Geddy
at one of the 1984 World Series games in Detroit.  Got an autograph
and a lovely shot of the back of his head, and while I would've
loved to chat, I can respect a man's enthusiasm for baseball and
wouldn't have dared disturb Dirk's focus on the game.

I am from Kalamazoo, MI, where Rush spent seven consecutive nights in
preparation for their Moving Pictures tour (tho I missed all seven
shows...dunno what could've possible taken priority over that, but
somehow I blew the opportunity of a lifetime).  Have seen all the tours
since then, but after the New World Tour, Rush never returned to
Kalamazoo.

Other musical prefs include Marillion, Yes, Maiden, Queensryche, and
lately, Hash (anyone heard of them?).

So again, greetings to all the familiar names I've seen so often over
the last four years...good to finally be among you!

This is not true.  The band Mahogany Rush released several albums
in the mid-70's timeframe (Maxoom, Child of the Novelty, Strange
Universe, IV, Live, etc...) and were definitely not the Rush we
all know and love.  Mahogany Rush were a three piece (gtr/voc,
bass, drums) fronted by guitarist Frank Marino; later converted to
a four piece when Frank's younger brother joined on backing
guitar.  The music was fairly good (at least early on), kindof
"Hendrix-ish" with lots of guitar effects - not at all like Rush
sounded at the same timeframe (i.e. 2112, AFtK, Hemispheres,etc.).
I suppose that with sufficiently poor photos as reference, Geddy
Lee and Frank Marino (circa 1975-1977) might look a bit similar
(although I think Marino had a mustache for a while...).

Yes, Dino, I did qualify for Dinosaur status.  I only needed to
know 5 answers?  Easy, man!  I think the Mahogany Rush bit above
might qualify as another question!  :)

  I asked this question a long long time ago, while seriously involved
with a female Rush fan named Elly.  All the responses I got were
consistent: on ASOH, Geddy sings "Hey Alex" while Alex sings "Hey Geddy".
The mixture of these 2 sound something like Elly.

my take, is that people often have to make major decisions about their

one type of decision we have to make.  We *are* taking a big chance by
doing so (i.e. Rolling our religious bones), cuz if we are wrong, we may
end up in hell.  You bet your life, indeed, you bet your soul.

umm, somone correct me if wrong, but I tihnk Mahogany Rush was a
completely different band from the 70's.  From the Visions bio, i seem to
remember the name Rush coming from Geddy's future brother-in-law or
something to that effect.

Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation...

	I was listening to Moving Pictures the other day (as I often do), and
a funny thought hit me.  Over the past few years, there has been a big push
from the liberal wing of academia to lower academic standards.  Many colleges
(including Rutgers, where I attend) have lowered admission standards, in the
name of promoting "diversity."  Many universities (Berkeley is a good
example) actually have lower SAT standards for certain racial and ethnic
groups.

	This cancer is growing at lower levels, too.  Many school boards have
proposed dropping grading altogether.  They argue that students'
"self-esteem" is damaged when they receive an 'F.'  As a result too many
institutions of learning are lowering and eliminating standards.  No one gets
'A's, no one gets 'F's, no one fails, no one excels, and no one learns.

	Then it hit me.

	"Everybody got to deviate from the norm
	 Everybody got to elevate from the norm
	 Everybody got to escalate from the norm"

In your face, you ivory-tower, liberal academics!

Subject: Rush and Mahogany Rush

Yo Rushies!
	This is in response to Meghan Middleton. Don't tell me, you work in a
morgue and your co-worker was sniffing too much formaldehyde, right? Let me
assure you that your co-worker hasn't a clue. Mahogany Rush and Rush are two
totally different bands, although both are from Canada. The lead guitarist for
Mahogany Rush was Frank Marino. The story goes that Frank was involved in a
serious accident and was in a coma in the hospital for several months. Prior to
the accident, Frank never learned to play the guitar. However, while in a coma,
he claims to have been visited by the spirit of Jimi Hendrix. He recovered
(obviously), picked up a guitar one day, and much to his amazement, he could
play the guitar very similarly to the way Hendrix did! He formed his own band,
named it Mahogany Rush, and recorded several albums, including "Child of the
Novelty," "Strange Universe," "Maxxoom," "Mahogany Rush IV" (one of my absolute
favorite albums of all time!!), "Live," "World Anthem," and "Tale of the
Unexpected." BTW, Mahogany Rush was a three-piece like Rush (I forget the names
of the other two members- I think one of them was named Jim Ayoub).
	Frank Marino did in fact play in a style very similar to Jimi Hendrix,
although he was not nearly as adept at the guitar as Hendrix (but then, who has
ever been quite like Jimi?!). I've seen Mahogany Rush in concert four times, and
Frank was always quite the showman. He'd play the guitar with his teeth, behind
his back, etc. The band was really quite good, but their time was limited
because the critics considered them nothing more than Hendrix hacks. The style
of music between Rush and Mahogany Rush is as different as night and day. If
you (or anyone else for that matter) are interested in experiencing Mahogany
Rush, I would suggest you start with "Mahogany Rush IV." It is available, but at
the moment only as an import in the U.S. I waited nearly 10 years to find that
CD, and my wife just recently saw it in a record store! IMHO, "Mahogany Rush IV"
is a masterpiece- a true rock gem. Songs such as "Dragonfly," "Little Sexy
Annie," "The Answer," and "The Emperor" from the album are truly incredible.
	Well, to finish the story, Mahogany Rush had its heyday in the mid 70s
to the very early 80s. As the years progressed, Frank started getting the
bighead, so he changed the band's name to Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush (so if
anything, the band actually lengthened its name instead of shortened it!) for
the later albums. The band finally fizzled out and as far as I know are no
longer in existence. Of course, we know that Rush is still kicking today!
(Hallelujah!)
	Tell your co-worker that when it comes to offering rock history, he or
she needs to follow the advice that an old high school teacher gave me
(constantly!) several years ago:
		"It is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought of as
		 a fool
		 Than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."
	I hope my reply has enlightened you.

Later fellow Rush-mongers!

	Fellow Rushians-

I was sitting at a friend's house a while ago listening to AFTK, when I
picked up one of his Stereo Review magazines.  Well They were talking
about the best songs to test stereo's with.  The song was none other than
2112!  They said with its dynamics and style's of music, and also
effects(the flowing water) it was great.  I guess they have seen the
light or they are just big fans.  I think both.
One more thing.  I have always been amazed by how mature the band is.
They were around 23 when they wrote 2112, whom to this day has written an

Given the number of submissions from the "elder" set, I thought I would
throw out a vague inquiry regarding an interview with Rush back
in the early 1980's.  Although I was only 13 or so at the time, I can
remember an interview with Neil, Alex, and Geddy that was probably part of
a promotion for their most recent album at the time (MP?).  I wish I had
specfics, but what was unique about this interview, and why I recall it, is
that Alex's interview was partially conducted in an airplane that he was
flying.  (For those that may not know, Alex has his private pilot's license.)
Does anyone have this on tape, know where I could find this interview, etc.?
Better yet, does anyone else recall this interview?

Secondly, I know the question as to what/who is the "Gangster of Boats" has
been posed to Geddy on Rockline and thrown around a bit on the NMS, but I've
had a theory where this originates from, and it ties in with Rush's sense of
humor and recordings on the island of Monseratt (Caribbean).  Having heard
a "gangster" story on a sailing trip off of Barbados back in 1987, I'd be glad
to share it with any "inquiring minds who want to know."  I'd include
it in this post, but since it is a "theory" and not fact, I'm relucant to
do so in a forum where jokes and theories often get twisted into bizarre
rumors.  Anyway, for what it's worth...

    Let's see how many posts this one causes. I remember seeing Mahogany
    Rush in some pretty dumpy bars around the Chicago area in the late 70's
    and early 80's. They are not RUSH. I was going through the local Tower
    last weekend and was suprised to see several Mahogany Rush CDs. I didn't
    take a close look at any of them, but my guess would be that the same
    NYC outfit that is rereleasing a lot of the old 70's stuff (Hawkwind,
    Babe Ruth, etc.) and manufacturing the CDs in Canada may be responsible
    for the Mahogany Rush releases. All I can remember of their music is
    that it HURT. The bars they played in sucked acoustically. But it must
    have been somewhat OK, because I made the effort to see them several
    times. Led Zeppelin hurt too, but what sweet pain ...

Hi, Y'all.

I don't know if Vincent Desiderio is kidding or not about Rush fans moshing,
but the only time I ever hit the floor for a general admission Rush show
(Pensacola, HYF, 1988), I was front and center and damn near got killed.  The
barricade was way too high, and the crowd was the roughest I've ever seen
(and I've been up front for Van Halen a couple of times--in the old days).
 It wasn't a mosh, but it was certainly painful.

As regards power outages at shows, I've never seen one, but I did hear a
story several years back that I'd like to see verified or denied.  I was
talking to this guy who claimed to have been at a PoW show in (I think)
Kansas City (but it could have been somewhere else in the central US).  He
said that Gary Moore, the opener, got sick and couldn't go on, and Rush
proceeded to play for over THREE HOURS to make up for it.  Anybody know
anything about this?  (I killed the guy in jealosy, so I'd like to know if I
was justified ;).

John Penna, thanks for writing back about my FUBARed "Big Money" CD-Vid.
 Actually, the audio-only tracks play just fine on mine, it's just the video
that's screwed.  You might want to take yours down to an electronics store
and see if your vid has any problems.

Regarding the King Biscuit show and the "joker productions" boot, don't get
ripped off, folks.  There are a ton of boots out there that are just verbatim
copies of the P/G and ESL video soundtracks (and that's exactly what the
above sounds like).  I've been fooled into buying a couple of them, and it
definitely isn't worth it.  Beware.

Subject: Re: Dream Theater, Rush

Hello,

	I would just like to comment on whoever it was that said they
thought Mike Portnoy of DT just bangs around--NOT TRUE-.  He is a very
good drummer.  Rush listens to/likes Dream Theater and vice-versa.  For
those of you who haven't heard DT I would definatley recommend on picking
up the CD.  I think you'll like it.

Subject: Recent sightings of Rush fans

Hello all.  I haven't posted in awhile.  So goes the life of a EE major.
Anyways, I was writing because I just realized I've seen SEVERAL Rush
fans/meorabilia, that I've never noticed before.  The first one that
struck me was on a door across the hall from my room.  Smack in the
middle of the door is a 2112 bumper sticker, with 'Rush' lettered in
silver and all glittery, with a glittery Red Star of the Solar
Federation.  Pretty damn cool.  Haven't seen but a handful of those.
Anyways, today I was in another dorm (for reasons that could incriminate
if I told you... so don't ask!  :), and I saw through a slightly cracked
door a Zildjian poster with Neil on it.  Can't quite tell what era.  It
looked like possibly from POW-HYF era.  He also had a transcript of the
lyrics of Cygnus X-1 Book One on his closet door.  Pretty cool.  Then,
just on my way over to the computer, I glance through a second story
window (which happens to be a girls' floor--- female Rush fan??  Who
would have thought!  ;), and on one wall a 2112 miniposter (smae as the
cover for the album), and on the other wall is a Fly By Night
miniposter.  Also, I think I saw AFTK, but I was too far away to make it
out, and I didn't want to look like a pervert trying to stare through her
window.

Maybe there's a recent growth in the number of fans to keep the spirit
alive, eh?

Until later...
