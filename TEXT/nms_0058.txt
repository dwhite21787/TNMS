Thanks, Dan for an excellent FAQ list!

But:

&gt;Can anyone list everything else that the members of Rush have ever appeared
&gt;on?

Don't forget:  Gowan [Alex]

&gt;Near the end of "The Camera Eye," there are some mumblings that I can't
&gt;quite make out?  Does anybody know for sure what is being said?

At one point, a Londoner says " 'ello, Guv! "

Subject: Rush trivia info

Fellas-
  Regarding 10/1's digest:

I'm not sure about Alex's last name, but Geddy's given name was Gary Leibovitz.

v[ What is your source on this?  This name isn't familiar to me.  :rush-mgr ]

His mother, who had a heavy polish accent, pronounced his name 'Geddy' and 
he legally changed it to same.  Alex's ancestors were from Yugoslavia or 
another E. European country, if I'm not mistaken.

Alex also appears on Larry Gowan's recent release entitled 'Lost Brotherhood.'
It's under 'Gowan' in the store.  Tony Levin (bass) also appears on all tracks.
It's a bit poppy, but the guitar is exceptional (Surprised?)

About the voices, Dan, you got 'em all right! (From Backstage newsletter I 
have at home!)

The club puts out newsletters occasionally ( I haven't received one recently)
but it's a good place to get merchandise, old tour books, etc. at reasonable
prices.

Guys, any word on a new album? If you mentioned it before, sorry! I'm new 
here!  A friend back home in Philly heard the B-Man on the radio and he said 
something may be out around March or so....confirm or deny.

Whoops, Gowan's album is on Atlantic records (I don't know the catalog # as I'm
not with my CDs right now!) If you need the #, let me know.

That's all for now...Any questions, comments, etc. or if you want to run some-
thing by me before posting, just mail me.

Thanks,
M

Subject: Superconductor video

I noticed in the 'FAQL' that there was a video made for 'Superconductor'.
Has anyone seen this????  I try very hard to avoid watching MTV, so maybe
they have played it (once or twice (sarcasm)).

A description of the video would be appreciated.

Has anyone heard for sure if the Chronicles video has been cancelled/
postponed?  That would be a shame.

Finally, if anyone has 'Lock & Key' from the ASOH laserdisc on VHS, please
get in touch with me... I have lots to trade.

Hello,

A few replies to this article:

&gt;From: ddelany@bear.calpoly.edu (Dan Delany)
&gt;Subject: Frequently Asked Questions List (long)
&gt;
&gt;The RUSH Fans Digest Frequently Asked Questions List:  Updated Sept. 29, 1990
&gt;
&gt;What songs has the band made videos for?
&gt;
&gt;[List of approx. 20 videos]
&gt;

Does anyone know if these videos are available anywhere?  Besides the ones
 on the four published videotapes, I have only seen "Time Stand Still" once,
 and "Show Don't Tell" a few times.  Please E-mail me any such info.

&gt;Does anyone have a copy of "A Nice Morning Drive", the Richard Foster
&gt;piece that inspired "Red Barchetta"?
&gt;
&gt;   Yes, this file was posted to the Digest once.  I would rather not
&gt;   include it in this FAQL, due to it's length.  It originally
&gt;   appeared in Road & Track  Nov,1973  pp.148-150.
&gt;

 Could you please E-mail me a copy?

&gt;
&gt;Can anyone list everything else that the members of Rush have ever appeared
&gt;on?
&gt;
&gt;   This is not a complete list.  Please send me your additions!
&gt;
&gt;   Bob & Doug MacKenzie: _Take Off_ (Geddy)
&gt;   _Modern Drummer_ Sound Supplement:  Pieces Of Eight (Neil)
&gt;   Max Webster: _Battlescar_ (Geddy, Alex, & Neil)
&gt;   Jeff Berlin: _Champions_  (Neil)
&gt;   Platinum Blonde: _Alien Shores_ (Alex)
&gt;                    {I'm not sure about that title.}
&gt;   Northern Lights: _Tears Are Not Enough_ (Geddy)
&gt; [ Beyond Borders: Alex and Rick Emmit (sp?)               :rush-mgr ]

The spelling is Rik Emmett, formerly of Triumph.

How about the charity recording Alex played on of "Smoke On the Water" in
 London during the mixdown of Presto?

&gt;
&gt;    Alex says "That's nice" at the end of "Chain Lightning".
&gt;    Alex says "Subdivisions" in the song of the same name.

Isn't it Neil?  Alex only does the lip-synching of the word.

&gt;    The deep voice at the beginning of "Cygnus X-1" is none other than
&gt;      Terry Brown.
&gt;    Neil does the "Attention all planets of the Solar Federation - We have
&gt;      assumed control" bit at the end of "2112".
&gt;    Neil does the narrative during "The Necromancer".

I always thought it was Terry during the Necromancer, and Neil on Cygnus
 X-1.  I could be wrong.

If anyone has these issues, could you please send them to me?  I don't think
I ever got them, and issue 34 (i think) has a nice morning drive on it.

If anyone needs any (other) issues between 23 and 56, i probably have them.

Thanks!

Subject: Catolicism bashing

This is in response to the person who proceeded to bash catholicism:
I am not a dedicated or loyal to the catholic faith to which I belong to,
but I do know that catholicism does not make feel like SHIT.  If it does
I think that would defeat the purpose of this religion.  I don't see how
you can come to that conclusion.  I see this religion as a way to escape
from kaos that goes on in this world.  Nobody can be the perfect saint in
order to go to heaven.   Just doing what you can do best is what will get
you there probably.  

[ I understand this is an emotional subject, and potentially explosive
  as well.  Please try to refrain from any overt bashing here.  (Not that
  you did - just trying to avert anything excalating.  Of course, what
  you do in private e-mail is another story.)  I will say that's I have
  heard both sides from diffent Catholics; I don't think there is any 
  absolute right or wrong answer.  Well, enough meddeling.   :rush-mgr ]

                      As far as Black Sabbath is concerned  they aren't
a rip off of LED Zeppelin because Sabbath was around before Zeppelin and
the contents of their lyrics totally differ from Zeppelin.  One band
concentrates on deep and depressing thoughts while the other has a lot of
sexual basis for some of their songs.  Whoever had said they were the same
is totally wrong!  Also I doubt Ozzy is catholic coming from a country made
of mostly people belonging to the Anglican Church.

I'd like to thank the 27 people who sent me mail with suggestions for`
the FAQL.  (I'd also like to thank the 24 of those who told me that
Neil said 'Subdivisions.'  That helped confirm it...)

On several of the boyz' last albums, they list in the credits lines such
as 'thanks to The Omega Concern'..  Does anyone know who/what this is?

Thanks,

About the real names of Geddy and Alex, I don't know myself what they
are.  But, 'Zvednvinck' (Lifeson) and 'Gary Lee Weinrib' (Geddy Lee) sound
right.  Sorry I couldn't be of any more help.

Subject: Greetings.

[ Just a note for you newer members - Jimmy is (as far as I'm concerned)
  the originator of this list.  He got it off the ground last year as a
  circulated list of userids for individuals to mail to.  Since I had a
  computer at my disposal, I volunteered to take over administration.  It's
  good to have you back with us, Jimmy!                          :rush-mgr ]

Well, it is nice to be back after a long summer without a lot of material
from the Rush Mailing List.  I am working on a file to be released on
Nov. 13 or so.  Some of you, if you've been on here long enough (Dan,
David, and others) may remember that date as the start of the list way
back last year.  Anyways, I will need everyone's help on this for the
1st ever submission of the complete History of Rush Tours.

[ Excellent - I was trying to remember that date myself, to have sort of
  an anniversary edition (collectors item? :-) ).  You should definately
  get together with Dan on this!                                :rush-mgr ]

The file (which I've started compiling using 3 books as references),
is a listing of every tour I could get and the location where the band
has played starting from Pre-Rush all the way through with Presto.
Unfortunately, as most of you know, there is no way I can get all
the dates and places when considering they used to do 300 shows a year!
back in the early days.  What I am asking for is if any of you kept
anything (books, tickets, lists, even bootlegs!) that has a concert
date on it, please send it to me in private email so I can add it to my
list.  I've been using dates from postings and even bootlegs I can find
to  make it as complete as possible.  Of course it can't cover every
single date known but with your help I can at least attempt to make it
as best I can.  With enough additions, I will send in the list to
the Digest every now and again as an update feature.

If you have tour dates or even complete tour listings, please send them
to me at the following email address:

jlang@ucsd.edu

Thanks everyone and it IS GOOD! to be back.
(Hi Dave - got some stuff for ya!! yippee)
