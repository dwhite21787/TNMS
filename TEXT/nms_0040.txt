This has nothing to do with RUSH, but I feel we should observe a moment 
of silence for the passing of one of the legends of guitar, Stevie Ray
Vaughn.  He was killed in a helicopter crash after finishing a concert
at the Alpine Valley Ampetheater on Sunday, Aug. 26th.

I guess Ronnie Van Sant needed great guitar player for his band...

In regards to the Rush on TV query:

2 years ago, ABC's Monday night football played parts of YYZ during half
time.  It was a clip on some of the more nasty sacks in football games.
Although I never imagined YYZ being a good tune to watch football by,
the song was quite appropriate.

I just recently resubscribed to the Rush mailing list and read that
somebody had transcribed some of the tourbooks.  Couls someone mail them
to me, or tell me an address from which to ftp them?

Thanks in advance,

I remember hearing Camera Eye on thaty
oopps.... on that drug episode on 48 hours... I remember being perturbed, it
was almost as if I thought people would associate Rush music with crack.

About 6 years there was a bit on 'PM Magazine' (I don't know if this was a
national show) about big sailing ships.. the background music was the
'To Sleep... Perchance to Dream' segment of La Villa.

About the thing on St. Elsewhere... I saw that too!!! Only thing is , it wasn't
Beneath, Between & Behind... it was Heartbreaker/Living Loving Maid by
Zeppelin...  at first I too thought it was BB&B.. when I realized it wasn't,
I got a better understanding of why the BOYZ were originally called Led Zep
Junior (the riff is exact).

&gt;
&gt;	I am surprised no one got this one...
&gt;    On St. Elsewhere in one of the episodes where the rapist, Peter White,
&gt;comes back in a Drs' dream, the music that is played in the background is
&gt;the beginning of Between, Beside, Behind.

Umm, I'm not a fan but I thought the music in question was by
Led Zeppelin. Anyone out there with a tape of the show want
to check it out?

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ALEX!!!

O.k., what other unlucky soul started school today...?

About those tour book transcriptions, I could do Signals, GUP, and
Presto (well, not all at once!)...Signals is the earliest one I have, so
I don't know how interested you would be since you mentioned you wanted
pre-Signals stuff.

Speaking of Signals, no one has responded to my desperate queries, so
I shall reiterate:  in the Signals tour book there are pictures of the
crew.  does anyone know who is who?  I'd appreciate any info.  Thanx!

Subject: NBC Sports and Rush

As far as I can recall, in the eighties, it was either NBC or ABC Sports that
used many a Rush song as a background track for their spotlight features.
Sometime ago, (I'm not sure what year) NBC Sports ran a piece during the
Tour de France broadcasts spotlighting a particular cyclist. (I don't
remember whom.) Throughout this piece they used Rush's "Grand Designs," as
the music. I remember this one especially because the commentator actually
made a Rush reference in the narrative when he ended the spot with
something to the effect of:
"All in all, [cyclist's name] has proven that he does indeed have "Grand Designs"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I know it's most unusual, to come before you so.
But I've found an ancient miracle, I thought that you should know."

&gt;What date (day, month, year) did Neil join RUSH, and why is it (day/month)
&gt;significant?

Neil joined on Geddy's birthday, July 29th 1974. (I think that's the
right date.) Anyway, that's the significance. Neil mentions this in
the front of the Complete Rush Songbook.

Ron Chrisley asked at various times about a "sea-change":

--| Date: Tue, 31 Jul 90 12:23:19 PDT
--| From: Ron Chrisley &lt;chrisley@parc.xerox.com&gt;
--|
--| A question: what does bringing "a sea-change to the factory floor"
--| mean?  (from "Red Tide")
--|
--| Date: Mon, 6 Aug 90 11:45:26 PDT
--| Also, still wondering what "bringing a sea-change to the factory
--| floor" means, from Red Tide.
--|
--| Date: Fri, 10 Aug 90 16:57:43 PDT
--| Don't worry if you can't understand all the lyrics.  Neil said it
--| was full of in-jokes, and he doesn't expect people to get it all.
--| I know I don't.  I suppose that "bringing a sea-change to the
--| factory floor" is one of those in-jokes, like "he won't need a
--| bed..."

	I haven't seen any other response to this question, so I'll
give it a try.

	There's a passage from Shakespeare, no less, that uses the
words "sea-change."

			ARIEL'S SONG

		Full fathom five thy father lies,
		   Of his bones are coral made:
		Those are pearls that were his eyes:
		   Nothing of him that doth fade,
		But doth suffer a sea-change
		Into something rich and strange.

			_The Tempest_, I.ii.397

The words "sea-change" mean a marked transformation, as to something
richer or finer, as in the forming of a pearl.

	Neil wrote:

		deadline approaches
		for the weary land
		it used to be something
		but we let it run down in our hands
		too late for debate, too bad to ignore
		quiet rebellion leads to open war
		bring a sea-change to the factory floor
		as the red tide covers the shore

	So my guess, and that's all it is, is that the above lines
from "Red Tide" suggest that the smokestack industries that currently
are polluting our water, land, and air, are going to have to be
transformed into something different, hopefully better, by force if
necessary.  The "quiet rebellion leads to open war" line reminds me of
the change in attitude from the gentle "Green Revolution" and "Earth
Day" type of ecological movement we've seen in the last couple of
decades to the more militant and violent "eco-guerillas" we've been
seeing more recently, like some of the Greenpeace folks who ram
whaling ships and others who spike trees to destroy saw blades.  They
(and the rest of us) will (and can) force industry to change their
polluting ways if industry doesn't do it voluntarily.

A part of the song I still can't figure out is:

		The party is disrupted by
		An uninvited guest

Maybe this is one of those "in-jokes"?  Any help on this one?

RRG:
   My spirits are low in the depths of despair
   Purposeful motion
   Against the norms -
   - I get this feeling
   You move me -
   He's cleaning up his systems

Hello out there.

	Well this may not be the place to post it, but I think it has to be
said. Everybody lost a helluva bluesman yesterday. I'm gonna miss Stevie Ray's
music and his shows. I am sure I'm not alone.

	In past weeks, list members have been sending in their favourite
musicians and "ultimate bandmembers" lists and such. I did not send one to the
post. No reason other than not enough time in the day. But, if I had, SRV would
have been in my best guitarists category. For those of you who have not seen
him live, this guy was incredible. Hendrix is respected as one of the best
guitarists/inventors ever. Well, SRV could give him a run for his money. I love
Hendrix, and SRV could do the best Hendrix covers that I have ever heard. Those
of you who have "Couldn't Stand The Weather" have heard his version of Voodoo
Chile (Slight Return) know exactly what I'm talking about. Also, during this
concert year he would close the show with 'Third Stone From The
Sun'.....Fantastic! I hope this is caught on album somewhere, I would love to
have it.  He and his brother Jimmy (Fab T-birds) have an album coming out in
Sept. I have heard a little from it....sounds good.

	Well, I don't have much else to say. If there is anybody out there who
has not heard SRV, do yourself a favor, buy one of his albums. You will not be
sorry.  Damn am I bummed!  Thanks for letting me speak my piece, I feel a
little better.

 Rush-Fans,

   I've been informed by the 'transcriber' of the Hold Your Fire tourbook
  that someone is needed to type in the Power Windows book.  I'll type that
  one in as soon as I can (I have to go home to New Joisey to get it!!)
  That should be around the second or third week in September.
