"Band gives Peart time to grieve"
By DAVID VEITCH -- Calgary Sun

Rush is not in danger of breaking up.

The band is just in a holding pattern.

At least, that's the viewpoint of Alex Lifeson, guitarist for the venerable 
Canadian rock trio, which has no long- or short-term plans beyond the 
Nov. 10 release of the triple-CD live set Different Stages.

Lifeson and bassist-singer Geddy Lee are giving drummer-lyricist Neil Peart 
time to grieve the loss of his wife Jackie to cancer this year, following the 
death of their 19-year-old daughter in a car accident in 1997.

"As far as the band is concerned, we're just waiting for Neil to really get 
better," Lifeson said in a telephone interview yesterday.

"I don't think he'll be the person he was, but I think he will cope with 
life again.

"Hopefully, eventually, he'll be able to find joy in all the things he 
did in life before."

Such as, presumably, playing drums and writing lyrics for Rush.

"I got to think in my heart there are things about what we do that Neil 
really loves a lot and is not prepared to give up," Lifeson said.

But the musician admitted he and Lee, both 45, have "spent hours and hours" 
talking about the tragic turn of events. They've decided there will be no 
Rush without Peart.

"I wouldn't do it," Lifeson said. "I love working with Ged and Ged is my best 
friend.... We would probably continue working together in some form, but 
I don't think it would be Rush. It would never be the same."

Lifeson, a friendly and forthcoming interview, spoke with great gravity when 
discussing the potential end of Rush.

After all, he has spent his entire adult life in the 29-year-old band.

Conversely, he spoke with great excitement about the prospect of future Rush 
studio records and, of course, the imminent release of the band's fourth live 
album (following 1976's All The World's A Stage, 1981's Exit ... Stage Left 
and 1989's A Show of Hands).

Fans will probably be most excited by Disc 3, a previously unreleased 
concert recorded in 1978 at Hammersmith in London, England, during the Farewell 
To Kings tour.

Meanwhile, Discs 1 and 2 are live recordings culled largely from the band's 
last North American tour behind the Test For Echo album. Disc 1 ends with 
the title suite for Rush's 1976 breakthrough album, 2112.

Local Rush fans may be particularly interested in Different Stages, as the 
group bypassed Calgary on both its Counterparts and Test for Echo tours.

The band last played in the city in 1990.

"We don't play 180 shows any more," Lifeson explained. "The last tour was 
about 84, 85 shows.... I know Neil, over the years, is less interested in 
touring than perhaps he was in the past. I mean, we all go through that.

"So, we only had so many days we could work and it was a case of going to 
what's on the A-list."

Although Rush has no future plans, Lifeson ruled out any possibility of a 
compilation of unreleased material.

"We've always had a policy that we only wrote and worked on songs that were 
going to be on the records," he said.

"So we never wrote any more music or recorded any unreleased material ever."

Ever? "We've done a few things in the recording sessions, but they would 
definitely get an X-rating," he offered tantalizingly.

For lyrical content or musical abomination?

Lifeson laughed.

"Mostly lyric," he said, "but actually both when I think about it."

evelate from the norm." anyone else catch this?>>

Yes, everyone else has caught this.  That's not a imperfection, though --
Geddy is deviating from the norm.  He's purposely mispronouncing it.

Frighteningly enough, I've thought about that, too.

i have to disagree.  with only one song from signals, one song from 
presto, and nothing from p/g, power windows, and hold your fire, i feel 
that the heavy synth of the 80's "stage" has been conveniently forgotten. 
 just like some people regret having lived through a decade with such 
mediocre music, rush seem to be pretending they didn't live it.  they 
were originally not going to include anything from signals or presto on 
different stages, while still marketing this album as "the best of rush". 
 that would have left practically the entire 80's off the cd.  but the 
point is, it just doesn't seem like there is much "80's heavy synth" 
represented on different stages.  not meant to be a flame, but just a 
different opinion.  for those of you that think this album represents ALL 
the different stages of rush, keep in mind that a significant part of 
their existence has been excluded.

G'day all,

Rush mgr ; Could you please let us know what time the realtime fancast is
due using GMT, so that international subscribers might be able to plan a
time to get out of bed and hop on the 'net.  I am unsure as to how far
ahead Western Australia is from New York 7pm (EST??) what with some
countries having Daylight Savings and GMT might help. Thanx.

   [ EST is 5 hours behind GMT, so it *should* be 00:00 GMT on November 16th.
     (Tune in 23:59 GMT November 15th if that helps :-)            : rush-mgr ]

Also, can all the Australian NMSers say Hi.  We seem to be crawling out of
the woodwork, but are still poorly represented on this list.  E mail
privately if you like.

Echoing K.Haines posting - I would urge a listen to some great Aussie bands
that are coming up through the ranks;

 Spiderbait
 Powderfinger - an awesome band from Brisbane, who I am surprised have not
hit the big time after their HUGE album "Double Allergic". These guys even
sound like Rush on some songs. Definitely worth a listen (and if you like
Live, then you may also enjoy Powderfinger).

>...and of course, Silverchair.

Looking forward to interupting my Halloween party just after midnight on
Saturday and turning on all the lights as Glenn passes over Perth in the
shuttle.
Guess which song I'll have timed to kick in at 12.30...

Wow!! Was he in Japan?? On a racing??
I have not heard anything about his presence,
even though being myself here in Japan.
I wonder what race was he in......

 Ryo (a cyclist in Japan)>>>

I started wondering the same thing (as to why Neil was "testing" a bike in
Japan, not being in a race, that is....). I could be a wise-acre about it and
say that he was at Suzuka when he looked in his mirrors and saw either an F1
car or a 500cc GP bike catching him and he missed the apex of the 130R at
150mph. Nah.   ;)
I do wonder where he was at (Suzuka, Twin-Ring Motegi, Fuji, etc.) and *why*
he was there. Perhaps someone in charge of the track is a Rush fan, eh? 
And, oh, yes. Put your money on Mika. (And look closely at the TV Saturday
night. Perhaps Neil will be in the pits...)     :)

Subject: Did Geddy EVER played with a pick ?

Laureti David asked:

No.  And certainly not in '91.  I have an interview from that time where
he states that the twangy sound he gets is from the heavy nail on his
middle finger, due to said finger being smashed when he was young. 
(Hey!  I have the SAME finger!!!!)

AFIK, Ged's sound has ALWAYS been fingers, and those little triplets he
does HAVE to be fingers.  

Sorry.  I don't know what gauge pick Alex uses.  Perhaps he dropped one
and Ged recovered it and threw it?

AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE insomnia!!!!!!!!!! I have school

Anyhoo, about Geddy's pick: He may not play with a pick, but members
of rock bands have been known to toss large quantities of guitar/bass 
picks into the audience as souveniers. I don't recall if Geddy did
this at the concert I saw, but I wouldn't be surprised if he does,
even though he doesn't use them.

I can confirm Geddy using a pick. One of my best Rush experiences was
back on the Permanent Waves Tour, when I was lucky enough to be front
row for all five nights at the Hammersmith Odeon, London. As the last
note was struck of Xanadu, the stage lights went off and Geddy leaned
forward and pressed his pick into the palm of my outstretched hand. I
also got four used drum sticks and one of Alex's broken strings.

I can still smell the dry ice.

Subject: Dog Years Recalculated

There has been some renewed comment about Dog Years in TNMS recently, so I
thought the following might be of interest. Here in the UK, we have had some
news coverage about the country's oldest dog, a papillon aged 27. The stories
added that this was equivalent to 150 for a human. Surely, though, "In a
dog's life, a year is really more like seven", so that should be 189.
Apparently not. It seems that the "experts" have reconsidered their opinion
and concluded that a dog year is really 5 1/2 human years, so that's 148 1/2.
"In a dog's life, a year is really more like five and a half"... Doesn't
quite work, does it?

On songs like "Xanadu" and "A Passage to Bangkok", Geddy played rhythm
guitar and bass pedals on his Rickenbacker doubleneck while Alex played his
solo.  DUring the rest of the song, he played the upper part of the guitar
as his usual bassist-self.

       With the release of "Different Stages" the movie "Pleasentville"

movie is about someone who has discovered something "wondrus" and brings 
it to the town "the preists". they reject it, though some people decide 
to follow it (the elders).  And so everything turns to crap and the 
elder race end's up beating the preists and taking over.  Same basic 
idea, but shoot me in the head with that quad shotgun if you want

Hey guys n dolls,

I just picked up issue one of a new UK rock magazine called Classic Rock. On
page 9 a titbit about DS.

ALL THE WORLD'S A DIFFERENT STAGE
Rush to release fourth live album in November

Rush, recently seen on the Small Soldiers soundtrack with a remix of 'Tom
Sawyer', have a new triple live album entitled 'Different Stages', ready for
release on November 17 
<*is this the UK release date?? No matter I have my Japanese copy on order,
hee hee>
The first 2 albums were taken from the 1993/94 'Counterparts' and '96's
'Test For Echo' tours, and the third is from their legendary Hammersmith
Odeon concert in February 1978.
The tracks are:

<snipped, we all know them now don't we....>

Comments drum maestro Neil Peart: "On the last two tours we've been playing
at a level we've not reached in terms of musicianship, accuracy, band
tightness and excitement. On live albums it's such a hard balance. Sometimes
we make them too polished, sometimes too raw. This time we're really trying
to get everything."
The band, already notorious for their dislike of the road, have announced
that they have no plans to tour for the next two years. This is due in part
to the tragic death of Peart's wife Jackie from cancer. Classic Rock sends
it's sincere condolences to Peart.

All in all this is the first positive thing on Rush I have seen in the press
for years. Not since the early days of Kerrang and Sounds! In a recent
article in 'Q' about Marylin Manson a snide reference to his Rush T-shirt
was made........
Bastards..............

Sad really.

Subject: UK MAGAZINE PART DEUX

Me again,

Delved further into Classic Rock. Next issue they are running an article on
Rush. I'll keep you posted....

Finally they have a bit about the 10 best live albums of all time they are:

1. Live and Dangerous - Thin Lizzy
2. Alive - Kiss
3. One More From The Road - Lynyrd Skynyrd
4. If You Want Blood....You've Got It - AC/DC
5. At Budokan - Cheap Trick
6. Strangers In The Night - UFO
7. Live Rust - Neil Young
8. Live At Leeds - The Who
9. Live After Death - Iron Maiden

and... wait for it...
10. All The World's A Stage - Rush

It had this beside it....
" Before Rush got too clever and discovered keyboards, they really could
rock, as demonstrated on 'ATWAS'. The first of what will soon be four live
albums over a massively productive career, this marries short rockers like
'Anthem' and 'Fly By Night' with epics like '2112' and By-Tor and the Snow
Dog, climaxing with the awesome 'What You're Doing'. At the end
bassist/squealer Geddy Lee can be heard extolling the virtues of the show in
question in vociferous fashion!"

Eh, quite! 

Positive-ish, really. 

All in all not bad for a Thursday afternoon.

Greetings All,
    I have spent some time with DS and I must say it is incredible. The guitar
tones on the beginning of "Natural Science" are mind blowing. They actually do
the backwards masking on the vocal in the quantum leap section. I don't recall
hearing it on the TFE tour.
     Geddy's vocals on 2112 are the best I have heard him sing on live
material, man the lad can put some feeling and emotion into his voice. The
packaging is sweet, it is not in a plastic jewel bow but a triple fold paper
one. One must relay know their Rush trivial in understanding the collage of
stuff in the inner photograph

Hi Rush-heads,

One of the prog-rock magazines from The Netherlands has asked their readers
to contribute for a CD section called the pro-rock classic album.
I'm written a contribution, which I'll submit this week. Unfortunately for
most people on this list, the article is written in Dutch, which was a

translation in English and contribute this to the list.

RUSH - Hemispheres

'To be continued' was a promise Neil Peart made at the end of 'Cygnus X-1',
the closing song on the album 'A Farewell to Kings'.
Through the sister of a good friend of mine, I got in touch with the music
of Rush in 1977. She played a tape with 'A Farewell to Kings' and I must
that it sounded very pleasing to my ears. In no time, I bought all existing
LP's and the long wait for new material from my Canadian heroes began. The
wait was made bearable by playing the old records to death.
On the day 'Hemispheres' was released, I raced home from school, making a
record breaking pit stop at the local record store to grab hold of a copy of
the album. Arriving at home, a quick hello was all my family got from me and
I raced to my room to put the black disk on my turntable. The needle slowly
descended to the surface and for the next 40 minutes, my ears were devoted
to only one thing.

The first side of the LP was completely filled with the title track
Hemispheres, the promised sequel to Cygnus X-1. It surpassed the appetiser
of the previous album completely. An original, top class SF story, nicely
told and accompanied by beautiful, varied music. Bombastic symphonic pieces
alternated with melodic hardrock and lovely acoustic guitar. My mind was
still buzzing when I flipped the record over.
Side 2 opened with the heavy rock song 'Circumstances'. Both musically and
lyrically a very nice song indeed. 
Next were the soft tones of Alex Lifeson caressing the strings of an
acoustic guitar, the intro to 'The Trees'. A song built to Rush standards,
with a calm (acoustic) into, which builds into a heavy rock song. And of
course very nice lyrics written by Neil Peart.
'Things can't get any better,' were my thoughts at that moment. Until 'La
Villa Strangiato' erupted. The subtitle promised all the best: "An exercise
in self-indulgence". This instrumental is one of the best songs Rush have
ever recorded in their long career. Virtuosity on drums, bass and guitar in
a magnificent piece of music.

'With the heart and mind united in a single, perfect sphere' are the final
words of Neil Peart in Hemispheres. He couldn't have described the
perfection of this album any better.
