I think our band is truly dead in America (not in our hearts of course)..
I swear that if it were not for TNMS I would'nt have even known that
"Different Stages" was released..
NO KIDDING !!!!!!
No flyers, no advertising, NO NOTHING !!!!!
Maybe in the bigger cities but here in the great center of
Wisconsin.......NOTHING !!!!!

I do wonder why the record company does'nt market the CD like they do other
artists ????
Don't get me wrong.....I am surley not saying Rush should "sell out"...NOT
AT ALL!!!!
BUT #35 to #97 ??????   ....This is a MUST cd for even the modest Rush fan
!!! (for lack of better terms).
yeah Yeah I know....it's a LIVE 3 CD set...it's not expected to sell as
well....BUT STILL !!!!!
For a band with such a huge fan base I figured that sales would be much
higher...
I think it's pretty obvious that the "word" is NOT out !!!!
THANK YOU CANADA.....for keeping these guys in business...

Here's a quick quiz for all my fellow RUSHians.  This just popped into =
mind while on the plane from Frankfurt to Ankara, TU (I work for the US =
government in Turkey). =20

What famous "prime time" show used a RUSH song in the intro (opening) =
segment of its broadcast?  This obviously is not something too difficult =
to figure out.  OK here's a hint for the confused (anyone under 18), the =
show aired on NBC during the mid to late 80's.  Tell you the truth, I am =
not sure whether or not the show still exists.=20
If I told you the RUSH "tune" it would certainly narrow it down a bit =
but why make it easy!  While you are chompin' on that, something that I =
would like to express regarding another Canadian power trio.  First of =
all, RUSH has been a part of my life since the 1979 (I am 30 yrs old =
now).  It was RUSH and only RUSH for me, hell I thought I might have =
been there biggest fan, I think most of us view ourselves within the =
same context.  Their lyrics and mystic sound has been an inspiration for =
me (good and bad times).  Getting back to the other group-Triumph has =
also influenced the turn of events in my life but definitely a distant =
second to RUSH.  I remind you that the Triumph I am referring to had the =
guitar virtuoso Rik Emmett.  I don't listen to Triumph anymore since =
they replaced Rik with a "monkey pumper".  Even today, I only listen to =
RUSH and "old" Triumph.  Now that would be the fantasy concert for me =
(of course, Triumph would be the opening band).  Nevertheless, Triumph =
also has (I mean) had the lyrics magnifico contained in their albums too =
(not quite like my RUSH though).  Sorry for the inconvenience in the =
lengthy post. =20
=20
So don't forget the quiz at hand and lets see how many of you will =
remember the show and the tune???

Hola Rush Fanatics,

I've been keeping up with the comments on Neil's drum solo.  I've got my own
input to the matter, and it's completely up for debate.  Here goes:

Although I don't think of Neil of much of a swinger, I made the connection
between his solo and the tribute CD he produced in honor of Buddy Rich,
"Burning for Buddy."  I'm thinking he got some inspiration for some of his
introductory soloistic material from Max Roach's "The Drum also Waltzes:
Part 1 & 2."  Take a listen.  

Also, if you're into listening to Neil try his hand at swing, he's the
featured drummer on "Cotton Tail" (Track 4 on "Burning for Buddy")  For
those of you who appreciate big-band and awesome drumming, I highly
recommend this CD.

See you in Xanadu,

I have experienced yet another event in which Rush, and subsequently me, 
were totally ignored.

My band was interviewed for a local magazine and the interviewer asks 
what each of us listened too.  I of course said RUSH.  It was left out 
of the article and everyone else's favorites were listed.  So not only 
was I ignored again as the drummer, but Rush was ignored.  I just 
thought it was kind of funny but a little sad too.  Later,

To da drummers:

Question: Concerning the floor/foot pattern that Neil plays at the =
beginning of the DS Rhythm Method solo (Bass Drum once and hi-hat or =
tambourine twice in triplet pattern), aint that called an *Ostenato*? =
Neil must have picked that pattern up from Terry Bozio. Now there's a =
guy who can play the expletive out of ostenatos! The DS solo blew me =
away. Less athletic than the other live album solos but more... musical.

     I just like saying "Ostenato" (and "Plutonium" of course)

Subject: Why Does it Happen?

Once again, we've been f$%#'d by the record companies.  Not by our beloved
band (more on that below), but by U2 and/or Island Records.  

I took a break from Different Stages today and popped in the U2 Best of 80-90.
One of my favorite songs of all time for its complexity, intricacy, weaving,
etc., is "New Year's Day".  So I'm jamming to New Year's Day and the song
fades out 1:30 before its supposed to!!!  I was s@*&ing my pants!  The whole
extended instrumental section that ends with "and so we're told, that this is
the golden age...." is gone!  A similar crime would be to put "Natural
Science" on a best of and leaving off part III.  I checked the length of the
disk, and its only got 65 minutes, so why chop 1:30?  I have been told,
however, that the cd single of "The Sweetest Thing" has two previously
unrealeased cuts from the '83 show at Red Rocks, songs not featured on "Live
Under A Blood Red Sky", so at least they did something nice for the fans.  

As far as Different Stages goes, for those of you that count minutes, disk 1
is 70:54 (plus the Clusterworks program) and disk 2 is 69:15, not bad, eh?
Disk 3 is only 62:38, but Ged sed songs with poor vocal performances were
purposly deleted from the show.  Thanks to the Russian Rushian, Erik Depoy,
who gave a lengthy description in NMS 2069, we know that only Lakeside Park,
Closer to the Heart, 2112, and Neil's Drum Solo were deleted from the show.
I'm assuming from Ged's comments that Lakeside Park didn't "do it" for him,
and they didn't want to duplicate songs already featured on the first two
disks.

For all you good law-abiding Rush fans... DON'T follow that idiot denimking's
suggestion to try to rip off BMG by claiming you didn't receive a shipment.  
That's called fraud.  It's also a federal offense to fuck around with the 
mail.  You think Clinton's got problems - just wait til you get your own 
independent prosecutor up your arse.

I understand that for 9 out of 10 Rush fans, this note is unwarranted since 
most of us have the good sense not to engage in this dope's stunts (yeah, 
Adam, your "friends" do it not you.  I know, I know).  But for some of the 
younger fans who may not have been properly brought up yet - do the right 
thing and pay for the CDs.  Theft is a crime.  Denimking is a loser for even 
suggesting it.

>I have been a "tourist" now for over a year and a HUGE RUSH FAN for about 16

I have also been a "tourist" off and on this Digest for sometime, and a Rush
fan since '76 when a friend of mine first played 2112 for me on an old GE
cassette player,(it doesn't seem like 22 years ago!). Rush has been my
favorite band ever since!  My first concert was on their AFTK tour.
The good old days of general admission and the absence of "pat down"
searches!

To drum solo or not to drum solo, or Greg Sanderson's comment on "The Rhythm
Method", Greg I respect everyone's right to their opinion, even if it's 
wrong. ;-) As an amateur drummer and dyed-in-the-wool Rush fan, I love The 
Rhythm Method on DS, and all of Neil Peart's other drum solo's for that 
matter!  As far as being the least-listened-to track, when I make up a Rush 
tape to listen to I always include the drum solo's.  And I will be doing the 
same with DS' The Rhythm Method.  Neil Peart is a master of his craft, and 
for me, listening to his solo is listening to the master at work.
A Rush concert wouldn't be complete without the drum solo, and a Rush live
album release wouldn't represent their concert work without the drum solo
either. So Greg, keep skipping the drum solo tracks if you want, and those
of us who enjoy them will keep listening.
Greg, don't take this as a flame, its just my opinion, even if it's wrong.

I for one am glad that Geddy found those old recordings from '78 and
included them on DS.  Thanks Geddy!

I don't know what compelled me finally post.  Maybe it was that '78 CD from
DS, it really brought back some good memories.

Sweet memories, actually, reminding and giving me a reason why.

Peace,
Phil Mc.

Greetings all. Long time reader, rare poster. Alex Lifeson called in to WDHA
here in north Jersey today and was interviewed for a few minutes. He said that
Neil is coming along slowly and that they will discuss the future of RUSH next
year. He didn't say that a new Victor album was in the works, only that he was
renovating his home studio and had an interest in doing another Victor album.
He also stated that he received a couple of offers to do movie scores. Just

With humor so scarce in TNMS, this guy is a refreshing twist.  His acronym

Empty Lives ... this is a much better B.O.W.E.L. movement. I would have to

    Personally, I would have paid for Different Stages if all it =

I actually prefer the studio versions (except for trees and xanadu on =
exit stage left).  The live albums are the only place you can find the =
drum solos and I listen to them more often than the other live cuts.  =
The drum solo is a great part of the concert, and in my opinion a great =
part of the live albums.  But we all know the story about opinions. =20
    For those of you who haven't done so already, try to keep the 3/4 =
bass drum high hat beat going (R,L,L,R,L,L) and do anything meaningful =
with your hands at the same time.  This is how the drum solo begins; it =

Subject: Prime Factor - A parody in several verses

For the past few months, I have been wasting away in a remedial math class
because I forgot to take the math placement test.  I suppose it's what I
deserve. Anyway, I have plenty of free time in the class to work on other stuff,
and I came up with this parody of Prime Mover.  It isn't completely accurate or
on topic, as I had to shuffle some things to get it all to rhyme, but the final
product comes off nicely.

Prime Factor
 ---- ------

Basically sequential, easy to derive
Just look for numbers
That simply, won't divide

Alternating digits in mathematical view
Rational equations tell them what to do
(Anyone can factor)

>From the point of a decimal
To an inverse cosine
>From the square of a fraction
To the sum multiplied

>From the start of a problem
To the equal sign
The point of prime factors is to help you divide
(Anyone can factor)

Basic computation on the number line
Can it be determined
By those number's prime?

Alternating digits form beneath your hands
Chose your number system, degrees or radians
(Anyone can factor)

>From the point on a compass
To the circle's edge
Now figure the angle of the bisected wedge

>From the exponential --
"Times ten to the fifth"
Prime number composites are what you're working with
(Anyone can factor)

I turn the abacus over
Resetting all of the beads
Calculate prime numbers
Start with one, two, three

Dividing four is easy
Because it isn't prime
Keep the five and seven
Skip six, eight, and nine--
(Anyone can factor)

Subject: Hammersmith

Hi there

Hammersmith was very dear to me (I now live in Ireland). The wonderful
Odeon is now called the Labbatts Apollo - which is kind of ironic. I was
at the '78 shows and DS brings it all back to me. Many Many bands played
the Odeon until the late '80s. I remember seeing Van Halen support Black
Sabbath there before VH1 was UK released - never go to the bar during a
support ... you never know who you may miss!. Sadly the 'Apollo' is now
home to Riverdance and other such shows - Oh well. The Odeon used to
have nearly a band a night, but the local old peoples home complained
for many years of the noise of fans and trucks - I suppose we will all
be old one day.

The Palais? Another awesome venue. Much smaller, but lots of atmosphere.
Best show I saw there was Siouxsie & the Banshees Kaleidoscope Tour. Its
now a disco. It was a dance hall in the 60's so I suppose it has gone
full circle.

We did have a third venue ... The Clarendon. This was the best of the
bunch. Dirty, dark, cramped and sweaty - but what fun. The best British
band ever ... the Damned once did a tour of Hammersmith and played all
three venues. Now an office and shopping complex sits firmly on top of
this once hallowed hall.

Unfortunately I cannot answer the question about the difference between
odeon/palais, but it does reinforce many a bands closing line to the
London audiences " Hamersmith - You are the rock'n'roll capital of the
World!" ... Well it was.

Subject: Odeon

G'Day all,

Hanstones asked where the word odeon came from. This is from their UK
webiste :

	The name "Odeon" has it's roots in entertainment and is actually
derived from the name of a huge amphitheatre which stood in ancient Athens.
It is not, as many believe, an acronym for Oscar Deutsch Entertains Our
Nation. 

	Oscar Deutsch, Odeon's founder, established the first Odeon in
Birmingham in 1930. With films in the 30's and 40's commanding huge
interest, Odeon rapidly became a nation-wide chain of cinemas which was
eventually sold in 1941 to J Arthur Rank and now popularly known as The Rank
Group Plc. 

	The huge estate of 318 cinemas was built up through a combination of
new cinema development and acquisition of other existing cinema chains, for
example, Gaumont and Paramount. The 1930's cinema building boom actually
created an architectural style still referred to today as the "Odeon style".

	It is this heritage which has led to the word "Odeon" being
considered by both the British public and the Film Industry as synonymous
with Cinema. 

Cheers.

Bezza

Subject: DS Review in Q

G'Day All,

Following review of DS is in this months Q magazine.....It was written by
Stuart Maconie and he awarded three stars out of five :

	Whopping triple CD live bonanza from still sprightly Canadian
threesome

	Having never been at any stage of their career been fashionable -
although Geddy Lee and Placebo's Brian Molko are vocally interchangeable -
Rush have never lost their fanbase. Unnoticed they still make a very
respectable living and legions flocked to last year's American tour whence
comes most of this hefty package. This judiciously mix newer Rush  -
essentially a slick modern Rock trio as evinced on Animate & Nobody's Hero -
with the pyrotechnic conceptualist of yore : 2112 is performed in its
entirety and the FM radio hits Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio and Closer To The
Heart are included. A Juicy extra come sin the form of a CD of a 1978 London
show when they were a very hot ticket and proving that a) Xanadu is a 70s
pomp rock classic up there with Stairway To Heaven and b) never in the
annals of rock have three blokes made such a formidable racket.

At least he's had a listen and done some basic homework !

Subject: DS Review

I've been an NMS subscriber for several years but reading the following FOUR-
STAR review of Different Stages (by David Lynch in the November 27th edition
of the Austin Chronicle) prompted me to end my years of passive participation
in the NMS newsgroup. (My apologies if this review has already been posted.) I
was readying myself for a one-star negative review by some idiot who couldn't
name any song by Rush other than Tom Sawyer, but much to my surprise it was a
bit better. Incidentally, of the 20 new albums reviewed, very few obtained
four stars (not even the Stones' latest) and only one earned a five-star
rating....Teletubbies: The Album!!!  

To recreate the original, shimmering-crystal intro to "Natural Science," Rush
piped an acoustic guitar through speakers suspended from trees surrounding a
pond; a microphone placed in a boat to capture the luxuriant chords as they
bounced off water and ping-ponged between trees. Sure, for a similar effect
the band could have simply processed the guitar through a little black box,
but for Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart only the creative best will
do. On the latest from the Canadian trio, the entirely live Different Stages,
the luscious reverb of "Natural Science" and the remaining 30 cuts is created
by concert halls. The first two discs are culled from setlists from the band's
last tour, concerts which featured re-energized selections from their
extensive catalog, creating a "best of" amalgam from such gems as the extended
bass-fueled "Driven," the complete 2112 suite, and a rousing version of their
existential chef d'oeuvre "Freewill." And unlike Rush's three prior live
albums (the too-raw All the World's A Stage, and the too-polished Exit...Stage
Left, and A Show of Hands), Different Stages strikes a perfect balance between
polish and punch. Fans of Rush's older material will be thrilled with a bonus
third disc, a previously unreleased 1978 performance from London's Hammersmith
Odeon. No questions and no debate. Different Stages is the Rush desert island
release.

Subject: All stages for all people

Here's one fan for whom The Rhythm Method is perhaps the most-listened-too
track on DS, O.K., there are a few others which get as much play, but it
ranks right up there.
For those upset it was included on the album, please learn to be grateful.
Isn't it enough that the guys gave us nearly two and a half hours of music,
then treated us to a bonus disc?
Some have said that a drum solo is great live, but has no place on an
album. Isn't a live album, especially one this length, supposed to be a
reflection of a live show? That one reason bootlegs are popular. They
capture, in most cases, an entire show. So the guys took a stab at the
bootleggers and put out a great package of their own to which no bootleg
could compare, at least not one I've heard.
As a drummer - drummers make up a large segement of Rush fans by the way -
the drum solo has been a welcome part of each live album. I still grit my
teeth when I hear the abbreviated version of The Rhythm Method on A Show of
Hands.
The newer version is incredible, worth the price of DS by itself. It
showcases Peart's tremendous talents for playing, composing and triggering.
It also lets him pay tribute to one of his heroes, Buddy Rich. If you
listen closely to certain passages, you can hear pieces of America from
West Side Story, one of Rich's most well-known solos.
Enough rambling. Those wanting to skip The Rhythm Method, please do so at
your own peril. Let the rest of us enjoy it. And, here's a promise. If
Neil's solo is left off the next live album, I'm coming after you.

The most endangered species,
The honest man,
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I just have a few comments on a couple of recent posts that suggest
obtaining re-mastered CD's through dishonest means.

1. One post suggested a way to "take advantage" of a music store chain by
taking your old CD in and lie about it being 'broken' or 'skipping' to exchange
it for a copy of the enhanced CD!  This little "upgrade" scheme is out right
theft!

2. Another post suggests ordering the enhanced CD's through mail order and
then lie and say you didn't receive them and your not paying for them!  (I
have a cousin who has done this, as well as numerous other stupid things, and I
haven't had anything to do with the low-life for years!)

   Of course the poster of this little scheme adds a disclaimer to absolve
   himself.  Oh, here's a way to be a thief, of course I don't recommend it.
   If you don't recommend it, don't post it!

Each time we alter the focus
To make the wrong move seem right
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --
One post says, "You got nothing to lose"!
You've got everything to lose!
Who you are is what you will lose!

I ask the question, who are you deceiving?  The big music store chain and
the mail order company?  Or yourselves?

Those companies don't stay in business by taking losses, they pass the cost
off to their other customers through increased prices!

You are defined by your actions, what your think, say and do!  Lying,
cheating, and stealing are actions that define who you are, someone who can't be
trusted!

You may think "It's only some CD's", is your personal honor that cheap?
Stealing is stealing, it doesn't matter if it's a CD or an armored car full 
of money, it's still theft!

An alternative way to obtain the enhanced CD's
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---
I advocate going out and buying them!  If you don't already have a job, get one.
If you don't make enough money at your current job, change jobs or get a second
job.  Or, budget your money, hold off on the cigarettes for while, don't buy
those lottery tickets this week, and get a 6-pack instead of a case for your
"weekender".

Then take the money that you've earned and BUY the enhanced CD's!

   [ Not to mention I've found many of the remasters showing up at used Cd
     stores. The retrospectives too!                              : rush-mgr ]

A few final thoughts
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---
Why are you even bothering to get the enhanced CD's?  It sounds like you
didn't listen very closely to the old CD's.

Please post any future instructions on how to lie, cheat, and steal on a
digest that is about Lying, Cheating, and Stealing, I'm sure there's one out 
there.

I'm sorry if my little "rant" sounds "preachy", but enough is enough!

Hopefully I'm not in the minority on this issue.

Thanks for listening,

Phil Mc.

P.S.
Rush music has lyrics you can live by, but you have to listen!

Just thought I'd offer a quote from Babylon 5:

Franklin: He's agnostic.
Ivanova: Then I'll say half a prayer for him.

Personally, I believe that prayer and/or magic work because of the 
energy/emotion put into it by the one praying/working magic. If we
to pray for/ send emotional healing energy to Neil, it might work
because *we* believe it; the fact that he doesn't believe in it
would prevent him from doing it himself, but it might not necessarily
block the results of someone else's prayer/magic, especially if he
doesn't know about it to say "oh, that'll never work" and therefore
block it.

Subject: DS review in UCLA newspaper

Hey all.  Just thought you'd all like to read another review of DS (not
by one of us, but by the newspaper at my school).
Here is the review in the Daily Bruin of DS in today's paper (12/2/98):

Rush - "Different Stages - Live"

    Rush's fourth live release comes just in time to celebrate their
30th anniversary as the world's best known "thinking man's hard-rock
band."  Since it's 1976 breakthrough with the futuristic "2112" (an
album based on the writings of Ayn Rand), all of the band's albums have
gone either gold or platinum.
    Rush consists of a power trio of Canadian virtuosos, all who
regularly appear in the top 5 of music magazine readers' polls.  The
band has had its ups and downs through its lengthy history, highlighted
by the four-million album selling "Moving Pictures" in 1981, which
marked the transition from epic ballads to shorter, punchier pieces.
    The two discs of "Different Stages" are a compilation of live
performances taken from six shows between 1994-97, concentrating heavily
on recent compositions.  The third disc is taken from a single set at a
1978 London show, arguably the band's peak year.
    The trademark screeching vocals of bassist Geddy Lee have indeed
calmed down through the years to a mere soothing whine, Herculean
drummer Neil Peart has taken on the appearance of an aging WWF star and
guitarist Alex Lifeson has finally joined the Hair Club for Men.
    Despite the physical alterations, Rush continues to rock the crowd.
This is evidenced by the masses of screeming fans in the background, the
blistering guitar maneuvers, the orchestrated syncopation and the surge
of pure adrenalinistic sonic resonation, which might cause someone like
Jakob Dylan to discharge all over his plastic Fender.
    Tracks range from newer, failed singles ("Test for Echo") to
resurrected epics ("2112") to guaranteed crowd pleasers ("Tom Sawyer").
Probably the most interesting songs are found on the 1978-set disc, as
this was the more typical, hard-core Rush fans know and love.  Pieces
like the 12 minute, 30 second "Xanadu" drench the listener with all the
grandiosity of progressive rock at its height, and typify the grace of a
bygone era - one just before popular music tastes collapsed into disco
and new wave.
    All and all, "Different Stages" is essential for anyone who calls
themselves a Rush fan.  For those who don't might try starting out with
something more typical like "Moving Pictures," as the live experience
can be better appreciated after exposure to studio recordings.  Either
form taken into consideration, Rush is bad ass.

Interesting review.  It's kind of cool to see Rush called "bad ass."
