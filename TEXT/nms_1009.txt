Hiya'

 jes lil' ol' me back from Laser RUSH to tell folks:  SEE IT!

It was alot o'fun, cool beans man!  If you're in Seattle,Land of the
Latte, you must go.  It plays every Tuesday night at 7:30 and 9:00pm at
the Pacific Science Center (next to the Space Needle, can't miss it).
Two fellow NMS'ers, Paul Goracke and Mike Weintraub, and I went to the
show last night and had our ears and eyes blasted by the incredible light
show and tunes.  The show wasn't nearly long enough, but the boys have 20
years worth o'albums, eh?  Subdivisions, at nearly concert levels, as
well as Presto (a welcome suprise!) were just  GREAT!  To think that I've
lived here for two years and I finally went!  And it only cost $3!  Yes
that's right, $3!

 Now, if we could only get the boys to play Seattle on the next tour!

Date: Wed, 24 Aug 1994 14:06:51 -0700 (PDT)

Fellow TNMS-ers,

I'm interested to know your first experiences with Rush- about how you got
into the group.  Which particular song blasted you into the Rush Realm?

For me...

I remember back in about 1981 or so, I saw a Permanent Waves cassette in my
brother's bedroom.  Stuck it in the player, didn't think it was that great
(at that time, I was a little punk that listened to Ted Nugent).  Around
the same period of time, I went into my OTHER brother's room and saw a
Moving Pictures cassette lying on the floor.  I stuck it into a tape player
and took a listen.  Hmm, not bad, I thought, as I listened to Tom Sawyer.
Then I heard Red Barchetta, and the part where Alex simulates a car on his
guitar gave me goose bumps.  My interest really started there.  After a
very short time, I couldn't play Moving Pictures loud enough.  Vital Signs
was my absolute favorite song for years (it's still in my top 10, among
other Rush, Yes, Kansas, Genesis), and for me it had major emotive-yanking
capability.  It was an immense song for me.  So I'd say that Red Barchetta
was the teaser and Vital Signs was the grabber, but then I loved them all.

>From the period of time between 1981 and 1982, just before getting Signals,
I saw the New World Tour concert, and then became a loyal fan (I still have
imagery of the space shuttle separating from its main tank displayed on
their rear projection screen burned into my mind).  Bought nearly every
album they had (over many months) and came to really love them and the
atmosphere each album seemed to have.   Signals came out, and I instantly
loved it.  I was hooked.  The fanatacism set in.  But that's another
topic...

How about you?

Ok, here's a new topic that might get us away from the EQ and
love/sex thing. Or maybe not. But what the hell:

Where were you and what were doing when you _first_ heard the _first_
single off any given RUSH album(s). That is, "Force 10", not "TSS", or
"Dreamline", not "Bravado". Please be as specific as your memory
allows.

Why? Well, why not? I'm curious to see how deeply ingrained these
memories may or may not be. I'll start, and hopefully you'll follow...

(Only have time for one right now):
"Stick it Out": first heard as I was flying down route 128, somewhere
just south of the Mass Pike. It was getting dark. The DJ announced the
song, so I knew what it was going to be, but I was _so_ unprepared for
what came out of my speakers. I remember laughing maniacally and
feeling euphoric, and I called my college roomates as soon as I got
home to tell them  so we could start planning for the concerts.

more later.....

Subject: New direction

Hi! This is my first post to the NMS! From what I have been hearing lately, it
seems as if the band is going to do another studio album before performing
their 20th Anniversary Tour and releasing a live album. Due to this, I'm
extremely curious as to what you believe will be the direction of the upcoming
album. Do you believe that the guys will continue in the direction that
Counterparts was going in? It seems like ever since Presto, Rush has strived to
 emulate their earlier sounds that spanned the 2112-Moving Pictures era. Do you
 think that the band will continue to leave the keyboards in the background of
 the mix and to progress the status of Alex's guitar to a more noticable and
dominant role? Honestly, I felt that Counterparts showed a certain diversity
of themes and musical styles that have not been demonstrated by Rush in a long
time. On the other hand, I found two major problems with the album. First, I
felt that there was too much of a stress on love songs (at least by Rush's
standards.) I mean, Cold Fire was really an excellently written and performed
song (especially considering the fact the band claimed to have a lot of trouble
 recording it) but I felt that The Speed of Love was complete overkill on the
love topic. Sure it had an excellent melody but it also is the kind of song
that does not demand an active listening ear (unlike the vast majority of Rush
songs performed through the years.) Therefore, I hope and pray that the band
might decide to temporarily avoid the topic for an album or two in the future.
Anyway I believe that RTB and Counterparts seemed to compensate for all those
earlier albums that Neil decided not to engage in the "love" topic. My second
problem with Counterparts seems to be a certain "rawness" that the first half
of the album showed. Sure  it sounded awesome to hear the beginning riff from
Stick It Out and the obvious tension and repose that defined Cut To The Chase
(don't forget CTTC's unbelievable guitar solo that Alex played) but I also felt
 that at times, the songs sounded overly raw. If one looks back to Moving
Pictures, what seems to predominate was not only a raw and harder sound but the
 use of keyboards to fill in those rough edges (Tom Sawyer is living proof of
this.) I really hope that the band can continue that harder and more intense
sound that Counterparts showed but to fill in the musical grooves with a touch
of keyboards in order to Rush's sound not only harder BUT FULLER!! Do you guys
basically agree? One final comment: Rush in every 4 album era seems to have 2
albums which seem to carry the same basic musical theme, back to back. For
example, Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures are very similar stylewise but MP
took over right where PW left off. The same can be said with PoW and HYF. I
truly believe that this upcoming album will be similar stylewise to Cprts but
will extend and take its theme to a new level. This new album will have
potential for musical greatness provided that Rush takes a serious look at the
strengths and weaknesses of Counterparts and is ready to expand their style to
more diverse areas. Go get um' Ged, Alex, and Neil. We love ya'!

P.S. What will the name of the 3rd instumental be??? I'm sure that there will
be one because the band seems to get a real kick outta doing them!

I've always thought by "reverse the golden rule" Neil meant "do unto
others as others do unto you", i.e. fight back, letting anger take

Subject: So who DID make liquid soap and why?

1) Yes did NOT break up, I saw em 2nd row last night.  Good show (not
as good as Rush though :-)  No they did NOT play the 'Revealing
Natural Sciences of GOd' :-)  YEs it was funny to see Chris Squire (a
BIG guy) prance.... and prance IS the applicable phrase
2) Actually RushFam(tm) was coined by the infamous HaploPeart(tm)
about a year ago, with a detailed description of what he thought a
Rush Fan was like (something about liking Star Trek, which I DON'T in
there too).  However, somehow it caught on, and I admit, it bugs me.
Personally, I'd rather deviate from the norm myself.
3) There is no number 3
4) Anyone got a list of who plays on this buddy rich tribute album:
I know of:
 Neil, Bruford (?), Rod MOrgenstein (Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse,
Winger), Matt Sorum (GnR....WHY?), Dave Weckl
5) ever notice that I like to number
6) Has anyone ever heard official comments (read documented
interviews) of what OTHER bands think of Rush?  I know that Primus
really digs em, but I was thinking more along the line of what
Yes/Crimosn/ELP has to say about Rush.... just curious
7) ok I won't mention my eq settings or 3 favorite discs BUT
Fripp, Alex, Wakeman, Bruford, Ged, Tony Levin on stick (what a line up!)
(yeah personally I think Bruford is more interesting than Neil
(although Neil's a close second))
8) Is it Green Eggs and Regular Ham or Green Eggs and GREEN Ham?  Does
the Green distribute over Eggs and Ham?

Subject: Non-Rush but almost. (Yes Concert)

 I saw Yes last Wednesday at Riverfront Park in Little Rock, Ar.
The show was awesome!  I left the show amazed at the musicianship.
Dont get me wrong I held the highest opinion of them before the concert
(well for at least 3/5 of them).  I can seriously say that the concert
rocked.
 It was at an outdoor theatre and only 2000-4000  people were there, but
everybody loved their Yes and had a blast.  Everyone was sitting on the
lawn not a bad seat in sight.  It was the best concert
setting Ive experienced.  (Ive only seen two bands.  Yes and Rush.)  I
wish I could see Rush in a small outdoor setting such as this.  Which
leads me to my question:  Does Rush (<-- singular) ever play settings
like this, or is it virtually impossible?

    In fact, I find that anything with a heavier than usual bass will
    carry well over the waves.  Have you placed your sound system  in
    the front or the back of the boat? Try throwing some life jackets

slogan 'How many ways do we have to say it?'. If anyone is interested i can
have it scanned and posted to the FTP site, if not it'll make me a very nice

Yo.

Well, since I already *am* stranded on an island, I guess I'll just defer
my 3 CD list... :-)

Especially, too, since I already /have/ all my CD's with me... :-) :-)

About that NAKED GUY in front of our good friend, the pentacle.  According
to Hugh Syme, he borrowed the naked figure from the Greek artists of way back
when; using the classical tradition to further illustrate the statement of
the music.  I won't say anymore because I don't want to ill-paraphrase him,
but I specifically remember that.  I think it was an interview that Cheryl
Renshaw had transcribed, oh, about a year ago?  A Special Edition issue, I
believe.  Hope that answers /some/ questions.

On ALEX and his amazing talents: forgot one -- he's an excellent cook.

And the flying RUMOURS about a 20th anniv. tour...This isn't meant to be
"official word", but when I talked to Kim Garner a coupla weeks ago, we
briefly touched upon this subject.  She told me that the guys had abandoned
the idea of a 20th Anniv. tour.  So that, coupled with the interviews the
guys had done some months ago, I think it's safe to say that the tour ended
its short life as a wishful thought.... <grin>

And much thanks and bowing of the knee to Jeffrey for transcribing "A Port
Boy's Story" from the St. Catherines article.  It's enlightening to hear of
Neil's boyhood.  I felt..humbled, oddly enough.  (?)  Now I understand much
more where he's coming from when he says what he says, sometimes...

I would propose that this should be interpreted much less
literally.  By being literal, one could interpret that since
Jesus wore a crown of thorns, that Jesus is equated with
anger.  And I don't think that is what Neil is intending to
say.  On that basis, I can think of two other "golden rules".

  -  Do until others before they do unto you; and
  -  He who has the gold, makes the rules

Either of which might apply to being reversed without shattering
our image of Neil.

Neil has said in interviews that he trying to paint mental pictures
with his lyrics.  That could also be the case here: and if it's
not just a lyric that paints a picture, then it should be interpreted
other than strictly literal.

Subject: Reversing the Golden Rule

Perhaps, if Neil meant "reverse" in the sense of "opposite", the
Reversed Golden Rule might run this way:
Do unto others as you would not have them do unto you.
or
Do not do unto other as you would have them do unto you.

Either one makes sense in the context of the song, I think.

I'm curious.  How many of you out there have noticed that the conceptual
domains given to Apollo and Dionysus in "Hemispheres" by Peart do not
appear to be quite accurate?

Apollo was actually the Greek god of sunlight, prophecy, music and art.
In "Hemispheres", he is the god of wisdom.  I guess the argument could be
made that sunlight symbolizes wisdom....Has anyone seen Apollo referenced
as the Greek god of wisdom by a source other than Peart?  My argument is
simply based on what Webster says ;-)

Dionysus was actually the Greek god of wine.  In "Hemispheres", he is the
god of love.  If my memory of mythology serves me correctly, Aphrodite
was the greek goddess of love. Hmmm.....  I seriously doubt that we can
conclude that this was an oversight by our esteemed lyracist.  But what
was he thinking? Any comments?

To Sara:  Hemispheres is one of my all time RUSH favorites as well.  In
fact, it is my favorite album from the 70s.  Hope you enjoy your class!

I think the "reverse Golden Rule" that Peart is referring to would be:

"Do unto others as you would have them *not* do unto you"

The song, Kid Gloves is about those rough childhood and adolescent
situations, that I'm sure we all can relate to, where there is this huge
pressure to do the things you think the "cool" people want you to, so you will
be accepted by them. An example might be to be cruel to another kid, thus the
lyric: "Then you learn the lesson that it's cool to be so tough" but it carries
a heavy price. For example, your conscience might start bothering you, or you
start having other people be cruel to you.  Therefore the lyric, "Then you
learn the lesson that it's tough to be so cool"  works very well also.

As for Tony's other comment about the Golden Rule being sound advice, I
mostly agree, but there's one caveat: It assumes that the person would
want to be treated the same way you would want to be treated.  This is not
always the case; something that would please you might not please me. Try
this: "Do unto others as they would have you do unto themselves."

Anyway, just MHO. I agree this is a cool song, with large amounts of genius in
it! Definitely one of my favorites!

I just remembered this. Way back in high school days, my Rush buddy (with whom
I used to shoot pool and listen to Permanent Waves endlessly - I'm sure almost
everyone here had or has a highschool Rush buddy) got a little black and white
kitten which he promptly named By-Tor. It's probably the worst name for a cat
possible. Also it was never made clear whether it was a reference to the "good"
By-Tor or the "bad" one. The cat was pretty stupid though and because my friend
lived next to a highway, By-Tor got squished at a young age. Oh well.

Anyone out there who is paying for E-Mail through the nose, is, for the
most part, getting ripped off.  It would probably be cheaper to get a good
internet account through a university, and then all you would have to pay
is a monthly/yearly fee plus long distance if it wasn't local.  Long
distance charges are pretty low if you call at the right time.  It can be
as low as 11 cents a minute, but all in all it is probably going to wind
up being cheaper if you use the net a lot.

TNMS hasn't changed its content much, as far as I can tell, over time,
thus, you pretty much know what you are going to get.  If you don't want
what you know you are going to get, don't waste your time and money.

Try thinking about the lyrics like this:

    "Anger wear a crown of thorns"
    "(Anger) Reverse the golden rule"

Anger makes people "do unto others" *not* as they would have others do unto 
themselves.

Subject: Why I love Neil Peart

Tom Keekly asked in issue # 1008 why drummers are so enthralled with Neil
Peart.  I am a NOVICE drummer, but the two things that most impress me about
Neil are his raw SPEED, and his smoothness in making transitional changes.  He
has the fastest single strokes I have ever heard (maybe I just don't listen
to enough music??).  Also his transitions are flawless and imaginative.
They always sound PERFECT.  He also does some very good cymbal work,
especially with the 'hats', rarely ever plays them in the traditional style.
I'm sure that drummers with more experience will respond with more
intelligent answers. (drummers saying something intelligent, isn't that a
contradiction in terms....NOT!!!)

Also to Tony in the same issue...He expresses his frustrations in understanding
the following from Kid Gloves "Reverse the golden rule".  I think if you
reverse the underlying meaning it might help.  I always associated the golden
rule with treating others with respect and integrity and all these other good
qualities because that is the way I would want to be treated.  The reverse of
this would be to treat everyone else like shit.  It seems to me that the
whole theme to the song is the struggle each one of us face to go into the
world with certain preconceived notions (ie. the golden rule) when indeed the
world is *reversing* such notions.  I hope this helps, although I'm sure
someone out there has a more concrete answer.

Subject:  Content vs. cost

Fellow NMSers,

     This is specifically addressed to the contingent that is whining about the
sometimes rambling and occasionally irrelevant posts.  If you don't like the
contents or feel that you are paying too much, STOP DOWNLOADING.  The 'rules of
nettiquete' are about wasting readers TIME, not MONEY.  If you don't put a
descriptive header so someone can skip a message they don't want, that is poor
manners.  Asking a group to drop all topics but to narrow one you want to hear
is equally poor manners, especially when the sole reason is it increases the
cost of a service that YOU choose to pay for.
     InterNet is about the unencumbered distribution of information.  It is not
simply an extension of a commercial service.  The manager of this list puts in a
great deal of time and has quite a bit of money tied up in hardware.  I haven't
heard one whine from him about this.  Heck, he even apologizes when his JOB
interferes with the management of this list.
     In summary, as long as the posts have RUSH content, I think they deserve
space.  If you don't like them, skip them.  If the NMS isn't worth what it costs
you, UNSUBSCRIBE.  I apologize for the lack of RUSH content, but I DO feel this
is important.

Maybe it's not a true reversal, but something like this:  "Do
unto others as they HAVE DONE to you."  In this way anger gets
the best of people and they do things to others that have been
done to them.  You know, an eye for an eye, etc.  Just my
thought on the matter.  Hope it helps.

You have to satisfy the customs people at the border if you want to
get into Canada.  When you pull up to the booth, you have about ten
seconds to convince them you're not a drug smuggler or fugitive or
some random thug trying to sneak into their country.

First mistake.  Know the questions they're going to ask, and have good
answers for them.

A disturbing accusation.  But then:

So you *were* lying before, about going to Toronto?  Big mistake.  It
makes them wonder what other lies you might've told.

Oh, bullshit.  Canada is a diverse society (as much so as the US), and
they like it that way.  If you show up at a border crossing and give
evasive answers to the customs agent, you'll get stopped.

> One of these days I shall venture forth again..a little more wiser.

A good plan.  Be cheerful, polite, and open with the customs agent,
and they'll probably let you in.

It's worked for me, five times in the last ten years.

If there are any of you out there who are going to start college in the
fall as freshman and are kind of feeling wierd about it, I recommend
listening to Time Stands Still on Hold Your Fire. It is just so
incredibly immense and described my feelings and inner turmoil/confusion
about the upcoming changes in my life perfectly. My best friend and I who
are goin our separate ways in September (I am staying in California she
is going to Massachussets) sat in my car last night (my car has this
awesome sound system) and listened to Time Stands Still and just cried
and cried. Great tension releaser. But then again, you could only expecyt
something as unbelievably amazing as this song with its incredible lyrics
from Rush.

On another note, in response to the guy who asked what song of Rush we
could do without, I know after becoming a fairly recent Rush fan that I
couldn't do without Red Lenses and Cold Fire. Cold Fire especially.

Subject:      Reverse the golden rule

I was intrigued by the quest for what NP was refering to when he wrote
"Anger wear a crown of thorns
 Reverse the golden rule"

To me, "reverse the golden rule" means "DON'T do unto other what you would
have them do unto you." Now, this can be taken two (or more) ways. (1) don't
do what they expect you to do. That is, "turn the other cheek" (sort of). This
puts the perspective in their court, so to speak. They are expecting (those who
are the "do unto's") you to do one thing, i.e. react, etc. Now do something
totally unexpected. Repay hate with love, that kind of thing. (2) Do the
opposite. If they come at you with love, come at them with hate, or apathy.
You get my meaning?
Now to drift to a new topic....
I really enjoyed reading the special edition digest "Port Boy's story." Neil
is a very good writer. I knew that he wrote great lyrics, but I also suspect
that the lyrics we hear on the albums have been reworked to fit the music, etc.
His stories (Port Boy's Story, Roll the Bus,etc.) are very good reads. If
Neil ever leaves the music business (God forbid) he will have a great career
as a writer (but we all knew that anyway!).

I think it would more like "Do unto others what you would NOT have
them do unto you."  Or Neil might be referring to the joke version:
"Do unto others before they do unto you."  Basically, it means: consider
yourself as having a license to abuse people.  This is the viewpoint
Neil is condemning in the song, it seems to me, the violent "anything
goes if it benefits me" attitude of kids in a playground.

I'm more confused by "Anger wear a crown of thorns."  Isn't a crown of
thorns associated with Christ, the ultimate example of non-anger, non-
violence?  Maybe Neil is making the opposite point: that sitting back
and letting yourself be sacrificed to the abuse of others is just as
bad as being abusive yourself?

   [ Unless of course you want to consider that a crown-of-thorns is a
     coral-eating relative of the starfish, bane of coral reefs. That would
