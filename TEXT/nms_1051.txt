Subject: Rush & Dream Theatre

Hi y'all,

After reading NMS #1049 and seeing that John Penna mentioned Rush and
Dream Theater in the same posting tells me that we have something in
common.  I've been a Rush fan since Grace and haven't stop listening
since.  I've seen every tour after Grace and it keeps getting better.
Also, I end up purchasing every new Rush album on the first release date.
(How's that for being a fan?)  Anyway, about 2 years ago, a buddy on my
mine in my fraternity (GO KAPPA SIGS!  A.E.K.D.B) who is a total metal
head but respects a good musician when he hears one. introduced me to
Dream Theater.  I was immediately hooked.  I thought Peart was the only
one out there who could play progressive time signatures in a rock tune.
I was wrong.  Mike Portnoy, drummer for DT, is quite the counterpart for
Peart.  His style is completely different, but since I'm a drummer myself
I thought the reason I liked DT was because of the complex drum rhythms.
Don't get me wrong though, I still am a Peart fan from Hell and would
never push aside Peart's drumming.  Also, I got the privilege of seeing
DT in Dallas, TX during their Images & Words tour in '93.  The place they
played was a dive, but because the place was so small, we had perfect
seats to watch the show.  The drumming was intense and the sound was
excellent.  Just wanted to let you know.

Just a quick comment or two,

To the disbelievers of a possible Rush tour this summer,
why not?  We all know they used to tour before album
releases down in Florida (my source for that is a couple
of old Rolling Stones).

Also, to Doug, I personally have the complete collection
of Rush on vinyl.

Alright people,

I think the Rock-Paper-Scissors thing has been
hammered enough.  I can only wonder at the deluge
of responses to someone saying "Was just looking
at the cover art on _MP_... do you think there's
dual-meaning in the title??"  -- no need to reply
to this, it was a hypothetical question! :)

Anyways, onto the reason for this post.  My brother
had me listen to a song called 'Grade 9' by
_Bare Naked Ladies_.  Well, towards the end, during
one of the chourses of "..this is me in grade 9..",
they bust into a little 'Tom Sawyer', specifically,
the drum solo(ish) part.  Not a bad job, actually,
but definitely not the boys.

There is no mention at all of RUSH in the liner notes.
I was wondering what the copyright laws were regarding
recorded music (it's been YEARS since I took Business
Law in school).  Isn't it something like 15 years?

BTW, _Bare Naked Ladies_ : excellent vocals/harmony,
and some quite humorous tunes (esp. 'If I Had A
Million Dollars').  Check it out.  I'd give it a
4.25 out of 5

	Fellow Fans-

I was the one who saw the bumper sticker that sais "Rush is a band!!"
Now I am going to Seattle again this weekend, and I will lok in all the
nooks and crannies for them.  If...I find them.  The NMS will be the
first to know.
I guess I am slow, I just heard "Burning for Buddy" last night for the
first time.  It is true musical mastery.  I was blown away.  It was funny
to see Neil with such a small set in the one picture.
Last thing.  I live in Bellingham, Washington, about 45 minutes from
Vancouver.  I was listening to CFOX 99.3 here, and the guys were saying
that Alex had been on some commercials on TV the night before plugging
something.  They thought all sorts of things, like a live album, a new
album, a tour and all sorts of stuff.  Now I know the rush-mgr says
nothing is happening, and I believe him, but why was Alex on TV?  If
anyone saw...please e-mail me back.  Also the DJ's were complaining that
Rush had forgotten about the other half of Canada, since they never hit
VAncouver.  Oh well out of time...out of luck.

p.s. I was talking to a guy  at our school radio station, and he said no
one has ever written anything as masterful as 2112, and no one will ever
be able to match the it, even the gaps between Temples of Syrinx and
Discovery.  He obviously has good taste.

Subject: Jacob's Ladder

With regards to the individual who wrote the post in issue 1049 about
"Jacob's Ladder" being about the evolution of the earth, I believe that
this is a bit off base.  First of all, I believe that anyone can read
anything into any song lyrics.  If a song holds a particular meaning for
you, fine, as the actual meanings of some songs hold entirely different
meanings for me.  However, a quick look at the Rush WWW site reveals an
quote from Neil about the song.  He basically says that it's a story
about a storm and its aftermath.  He said that he just wanted to capture
that in a song.  Just thought I'd help clear that up.

Subject: First Post

Hello all you out there in Rush land, This is my first post so bear with
it.  I became interested in the group after hearing Chronicles, through
the last four years I have bought all thier CD's and have seen the Roll
the Bones and Counterparts concerts.  I have also, in the last four
years, tried to persude every one of my friends that Rush is the best
band, they couldn't understand why I could be so obsessed with one band.
I suppose a lot of you have stories like this--enough on the background info.

I've read a lot of posts stating that Rush doesn't receive enough media
attention, I also agree with this. I've tried to conjure up reasons why
this isn't so--is thier music not shallow enough, is Geddy's voice
irritating to the public?  I've settled on the fact, though, that thier
music is an aquired taste.  Also, I think if we saw Rush on Letterman,
Leno, SNL, Oprah, Ricky Lake, Richard Bey, they would lose some of their
appeal.

Since, I'm only 19 and have only seen the last two concerts, I have
spoken to some vetren Rush fans and they've told me that Rush concerts
were the concerts to see back around '80-81 (Moving Pictures), do you
think they still have the same popularity??--It's hard for me to admit
they're not in thier prime.

Also, could anyone give me info on where to find Rush bootlegs around the
Minneapolis/St. Paul area?

Thank you very much . . . good night!

Beavis and Butthead are getting old dude -- I'm sorry. Everybody is entitled to
their opinions. The rush episode just reconfirms my growing dislike.  Don't get
me wrong, I used to be a big B&B fan. I even had a picture of them in my cube at
work! :-)

I still like the show, but not nearly with the same amount of enthusiasm I once
had. BTW, B&B like bands like gwar -- the epitomy of poor musicianship. Do you
think the Buttmunchers two thumbs up on gwar sells albums?!? You bet it does!

Subject: Concert Tidbit

Got some e-mail asking about the power failures at "Power Windows" in San
Diego in '86, and thought it might be of interest to  others.   The band
suffered two compete sound sytem failures in this show:

The first was during "Marathon". They were cooking along in that 7/8 middle
section just before Al's guitar solo, when suddenly all you could hear were
Neil's *unamplified* drums!  He played for a few more measures -- looking
around puzzled -- and then just stopped.  I remember the crowd roared because
it was so weird --  it kind of bridged that performer/audience gap in an
unlooked-for way, because it revealed the band as less than perfect (even
though it was a technical problem and had nothing to do with them).

Alex and Ged began gesturing and dancing playfully behind their dead
microphones to keep the crowd entertained while the sound crew sprinted
around with knit brows and focused alarm. After a few awkward minutes the
problem was solved, and Ged stepped up to the mic' and relieved the tension
with, "Wow! We blew this place up!" to which the crowd enthusiastically
agreed with a roar as  the opening phrases of "Marathon" kicked in again with
renewed urgency.

The second instance was late in "Distant Early Warning" and was not nearly as
much fun due to the visible frustration of the band and the scattered 'boos"
that ensued. The problem was again resolved quickly and the band carried on
to the next song. I don't remember if Geddy had anyting to say after that
one.

See also page 88 of "Visions" for the B-man's version of what happened.
Later!

   To all those involved in the debate about the meaning of the three hand
symbols on Presto I offer this message....You are all (except those who came
up with the really way out ideas) correct; The hands represent both the band
members and the game paper,scissors,stone.  In an interview some time back
(sorry, can't remember which magazine), Geddy said "The hands are taken from
the game paper,scissors,stone which is based around a philosophy very similar
to that of the band. ie. There are three possible responses; all of them are
right some of the time, none of them are right all of the time."  This isn't
an exact quote so don't go digging out your old magazines and sending me a
list of corrections, please.  Hope this clears things up once and for all so I
can concentrate on more important things like how I'm going to repay the video
for chewing up my Show Of Hands tape.....

Greetings fellow RUSHans,

I am responding to Will Collier's question regarding "The Big Money"
CD-Video.  I have a copy and the audio is perfectly fine.  To this
day, however, I haven't watched the video for the same reason you
didn't for so long -- no laserdisc player.  So I can't say how my
video is, but as said my audio is fine.  It may your disc.  My disc
played fine in my house player, my truck player and my friend
's home player.  If it is the disc, that's too bad.  It has a really
good live recording of "Red Sector A" as you know.

So long for now...

I was browsing through a used record store the other day and I came
across vinal versions of P/G, 2112 and FbN.  The P/G had a book
inside the record sleve containing art work(egg in vise) and several
concert photos.  I am curious if this is relatively scarce.  Also,
2112 was a "fold out" type format with the lyrics inside.  FbN also
had the lyrics on the record sleve.  I thought this was pretty cool
seeing that when you buy a CD of an old album, they leave out a lot
of the original packaging fun stuff.

Just sort of a nice discovery.

Subject: Between Sun and Moon

Hello to all!

Someone a short while ago asked something about the meaning of the song
Between Sun and Moon.  Well, I thought I'd go home and have a look at the
video of the Kumbaya concert from this fall here in Toronto.  For those
of you who don't know, Kumbaya was an AIDS benefit concert featuring a
whole jamboree of artists, including Alex Lifeson.  Anyway, Pye Dubois
also happened to be there, and what he did was read the poem that he
submitted to Rush which was to become Between Sun and Moon.  Here is an
unofficial transcript of it.  There were a couple of lines where I wasn't
sure what he said and they are marked with a "*".

There is a lake between sun and moon
Not too many know about
Some go there for their high noon
Some go there for their midnight moon
It is a moment between silence and shout
Maybe you, might as well me
Why the sun, why the sun

Say yes say yes ahh say yes to self-esteem

We want to escape because we don't want to fall in
The signs are clear and so is the fear
We do not trust the firmness of the ground

Then say yes say yes ahh say yes to self-esteem

There is a fine place between actor and audience
This is the fine line
The fine line of living
This moment experienced
*This spin deliverance*   [ I think it was "this fine deliverance"? :rush-mgr ]
Do what you want to do in no ordinary way
Say what you need to say in no ordinary way
And sing what must be sung in no ordinary way

Say yes ahh please, please say yes to self esteem

Some go there for their high noon
Some go there fo their midnight moon

It is the moment between silent and shout
This is a fine place
*Faces* face to face
These bonfire eyes
In the lake of the sky
It is our light to land and leave
Never so dark to unravel the weave
Never give up and never say die

Do what you need to do in no ordinary way
Say what you need to say in no ordinary way
And sing what must be sung in no ordinary way

                                       -Pye Dubois

   [ Glad someone finally typed this in! I've been meaning to, I've just
     not had the time. I'll stick it up on the web site.     : rush-mgr ]

Well hearing this and reading the final lyrics to the song, I *think*
it's got something to do with finding a place within yourself where you
can think and feel and be human, hence, from the song--"This is a fine
place/To hesitate" and "We just need a break-/From the headlong race".
Also, since Pye was reading this at an AIDS benefit concert, it may also
be a song of hope.  Anyways, that's my interpretation.  Feel free to
comment.  Ya'll post now, ya hear?

Subject: Re: 01/23/95 - The National Midnight Star #1050

In response to Michael's post in #1050 about good seats:  I've only been
fortunate enough to have caught Rush once on tour, Jan 23 (?) 1994 at New
Orleans (memory a bit fuzzy.  lotta hash smoking in my area that night).
We sat on the side of the stage, behind and to the left of Neil's
kit--almost completely behind them.  We didn't see hardly any of
Candlebox, but we weren't complaining :)  We did, however, get to look
right down on Neil from where we were sitting.  This was a special treat
for one of my cronies, as he is a drummer who admires Neil a great deal.
I told him this was the closest he'd probably ever come to a drum clinic
with Neil, only this one had far more people than normal clinics do ;)

Even though we didn't get to see the band head-on, it was kinda
interesting to watch everything from behind the stage.  I got to see
Geddy's teleprompter and keyboard/pedal setup (which I hadn't seen
before), and the projections were still cool, even in reverse.  Mind you,
I don't just sit back and accept bad seats willingly, but in this case, we
didn't have much choice.  Besides, we saw the show from a different point
of view, kinda cool in itself.

Here's hoping for a new album later this year...

Yeah. There's quite a lot of them about.
I think there's a loophole in the local copyright laws, or something like
that, allowing people to publish bootleg material as long as they make it
plain that it isn't an authorised recording.
That's what I heard anyway.

As for the price, not bad. They vary from around between $6 and $10 depending
on where you buy them (this low price was at Melbourne's Victoria Street
markets).

Too right. The Rush CD isn't too bad. I've got an unauthorised Metallica CD
on which the quality is shocking - sounds worse than a tape that been on the
car dash all day.

IMHO, you are way off base buddy.  In fact I believe Alex would agree with me.
I remember reading in Guitar Player magazine in 1980 where Alex states that he
thought that the guitar solo that ends Different Strings was one of his 
favorites on the album, and that he wishes that they hadn't faded out so 
quickly, cuz what continued on was way cool.  Personally, I think the riff Alex 
starts playing at the end helps step the emotional intensity level of the song 
up and the solo which is very moving is a nice way to end this song.  Some of 
my favorite Rush songs has Alex playing 'distorted junk' on them.  I think 
the 'distorted junk' on Counterparts is some of what makes it a better
album than RtB (which had a wimpier sound in general) for me.

I know there will probably be many posts saying this same thing, but in
case everyone else decided the same thing and held their tongues i'll make
the point.

In Madrigal Geddy sings "And there's no safe port in view", thats why it
sounds like 'Sayporting' in your 'supporting view' interpretation of his
singing.

It's all in the lyrics sheets...

thats really all i have to say..i'll go away now

Actually, the lyrics are "There's no safe port in view." And what is so

Geddy's classical guitar. That's also IMHO.

I don't know about the rest of the states in the US, but here in Florida
most tickets are sold via TicketBastard (oops.. :) ) and go on sale
at the same time across the state.  Now my intention for the RTB tour
was to camp out in Orlando at the Orlando Arena box office and get great
seats.  Well I got there around 4pm Friday and the tickets went on sale
10am Saturday, and I got 33rd place in line so needless to say my seats
sucked bigtime.  Although I was in the first level, I was across the
entire arena from the stage. So now that I goto school in Gainesville
(about 120 mi. from Orlando), I decided to camp out HERE in G'ville for
tickets for the CP tour in Orl. I got to the place at 8pm Friday and tickets
went on sale 10am Saturday and guess what. I was FIRST in line. Actually
I was the ONLY one in line until around 10pm Friday.  The next morning
after a Frrrrrreeeeezing night (around 45-50F, too cold for my butt :) )
I got to the window with the 15 or 20 others behind me and the dude at the
window sat there at the terminal and entered my order and kept pressing
the SEND until the clock hit 10am and I got Row A, Floor, seats 6, 7, and
8!  Right in front of Gedster.  So the point is, drive to some remote
TicketBastard Outlet and get them there.  Or just win them from the radio

Hi gang,

In addition to B & B's review of Stick It Out and the Real World report on
MTV, I also heard Stick It Out used as background for a 'Making of Beavis
and Butt-head Special' on MTV over Christmas.  The writers and illustrators
for the show seem to be intelligent, accomplished professionals.

Maybe the other Canucks back home can confirm this:  is Beavis and
Butt-head being shown on MuchMusic these days?  How about MusiquePlus? (I
know we get MusPlus in the Kingston area...).  Is the video for Nobody's
Hero still in regular rotation?

I always found that if MuchMusic was going to show a random Rush video,
they'd play 'Show Don't Tell'.  Great choice!

Bye, kids.  Watch LOTS of hockey, okay?  And let's have a moment of silence
for Patrick Rafter, the latest victim who played well, but just couldn't

ordered this CD for some time now from a friend down under, with a bunch of
other really cheap,  yet high quality stuff.  I know there is only one Rush CD
avaible,  but for other bands they have some really good stuff.  I bought a
load of U2 CDs and just about everyone was soundboard quality.
	While I am writing,  I might as well bring something up that I noticed
about 3 weeks ago.  It was one of the playoff games in which Cleveland was
playing someone.  (sorry,  not a huge football fan)  But when the offense of
Cleveland huddle up, Metcalf and Tesavertie stood next to each other.  If you
know the numbers of these two,  you would see why I took an intrest.

     This is not the CN Tower. The Tower is constructed of concrete, and
     there was never a steel skeleton of it. It rose from the ground up in
     sections. How do I know this? First off, I lived in Hamilton for many
     years and remember it being built. Secondly, my dad was in charge of
     part of the construction of it - the metallic siding on the two domes.
     I saw many pictures and blueprints of the thing as it was built.

     It's more likely a TV or radio tower (sending out those Permanent

     PeW is probably my favourite album. Granted there are not many songs,
     but they are beauty songs. It's not quantity, but quality I want. I
     would have to say that PeW is a desert island album for me.

It says, my friend, that you've been seduced by the dark side of tenured-
professor college English classes.  I know because 10 years ago this was me.
Don't despair: 12-step recovery groups exist for this condition.  It's a long
road, but someday you will lay aside the word "epiphany"; you will cease
employing flights of eloquence in defense of the inadequacy of language; you
will GAIN the confidence to MAKE interpretations without the crutch of
italicized qualifiers; yea, one day you will awaken a new man, one who is
not afraid to say, "If we can never EVER reach an answer, why would we
do this?"

Re: Between Sun & Moon, it's about sex.  The moon represents desire,
pretence, superficial attraction; the sun represents real, committed love.  The
counterparts of attraction.  Sex is the place between, where the pleasures of
both coexist.  It is neither love nor illusion, empty wish nor cold fact,
groundless wonder nor cautious doubt, obscure whisper nor all-too-clear
shout. Note that "not too many know about" this level of experience; most are
dedicated to one side or another, to the full noontime sun or the full midwinter
moon.  "Yes to yes" has a three-fold meaning: (1) the yes of each
partner (each "shining face"), (2) the yes of each counterpart as they combine
for the experience, and (3) an all-encompassing sanction of the positive,
similar to Chain Lightning's.

This here's my first post, so I guess I'll get the boring bio stuff out of the
way first...my name's Scott Rochette, and I'm a Ph.D. student (meteorology) at
Saint Louis University.  I'm married to a woman who will listen to _most_ of
the music I make her sit through (she did go to a Rush show with me once or
twice; she's a hell of a sport!  :-)).  I've been listening to Rush for about
14 years (since _Moving Pictures_), and have seen them live 7 times in various
places 'round North America.  As for musical taste, the manager put it best...
you wouldn't want to see some of the things in my CD rack!  :-)

I saw a couple of things I wanted to respond to...first, Tony Dormio wrote...

>I also got PeW (there was never enough music to justify
>BUYING that on disc.) and Hemispheres (excelent! No hiss
>pop, pop, bang duirng LVS)  Thank God for gift certificates.

_Permanent Waves_ was the first album I ever got by Rush...picked it up in the
$4.00 bin at a discount store in 1982 or so.  This one was the one that got my
friend and I (he's a more rabid fan than I, or at least he used to be), so it
is a sentimental favorite.  Nonetheless, I can't see how you could make a state-
ment like there not being enough music on it.  Granted, it was a short album
(6 songs, ~37 minutes), but if memory serves, _Hemispheres_ (another great one
in my book) is shorter (4 songs, ~36 minutes).  To me, they're different types:
_Hemispheres_ was the last blatent concept album they did, while _PeW_ was a
return to shorter, more concise songwriting.  The music on both is second to
none, and I like each one for their own merits.  In fact, I almost prefer _PeW_
over _Hemi_ for the entire second side (boy, am I dating myself), esp. 'Natural
Science.'  Again, I can't agree with the opinion that it isn't worth shelling
out real money for.  The important fact is that you have it; I personally think
it's one of their best, and not just for the radio material (no pun intended).

Michael Eltz asked...

>I'd love to hear some stories about the best seats you ever had, and how you
>went about getting them.

The first time I saw Rush was December 11(?), 1982, New Haven, Connecticut.
Rory Gallagher opened.  Had 9th row on the floor.  Paid a high school acquai-
ntance (scalper is such an ugly word) $32.50 a piece for the tickets.  Hell of
a show...only the second show I'd ever seen (Moody Blues in '81 was the first).
Saw them later the next spring (same, New World Tour) in Hartford.  Seats not
as good (no where as good, actually), but a better show.  Still, you never
forget your first (concert, date, ________).

Next time, Montreal, PQ, March 4, 1986.  Marillion opened (_best_ opening act
I'd seen since Stevie Ray Vaughn for the Moodies in '83).  Seats not great, but
had to see my two favorite bands of the time.  Paid for my friend's ticket to
get mine, but worth that and the three-hour drive in the middle of the night.
One of my all-time favorites.

Last time...April 4, 1994, Saint Louis, MO.  Primus opened, but my friend and I
walked 'round the perimeter of the Arena until they left the stage.  One of the
best shows I'd seen.  Actually stood in line for these at a local record store.
Was kept company by teenagers and parents alike; best part was the fact that the
parents were getting tickets for themselves, not their kids.  Again, one of the
best Rush outings.

I hope the trend continues, and the shows just keep getting more memorable.  I
have a feeling that this will be the case.

Sorry for the long bandwidth!
