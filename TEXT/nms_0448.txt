     Ok, this has really bothered me every time I saw it before - and now I
see it in the FAQL.  Whoever started the rumor that "Gangster of Boats"
has anything to do with the Mac Plus they use - read closer next time.
     I originally saw this mentioned as a quote from the HYF liner notes:

"Macintosh Plus, the Gangster of Boats"

This was the quote - and yes it's in there like this, along with a couple
of hundred other phrases, names, etc. all separated by commas.

Unless the band confirmed this in some interview somewhere, this information
is most probably totally wrong.

In the FAQL part 2 I noticed a question about Sir Gawain and the Green Night.
I'm not sure if there is any connection, but my frosh year of high school our
jazz band played a tune called Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.  To this day
there hasn't been a jazz band tune that I've enjoyed more.  It was already out
of print at that time, so I don't know how easy it would be to find now...
If anybody knows if there's any connection between the jazz band number and the
Rush tune, let me know...!

Subject:      Tears For Fears

Hello,
     I am posting to many of the lists on the musical lists of lists
searching for Tears For Fears fans or collectors.  I am a serious
collector of T.F.F. and am looking for other collectors or serious fans
to exchange information and trivia with.  If any of you on this list
fit this description, I'd love to speak with you.  A Tears For Fears list
used to exist a long time ago but was taken off due to lack of interest.
This is quite a shame.  I wish someone would revive a list for T.F.F..
I would do this but don't really have the system or knowledge to moderate
a list.  However, I remain a serious collector of their work.  I am
currently looking for T.F.F. discographies.  I know some exist in a
British magazine called Record Collector but I would need to order the
back issues and these are expensive.  If anyone has back issues of this
publication or just have a T.F.F. discography, I would be very greatful
if you would e-mail me at uk04028@ukpr.uky.edu, as I am not a member of
this list.

                                             Thanx in advance,

Hello drummers (and *other* Rush fans, too :-)

I know this is probably a tired old request, but I didn't see it in the
faql, and I REALLY, REALLY want to know:

Where can I get a transcription of any version of Neil's solo - specifically,
but not necessarily, the one from ESL ?

Any info would be appreciated!!  thanks..

Uhmm, it's Sat evening and I was a bit surprised when I parsed thru the
previous week's rendition of TNMS and didn't find more comments about the
Richmond show.  I was able to get down there (thanks to a timely class
scheduling) and catch The Boyz in VA.  One thing I will mention and that
is it took a hellava long time to drive from Upper Marlboro, MD to Richmond.
But first I had to drive from Columbia, MD to U. Marlboro (and that took
around 50 minutes).  We (a buddy of mine and I) left there at 6pm and didn't
get to Richmond till 8:20 (and that was doing around 80 down I-95).  Good
thing cause Rush was already out playing Limelight!  I didn't feel too bad
as we only missed Force Ten and Primus was not on my top-10 list on bands
to hear - now if it were E. Johnson...  The show overall was ok.  I did
like the small hall.  It didn't look like there was a bad seat in the house
if you were on the 1st tier or floor.  I thought Rush started out kinda slow
and they did have some phasing problems between Neil (who was listening to
the background phrases) and Alex & Ged in the beginning of Distant Early
Warning.  It didn't last long as Geddy knew right away they were out of sync
and looked at Neil to get back on track.  I have noticed that ever since the
Presto tour they get more "into it" after they play The Pass.  Seems they
always put a lot of feeling into that song and the rest of the set sounds
better and more energetic.  Anyone else ever notice this?  I was a bit
surprised when The Boyz decided to do another show there in Richmond and not
do one at the Cap Centre.  I would have thought that they would have gotton
a better response at the Cap Centre (no offense to you Virginians or
anything :-).

To close I will just say two things:
1.  I have seen The Boyz in PA, OH, MI, WV, and now VA and there's no crowd
    like a Cleveland crowd (and I'm not saying that just cause I live around
    here either).  They just always get a big response in good 'ol Cleveland,
    OH.  Maybe it is because they got their "break" here or maybe this area
    just really likes Rush - I really don't know.
2.  I was really glad to get back to Ohio where the driving is a lot more
    calm (you area D.C. people and Marylanders know EXACTLY what I mean :-).

Chow,
Dan...

Subject: Overture memories

Here's a fun little Rush memory.  About eight years ago, when I was
a little non-music-listening kid, our little group of friends would
get together and put on plays for our parents.  We considered them
a pretty big deal, and they got more and more extravagant as we
went on.  For something like our third play, the girl that lived
across the street wrote a piece of truly great literature called
"The Time Machine."  The basic idea was that a bunch of people
would meet from different time periods, and, as I remember, they
all ended up beating each other up.  But that's beside the point.
We decided that when each character stepped from the machine, a
short clip of music would play, which suggested the period they
came from.  It wasn't until about a month ago when I found the tape
we'd used that our space-age man stepped out of the machine to the
opening of 2112-Overture (Look! Rush content!).  A college-age
babysitter had dubbed the opening 30 seconds or so for us.  At the
time, the name Rush was meaningless to me.  Its weird to think that
eight years later, they're my favorite band of all time.

Subject: Binghamton Show
Date: Sun, 15 Mar 92 16:58:59 EST

  I just wanted to add my two cents about the Binghamton Show at
the Broome County Arena.  I also can't believe that they didn`t
search people at all.  I've been to several concerts here and this
is the first time this has happened.  I was tempted to leave and
go rent a video camera!
  I really can't understand Chris Webster's opinion about this show.
I thought this was the best Rush concert I've seen (this was my fourth).
The song list was significantly different from the Presto tour, and I
thought Geddy sang quite well, especially on Xanadu, which he usually
butchers.  As usual though, he sang Anthem and Finding My Way horribly,
but the rest of the songs were quite good.  I think Geddy has a mental
block about singing songs from his Robert Plant imitation days, and
doesn't even try to do a decent job on these.
  The best part of the show however, had to have been Alex.  He truly
looked like he was on drugs that night, and was acting sillier than
I've ever seen.  He danced around, stuck his tongue out, played the
keyboard with his nose, and even laid down on his back, while playing
Ghost of A Chance.  He was hilarious.
  Even Neal looked like he was having fun.  He screwed around with the
endings of about three of the songs, and even stood up and swung his
arms at one point.  He also caught every stick he tossed into the air.
At the last concert I went to (Oct 26 in Rochester), Neal seemed to miss
more sticks than he caught.
  I think the fact that I had really good seats also helped in my
enjoyment of the show.  I was sitting in the $35 VIP section in the
first elevated row, on stage right, so I had a great view of Alex
during the entire concert.
  My only complaint is that unlike Ed Lovell, I didn't see anybody
selling bootleg shirts.  I've already bought all the legitimate shirts for
this tour, and was hoping to pick up a bootleg, because some of them
really have great pictures on them..

  I just wanted to say that I bought the Rush biography Visions
by Bill Banasiewicz yesterday at a Sam Goody in Elmira, NY (the
Arnot Mall).  The book wasn't cheap, $19.95, but I'd recommend it
to any fan who wants to know more about the band, particularly their
early history.  It also has lots of great pictues, including some
of the band with other well-known musicians, and early shots of the
group.  It was published in 1988, and covers up to HYF.
  For the musicians in the NMS, Sam Goody also has a Rush Chronicles piano
book, and a guitar book for Roll the Bones.

What is this about Geddy not being able to "effectively sing"
Temples of Syrinx anymore?  Did something happen to his
voice?  Did doctors tell him, "You'd better not attempt that
one again, or you'll go mute!"?

The concert was great again, although *still* too loud (however, I chose
not to wear the earplugs I brought after seeing them in Madison Square
Garden).  The boyz seemed to have much more fun this time.  Geddy talked
more to the audience (although this was to stall for time;  Alex seemed
to be having problems with some of his rack-mounted equipment).

Regarding looks:

Geddy played with his hair down; he was wearing black leotards and an
"Anheiser Bush" t-shirt with a covering jacket.  Alex started with a nice
black shirt and gray jacket, but switched the shirt for a Primus shirt
during Neil's solo.  Neil was wearing a blue bandana and a "Ghetto Rags"
t-shirt.

As already reported, there was the gun fight between the a roadie and
Alex; Geddy joined in later with him throwing one of the plastic darts at
Neil for the finale.  Neil looked extremely serious (as usual), but did
smile at times and looked extremely funny doing his Townsend imitation
(whirlybird).

Sitting exactly between the front and rear speakers, the stereo sounds
had much more impact than they did at MSG (especially the "mumblings"
that you find on Subdivisions, Show Don't Tell, etc.).  The lighting was
slightly different and the "choreographer" took full advantage of it,
creating a great atmosphere for the boyz to play in.

Neil's solo was different again, rearranged to keep us on our toes.
Maybe he anticipated some of the same crowd from December?  He is
amazing.  The guitar sounded really good but I couldn't hear the bass or
keyboards well at all (except for the sampled and sequenced parts).  Alex
was actually singing backup vocals on a lot of the songs, which surprised
me.

Primus was rather good; I enjoyed them immensely, given that I had never
heard any of their music before.  There Led Zep spiff was great sounding
and the opening of YYZ had the crowd going wild.  Speaking of which, the
crowd was much more responsive to them than what was indicated in
previous shows.  The singer's first words were, "Hi, we're Primus, and
some say we suck."  That was so funny...

All-in-all, I enjoyed the show immensely, and will probably see them
(again) on Jones beach.

	Gregg, you not only said that rush has the ABSOLUTE BEST lyrics, but
that rush is the ABSOLUTE BEST at fitting these lyrics to the music. I
don't agree. The last letter was not a flame. I simply disagree. 	When
you begin to use words such as ABSOLUTE to describe a band - that
constitutes a type of worship. Fact: There are lots of bands that have
great lyrics. Lou Reed writes great lyrics. Opinion: The wit and sarcasm
in his writing are comparable, if not better than Peart's writing
	Again, sorry if you thought it was a flame. I really don't mean to be a
nitpicking kinda guy.
	Does anyone know if Rush will be playing many outdoor venues this
summer?? Is it a rumour or is this official? I live in Pittsburgh,  and
I was wondering if Rush would play "Star Lake Amphitheater" After the
European leg of their tour.  ????

	Another question: Is there any way I could get a list of the synths
and/ or samplers that geddy used in the production of Roll the Bones??
I'm guessing that it's the same setup as Presto, but some synths and
sequencers sound better on RTB....

Subject: New Have Show (spoilers)

Well this tour sure blew Presto away from the opening act (Primus vs.
Mr. Big) to the presentation of the rest of the show.

Good Points:
1) Primus as an opening act.  Don't know if I would buy any of their
stuff, but it was cool hearing them grunging along in 5/4, 7/4 and
even one piece was in 11/4.  Kashmir was neat as well.  Girlfriend
didn't really care for them but that's life.

2) Fairly punctual.  Primus came on on time and played about 45
minutes and Rush came on 15 minutes later.

3) Alex's solo during Dreamline.  Wow that really added to the song!
In fact all during the show Rush showed their Floydian influence.

4) Geddy's bass playing.  He really has gotten much better over the
years.  I never used to think he was that great (not that I thought
he was bad, just not great), but he really cooked!

5) Lasers.  Yay!  I really missed them on Presto.  They really add so
much to a great concert.  However, if you guys (and girls) think their
laser stuff is impressive, Floyd blows doors off of it.

6) Where's My Thing.  Great intro.  I thought they were going into
Xanadu when they first started.  They had a great time together.

7) Roadie firing arrows at Alex.  Someone hit the one of the bunnies
as well.

8) The bunnies!

Bad Points:

1) Sound.  They still have the same problem.  Things tend to sound
distorted (especially Geddy's voice).  They either need to turn it
down a notch or use different equipment, or get a new sound-person.
Could barley hear the keyboards as well.

2) No quadrophonic sound.  At least I didn't think so.  It was in
stereo though...

3) Roll the Bones.  This one is my fault though.  I was under the
impression that a big skeleton was supposed to come out of the stage
and do the rap instead of a video one.  Don't get me wrong; it was
really cool just not what I was expecting.

4) Power Windows.  My first Rush show (though I had been into them
since Hemispheres).  Where were some other songs?  Mystic Rhythms was
one of the most god-like things I have ever seen.

Not to be missed...

hi
  i was driving down from Boston back to Amherst( in Massachusetts) when
I passed by Springfield.  They have a station ROCK 102 ( FM 102.1)
and they have a program called 'Off the Record' every Sunday night
from 11.00 to 12.00 pm.  Yesterday( i.e 15th Mar)  they interviewed
Peart.  I was able to pick them up only for 15 minutes or so..They
played New World Man, GOaC, RTB, Red Lenses.  Pretty cool.

 One another thing.  After I perused thro the FAQL, I did not notice
anything on the band members' school/university education.  I wonder
what their educational status are??  And did they work anywhere
for any period of time? ( Other than their music production).

Hi,

    Roll the Bones is available on vinyl.  My copy was $14.95 and it is an
import.  The back and the front are the same as the CD except the titles
aren't numbered and no track times.  The sleeve has the song lyrics on one
side, plain black and white, and the other side has the elephants gluteus max
complete with all the credits and the lyrics to the 'Spoken Word'.  Along the
left side of the sleeve are pics of the boyz and the wishbones.  The labels
on the vinyl are exactly like the back cover.  On the back cover it states
that it was 'Made in Germany'.  The colors are all outstanding on both the
front and especially the back.  The songs are in the same order as the CD/TAPE.
Side one is about 22 minutes long, side two is about 25 minutes long.

I received my copy from     Hogwild Records, Tapes, and CD's
                            1824 N. Main
                            San Antonio, Texas 78212
                            (512) 733-5354      $14.95

Also on the Presto LP, they are out there somewhere.  A friend of mine in
Boston (Hi Sonny) found one for me used for $2.99 and it was in excellent
shape.

                         Keep rolling the bones,

                                              Robert

     I saw Rush last night at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island.  Chalk up
another great show.  Primus kicked serious ass, too, even though they were
only on stage for half an hour.  Before their last song, Primus lead
singer/bassist, Les Claypool, said something to the effect of:  "This is the
last night of this North American leg of the Rush Tour.  We've had a great time
touring with Rush and hanging out with them.  The first time I saw Rush was on
the Hemispheres tour.  I remember I was 14 and I had two beers and threw up in
the parking lot.  Anyway, since this is the last night, we just wanted to say
thanks."  Right on cue, Herb (the drummer) came in with the triangle (or
cymbal) and they launched into Yyz!  They only played the intro and the segued
into John the Fisherman (same as on Suck on This for any Primus fans out
there).
     Rush must like Primus too, because Alex had a Primus shirt on under his
suit jacket!  Anyway, here's the set list (for Primus; Rush's was the same as
usual).

Here Come the Bastards
Les Claypool upright bass solo:
   tidbit of Kashmir
   Seas of Cheese
Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweekers
Jerry Was a Race Car Driver
Fish On / Eleven
intro to Yyz / John the Fisherman

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention: at least two people stage-dived during the
concert!  Funny thing was, it was during the Rush set!  I  saw Neil smile after
one of them (through binocs).

Subject: light sticks, Queen, and MTV

A few quickies:

1) Jay Cook: I'm guessing that the concertfolk were tossing around Cyalume
lightsticks.  About six in. long, filled with two fluids, separated intern-
ally by a small piece of glass.  When you break the glass (by bending the
stick itself) the chemicals mix and--voila--chemiluminescence!  Basically
there's some ploymer chemist hanging out somewhere laughing his ass off
that he's a multimillionaire because he forgot to clean his glassware one
day.  My two hundreths, being a chem major...

2) Someone mentioned a concert in England (not Rush).  Details:
It's an AIDS benefit organized by the surviving members of Queen in memory
of Freddie Mercury.  The concert will be on american TV the day of the
concert (Apr 20?) on Fox network, in a condensed form; the whole schmeer
will be aired in MTV on Apr 25 or 26, not sure.  Acts include: G'N'R,
Extreme, Eric Clapton, Elton John, and I think U2 is coming in via satellite
from a tour date in Maine.

3) DON'T FORGET!  This Friday (MAR 20), between 4pm and 6pm, call in to
get Roll the Bones on the tube.  That number again...1-800-DIAL-MTV.
I've had several people private email me on this, and we can give it a
sound effort if everyone calls in, even if they can't get to the TV.
Good luck, and remember, we're all counting on you.

And that's the way it is....

Mercury, messenger o' the gods
