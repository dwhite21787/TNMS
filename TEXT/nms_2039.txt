Woo hoo! O Canada, The Pass & Show Don't Tell are now up in RV on the NMS
web site! Aren't there two versions of SDT? I believe the one I have is the
one with "conceptual footage"; and as always, if anyone has BETTER copies
than mine and would be willing to loan them out to me, I'd be grateful!

Also if you have any videos I don't (the other SDT for example) that'd be
cool. I have Chronicles & Through the Camera Eye, so don't offer vids off of
there (I know I haven't put them all up yet, I'm getting to it!). And if you
happen to have Stick It Out from Beavis & Butthead, lemme know.

Oh, forgive the occasional downtime of the trader page, it's running on 
yyz.com and we've been having some problems with the httpd on it (it'll die
for no reason, actually we know what the reason is, a screwed up chat thing)
so just bear with us. Hopefully we'll be able to turn the chat off in a week
or two.

They started using Taurus pedals shortly after ATWAS so technically
not the '2112' tour.  There aren't any evident on ATWAS itself.  

The Taurus pedals were a real pain for the first few years they
were used IMO.  Geddy couldn't leave them alone and used to ruin
'Lakeside Park' and a few other classics by adding excessive 
zoopity-zoo sound effects where none was required, usually over
Alex's most tasteful and subtle rhythm parts.  A particular
grave offence was his practice of drowning out the delicate
acoustic guitar into to 'Closer to the Heart'.  In later years, 
he learned to practice a little restraint and discretion.

Not quite - in addition to the 4001 he also used to play a Rickenbacker
3001, and can be seen playing it backstage in a photo in the AFTK

Subject: In The Moooooood & a trivial question ?

The "hey whomever " on ASOH is Elle.
Supermodel Elle McPhearson.

I believe this is refered to in Bill B's authorized biography.
or I read it in something similar.

Alex has an infatuation with beautiful women (what red blooded guy
doesn't ?)
and this is his way of expressing himself.

It has been many things through many tours.
I even remember a Philly show where several names popped up, but I
don't remember them specifically.

NOW THE BIG QUESTION !!!
I love every song they have ever played. And I mean every one !!!
(even Tai Chan)
However Tom Sawyer, Spirit and Closer live have become rather
redundant don't you think ?

I wonder if the band feels the same.

I'm curious.
(perhaps this is in the FAQ's)
What song has been performed live (in it's entirety) the most ?

Just wondering, and I have a bet on it.

I'm prety sure that it's hey Ellie as well, I only remember, cause a
friend of mine watched it with me (He's not a huge RUSH fan or anything,
but he likes some of their songs and this is one of them), anyway, He
was a little dissapointed cause they don't say "Hey baby it's a quarter
to eight..." , and it does sound like Ellie.  I may be wrong, so let me
know... I can picture hundreds of Rush fans putting their ASOF videos in
their VCRs in unison...:)
Ah, the beautiful sound of RUSH...

>From: grs2 <grs2@ukc.ac.uk>
>Subject: The Man of the Match Awards

Well, I"ve got a few areas of dissagreement on this list...:)

>Album:  2112    Song:   Something For Nothing SOTA:   2112

I think you got it backwards on this one... 2112 is the Almikey RUSH
song

>Album:  A Farewell to Kings     Song:   A Farewell to Kings 
>SOTA:   Closer to the Heart
>Album:  Hemispheres     Song:   The Trees SOTA:   Hemispheres

Personally, I think Cygnus X-1 is #1 on AFTK, followed by (a close
second) Closer to the Heart, then AFTK... and on Hemispheres, The title
tune is first, followed by (again, a close second) La Villa Strangiato,
with The Trees and Circumstances tied for third...:)

>Album:  Permanent Waves Song:   Freewill SOTA:   The Spirit of Radio

No way... Spirit is the driving force behind PW... And once again (I
think it's just me) but I don't care too much for the Freewill solo...
I'm not going to go into this any further, but I think Jacob's ladder
would be the second one on this album

Album:  Signals Song:   The Analog Kid SOTA:   Subdivisions

Well, no complaint here...:)

>Album:  Grace Under Pressure    Song:   Between the Wheels 
>SOTA:   Distant Early Warning

Well, I don't know about this one, Red Sector A is pretty cool and
all... I would have put it at #2... with DEW being a close 3rd...:)

>Album:  Power Windows   Song:   Marathon SOTA:   The Big Money

Right on the Money... The Big Money that is...:)

>Album:  Hold Your Fire  Song:   Force Ten SOTA:   Time Stand Still

NOOOOO way... not even close... Mission definatley #1... especailly with
the part "If their lives were exotic and strange, they would likely have
gladly exchanged them for something a little more plain, maybe something
a little more sane..." and Prime Mover being the #2 on that one...:)

>Album:  Presto          Song:   The Pass SOTA:   Show Don't Tell

No title cut?  *WARNING RESPECT LEVEL DROPPING* *L*
Naa... IMO It would be Presto (with the wonderful usage of Ged's vocal
range, not to mention the music and the lyrics) and Scars (for the cool
funky music and the lyrics)... Not to mention Hand Over Fist, and
Available Light... The entire album is too good to worry about Who's
#1...;)

>Album:  Roll The Bones  Song:   Dreamline SOTA:   Roll The Bones

I don't know... RTB is a cool song but I think Bravdo would be the #2
there...:)

>Album:  Counterparts    Song:   Between Sun & Moon SOTA:   Animate

Animate #1, Everyday Glory #2...

>Album:  Test For Echo   Song:   Virtuality SOTA:   Test For Echo

Three words: Half the World... I know it probably gets too much airplay
everywhere else (I wouldn't know, the only radio stations that play Rush
around here are the Classic rock station, that only play the mainstream
old stuff, and the Rock station, that is alternative now , but still
plays a few cool songs from Floyd, Sabbath, Rush and others... And they
don't play anything newer than Signals...:(  the bastards...
Although you can definatley ehar where the mandola was used (Lerxt
brought that one in from his solo project Victor) they music is nice and
happy... it's a pleasure to listen to and to play...:)  Although HTW is
a great song Virtuality would have to be #1, with HTW second...:)

And about the secod guitarist... why not me?  *L*  Yeah, that'll happen,
I'd be too excited about meeting the Boys, without having to worry about
getting all the chord structures and melodies right...*L*
Anyway... sorry about the lengthy post... Just had a lot to say about
the Man if the Match "awards"

Peace,

Hey!
     Thanks to the Rush-Mgr. for the Pop-Up Video information. I caught
it Sat. evening, and it was cool. I'd never seen that video before. I
seem to remember a Rush video, for "Tom Sawyer" I believe, from MTV's
early days, with the lads in concert. Geddy singing into the non-keyboard
microphone and was bathed in blue/green light; or was that the video for
"Red Barchetta"? Anyway, thanks!!

alot of forward and backwards guitar parts on that song.  they seem to 
me to be more separated from each other than on vinyl or even the normal

today i was watching my generation, and the category 'gimme three steps'
was picked for 1983. any of you that have watched the show should know
what that is, so i'll stop at that.  the three albums were Signs(!?),
Permanent Waves, and Grace Under Pressure. 
now, i think they can be forgiven for pretty much any of their other
errors, but incorrectly naming one of Rush's big albums?  that's absolute
stupidity.

does anybody know how to get a hold of the people that produce my

Subject: Short article on Geddy and Neil in Bass Player Magazine

 This short article was part of a special issue of Bass Player entitled:
The Great Rhythm Sections:

WHAT A RUSH

"When you think of RUSH you don't think of a sedate rhythm section" said
Geddy Lee in December '93.  Indeed,  while many other rhythm sections
specialize in earthy simplicity,  Lee and drummer Neil Peart excel at quite
the opposite:  exciting,  intricate,  highly orchestrated parts that keep
you on the edge of your seat.  True survivors of the mid-70's progressive
rock movement,  RUSH managed to hold onto it's fans (and grow considerably)
throughout it's 80's heyday and on into the 90's.  Part of the reason is Lee
and Pearts tightness and cohesion;  they provide a solid foundation - albeit
an angular twisting one - for the band's explorations of odd time signatures
and epic concepts.
    Few songs have steered more budding musicians toward the bass than
RUSH's biggest hit,  1982's "New World Man."  A masterpiece of four minute
craftsmanship,  the tune has an on the edge vibe that seems to intensify
from beginning to end.  Geddy's charging ,  breakneck eighth-notes and
offbeats are solidly welded onto Pearts eighth-note kick figures and offbeat
ride patterns.  Peart - the hands-down favorite Musician Who Doesn't Play
Bass in BP Readers Polls - is the consumate drummers drummer,  forever
painting fresh textures and colors without obscuring the other instruments
or vocals.  "Over the last couple of years Neil has learned more than ever
how to excercise restraint"  said Geddy in '93.  "He understands that there
is  a time and a place to do the things he does."  The same could be said
for Lee - and it's this energy that makes the RUSH rhythm section so
effective.
    While Lee and Peart are superb at laying it down under a verse or
chorus, their greatest moments come when the song's excitement peaks,
especially during Alex Lifeson's soaring guitar solos.  Geddy's grinding
tone (courtesy of various Fender Jazz,  Steinberger,  Rickenbacker,  and Wal
basses over the years)  forms the perfect firmament when the rhythm guitar
drops out.  Meanwhile Peart helps fill the harmonic void with tasty beat
turnarounds,  intense syncopations,  and zingy cymbal work,  as showcased on
such classics as "Limelight" and "YYZ."
    Rush has become more soulful over the years,  but the exciting
rhythm-section interplay still comes to the fore - especially at their live
shows,  which continue to sell out arenas 25 years after the bands debut.

I spoke briefly with Herns on Sat at the Van Halen show in Chi (as I said I
would).  He even remembered me from Rush shows.  Anyway, after some lite light
talk, I asked him about the closing of MLG and the rumoured Rush show to close
it out.  Howard said he'd heard about MLG but has NOT heard about a Rush show.
Granted, he has been in Australia for about a month with VH, so maybe that
hasn't been brought up to him yet.

Howard is a good guy and I probably could have talked lighting with him til
the proverbial cows came home, but he had a show to do.  Maybe next time...

King's X were heavily influenced by the Beatles, especially the hooks
driven three part harmonies found on their first four albums. The thing
that has always amazed me, like Rush, is the fact they can pull it off
live. I've seen them play numerous times, and they are one of the
biggest sounding three-piece bands I've ever heard. Recently, someone
asked which album to check out first. My vote would be cast for
"Gretchen Goes to Nebraska", with their "S/T" release coming in second.
It's all really good, so it doesn't really matter ;-) I'd love to see
Rush and King's X on tour together. That would be an incredible show.

both beat skins with woods, but otherwise, they have nothing in common. I
hate U2 (a very overrated, commercialism-eptimozed marketing machine called

actually did one for Rush.  We should all email and thank them and

them to do some type of profile on Rush like a "Behind the Music" or a

One of my greatest concert mouments last year was at a Primus show.

My nomination for new Guest Female Vocalist would have to be Shania Twain.
Number one she's Canadian, which is appropriate. Secondly, she's a good
looking gal who would be very welcome in a video. Last but not least she is a
fine singer. Her main problem, IMO, has been the really lame lyrics in her

Subject: Bradley Center

I was at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee on November 1, 1996 as well. I
wonder if I walked by any of you. I was born in northern Wisconsin, but
I've lived in Montana most of my life. I have an aunt, uncle, and
cousins living in Milwaukee. So, a friend and I flew to Milwaukee to see
Rush and we stayed with my relatives. It was a kickass trip! We hit the
Miller brewery tour(second time) while we were there. 

Overall, the concert audience didn't seem really "into it." If I recall
correctly, most of the people stood for the majority of the songs, but
with their arms folded and not doing too much. Personally, I was singing
along like a freak and pretending to play guitar. The friend that came
with me was fairly new to most of Rush's music, so he didn't know many
of the words, but he thought the concert was incredible. I had a third
ticket available so I sold it to one of my cousins. My cousin was not a
Rush fan, and remained quiet throughout the show, but the following day
he felt the need to listen to "Driven" over and over again. "Brian, play
that Driven song again." In front of us at the concert were three male
teenagers, probably about 16, who were going crazy the whole concert;
they were air drumming, air guitaring, singing, etc. I thought it was
cool to see some real young Rush freaks. (Although their constant "high
fives" were getting somewhat obnoxious.)

Do any of you who saw Rush at the Bradley Center remember some of the
things Geddy said between songs? I believe there were a few times he
changed his voice into a Scottish accent. For example, right before
"Driven" he said in a Scottish voice, "We'd like to play a Scottish song
for ya right now. This is called Driven!" I found this to be amusing,
but does anyone know what the joke was behind this? Did this happen at
other shows? Also, was it just me, or did "Dreamline" seem much louder
than the other songs Rush played at the Bradley Center? It seemed like
the audio crew, or whatever the hell you call them, determined that
Dreamline was too loud so they "turned the volume down" for the
following songs. Hell, Geddy's bass was so powerful on the first part
that I could barely hear, "He's got a road map of Jupiter, . . ." Maybe
I'm screwed in the head.

In closing, I cannot begin to explain how excited I was to be at the
Rush concert in Milwaukee. I know you all understand what I mean. It was
a fun trip and a wonderful memory. I thought the power trio played well! 

Cheers from the middle of nowhere(Montana, of course),
Brian

Alex makes extensive use of chorus effects on the first album, which
wasn't recorded at Le Studio if I remember rightly - so I don't think
we can credit the late great Jaco Pastorius with this.

Actually, my bet is that they change it per tour.  I think they did "baby"
for a while, got tired of that, moved on to "cookie", then moved on to
"boobie" in the GUP/PoW era (I believe I heard him use that one on the GUP
tour video), and then more recently "alex/geddy".

Contrary to the FAQ maintainer, "Hello, Morning Gov" is so clear as to not 
really be debatable.

It was clear to me on the album and even more clear on the regular CD (just 
heard again yesterday).  I don't own the remaster.

What's even better is that I came up with this all by myself, without hearing it
from someone else.  What's cool is that OTHERS have come to the same

since the boys are Canadians maybe they'll stick with their own country

I support the idea of issue #2112 containing a list of all subscribers

chronicle the breadth of Rush's impact.
