First of all, a moment of silence to mark the passing of one of rock's
greatest performers, Freddie Mercury of Queen, who died of AIDS yesterday
at the age of 45.  You'll be missed, Freddie.

Secondly, the amount of mail was so great over the weekend that I've had
to split up today's NMS into two issues to keep it below 50K per issue!

Does anyone have an updated tour schedule for both legs of the current
tour?  I know (now) a second date has been added in Philly, and other(s)
have been moved or rescheduled.

There are more guitar and bass tab transcriptions to come, as soon as I
move them over into the 'tab' directory at the ftp site (Syrinx).

Also as a favour to Neal Dillman, a local list member:  PARTY MAIL

&gt;  I'm planning a party before the Dec. 4th Capital Centre (Largo, MD)
&gt;  show at my University of MD apartment.  If you're interested, send me
&gt;  e-mail at "comehome@wam.umd.edu" within the next few days.  Thanks!
&gt;                                                        -Neal

I don't know if there are any other parties planned for prior to the Cap.
Ctr. show - if you are planning one, get your post in soon!  If for some
reason you want to meet me (gawd knows why :-) I'll be at Neal's party.
Maybe we should coordinate a meeting at the Cap. Ctr also?

Subject: Anniv Ish

Hey Jimmy and Dave,  I forgot to post to the Anniv Ish congratulating yous
guys on 2 years of the NMS.  I can't believe how the NMS has grown since I
joined last December (500 then compared to 1200 today, WOW!!).  Keep up
the good work. How about a round of applause for these guys (applause).

Next, thanks Ken for giving me the address a year ago.  Also, thanks to
the readers of the NMS for making this the best of its kind.  Give
yourself a round of applause.

To celebrate this auspicious occasion I will bring back a poll I did last
year.  Ladies and Gentlemen, prepare yourself for:

       CASSETTE POLL II:  THE SEQUEL WITH NO EQUAL!!!!!!!!!

That's right, IT'S BAAAAAACCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKK! For those new readers who
came aboard NMS recently, lemme fill you in on what we're doing.  Last
year I asked NMS readers if they could make a cassette of their 20 or
25 all-time, best of the best, USDA Prime Rush songs, what would these
songs be?  (Remember, this is based on individual results so some lists
obviously would be different from others)  I took these results and
placed the songs into different categories (70's Rush, 80's Rush,
Live Rush, etc).  This time, with all the box set fervor going around,
I am thinking of compiling each songs into a box set format (Around
50 at the minimum but that number can change depending on how many songs
I get.  This collection will include bootlegs, concert videos, and
song parodies (Existing ones or new ones).  So, if you have a list of
20 or 25 of your all time favorite Rush Tunes, send them in to the following
addresses:

         Internet:  cschwabe@unix.cis.pitt.edu
                    dgsst4@vms.cis.pitt.edu

         Bitnet:    CSCHWABE@PITTVMS
         UNIX  DGSST4@PITTVMS

These tunes can be in any chronological order (Rush thru RTB) and you
can send me special lists (Live Rush -- Albums,
Bootlegs, Videos, etc, 80's Rush, Parodies, etc).  If you have any Ideas
other than the ones mentioned, please send me mail.  For all you Max Webster/
Kim Mitchell fans (and you know who you are)  I am making a best of Kim
Mitchell box set of MW and solo material.  Send me your 20 or 25 all time
favorite Kim tunes to the above addresses.

I realize that finals and the holidays are coming up.  However, I am going
to extend this poll to after the first of the year.  I have set a tentative
date for posting the results (after Feb 1).  I will be making reminders
every week or so and I will give you weekly reports on the status of the
poll.  This ought to give everyone a chance to particpate and with 1200
NMS readers there should be alot of interesting responses.

OK, I'm done rappin' for now, so get out there and rock and ROLL THE TAPES!

played at Graffiti in PGH Tuesday night but I had to work that night.
Check out "Superman's Song" it's on the Jukebox Network - Selection 028

From: David Sandberg &lt;sialis!quad!dts@cs.umn.edu&gt;

Well, in a desperate attempt to catch the RTB video, I watched
about thirteen hours straight of eMpTyV on Friday, including all
the way through the noonish zone where it sounded like they had
been playing it almost daily (until today, apparently).

This "marathon" left me _still_ without having seen the RTB video
(please please PLEEEEEEEASE say they haven't pulled it already!).
Nonetheless, I did learn something from the experience...

    &lt;drum roll&gt;

eMpTyV has degenerated much, much further than even I could have
believed!  God, it's one continuous bad joke!  The television's
OFF switch has never looked so compelling.  Oh, and Hammer needs
an English tutor much moreso than a "right-hand man" (chuckle).

On a more pleasant subject: does anyone know which (if any)
Minneapolis-area radio stations carry Rockline, and at what
time?  Hearing the NP interview is a moral imperative!

Hugh Syme did the cover for the debut album by The Northern Pikes
entitled _Big Blue Sky_. A good album I might add, though their last
two albums have been mediocre-to-okay. They're from around Toronto
I think.

Also, for the "La Villa Strangiato" guitar fans, there's a
transcription of it in the latest issue of Guitar for the Practicing
Musician, and an interview with Geddy Lee. Also, the poster is of
Alex and Geddy with their axes.

NOT the Mafia :-)

I was listening to "Witch Hunt" earlier, and for some reason I was
paying more attention than usual, and I was able to pick up (I think)
some of what the "mob leader" was saying to incite people. You can
clearly hear this guy speak at the beginning (right around and a
little after the chimes). The part I could make out clearly was something
like "and we must protect our children..." Now I am wondering if
anyone with better equipment than me (I was listening to a *tape*
believe it or not!) could hear more clearly what this guy was saying.

(Now if this isn't trivia, I don't know what is :-)

&gt;Subject: Late bloomer + Predator II
&gt;Date: Fri, 22 Nov 91 10:53:16 CST

&gt;Secondly, about the phrase "Roll the Bones".  Has anyone seen Predator II?
&gt;For some background, Predator II is about a predator like Predator I that
&gt;comes to LA during gang wars in around 1996.  Apparently, they are attracted
&gt;to intense fire and heat.  Anyway, one of the gangs is a Colombian gang,
&gt;and their leader is someone named "King Willy".  During the movie, the hero,
&gt;a cop, goes to talk to him about what (the predator) is killing all of his
&gt;people AND the cops.  Willie is 100% rastafarian (sp?) and talks like, "
&gt;Yaaa maaaan, they saaayyy you want to talk to me maaahn".  The interesting
&gt;thing is that the whole time he is talking, he is *rolling bones* onto the
&gt;top of a 50-gallon drum.  I think it is related to voodoo magic because
&gt;the columbian gangs used voodoo magic.  Does anyone know for sure?
&gt;I don't know if that is what the boyz intended, but I think it is the most
&gt;likely possibility.  Comments?

     Yaaa maaan, I saw that flick.  It was pretty cool.

     I think you hit the nail on the head, Jeff.  People used to (still do)
roll bones as a form of divination (foretelling the future or the unknown).
That's what Willy was doing.  It involves *ROLLing THE BONES* and observing how
they fall, their direction, and their proximity to one another.  Some people
also use(d) bones for games, like dice (beer?) games.  When I was very young,
my grandmother used to play a game with lamb (I think) bone.  I really can't
remember how it was played, but the bone was used as I die.  The outcome
depended on which side the bone landed on (there were four distinct
possibilities).  Also, haven't you ever broken a wishbone?  That involves
chance!  Anyway, each of these cases involves chance... I think it's safe
to say that's what the boyz intended.

     A long, long time ago, people even killed animals, looked at their
entrails (guts), and foretold the future from that.  YUCK!!

     I'm going home for Thanksgiving... I hope that I see the boyz' video
on eMpTyV.

Hello Rush Fans,
 Does ANYBODY out there have recordings from the 'Down the Tubes
Tour'(Caress Of Steel)? I would desperately like to get my hands on
anything from that tragic tour. I don't know about the rest of you, If I
could go back in time and see those shows, I wouldn't be able to stop
screaming and yelling. I can only envy those true Fans of Rush who stuck
by them and went and saw them play in support of their Caress Of Steel
album. And to all of you who may have decided to sit that tour out
because you read a bad review of the album before you heard it:
FFFFFFfffffffppppppppptttttthhhhhhhh!! :)

Subject: Alex's keyboard playing

 faulkner@acsu.buffalo.edu (shane p faulkner) said:

&gt;Many people have been mentioning Alex's playing of his keyboard part in
&gt;Superconductor with various body parts, including fingers, noses, foreheads,
&gt;and most recently a guitar stand with a glove attached to the end.
&gt;
&gt;Well, none of this is as impressive as it might seem, since Alex isn't really
&gt;playing the notes you hear, he just triggers the whole line.  In other words,
&gt;he presses a key exactly when the part should start, and holds it till the
&gt;end.
&gt;
Well, this part sure wasn't "triggered" at the Cleveland show.  Alex played
the first few notes of the line, paused to pick up the guitar stand (you
could hear the pause), and played the rest of the line.  When he started
playing with the guitar stand, he accidently hit two keys at once, and
you could hear _two_ distinct tones.  Now, that just don't happen when
you trigger a sample...

Someone mentioned Mr. Holdsworth and Mr. Colauita.  Incredible musicians.

 Being a guitarist, I can't help but be impressed by Holdsworth.  And that
tone!  Holdsworth has long been an influence on Alex, specifically his
interest in using the whammy bar as a textural device, and the legato notes
concept.  Alex doesn't take it all the way out and be a Holdsworth clone
because he's more of an original stylist.  Still - listen to Alex bend notes
with the bar sometime and there's an undeniable Holdsworthian influence
happening there.

 Colauita is a monster - listen to his drumming on Joe's Garage by Zappa, or
anything he did with Zappa.  I'd love to see a band with Neil and Vince
playing dual drums.  Would be monsterous!

Hello fellow rush fans.  Tix for LA went on sale today and by the time we
finally heard ringing at the other end of the line it was 9:40 and the dude
who answered said they didn't have two seats together.  However he did
mention that the San Diego tickets went on sale at 10:00 so we called again
at 9:57 and my image of ticket bastard had been greatly improved by the fact
that the guy just asked us how many we wanted and put us on hold till 10:00
while he was ringing them up.  He then announced that we were getting there
best tickets and said they were section B but wouldn't say more.  Would
anyone out there who's familiar with the San Diego sports arena tell us
where section B is?

Subject: Terry Brown, Hugh Syme, and Fates Warning

Just wanted to mention something about one of my other favorite
groups, Fates Warning.  Terry Brown has produced the new CD
PARALLELS and Hugh Syme did the artwork.  The CD was recorded in
Toronto.  Needless to say, PARALLELS is AWESOME!!!! Anyway, so if
you like the sound of Rush, Queensryche, and Metallica, I highly
suggest you treat your ears to this group from Connecticut.  The
vocalist Ray Alder is second only to Geoff Tate in talent, IMHO.
The guitars of Matheos and Dibiase are superb.  The lyrics are
akin to Rush.  So check these guys out!

Subject: My Lakeside Park Mystery...  I Need Your Help!

From: dws@soc12.acpub.duke.edu

Hello Rush fans,

	One of my favorite songs is "Lakeside Park" and for a long time
now, I have been wondering...

              What Is The Significance Of The 24th Of May?

	Even my writing-course teacher from last year who was born and
raised in Toronto didn't have a single guess as to what its importance
might be.  My guess is that it is some Canadian holiday, some religious
holiday, or some date of personal importance to Neil, like his birthday
or someone in his family's birthday.  If you have any ideas of your
own, any input or information about this date, or even know the correct
answer, let me know.  My address is...

	dws@hercules.acpub.duke.edu

Just in case you are not familiar with the passage, it goes...

Everyone would gather,
On the 24th of May.
Sitting in the sand to watch the fireworks display.
Dancing fires on the beach,
Singing songs together.
Though it's just a memory, some memories last forever.

				      "Lakeside Park", _Carress_of_Steel_

In case I didn't write back, thank you to all the people who submitted
to my "Bad Habits" survey.  I did think of one more that no one gave me.  
It's...

&gt; ...  Sweet wine and soft, glowing light... (I believe)

					"Rivendell", _Fly_by_Night_

Thanks for reading.  Hope to here from some of you soon.  Bye.

Subject: Rush an' Literature

&gt;From G.A.Lira:
&gt;	Someone asked about literary references beyond Ayn Rand's stuff.
&gt;Hemispheres is based on Robert Graves' work on the Apollonian and Dionysean
&gt;extremes; the Cygnus character, I believe, is the Prof's own stuff. Rocinante,
&gt;however, is Don Quixote's broken-down horse, which the Knight believes to be a
&gt;great stallion; check out that work (actually, they're two books) by Miguel de
&gt;Cervantes--it's super hilarious, if you find the right translation.

Rocinante is also, as I recall, the name of the truck in Steinbeck's
_Travels with Charley_, though of course that itself is a reference to
_Don Quixote_.

&gt;Rivendell,
&gt;as probably most of you know, is taken from J.R.R.Tolkien's Middle Earth. From
&gt;PeW on out, however, I don't recall any song being wholly devoted to or drawn
&gt;from a single author or book. Certainly, some song titles are taken from
&gt;books, but the songs themselves aren't wholly based on that specific
&gt;book.

This seems to be the case, with one exception (see ``The Camera Eye''
below). Perhaps Neil became cautious after catching so much `plagiarism'
flak for the resemblance of the lyrics to ``2112'' to Rand's _Anthem_.

&gt;Only thing that's always bothered me is Jacob's Ladder: the name is
&gt;a children's game, played with a loop of string, nothing much to do with the
&gt;actual lyrics. So what's the idea? That one is above my head.  WAY above my
&gt;head (or else the Prof was drunk)

Doug White got that one:
  &gt;To the person interested in Rocinante, books, etc. :
  &gt;I always thought the title "Jacob's Ladder" referred to the passage in the
  &gt;Bible where Paul the apostle dozes off and sees a vision of angels climbing
  &gt;a ladder to Heaven. "..Follow men's eyes as they reach toward the skies ...
  &gt;The shifting shafts of shining weave the fabric of their dreams..."
  &gt;(please excuse misquotes) That has always been my thought on the subject,
  &gt;anybody else?     Doug

  Yup, that's it. And of course there's Absalom, another reference to the
  Bible, via Faulkner's _Absalom, Absalom!_ (cf. Faulkner's Nobel Prize
  acceptance speech (which I transcribed for TNMS some time ago) for a
  connection with the meaning of ``D.E.W.'').
  BTW, I read a quote from Neil saying that it is the name of the
  natural phenomenon of sunlight breaking through clouds. In ``Jacob's
  Ladder'' it seems to me that Neil is referring more to human imagination
  and desire for self-elevation than anything else.

Back to G.A.L.:
&gt; Camera Eye (which is, incidentally, the name of an experimental
&gt;technique of John DosPassos' The Big Money) runs no more than 6 and
&gt;a half minutes.

``The Camera Eye'' is the title which Dos Passos' gave to
many sections throughout his _U.S.A._ trilogy(incorporating _The Big
Money_). The technique used in these sections is called `stream of
consciousness' writing. The introductory section called `U.S.A.'
bears some resemblance to ``The Camera Eye.''

To add another Rush reference to literature, Dos Passos also wrote a
book called _Grand Designs_...

I'm looking for Rush - Archives on CD, but I can't find it here

&gt;... I noticed a computer screen up near the back wall on Neil's right.
There were

&gt;wondering what it's purpose was.

    Like most major bands nowadays, Rush uses computers to visually
monitor the sound mix and most importantly, the inputs and outputs of
the crossovers and amps.  This is to make sure that every speaker in a
fifty some odd cabinet array is receiving the right amount of signal.

Well actually, it was Jacob (hence the name) in the old testament (Ge

Greetings Rush-heads from Germany!!!
Orders of business:
1.  I have analyzed Camera Eye for the past decade-to the point
where it can be said that I have a PHd in Camera Eyeology.
What is said in the song has been determined to be (by a board
of fellow Camera Eyeologists) "Good day, chap!" and "Thank You!
Enough said.
2.  This same board has also come-up with an interesting fact.
Remember back in the old days when Rush was deep in the concept
albums?  They changed presentation, but still stuck with
concepts.  There is a central theme to all rush albums, save
perhaps, Hold Your Fire, a pop album.  I will elaborate more
on this in a future posting.
3.  This may be an uncanny coincidence, but watch "The Big
Money" video.  There are an incredible amount of references
to tracks on "Roll The Bones"!!  ie. The Big Wheel, Roll The
Bones, Ghost of a Chance & Face Up.  Watch the bones tumble!

this is a semi-resonse to "the fuzzy navel"? who seemed awestruck that the 
first guy in line for tix got there at 9pm. i dont mean to sound like a hero
or anything, but here in BUFFALO I began the line for my tix, arriving at my
location at 8:45am, the day before the sale. for RUSH tix, this length of
waiting time (25 hours) was well worth it (got 4th row). I am sure there
are people who waited even longer than myself, across the country.

	Alright, let me get you people straightened out.  To begin with, 
Jacob'sladder is not a dream by Paul, it is a dream by Jacob.  In the Old 
Testament of the Bible, Jacob ran away from home because he stole his 
brother Esau's
birthright.  He stopped in a field to sleep and used a stone for a pillow.
As he slept, he had a dream about a stairway to heaven on which angels were
going up and down.  In modern times, it has been referred to as Jacob's
ladder instead of stair case.
	Here are some other literary references that Rush makes....

"Wheels within wheels"- The Bible.
"Prime Mover"-The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand
"Too tender hearts upon our sleeves"-Shakespeare
"Let us not go gently to the endless winter night"-Dylan Thomas take-off

                 --Karen
I know more but can't think of them.  And if anyone wants to write be

This is kind of a long posting, but I thought it would be of interest
to a good portion of the readers.  Also I'm posting this to several
lists (Genesis, RUSH, Gabriel, YES, King Crimson, Marillion), and maybe
I should say that I have no connection with either of the companies
listed.  So this is info only, not a sales pitch.

I've recently come across a mail order source of import CDs, as
well as the cheapest source of domestic CDs I've seen ("import"
and "domestic" are relative to the US).

Info about the import source is as follows:

They are pricey, and you also have to add $3.75 PER CD for shipping
and insurance, and only defective CDs can be returned.

The domestic source I've come across is:

     Noteworthy Music
     800-648-7972

Their catalog has way too many discs to even give excerpts of, but to give
you an idea of selection and prices, they had all domestically available
CDs for the following groups:

Bruford (all for $10.47 or $10.94)
Eno (all for $10.94)
Fripp and Fripp & Eno (all for $10.94)
Gabriel (1st four are $9.21, others vary)
Genesis (single discs $9.21, Lamb is $18.73, Seconds Out and 3SL are $22.66)
Jethro Tull (most $9.18)
King Crimson (most $10.71, $10.88, or $10.94)
Marillion (1st four are $9.18, others vary)
Pink Floyd (most $9.10 or $10.69)
RUSH (studio discs $9.03, live discs vary)
UK (first $10.94, other two $11.41)
YES (single discs $9.21, others vary)
Zappa (prices vary, but cheapest I've seen)

Tickets:
	well, yesterday i went to the nearest TicketMaster, it was closed, a
city ordance prohibited them from selling tickets before 1000 hrs.  at 0800
priority wristbands were handed out at another TM.  about 0820 i got there.  at
0830, the random number was chosen, it was three greater than mine; which ment,
that at best i'd be third from last.  i was last.  at 0900 the tickets went on
sale.  at ~0925 i could see the front door and shortly thereafter, the tickets
sold out. sucks to be me (and the few guys between me and the counter).  my
advice:  DO AN ADVANCE RECON OF THE TICKET PLACE!  these guys were slow and
they didn't have one person punching out tickets, one person issuing them and
at least one person taking money/plastic, they only had two people.

Jacobs Ladder:
	funny, being a scientific type (i.e. geek) i thought of those spark
thingies you see in old Frankenstien movies. ya know, two slightly diverging
wires that have a spark between them that starts at the bottom and moves up the
wires.

A Weekend (although shared) of Respect
	about 2-3 week ago, a station here in LA (95.5 KLOS) finally discoverd
"Dreamline" and "Roll the Bones" from RTB, only two months late.  anyway
they've been playing these two songs and the standard three token rush songs
(Limelite/Freewill/etc) for a while. this weekend, tickets went on sale for the
Boyz and Mark Knopfler's(sp?) and company.  so they're having a Rush/Dire
Straights Block Party weekend; "Featuring blocks of Rush and Dire Straights and
your favorite musicians all weekend long."  oh well, some recoginition is

Hi fellow Rush fans!  I'm a 'new' subscriber to TNMS in the sense
that I was forced to unsubscribe five months ago.  But Stanford
University has decided to be nice and employ me, thereby giving
me my account back!  Anyway, on to Rush-related stuff:

In Digest #384, jwu@nike.calpoly.edu (John Shih Jen Wu) writes:

 &gt;In regards to the mystery rapper:

 &gt;About two months ago, I was flipping through the channels and caught
 &gt;a small piece on MTV regarding the new RUSH album.  They had mentioned
 &gt;a rap artist had helped the gang out on a song.  I would assume this
 &gt;would be RTB.  [...]

Well, I have actually found some contradictory information about this.
(Please don't take this personally, John.)  I have an interview with
Geddy and Alex in the December issue of _Guitar World_ magazine.
Here's a small excerpt about the subject:

	That "middle section" is the techno rap that suddenly pops up
after what is a typical Rush chorus.  This inner city-flavored
departure from Rush's usual thang is sung by -- whom?  Neither Lee
nor Lifeson is talking.  "It's a mystery dude,"  Lee says with a
devious smile.  "All I'll say is that it was from within the band."

Stephen Tayler goes on to explain some technical details.  But anyway,
it appears that it was either Geddy, Alex, or Neil.  Any guesses?  :-)

BTW, unless someone is already doing so, I'll try to get a full
transcription of this article out to the digest.

Greetings Fellow Rushophiles,
	Please be gentle with me, this is my first time (in NMS)!
No flames please (I'm not into that kinky stuff....yet). Anyway, to
the heart of it: Does anyone know of any shows where seats are
available/have any tix from unworthy swine that have decided to blow
off the BOYZ (all caps for respect) to attend some function of lesser
importance (Wedding, Star Trek Convention, etc.) in December?
If the show is within 8 or so hours of warm sunny Dayton, I'm
interested!!!
	If anyone has info, I'll bring lotsa suds and other manly
male-bonding supplies (Ladies, this includes you too....I'm a
non-sexist manly bonder ( &gt;  &gt;   ;&gt;

;&gt;  ;&gt;  )   (that's nudge, nudge,
wink, wink ). Listen,I've been a fan of the Boyz since the late 70's,
and an NMS subscriber for about a month, and it's great! Oh yeah,
Hemispheres was my first tour (every one since, thank you!). Happy Holiday
everyone!
