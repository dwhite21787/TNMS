Hi all,

    Just a quick note here.  I've caught up ALL the administrative mail, so
if you think you deserved an answer and didn't get one, feel free to send
more mail.  (See note below about my absence.)  We are now up to over 1250
members, and may hit 1300 within a month!

    I found a bunch of special issue type of stuff in the process of getting
cleaned up, so I'll work on putting out a few special issues, starting today
and resuming after I return next week.  If you sent something and it never
came out, it may come out soon.

    I will be gone all next week (2/24-2/28) attending a NeXT class in Chicago.
I have received offers to put out the NMS while I'm gone, and I've sent them
instructions on how to do so.  I don't know if any will actually go out next
week or not, but it's a better chance than usual.  Administrative requests may
be slow in getting answered, please be patient.  If anyone wants to try to
get together next week (no promises, but I'll try, depending upon class load),
you can probably contact me at the Hotel Intercontinental at 505 N. Michigan
Avenue under David Arnold.  I'll be arriving Saturday afternoon sometime.

I guess that's all for now, see you in a week!

Just in case you all withing walking distance of the Balt. Arena haven't heard,
Rush is not coming.  Bummer -- I called them yesterday.  Hmmm...the guy DID say
"As far as I know they're not coming.", so ther IS a chance.  Keep me/us all

Here's my $.02 on the Peart cancer rumour.  It seems very unlikely that if he
had cancer he probably would not be out touring the world.  Any other opinions
(I may be wrong).

Subject: Misc ramblings

IN regards to the posting in 434 about GA shows.  Rush will never play a GA
show in the US again.  From what I understand within their tour rider, it
states that under no circumstances can a promoter sell a show GA.  Plain
and simple.  However, I have heard that the upcoming German shows are indeed
GA, can someone in Europe verify???  (BTW, GA is General Admission).

There were a couple of postings recently which had some inaccurate tour dates
for March, so here is the accurate final week of the tour so nobody goes to
an arena and finds Paul Abdul:

March 7 Chapel Hill, NC Dean Dome
March 8 Hampton, VA Hampton Coliseum
March 10 Richmond, VA

March 12 Binghamton, NY (goes on sale THIS SAT.)
March 14 New Haven, CT
March 15 Uniondale, NY Nassau Coliseum

EUROPEAN READERS:  I am in the market for any and all formats of RTB and GOAC
when they are released.  Would it be possible to set up a buy for me?
(Please email directly to me, THank you in advance).

I also have still heard persistent rumours that the following outdoor venues
will be hit on the RTB Summer 92 Tour:

Irvine Meadows, Shore Line, Fiddler's Creek (CO), Coiompton Terrace or
indoors at Phoenix, Alpine Valley, Deer Creek, Walnut Creek, Finger
Lakes PAC, GardenStat Arts Center, Jones Beach, Great Woods, Blossom Music
Center.  None of this is confirmed, just rumours.

&gt; You've all seen Neil and his bandana for this tour?  Well, I
&gt; just saw the video for Queensryche's "Anybody Listening?"
&gt; (great song, great video--any recommendations of what QR albums
&gt; I should get?  I have none.)  In this video, their drummer is
&gt; also wearing a bandana.  Coincidence?  Well, probably, but I
&gt; just thought I'd bring it up...
&gt;
Maybe, maybe not.  Queersryche are really into Rush and list them as
one of their main influences.

On the last digest, someone mentioned that they saw Rush on a Don
Kershner's rock concert. I was wondering, these were broadcast, right? Is
there a videotape collection of these shows somewhere that one could buy
or order?? It would be great to get some nice crisp recordings of Rush
during that time period (Xanadu, Farewell, etc...).
 I do believe that Where's My Thing? should be given the grammy. I also
believe that it is one of the finest pieces of music Rush has ever
created. The live version kicks even YYZ's ass! I can't wait for the next
live album!!  Also, about the release of the RTB single in the UK, will
Show Don't Tell be a live version?? When was that release date?
Yaaaaaaa!

        Ludwig has done it again.  They've got a new ad featuring Neil
and his new awesome kit.  IMO, the photo is excellent.  They are offering
posters of it for a mere $3.  How do you get yours?  Just send the 3 bucks
to:

        Ludwig Industries
        Neil Peart Poster
        P.O. Box 310
        Elkhart, IN 46515

        I am in no way affiliated with the company, I just thought that
some NMS readers would be interested in getting the poster.

Subject: Rush at Alpine Valley - bad news
Date: Fri, 21 Feb 92 8:26:57 CST

Hi everyone,

It's been quite awhile since I have posted to the NMS, and unfortunately,
this time it's with bad news.  Alpine Valley has been closed permanently,
or at least until someone else buys it and reopens it.  Apparently, they
were in financial trouble.  I don't even know if the ski hill is open now.
I for one, don't give a shit if they reopen.  I would rather see all of
the concerts at the Marcus Ampitheater on the Summerfest grounds.  It's
almost as big and a helluva lot nicer.  Much more parking too.  Maybe I'm
getting old, but I just don't enjoy slipping and sliding down a mudbank
in the pouring rain, drunk, with some guy on acid freaking out over the
single piece of grass growing out of the mud :) :)

I suppose its possible they will reopen this summer under new ownership,
but I would assume that lots of the bands book their dates long before
they play.  If Alpine Valley does reopen, it might be to late to get The Boyz
booked, it might not.

P.S.  I wish Alpine Valley had closed two years ago.  At least SRV would
      still be around - RIP.

Subject:      Enemies Beyond and Within **RIPOFF WARNING**

Hi, it looks like I joined this fabulous group just a few days
too late... 3 days ago I bought 'Rush: Enemies Within and Beyond'.
As Terry Stedman pointed out yesterday, it is a RIPOFF.

The subtitle reads: Live FM Grace Under Pressure.  I had visions
of a European concert recording which was broadcast live on FM radio
in Europe.  NOPE. 10 of the 12 tracks are the EXACT same tracks from
the G.U.P. tour video.  My wife Pam, who is an even bigger Rush nut than
I am, was able to quote word for word what Geddy Lee was about to say
BEFORE he said it.

Now, I wouldn't mind having the GUP tour video sounds in CD format.
But only IF the recording were top-quality.  NOPE.  In one song, the
left channel cuts out for about 10 seconds... and in several songs, you
get static.  Maybe they called it FM tour because it sounds like it was
recorded off a radio station a long long long way off.

DO NOT BUY THIS DISK.

Subject:      MORE TOUR DATES?

I looked through the archives on syrinx and found tour dates for
this leg of the tour up through the time that the boyz leave for
Europe... and found the tour dates for several European stops...

I have heard that they will be coming BACK around the U.S. in the
summer after they finish with Europe... mostly to play outdoor venues.

I would LOVE to see a compilation of tour dates for the summer leg
of the tour.  Does anyone have a list?  If not, I would be willing
to act as co-ordinator of such a list.

Hey,

1) In response to Rex, who asked if there is a guitar mailing list.
	I'am working on starting one. It's in the VERY early stages, mostly
	just on-line sheet music, but I may add other stuff. I would appreciate
	any body aut there with Rush guitar or bass TAB sending it to me to be
	put on this list. Send it to me directly, not through this list!

2) MST 3000 has mentioned Neil several times, the last time was during Pod 
   People.

3) Does anybody know if Rush is coming to Las Vegas? I think I missed them in
	L.A. The concert grapevine here isn't very good, unless your Wayne 
        Newton!

Well after attending the San Antonio show, where the acoustics were like
a large bathtub, and the Dallas show, where the acoustics were a little
better but the light show was awesome, I finally made it to the Austin
show.

I'd been telling my husband that the arena here is the best.  It's got
acoustic tiles on the roof.  Unfortunately the laser on the left side
of the stage was either out or couldn't be placed there; only one laser,
which left the songs that use lasers either without lasers or only one.
When they have both, they make these triangle things that revolve
around Geddy and Alex's feet.

I was extremely lucky seating-wise; when they raised the black curtain
(which collapsed around us originally, and I had to crawl out from under
it, I found myself pressed against the barricade right in front of Geddy.
I had on a Toronto Blue Jays baseball cap.  I hope he enjoyed it.

Alex was definitely competing for attention, making totally weird faces
and dancing like Steve Martin's King Tut, among other things.  He came
over and bit Geddy's shoulder and then pretended to blow fuzz off his face.

Neil had me really worried.  At the beginning of "Force Ten" (the opener)
I thought he wouldn't make it through the concert; he looked so ill, I
felt sorry for him and tried to catch his attention and smile.  He had
deep, dark, lined circles around his eyes and a wan smile when Geddy
or Alex would go over to talk/encourage him.  By the end of the concert
he was looking slightly better, but I really wonder how life on the road
affects men going on 40!  Geddy and Alex have never looked better but
Neil was really sick.

I think the best way to see a concert is to get a ticket in the middle
of the lower arena for show #1; you can see all the lights and get a feel
for the set list.  Then for #2, if you are lucky or can afford it,
get a front floor ticket.  The sound is much clearer, the band members'
faces are visible, and everyone around you is rocking out.  And the arena
makes all the difference.
