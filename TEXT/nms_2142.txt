2) I'm pretty sure the boys don't read these posts....but I would just like
to say THANKS to them!
    They could have easily raised the price with the third CD in the pack.
    They could have raised the price just because of the clusterworks thing.
    Hell...They could have changed over $20 for just the 2 CDs.
But no....18.99 for 3 CDs and one enhanced program!

UNBELIEVABLE!...thanks boys!

A lot of people have posted saying that they think their CDs will get
scratched when taking the CDs out and putting them into their cardboard
pockets.  I don't think this will happen.  Some of my favorite CDs are
packaged in a similar manner (Pink Floyd's Pulse and Star Wars soundtrack
among others) and none of them have a single scratch on them.  Just don't
store your razor blades in there with the CDs!

Hey Rushians,

I don't know about anyone else, but I think I already worn out Driven on
my copy of DS.  Is Ged's solo not the greatest thing you've ever heard
on a live album of Rush's?  OK, maybe not if you are a drummer or a
guitarist.

And even though I have the utmost respect for Geddy, I think he's saving
the wrong CD.  If I saved a Yes album, it would be Close to the Edge. 
Of course, that's after saving all my Rush discs.

Take care all

Subject: So, ClusterWorks?

The enhanced portion of the first DS CD, for those of you lucky enough to have
it not work, is an inane little program that makes pretty lights in obnoxious
patterns, matched only by the obnoxious music.  Not only that, but if you ever
manage to get it to work... don't install it!  Even it's own un-install 
fails to remove it completely, leaving nice little glitches on your system.  
This is for PC owners.  Mac owners on the other hand...

Apparently, the ClusterWorks Mac edition actually follows the music on DS in a
reasonably entertaining way (this from a Mac owner and fellow Rush fan).  Not
only that, but, by complete accident, he discovered that it'll work on any of
the three CDs, not just the first one.  I think you have to hit either 
Ctrl-I or that stupid little apple-I to get it to follow the music though.  
Mac owners: play around with it and see what you can do.  
PC owners: resist the temptation!  Be happy with the music!  DON'T INSTALL 
CLUSTERWORKS!

Hi!
I haven't posted in about 3 years ( you leave college, and your VTerm 
days are limited) and I am so excited to do this, you have no idea.

Anyhoo, I'll make this quick.  I love the new album with the exception 
of the vocals on Limelight.  

My question:  where is Ghost of a chance?  that's a Kick*ss song live-
              I'm so surprised they didn't do it!

Also:  I was kind of upset to read Geddy's comments in the sleeve- the 
fact that they taped show after show after show- and the Chicago show 
was the only "magical" one???  I don't go to Rush shows expecting 
perfection, nor do I expect a live album to feel "perfect".  When I 
listen to a live album, I want to feel like I'm at the show (not that I 
don't already)!  I feel a little cheated- I've heard much better 
versions of Limelight and Analog Kid in places like MSG, Nassau 
Coliseum, Toronto, Great Woods, and Philly ( I was at the taping for 
Bravado).  I wonder why they did this..........

Oh, am I the oly one who thinks that Animate TOTALLY grooves at that 
tempo?  I felt this way ever since the counterparts tour- no matter 
where it was taped :P :P :P

ClusterWorks is 100% on my PowerMac.

Natural Science does have the specific verse you mention twice; they
played this the same way both in Phoenix & Phila.  The way I see it, the
other bridge parts in Natural Science are harder to reproduce live, thus
having to 'fill in' the time slot, singing the one verse twice.

Odd I know, but hey...what do you expect from Rush?  These wizards are
known for pulling Rabbits out of hats!

BTW, did anyone else log in to the Digital Arena on Sunday evening?

Subject: Yet Another Thread (OH NO!!!)

Hey Rushians,

I concur with Dan O'Halloran.  There are some rather funny non-musical
moments I remember from Rush shows.

The first time I saw Rush live was March 4, 1988 on the Hold Your Fire
Tour at Joe Louis Arena (Hockeytown!).  At some point during the show,
the drunk foursome behind us dropped and broke their bottle of Southern
Comfort all over use.  Nobody got hurt, but we had that sweet smell on
us the rest of the night.  I was tough explaining to my parents that it
was not our bottle.  I was only 17 at the time.  Plus, during the film
intro to Lock and Key, one of the guys in that group stood up and just
started yelling, "RUSH, F*CKIN" RUSH, YEAH RUSH, F*CKIN' RUSH!"  He
finally shut up about half way through the first verse.

The other memory was from the show at the Palace on March 22, 1994 on
the Counterparts Tour.  This show is were The Analog Kid on DS came
from.  My brother, one of his friends, and I were about 4 rows off the
side stage on Ged's side.  I forget what song it was, but they had
flames shoot out of the big bolts on the sides of the stage.  I remember
feeling like you were fried.  My brother turned to me and said (more
like yelled), "Time to turn over, that side's done."

Take care all.
Scott Fab....

If Primus sucks, then Rush must be absolutely horrible.

Hola fellow fanatics,

I've been quietly keeping up with the latest DS/NMS reviews, and it seems
that a lot of folks haven't been able to get their ClusterWorks enhanced CD
software to work.  The boyz must be Apple saavy because I haven't had any
problems running the application from my Power Mac.  (No flame mail, please)
 Allow me to describe it for you'se guys.

It's a cool little program that combines 3-D pointillism with musical
tinklings.  I was thrilled with it.  Unfortunately, your required to have
the one of the Rush live CD's in the drive to make it run.  It also is
supposed to accompany the live album as it go through various chord
progressions.  It's kind of like a personal laser light show to go with the
greatest live album Rush has ever put out!

Btw, DS is truly a masterwork.

Subject: Thomas Perry's note: enhanced CD

T. Perry's note of communication with the author of the Clusterworks 
program confirms for me that this was a pretty serious waste of time by 
Rush to put on their new CD.  If the program has no real relationship 
to the music, as the author of the program has now seemed to confirm, 
then -- really -- what is the point of including it on a Rush CD?  Just 
because Geddy thought it was a cool looking thing???  

I'm quite disappointed and will quickly de-install Clusterworks from my 
computer.  I'm interested in responses from others on this issue.

Subject: Victor "II"

Well, it looks like Alex's recent works may not surface as another =
"Victor" project. I got an email (which I had sent about two months ago) =
reply from Tony "Jack Secret" Geranios,
which his email addy was in his interview for some sound magazine. =
Ok..this is the story I got, and ABSOLUTELY nothing is confirmed.  This =
came to mind when ALex seemed a "little" vague about doing another =
Victor in the "chat" on Sunday night, so hopefully this sheds some light =
on the situation.

Alex had apparently spent quite a bit of time (over a 4-5 month period) =
composing songs for a possible next Victor release. But, he has =
supposedly put it on the "back-burner" for a couple of reasons. 1)Alex =
paid for all of Victor himself, right down to the artwork, and doesn't, =
at this time, feel like investing all of that time, money, etc, again.
The first Victor cost him ALOT of money in the long run, because it =
turned out to be an actual monetary loss (with royalties payed to other =
writers, etc). It was also a VERY exhausting experience for him, and =
Atlantic apparently isn't interested due to the poor sales of Victor.=20

Now, 2) this second "reason/specualtion" is a little more positive, as =
he doesn't want to get into anything heavily "musical" until he has an =
idea of what Rush, or Neil in particular, wish to do in the next year or =
so.=20

As far a Geddy releasing anything, from recent interviews, he seem's =
happier just "jamming" with friends....so VERY much different then =
having the responsibility of putting out a record.

But....as they said at the T4E recording sessions..and as DS =
proves...TOGETHER..THEY ARE A GENIUS!! =20

Here is to the NEXT STAGE!!!:-)

Peace...

Subject: DS merchandise

Hello, fellow residents of the Jolly Teabag Rest Home!
One thing has occurred to me quite a few times while reading all the posts
about DS, the various interpretations of the Tinkertoys, the packaging,
etc.--------are there any plans by the Backstage Club to get off their
collective a**ses and get some t-shirts, hats, stickers, and so on promoting
DS? I just find it kind of unusual that with the following the boys have their
"official merchandiser" does such an Atlantic-like job of offering items to
promote the band.
(Someone do me a favor: get the marketing rights for promo items and start
cranking out this stuff. It's amazing to see people going around with Jimi
Hendrix, Beatles and Led Zeppelin shirts and the like, while we have to be
content with our getting-worn-out NMS shirts).
Imagine a Tinkertoy DS or JTRH shirt, just in time for.....next Christmas. 
Oh, well. I tried.   :)

Subject: Is it just me?

Hi all,
 Is it just me who got goosebumps when Geddy said goodbye to the 
crowd at the end of the second CD on DS? If this is the end of Rush 
as we know it, I am glad I got to see them and to experience their 
music.

Meanwhile, while we all wait for news of the next Rush album, give me 
the new Victor album!

Take care,
Brian

Subject: Limelight on DS

I couldn't help but notice that someone, in an earlier issue, commented on how
Limelight sounded horrible.  I wouldn't go that far, but I definitely think
it's better on studio (it's the only song on DS that I feel that way about;
strange, because Limelight is my fave song ever).  It sounds OK up until right
after Alex's solo.  That whole last minute seems to lack the power and drive
of the studio version.  Anyone else agree?  Also, does anyone know how
realistic the video release is, or is it just a rumor.  When will it be out if
it's a real deal?

I found one of those T4E stone guys -- Inunkshuks -- hidden in the Hammersmith 
Odeon case. Turn the case sideways so that the opening is facing left. Now 
look along the right edge at the brick road. About one and a half inches from 
the feet of the scalpee, you can see the shape of an Inunkshuk. See it?? Maybe 
it's a stretch, but I bet I just made a thousand people look for it. Oh, the 
rush of power. Pun intended, thank you. 

BTW, I have a good idea. Since there aren't any DS t-shirts, I'm gonna have 
one made. All ya gotta do is take in the CD cover (or whatever picture you 
want on your shirt) and have a blown-up decal made of it. Then they'll press 
it on a shirt, and you have something no one else does. :-)

Subject: not a scientist but.........

About the Clusterworks program - pretty cool inclusion, but it seems that
Hisashi Hoda is mistaken about one thing:  He states that there are 2
kinds of perception, one based on movement and the other on static images.
Well, the scientific fact of the matter is there is no such thing as the
perception of static images or of static perception.  All perception,
visual or otherwise, is based on movement.  Without movement, there is no
perception.  Of course, this doesn't take away from his artistic
accomplishments with the Clusterworks program, but the scientist in me
just had to speak up.

>>>> although I'm not a scientist, it seems to me that I don't entirely agree
with the definition of perception...........are you to say that just because
something is static, there can be no perception, and that the only way for me
to have the illusion of perception is for it to have movement? Take that book
laying on the desk there..it's not moving, but I know it's
there.............therefore i have a perception that it is real.......right?
Just a little confused...please help clarify

  I had to respond to this. I too felt an affirmation when when I read that
Relayer was one of Geddy's faves. I've always loved Relayer for its
technical wizardy, awesome melodies and downright wierdness. To me, this
very underated album has to be the most avant garde progressive music I have
ever heard. The bass playing by Chris Squire is immaculate. You can
definatly tell where Geddy got the majority of his bass style that would
eventually end up on albums like Hemispheres and AFTK. I would have expected
Geddy to answer with one of the more well known Yes albums like Fragile or
Close The Edge, but the fact that he said Relayer just floored me. I am not
alone.

I remember reading my sister's copy of the UK fanzine 'The Spirit fo Rush'
sometime last year. In it there was the trip diary of a Scottish guy (can't
remember his name) who travelled to see Rush at a few of the Canadian shows
on the TFE tour.  One of these shows was at the Molson Ampitheatre on 2nd
July. This guy was wearing his full Scottish regalia at the concert (kilt,
sporran, etc,) and he said that Geddy spotted him in the audience at one
point and, in a quite passable Scottish accent, said those words during the
Resist introduction. 

I don't know exactly what Geddy said as I'm still waiting for my copy of DS
to arrive from CDUniverse but I'll check my video of that show at home
tonight.

BTW, it's driving me nuts reading all your reviews of the album when I still
haven't heard it. If it doesn't arrive by the weekend I can see myself
buying another copy here in the UK. 

Does anyone know if the vinyl version was released here after all?

ABSound has DS for a lil' bit more than $11 + shipping.
Go to http://www.absound.ca/music/search/search.html and type in "Rush".
Since the record costs the equivalent of $34 here in Italy, I bought a
dozen copies for me and friends: with shipping and custom duties we end up
paying less than half for it.
Sheeeshhh, and those assholes at Italian record companies have the nerve to

On the other hand, I'll have to wait to listen to it for a while, but in

18.  Earring on the guy who has the one shaved in his head - this one took a

19. In montage, dead center at bottom - picture of Neil sitting there

    this one looking for the microphone

Good call on the Geddy's microphone - I never would have found that.

An emphatic no.  I recall reading in a previous NMS a while ago that 
Hugh Syme has admitted himself that there is absolutely no meaning in the
tinkertoy design.  Surf through the back issues if you don't believe me.
But if there were some meaning there, the better theory would be 
3 disks - 2 of which are from last tour, one is from long ago.  I doubt
that being so close to the band, Hugh's perspective is that of one
member being distinguishable from the next.  We look at things differently
and a bit more objectively because we are so far removed from things.

That's an H.S. - standing for Hugh Syme.  He was just signing his name, with
the date it was created, I would imagine.

Dear NMS and all rush fans;

although tons of information and report of "DS is great!" i can read thru
nms mail list,
I'm sad that I haven't listened to it.   I tried to find imported version
or single cd at all major cd
stores in tokyo including tower records but i could find NONE!  i know how
rush is unpopular in japan,
but this is too much.  i envy all of you.  maybe i'll get ds by internet.  
I also am not happy with japanese version of ds as i know liner notes are
usually written by a
notorious heavy metal critic who loves describing rush in
superincomprehensible way so i think
it's a waste of papers and money although i know a bonus song is featured.
now i 'm amusing myself only by reading nms mails and imagine how ds will
be great.  
hope the day I can share fun of DS with nms people soon.

You know, I love DS but I wish the guys had recorded
some Presto shows for this live set.  I really, really like
the quiteness/somberness of some parts of Presto.  
Presto is pretty-well felt in the T4E stuff and "Show, Don't
Tell" made it on to DS.  However, Presto is much more
important, IMHO, than Rush makes that album out to be.
It was the "turning point" away from the Rush of the mid 80's.
Presto was a step toward one of Rush's best, Test For Echo.

Oh well, any and all Rush songs are excellent!

Well, I finally got around to being awake early enough to go pick up a copy
of DS. ( work night's OK?) The first thing that struck me was the price!
$16,95 Canadian!! To be honest I was expecting to shell out the better part
of $40.00! But this is what I can't figure out, the original price was
$25.95, then it had the mark down sticker to $16.95. Why the mark down so
fast?! I can't figure that, cuz I got the last one on the shelf! :-)

Anyway, all and all I love DS. hearing all the live tracks from the last
tour made me want to get up and flail around the room for a while.
technically, I noticed a couple of things that could have been a bit
better. In a couple of spots I noticed the recorded crowd didn't mix in to
well with the live ambient crowd. It seemed to me to be sitting sort of a
layer above in some places. The most obvious glitch to me was right at the
end of 2112 where the crowd starts to cheer at the end of the song. A
rather rough transition to the crowd coming out of the music, a definite
change in tone. In the set 3 disk you can hear a buzz one and a while
caused from the lighting dimmer circuits on stage powering up and down.
(most noticeably in the first part of Xanadu) definitely gives it that live
feel!  (the sound of Howard! lol..)
But don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining at all! I love this disk! I
just a bad habit I have. :-)

My apologies if this has been talked about here before, but
on some of the songs on DS the vocals sound distinctly
different, sounding as if they had been previously recorded,
particularly on Show Don't Tell (the "show me don't tell me")
and on Nobody's Hero (the "heeero" part)Geddy's voice sounds
different - just curious if the vocal parts were in fact

No Ken, my point was that Bravado is not an average Rush song.  It stands
out as one of their best.  I thought so the first time I heard the song on
September 3rd, 1991, and I think so today.  While difficult to draw
comparisons, and as much as I hate 'favorite songs' polls, I'd say that
Bravado ranks among my top 5 Rush songs.  And for what it's worth, I'd put
it one category *above* the songs you mentioned.  Why?  Because it's got
perhaps the single best vocal performance on it, one of Alex's favorite
solos if not most favorite ever (he actually said this) and among the most
innovative and complex drum patterns of any Rush song (the outro).  Not to
mention the more-difficult-to-describe "emotional aspect" that puts Bravado
firmly in the top tier of Rush songs.  IMHO etc.  Now do you see my point?

Subject: DS Packaging/3rd CD 

Hello,

I must admit that at first I was a little disappointed when I heard that DS
would be in a cardboard case instead of a jewel case. But, after having
purchased DS, I have to tell you that I really like the packaging. Maybe
instead of complaining about the packaging (which embarrases me when I think
that somebody who had a part of making DS might actually read something from
NMS), we should APPRECIATE the HARD WORK, THOUGHT, and EFFORT that obviously
went into the packaging (and the DS as a whole). Be thankful we are even
getting anything new, let alone 3 superior cd's at a great price!

As for the ODEON cd being in a seperate sleeve...what did Geddy say? This cd
is a GIFT...It is something extra, something above and beyond, a free
expression of graditute to us - the fans - for our support over the years.
That cd should be accepted in the spirit of a gift - would you complain
about getting a free Porshe from Grandma Bessie because you didn't like the
way it was delivered to you? It makes perfect sense for this cd to be in a
seperate sleeve as it is an free bonus - and with the proper attitude it
shouldn't matter anyway. 

The packaging is just a vehicle to get to us the music - which is the most
important thing. That is what we bought DS for in the first place. But RUSH
being RUSH, they went the extra mile to provide a superior delivery system -
which I appreciate.

Later...
