Maybe this has already been accomplished, but how about somebody starting a 
photo yearbook of TNMS contributors?

Wouldn't it be cool to see the faces of people whose messages you've 
enjoyed -- or despised?  Hehe.  I mean, you could print some out and post 
over the bullseye of your dart board.  Create a small, framed altar to the 
Holy Bitch.  Perhaps run some Charmin through your LaserJet memorialize S 
Cott@.  See Matt Lupoli, 14, with his AARP membership card.  I mean, the 
possibilities are endless.

With my .gif you could test out the effectiveness of the new, improved 
Pepto Bismol.

So, who's up for it? ;)

Subject: Intro to Rush

Well...lessee here...
It was the winter of '91. I was 9 years old. My brother Joe was
visiting from college and I was delighted to seem him. At the time I
was listening to typical radio crap like "M.C. Hammer." (Please
forgive me, I was young and foolish.) Joe brought with him tapes by
bands like Queen , Kansas, and most importantly, Rush. The first Rush
song he played that I remember was 2112. I didn't much care for it.
After all, I was into (c)rap. So, later he took me into his bedroom
and said, "Here, you may like this. They rap a bit on it." He then
played Roll the Bones. I loved it immediately, and found myself
singing it in class for a few weeks after. He later made a copy for
me, which I held onto for a while. I listened to that for a good two
years, but never really got into Rush...

>...Until he came back from college again with Counterparts. By this
time, I had learned to think fo myself. He played some of it, and I
ate it right up. I taped that and a few other songs and slowly
proceeded to get into them. Rush quickly became my favorite band, and
they still are today. I finally saw them on June 6th, 1996
(ECHO!!!!!!!), and loved every minute of it. Using Rush as a starting
point, I've since developed interests in other bands (Floyd, 'Tallica,
Dream Theater). Thanks to Alex Lifeson (and my other brother, Pete)
and the opening riff to "Show Don't Tell", I've learned to play
guitar, which I've played for 4 years now and is VERY important in my
life. In other words, thanks Joe, and thanks Rush!

After letting him listen to the track, he admitted it...and ofcourse I
gave him a hard time ...ie "metallica rippring off rush music"..hehe

Lets start a thread here.  Are there other bands that use *any*
of rush music..ie chords, appergios, etc?

Greetings fellow Rushians - first time caller long time listener---

This is regarding the thread concerning musical moments that cause
goosebumps.

The following are my selections on this topic:

1. End of Hemispheres, prior to "the sphere"...we will call you
Cygnus, god of balance you will be....
As the band kicks in I have this image of Cygnus looking over the
world bring everything into balance.

2. Final chorous of Heresy - good god that is awesome.

As Geddy is singing "all those wasted years" Alex's guitar builds on a
few simple notes that just blow my mind.

3. Jacob's Ladder 6/8-7/8 section, background keyboard over
bass/guitar/drums.

4. Entre Nous-right before final chorus.

Great thread, hope it catches on.

Peace

Subject: The Great Debate - and Evander??

Well I must confess that I was the instigator of the great Phil Collins vs
Neil Peart debate in early January.  I went thru a PC phase, where all I
could see was that he could do no wrong!!  However I do stand by my comment
that he is more influential to watch than Peart etc.  What I didn't realise
was the animosity of the readers of NMS who slaughtered my comments.  It was
an opinion and that's all.  It has filtered down to the occasional
comparison of sportspersons and give it a couple of weeks and no-one shall
probably mention it again.	
By the way what the hell was that American woman judge watching @ the
Lewis/Holyfield fight?? Her fingernails??? Our man Lennox gave Holy-man a
lesson in boxing - great jabbing, nice o/hand rights. The thing Lennox
didn't do was to finish the job when given the chance (7th round).  Our man
won - and that's final!!!!!  I think I'm gonna buy an iron to straighten Don
Kings hair.

   Here's another odd similarity.  Neil Peart has often played sessions =
with the wonderful Toronto band The Rheostatics.  Similarly, last month =
at a Rheostatics concert, Rick Emmet did a walk on and performed improv =
guitar solo to 3 of their songs.

Re: Spine-tingling moments of beauty
For me, Mystic Rhythms from ASOH always does it for me.  That's a 
beautiful song, and something about hearing the stripped-down live 
version, seems so wonderfully naked and magical.

Re: Genesis/Three Sides Live
>From what I understand, the original US version had a 4th side of studio 
stuff, but the UK version and the remastered version (both in the US and 
UK) have four sides live.  I just picked it up used, and Bill Bruford 
and Steve Hackett are credited on a few songs.  This confuses me, 
because the liner notes say that those particular songs were recorded in 
1979, a few years after both men left.  So something in those liner 
notes isn't right.

Re: Rush not selling as many tickets
I think someone mentioned this before, but on the CP tour, Rush had one 
or more opening acts, which draw more fans to a show than Rush by 
themselves would.  I remember that tour, because at the time I was a big 
Primus fan, but not yet a Rush fan.  I was going to go, just to see 
Primus, but for whatever reason I didn't.  Wait... Actually, that was 
the RTB tour.  But my point (actually someone else's point) is still 
valid.  Another valid point is that selling 300,000 tickets and a 
triple-live album debuting at #35 on the Billboard charts could hardly 
be spell the end for Rush.  They're doing better than my band!  At 
worst, they may have to trim down their live stage show and play smaller 
venues.  Fine by me!

Re: Rush on the radio
Gets me every time too!  One night I was on my way to play a show in 
Madison and I was switching CD's.  I happened to catch Temples of Syrinx 
on Lazer 103, and I FLIPPED OUT.  I cranked up my stereo and started 
screeching at the top of my lungs along with Geddy.  When my band was 
soundchecking that night, I kept playing 2112 (and other Rush songs) to 
warm up, much to the annoyance of my Rush-hating bandmates.    Does 
anybody have any theories about why this happens?  What's so special 
about hearing Rush on the radio?

Who cares, Rush R00LZ!

Subject: The day I was born again.......

     I will never forget it. My car had broken down one night outside of
Cincinnati (actually it was my parent's car). I was 16 at the time, I was
into rock music, but not into RUSH. I was on I-75, hazard lights flashing,
waiting for a cop to pass by or some decent person to give me a ride to a
payphone. I actually sat on the side of the road for what seemed to be a 45
minute period. Low and behold there was a tour bus coming up the hill
towards me. After it passed me it came to a stop about 40 feet up the road.
I ran (of course) up to it, and the driver opened up the door and asked if
I needed a lift to a service station. I said that I just needed to get to a
phone to call my dad. He said that he had a mobile phone in the bus, and
that I could use it real quick. I used the phone, called my dad (who was a
cop) told him that the station wagon crapped out and that I needed him to
come pick me up. Before I got off the bus, a man came up to the front of
the bus to see if everything was ok. Well, anyways, if I told you who he
was, you would never believe me. But that's not the point of my story. I
thanked the bus driver, and turned to get off the bus. He handed me a
cassette tape and told me to "broaden my horizons". The tape contained some
music from RUSH. Needless to say RUSH had played at the Coliseum that night
in Cincinnati. That next week in school my friends, who were in the high
school band, heard my story and freaked out. They said that the blonde guy
who came up to the front of the tour bus had to be Alex Lifeson. 
     To this day I kick myself for not being a RUSH fan at the time of the
incident. But I have made up for it in the last 12 years. I own every LP
and every CD that they have put out. I have been to every concert since
"Hold Your Fire". At the "Test For Echo" concert in Florida I had second
row seats.I am a huge fan of RUSH, and always will be.

I think that one of the reasons for the lower turnout may have been the
band played ALOT more "smaller" outdoor "sheds", especially on the
second half of the tour in late spring, early summer. I also think the
"lag" between the first and second part of the tour lost alot of the
newer "T4E" fans, since they may have just figured they could see them
next time around. At the Toronto show, I was actually quite surprised at
the number of newer, younger Rush fans.(I am only 31...but alot of
teens.)

On another note, it was also nice to see families there...Mom and Dad
with the couple of kids. Just your normal, average, "urban" type of
family. It's great to see that Rush has reached SUCH a wide audience.

BTW, not to plug my website, but Alex will most likely be showing up as
a "special guest" for the Tom Cochrane show up in Barrie (Wasaga Beach),
Ontario on Friday May 21'st. Tom told me it had something to do with
"celebrating the opening of Golf season in Canada"..or something like
that..heh. Anyways...anybody here in Ontario..go..it will be a great
time! You can get tickets at http://www.ticketmaster.ca and just type in

Subject: Other Canadian Gems (re: Canadian Precious Metal)

In TNMS #2182, Frank Bettencourt compared Rush and Triumph (Subject:
Rush & Triumph : Canadian Precious Metal).

Another amazing Canadian band that don't seem to have recieved the
recognition they deserve is "The Tea Party".  Oddly enough, Australia
seems to have one of their largest fan bases.

They are a trio, consisting of Jeff Martin, Stuart Chatwood, and Jeff
Burrows, and are bsed in Toronto I believe.

Musically, they are heavy rock with some serious middle eastern
influences throughout their music.  This is a really bad comparison
(ie any other fans out there, please don't flame me! :^) but think of
Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir" (but way cooler), with Jim Morrison on
vocals. Jeff Martin seems to get some very similar vocal inflections
to the Lizard King.

Discography: The Indie CD (No longer available)
             Splendor Solis
             Edges of Twilight
             Alhambra (EP)
             Transmission
             Triptych (currently being recorded in Montreal)

I saw them live on the Transmission tour, and these guys rock like
hell! I was already a convert, but this just took my appreciation of
them to another level. They are incredibly tight, and have one of the
best live shows I've seen in some time.

Check out their official website @ www.teaparty.com

As a starting point, I'd recommend "The Edges of Twilight", although
it's a tough call between that, Splendor Solis, and Transmission.

Four weeks ago is wrong.  I found this guy's order envelope in my

K-Tel's Dancing Machine

I know, but I was only 7 years old. A few years later I got the KISS "I

later I got "Stay Hungry" from Twisted Sister. That album pissed my Mom

Okay, now for my first RUSH experience.  In 1998 my boyfriend, who was a

Subject: Love at first...listen

I just joined up on this list and since I enjoyed reading everyone
else's stories so much I thought I'd subject you all to my first Rush
experience as well.

My younger brother had been listening to Rush since he was in middle
or high school (I've always suspected he was smarter than me...).  I,
however, just figured it was one of he and his little friends' fads
and kept my nose clear (any other big sisters out there will
understand).

Until my sophomore year of college (8 years ago)...  One of my best
friends was a long-time Rush fanatic and was scandalized when I
brushed off Rush as "something my brother listens to."  So he grabbed
some tapes and me, and we went to the listening room to do some
studying.  He gave me RTB and listened to SoH.  I didn't get much
reading done--I was too busy enjoying the sound and berating myself
for my earlier scorn.  What I'd missed...!  My friend let me listen to
SoH when Neil's solo came up and that's when I figured out he liked
me--and I was hooked (on Rush, not him, to his disappointment) from
that moment on.

Glad to be "connected" to a bunch of other Rush fanatics (and anal
ones like me at that!)...

Subject: Acoustic guitar on Differnet Stages' Driven

Michael Z. Williamson said: "...listening to Driven.  I hear BOTH acoustic and
electric guitar during parts of it, and it sounds like two different riffs.
Either: A)  Alex is splitting the signal and using serious process and delay
on the electric side (likely) (and he has both pickups on the guitar), or ..."

Yes thats basically what he did.  This is from an interview in January's
Guitar World...

Alex Lifeson: "I had PRS make me a couple of guitars with transducer pickups
in the bridge, resulting in a hybrid acoustic/electric, which I used for
almost all of the acoustic-sounding stuff on Different Stages (the only
exception is "The Trees")....I just toggle switches on the guitar to change
from the acoustic to the electric sound.  There's a separate line that runs to
an Alesis multi-effects unit with a few differnet presets: a shimmering
12-string setting, a clean setting, one that is a little dirtier, and some
others.  "Driven" is another example of the acoustic/electric sound.  One of
the coolest things about combining the electric and acoustic sounds, like on
the chorus section of "Driven", is I'm doing a fast, steady 16th-note strum
with a really dirty sound, and while the acoustic guitar sound is going,
"chiga-chiga-chiga-chiga," the heavy electric sound is a steady, "Errrrrrrrr."
Together, you get the illusion of two guitars playing at once.  I do a similar
thing in "Resist," "Nobody's Hero" and "Natural Science."

Subject: how many sides has three sides live

Hello everyone,

I am not sure if I should be keeping on with this Genesis thread on 
the NMS [apologies for lack of direct Rush content].

Someone asked whether my listing of 3SL was actually Three Sides 
Live.  That got me worried.  I am at work, but my good friend Paul is 
in Australia [ie. it's evening time!], so he checked this out for me. 
Good man.

>Keith are you sure that you're talking about 3SL here?  Side 4 of 
>3SL are studio tracks including Paperlate and You Might Recall 
>(hence the name of the album).  just trying to clear things up for 
>anyone who might care.

We think that the confusion is that USA and UK had different versions
of Three Sides Live.    So, as Mark said, for anyone who cares=>

3SL [US version] - released in May 1982: Atlantic Records SD 2-2000
Featured [on side 4] ..... Paperlate / You Might Recall / Me & Virgil
/ Evidence of Autumn / Open Door.

Playing by PC and Chester T.  These are tracks taken from sessions 
during the making of *Duke* & *Abacab*.

When the album was re-mastered for CD, the track-listing for the UK 
release was used, viz 

3SL [UK version] - released in May 1982: Virgin Records GE 2002
Featured [on side 4] ..... the live tracks as described previously,
from 1976 & 1980, and featuring playing by Billy Bruford and Stevie
Hackett.

Source - The Genesis Discography 1967-96 by Steve McMahan.

Mystery solved ?  "I Don't Care No More".......

If you haven't heard Bill Bruford [this, for anyone left....is where 
the thread started] play on this stuff, I recommend it highly.  Not 
that it is "better" or "worse" than PC or Chester!-Chester!-Chester!, 
it's just so very different to hear BB taking the songs on.  

By the way, I seem to recall that BB was relieved of drumming duties 
in Genesis as he tended to be a bit close to the edge* every night, 
playing things a little differently.  What a star. 

That's Entertainment!

See you later.

Subject: My Rush Conversion

    First off, My name is eric and I'm an anal Rush fan.  <Aaaahhh>  I
feel better now.  Thank you Rushaholics Anonymous.    I too have all of
my CDs sorted alphabetically by group, then chronologically by album.
Not only that, but they all have the same physical orientation in the CD
cabinet (ie top is always up).  This means, of course, that if I place
them that way and the lettering on the edge is upside down, I'm forced
to do surgery on the CD case to correct this little problem.
    Secondly, I'm what you'd call a second, possibly third, generation
Rush fan.  The first concert after I discovered them was Roll the
Bones.  The first time I heard of Rush it was when I was a freshman in
highschool.  My brother had a friend that was a huge Rush fan and
consequently had a few token tapes lying around.  I'm not sure what it
was about the Tape case that made me want to check it out, but the first
tape I decided to "borrow" from him was Presto.  I listened to it...
listened to it again.  It was good, but I didn't give it much thought.
I did like it enough to listen to his other two or three Rush tapes and
decided I liked those as well.  Nothing much really came of it, except I
too was now a mediocre Rush fan.  A couple of years later, I had a good
friend that liked them as well.  We found out that we had a lot in
common, so we hung out a lot.  You know how something seems seems
funnier when you have a friend with which to laugh about it?  Things
seem to be more sensational when there is somebody with which to discuss
them.  It wasn't until this time that I REALLY listened to Rush and
began to appriciate.  Well, my friend and I never did anything half way,
so we had a race to see who would buy all of the (at the time) Tapes
first.  I won.  I have't looked back since.  On a side note, that friend
and I also started the 20's preservation society and a personal crusade
to convert all Democrats in our Computer Science class to Republicanism
(I realize now that the latter, however fun it was at the time, was a
futile jesture at best).  After much consideration, and much reading of
previous run-into-the-ground Rush threads, I conclude that both parties
are of more or less equal merit.  Both have faults and strengths.

Hi, everyone. 

I first would like to say thanks to all of you who wrote in with their intro 
to Rush stories. They are all very cool and have one thing in common: 
everyone seems to have had their life changed by Rush. I, too, knew I would 
play music immediately after hearing Rush for the first time. 

I am now a member of a band called "Trone". We are based in northeastern 
Maryland (so far up that the town is called North East) and we have a CD 
coming out (independent) early this summer. We sound different than Rush 
(much more accoustic based), but I'm sure one could identify the influence. 
Our website will be up and running soon, I'll keep you all posted. 

*Sorry if you think this is a shameless plug, but I would appreciate it if 
someone told me about some good quality, original, and independent bands.

The first record I ever owned was SGT. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band by the 
Beatles. What a start, huh? My parents gave it to me for Christmas when I was 
6 years old. 6 years old! (1976). What were they thinking? I think it was 
divine intervention. Thank God I was born into a family of music lovers.

The first record I ever bought myself was Double Vision by Foreigner. I think 
that vinyl LP cost about 7 or 8 bucks (a ton of money when you're 8 years old). 
I still have a special place in my heart for that album. I love the way that

David, this was by far my favorite story and here's why:
As stated in a previous e-mail to NMS, I live in Northeastern Maryland, so the 
Spectrum in Philly was the place I saw the bulk of my 50+ concert experiences 
in the past 12 years. I was probably at every Rush show in Philly right along 
with you. And get this: I had a '78 pinto as my first car. It wasn't quite 
orange, but it was close (kind of a peach color. I know, it was awful, but it 
ran for 2 years and it cost me only $400.) I really hadn't anticipated how 
this intro to Rush thread would take me down memory lane. Thanks for the 
response.

John

P.S. as a side note, the pinto was so junky that I let a friend, and band 
mate at the time, carve our band's name (Mayhem) into the dash board. Guess 
you had to be there.
