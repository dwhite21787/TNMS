Finally Beavis and Butt-Head have commented on a Rush video!! It was
"Stick It Out" (very appropos considering that the epichoad [as they
are known] is about them trying to get their penises enlarged but they
actually get their noses enlarged). Beavis wasn't too thrilled by it.
When he realized it was Rush he started screaming the bridge to "SoR"
(invisible airwaves crackle with life...) in his unique but unflattering
voice. They couldn't decide whether the guy on the pole was Lenny Kravitz
or "Our Lord Jesus Christ". They seemed to think the guy sitting on the
pole was cool and funny because....hehe...he's, like, sitting on a pole!
Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe!!!!!

I missed the name of the epichoad but it may be "Plastic Surgery". Oh, yeah,
a "choad" is what's between a guy's legs that doesn't have a twin next to it.

From: MikeGusway@aol.com
Subject: Re:Bass Questions

This posting is in response to a recent posting about Geddy's bass tone.
 First off, I've got a damn close approximation of the MP tone with my
current setup: Yamaha Attitude Custom (Billy Sheehan Model) bass, a Yorkville
Block80, and a KORG A4 processor.  Geddy's sound (esp. pre- ESL) comes from a
LOT of compression.  On the A4's scale of 0-15, I set it about 10, which is a
fairly high ratio.  Also, as far as EQ, boost around 200 Hz, and even more
around 1.5 KHz.  My amp is set pretty much flat, 'cause my bass has a great
sound to begin with, and the A4 does all the rest.  Invest in either an A4
(they're great units!!) or at least a small compressor, like a pedal.
 Compression gives it the punch, yet evenness of levels, and the EQ brings
out the presence of the bass for the Geddy Lee/Chris Squire sound.  Also, try
using a bit of chorus or flange for the YYZ sound.  This is all subjective to
the kind of bass, pickups, amp, etc. that you use, but this is a general
guideline.  I'm a fairly reknown studio/live engineer in the area, and have
lots of experience and compliments regarding bass sound. If anyone's
interested further in the techie stuff, E-mail me at <mikegusway@aol.com>  I
don't want to waste further bandwith on "boring" stuff like this. <g>
Rush rules!!
P.S.  Anyone ever hear of Michael Manring??  He won BassPlayer mag.'s Bassist
of the Year.  If you like great bass playing then you MUST get a load of
Mike's new album THONK.  Unbelievable.  Guest drummer: Tim "Herb" Alexander
of Primus.  Later!

That gives me an idea.  I think I'll do the same thing.  If more people did
this, we would be reminded of Rush songs which really turned us on and we
would know what to look for when listening to our albums. Anyways, enough
babbling:

Fav guitar solo- Exactly 13 minutes into 2112 (The Studio Version)
Fav bass line- the line that Ged plays during Alexes solo on Freewill
Fav drum part- I dunno, but you're right Natural Science is a good song to
hear good drumming.

Oh, as long as we're on the subject of highlights from our favorite songs,
someone check out the bass solo in the end of Nature Boy by Primus!!  Holy
cow, I go insane everytime I hear it!!  When I saw that in concert, I went
totally insane!!!  Oh well, back to Rush:

I noticed someone mention that Rush fans have diverse musical tastes, and
that Rush fans listen to many of the same bands, and by the same token, we
can pretty much agree on who we don't like (such as C+C Music Factory).  I
think that is a good observation.  I know I am a Rush fan, but I also
listen to everything from Suzanne Vega to Stevie Ray Vaughn to Nailbomb.
Some other bands that Rush fans seem to agree on: Primus, Tool, King's X,
and a couple others I forget.  These are just peresonal observations.  Does
anyone agree with me, or am I the only one who senses these things?

	I was listening to the radio and a strange thought entered my head.
Has anyone ever wondered what it must be like in the House of Rush...does Geddy
sing Christmas carols to his family?? That got me to thinking about how great
it would be to have a Christmas album by the boys...call it Christmas Rush...
	Imagine a Geddy Lee rendition of Silent Night (al la Rivendell) how
about Alex doing Jingle Bell Rock with a long moody solo in the middle and what
Christmas album would be complete without Neil's version of the Little Drummer
Boy with a 15 minute snare and hi-hat solo done in 7/4....i get goose bumps
thinking about it... :)
	Hope everyone has a very RUSHful Christmas!

Subject: L.A. Review

I write concert reviews and other music-oriented stories for Daily Variety,
an Entertainment Industry trade paper here in L.A., and thought that some of
y'all might want to read my review from Rush's L.A. Forum gig of 2-3-94.

As you may imagine, it's not easy to remain objective while reviewing your
favorite band, but I did try. Also, editors did mess with it a bit but it is
pretty close to what I turned in. Feel free to e-mail any comments,
corrections, etc.

Also, I thought it might be interesting to hear what special, legitimate
(Non-bootleg) Rush items people may own. Probably not interesting enough to
justify a separate post, but maybe while folks are posting for other reasons
they can also mentions some of their fave personal goodies. Me, I have lots
of promo cd singles ("Time Stand Still" through "Nobody's Hero") as well as
white lable promo vinyl of "Rush," "FBN" vinyl w/ lyric sleeve, "Hemispheres"
red vinyl, "Presto" promo pencil with bouncing bunny on the eraser end. Also,
I interviewed Geddy a couple years ago for an article in RIP magazine. He was
as nice as I could have hoped.

Anyway, here's the review and sorry about the length - please, no flames.

*It's not as if Rush has anything left to prove. The Canadian pwer trio's
long string of top-10 albums and sold-out concert tours and its large and
loyal fan base speak volumes about the Atlantic band's popularity, if not its
musical relevance in 1994.

Entering the packed arena to music from "2001: A Space Odyssey," Rush seemed
in a loose, spirited mood, matching the stripped-down, soulful tone of the
group's excellent new Atlantic album, "Counterparts." Unfortunately, this
hockey arena's cavernous design offered little acoustic cooperation, laying
sonic waste to the set's beginning.

Too bad, because it was early in the two-hour show that the band -
singer/bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peat - was
most effective in conveying its rediscovered inspiration, particularly with
music from the new album.

Song's like "Nobody's Hero," about what it means to be truly gallant, and
"Cold Fire" signal a return to the more guitar-oriented sound that brought
the band fame early in its career and represent an effort on the group's part
to sing about subjects more accessible than space travel and science fiction.

But a flat, heavy sound mix served to dull the music, counteracting the
trio's efforts. Blame can also be laid on Rush's long-standing habit of
relying heavily on vocal and instrumental samples, necessary to reproduce the
band's elaborate recordings but ultimately a spontaneity muffler.

The sound did improve in time for the much-anticipated oldies jam at show's
end. Old faves "The Trees" and "Xanadu" were greeted wildly, the latter even
featuring the return of Lifeson's double-neck guitar, not seen since 1981.
The spacey "Hemispheres," not performed since 1980, and hit "Tom Sawyer,"
which ended with a mini fireworks display, were exciting show closers.

Musically, all three band members are still at the top of their game,
particularly Peart. His awesome solo still drops jaws, his technical
precision and uncanny sense of dramatic timing still something to behold.

Rush seems dedicated to constantly reinventing contemporary, progressive
rock, even in the face of grunge and slacker rock. And until the day comes
that these three musicians lose their inspiration, a Rush show will remain
one of pop's great spectacles.

Maverick/Warner Bros. band Candlebox opened the show with a fairly likable if
unspectacular 30-minute set. The Seattle quartet, sounding a bit like Pearl
Jam meets Blind Melon, earned its biggest applause when guitarist Peter Klett
played a riff from "Working Man," a song from Rush's 1974 debut album.*

Subject: First time post

I've been busy reading past NMS's (I started at issue #1000). I am
impressed with the dialog between Rush fans...no matter whether anyone
agrees with anyone else, I feel it's a gift to all Rush fans to be able
to get together here and hash it out. I love this whole technology
thing.

Anyway, I have a thought I'd like to share with you all and maybe get
some feed back on:

I recently bought the 3 Rush UltraDisk II's (2112, Moving Pictures,
Signals). I haven't opened any of them. I'm not sure if I want to. I
mean, obviously the CD's were made to be listened to (not to mention the
music). However, I already have all 3 releases on "standard" CD.

Can anyone comment on the "collectibility" of these UltraDisks? They
will be worth more in the future if they are kept "Virgin". But, I am a
die hard Rush-addict that wants to rip the disks open and enjoy the
incredible music to it's fullest potential.

If I was rich I'd just buy a couple of each Ultradisk...one to
play...one to collect. But, I'm not.

Thanks

-Mike

Dear NMS'ers:

My apologies if this has already been covered, I've been dis-connected for
awhile, but two sources I've seen have talked of a new rush release (the
live album?).

One was a dj on 96.3fm in columbus, ohio that said a new rush album was due
out 1st quarter '95 and the other was a SPIN magazine bbs that had a new
relases list for atlantic records which showed a new rush release on March
25th or 28th, I forget which.

Anyone else gotten wind of this?

Any of those guitarists would be able to play Broon's Bane...no
problem.  Which is not to take away from Alex at all.  He may not
be the greatest guitarist of all time (J.P. is the master!), but
he is widely known for his incredible skill at pinch harmonics.
He can make 'em scream with the best of 'em (Ala: Turn the Page).

If you're going to read those, you should also read Barbara Branden's
biography of Rand, stupidly titled _The Passion of Ayn Rand_, and
Nathaniel Branden's memoir, _Judgment Day: My Years with Ayn Rand_.

Ayn Rand wrote good novels and developed an interesting philosophy, but
her personal life bore little resemblance to either.

 Hmmm... people seem grumpy in this holiday season. Lotsa a bitching about this

 Anyway...

 I definitely think the stream with everyone putting ideal bands together is
one of the best I've seen so far. Facinating.
 For instance, one person re-united Roger Waters and David Gilmour, only to
put Neil Peart and Les Claypool in the rhythm section. Wow! The busiest rhythm
section in history under the most straight-forward song-writers possible...
(actually, I can't even imagine that combo... short-circuits my imagination I
guess)

 Criteria for my band:
	- compatibility of musical styles
	- creativity in own medium
	- general success at collaborating
	- song-writing collaboration potential

 Thus:
	BASS/VOX- Sting. No offense, but he's better than Geddy. Maybe the only
one, too. Plus: great vox and unmatched songwriting skills.
	RHYTHM GUITAR/VOX- David Byrne. Has definitely proved himself with the
playing on his last 3 albums. Knows exactly what to do, and when to do it.
Song-writing is also a major plus.
	DRUMS- Neil Peart. Two albums ago, I probably wouldn't have picked
him, but RTB and especially CP have demonstrated his creative maturity. Knowns
when to vanish, knows when to dominate.
	LEAD GUITAR- Dominick Miller. Easily them most under-rated guitarist in
the world. Faster than Eddie, more creative than Alex (tho not always).
	KEYBOARDS- Peter Gabriel. Knows his way around a piano, but picked
mostly for what he can bring to the composition side.

	I imagine they can all swtich off doing lead, as the song demands. A
band with four good singers in a cool thing.

	Now, when's their first album being released?

Subject: Unusual 1st Album

I have something rather bizarre and RUSH related in my album
collection. It's their 1st album (at first glance) but
something is amiss. The album cover is for their first album,
(picture of greasy-haired Alex and all) and when you pull out
the album, the labels are for their first album. However, the
material recorded on both sides is Bachman Turner Overdrive.
There must have been some kind of screwup at the pressing
plant. Does anyone else have something like this? Would you
consider it rare and collectible or just junk?

Subject: First Album/Song

First post since July 24, 1994. First Rush song heard: The Camera Eye, April
1982. Favorite today: The Camera Eye.

When I wore out The Camera Eye track on my first MP album I thought, "I'd
better stop listening to this one song so much because I'll get bored
of it and I won't like it anymore." I knew from experience that if I heard
a song too much I'd get bored with it or even sick of it. Well, I didn't
stop blasting out that song. I went through two records and one tape
before getting the "indestructible" CD.

It's the same with many Rush songs. I can hear them over and over and
I never stop enjoying them. I have never had this experience with any other
group or type of music and through subscribing to TNMS since April, it
seems as if I'm in good company vis-a-vis Rush. Is this what makes Rush
fans such diehards? Is this why some people think we're wierd? (when I say we
I mean only the fans I've met, they're haven't been many, I'm certainly
not calling everyone subscribing to TNMS as "wierd", although I take it
as a compliment :-))

What is it about Rush that year after year I can play the same songs and
never tire of them? I'll get into a certain kind of music or group and like it
for awhile but then I get bored with it and go back to Rush.

My parents, family, friends thought that playing MP over and over again
was just a phase, "he'll tire of it like everything else" and that
was almost 13 years ago.

So, what is it about Rush and their fans?? Are there any other rock groups
that have fans as loyal as most of us? Why am I so loyal? Why do I never
tire of their music?

P.S. There is no such thing as a "bad" album/song or a "good" album/song.
Music is a matter of personal taste and preferences. One person's beer
could be another person's vomit. Or something to that effect. I'd better go.

I'm writing about Neil's cymbals and his last interview.

	First, Neil has helped design many cymbals for Zildjian,
including the Rock crashes and the newer A Custom cymbals in
collaboration with other Zildjian artists like Vinnie Colaiuta and Steve
Smith.  He does use A Zildjian Rock crashes, though without brilliant
finishes (according to the same poster Mr. Hokanson is looking for).  His
ride does have a brilliant finish-- it's the same ride, according to the
Feb 94 modern Drummer and Armand Zildjian "that he's used since he was a
kid." (a 22" Ping Ride).  Also, Neil doesn't like any logos on his cymbals.

	The last great Article on Neil was in that same February 1994
Modern Drummer in which he was the cover feature.  Pick it up-- it's got

Just to extend the thought, here -- I think Neil's style isn't any less
complex, as it is more subtle.  He's not as bombastic as he used to be
(sniff sniff), but the complexities in his playing still remain.  They've
just been transferred to complex ride patters, or hi-hat patterns, or more
interaction between the bass drum and snare; stuff like that.  Stuff you
really have to *listen* for; it doesn't just come right at you, like "Tom
Sawyer."  The complexities of his playing are now in honing his skills to
control the stick, for instance, rather than how to wack the drum.

I only have Max Websters' "Universal Juveniles" to go by, but I suspect
that the judgements listed above are, in fact, due to fans'
misinterpretation of Mitchell.  Kim Mitchell, like Frank Zappa, and even
Rush, have the rare ability to fuse humour with music in an intelligent
way.  I think that's why Rush and Max W. got along so well because they
both recognized that dry wit in each other.  Take "April in Toledo", ofr
example.  It's *hysterical!*  I cracked up the first time I heard it!
It's meant to be funny!  But it is understandable how it could be  seen as a
serious song that's really infantile.  So I think if people kept the idea
of humour in their minds, I think Mitchell's work would be seen in the
light it deserves.

I can understand why they do it, and like James, I agree that it's a phase you
need to pass through as a musician.
I played in a band for quite a few years, and yes I did play covers (but not
Rush). They're fun to do, and it's something the crowd recognises and likes.
I think that trying to clone a band is very sad, and I'm sure that Rush would
say "get a life of your own" to them.

Thanks again to all for a great talking place. See you all in the New Year,

I have this on music cassette: it was released in the UK by Mercury in 1978
(I think) as Mercury 7141 171. I don't know if it was available elsewhere in
this format....

Got this as well. I see this listed in dealer adverts for about UK10 pounds in

If anybody is interested, I've got a patch that does a pretty good job of
duplicating this with a Yamaha DX-100. I'm sure it could be easily adapted (and
further refined, given two more operators) for the DX-7. But, if you want the
real thing, a sample would be your best bet.

If you can ever find a Sequential Circuits Six-Trak, attempt to acquire at all
costs! This was a marvelous hybrid synth. Analog synthesis, but with digital
controls, including MIDI and a pretty nifty (though primitive) sequencer. We
did patches on that thing that sounded EXACTLY like the keyboards for
Subdivisions, and programmed in into the sequencer the whole synth routine. We
called it our "Geddy-in-a-box" sequence. When we had rehearsed for 5 hours
straight, and it was 3 in the morning, we got a little silly with it! :)

In reply to PARMERTERB@hartwick.edu:

It's not that I don't think Hugh Syme is an amazing designer/artist
(lately his digital artwork has been amazing).  I mainly felt that he is
kind of entering a stagnant period where all of his album covers are
starting to look the same.  (Megadeth, Queensryche, Fates Warning, etc.)
where he is using the same fonts, textures, color schemes and layouts
over and over again.  I guess I just want to see him take some more
risks!  Personally I feel the Counterparts cover - though I liked it -
was a little cluttered, and that Aerosmith: Get a Grip wasn't very good
at all.

I don't think that if Rush were to contract someone else to do their next
album cover it would necessarily be bad at all (re: your comment about
the first album cover).  I was comparing their recent decision to change
producers for a new musical feel to the possibility of changing graphic
designers to reflect their new attitude.

     What year is it, 1976, or 1994?  Neil, in the last 20 years, has read
many other authors besides Ayn Rand.  I am in the process of reading The
Fountainhead right now, and I can see her influence in a lot of Neil's
older songs, but I don't see it that much in his more recent works.  What
I am trying to say is that, although he may agree with some of her views,
this does not make him a pure Objectivist.  As for Neil being a Libertarian,
people are saying that because he himself has said it.  If you check in the
FAQ, I am pretty sure that it states it in there somewhere.  If not, I
know that past interviews have mentioned it.  He distinctly states that
he is a "left-wing libertarian."  Since this is my first post and I know

Subject: Jyhad

Hi all!
I went to my local Game Sanctuary fantasy gaming store today and bought
a pack of the Jyhad Deckmaster card game (those who play Magic: the Gathering
probably know of this and possibly play the game).  Anyway, since this
was the first time I had bought the Jyhad cards I promptly went home and
later read the instructions on how to play.  I used the cards as a visual
reference so I could better understand how to play it.  This is where the
Rush part comes into play.  They were describing a type of card called
a Master card which you, as vampires, use to perform certain actions.
So they began to talk about 3 different types of master cards, one of
which was a location card.  So I leaf through my cards and find a master:
unique location card called Elder Library.  Now generally on these cards
they try to fit some kind of literary, poetic, or some other such passage
on the bottom of the card.  Well low and behold I read it and it said:
"I have heard the whispered
tales of immortality
the deepest mystery.
>From an ancient book I took a clue.
Rush, Xanadu"
I couldn't believe it!  Usually they have poets who write something or
they make up their own quote keeping the world in context.  This is the
first time I saw a song, and it was by Rush!! It was just a mind boggling
experience ;)  I'm even more psyched to play this game now!  Too bad everyone
I know plays Magic and nobody really plays Jyhad.
Rush mng.--If I can I will attempt to scan in the picture of the card.
We have scanners at the school, but I'm not really sure how to use them.
I know some people who may be able to help me do it, as well as how to get
it to syrinx, if you or anyone else wants the card picture.
