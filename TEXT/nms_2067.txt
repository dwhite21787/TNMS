Subject: Old Rush Sighting

Forgive me Rush fans, but in all the times I have read the different
Rush sightings in the TNMS's, I never thought to contribute my one and
only real live Rush sighting.
BACK THE CLOCK UP ABOUT 14 YEARS
June 6, 1984 (or thereabout)
I'm 18 yrs old and am driving down I-20 in west Texas early in the
morning (9am) to pick up a friend at a ranch to take him to that
evenings Rush Concert scheduled in Odessa, Texas.  Distances in West
Texas are sometimes shocking to outsiders, but locals think very little
of three hour drives - mine being twice that amount round trip.
Near Monahans Texas (35 miles w of Odessa) I catch up to a four door car
with a rental bumper sticker on it.  As I pass it I notice the three men
inside the vehicle.  I'll never forget it now, but at the time I didn't
have a clue. Geddy was driving, NP was in the front seat, and Alex was
in the backseat with his arm sort of thrown over the front seat talking
to the other two.
Now having most of my Rush collection on 8-track tapes was a distinct
disadvantage here, since the eight track did not have pictures of the
band members.
For one reason or another I noticed GL's nose (it is rather large) and
Alex's distinctive haircut.
Well the rental turns off at Monahans Sand Hills State Park and I
continue on my mission. It is only later when I plug my new Grace Under
Pressure Cassette into my car's new cassette player that I realize I had
seen the three of them in the rental. My friend spent most of the return
trip to Midland telling me I should have followed them into the park and
gotten autographs, that and the fact he kept hitting me!(just kidding)
That night I saw Rush in concert for the first time.  It was the
Pres/Grace tour and I enjoyed it tremendously, even though my whinny
girlfriend at the time had the three of us move three seperate times
because it was too loud.  Since then I have learned/retained what the
band members look like and have seen them 4 more times in concert,
(HYF/OK CITY, Presto/Dallas, RTB/Lubbock*, TFE/Dallas) but wonder what
would have happened if I had only turned right into the State Park.

*RTB in Lubbock was the best of the five since my wife won near front
row tickets in a "Roll the Bones" radio station, 94.5 KFMX, give away
with a dice roll of 12 (I rolled a seven). My skin tingled with "Roll
the Bones" and I got something in my eyes, real men don't cry, during
"Time Stand Still"

Hey Hey!

Got a question for the non-North American Rushians out there (you know
who you are!).  How did you get into Rush?

Was it as easy as turning on a rock station or seeing them on MTV (back
when it was good)?  Or did you have to go to extra lengths to learn
about this great band?  I guess we who can hear some Rush on the radio
may take the band for granted, but what about people who have to really
seek them out?

A little Rush moment:

Rush really helped me on my bicycling vacation in Ireland.  I'd start up
a b.a.h. (big ass hill), and I'd sing to myself, trying to keep a
cadence going.  Sometimes I'd sing one of my songs or Johnny Horton's
Battle of New Orleans, but Rush kept popping into my head, especially
Prime Mover and Marathon.

I now return you to your regular programming.

i think it might be just because the word "erotica" was used in
"neurotica."  you know how strict some of those things used to be, they

I must concur, on both points.  RUSH IS GREAT!  and i have seen
Disgruntled Postal Workers at the Birchhill.  I'm friends with one of
the members' cousins and he took a bunch of to see them.  in fact, my
first comment to him was that they sounded like RUSH.  i would
definitely recommend checking them out.

Subject: DCK Rush sighting

I was using the DCK (a DOOM editor) today when
I had a Rush Sighting.  If you want to run a level
that you're editing, you can do it from the editor.
It will ask you for the level of difficulty also.
Instead of using the scale that DOOM uses, it picks
A random scale scale that has a common theme.  One
of the themes is Rush.  The scale goes (from lowest
to highest):
Finding My Way
Distant Early Warning
Red Sector A
Manhattan Project
Force Ten

I thought that was pretty neat.  (It was DCK version 3.62 by the way)

My dream band...

Guitar & Vocals- Jerry Cantrell (My Song is currently my favorite)
Guitar - Angus Young (trading lead and rhythym)
Bass - Mike Anthony
Drums - Lars Ulrich

But do you think they'd mesh? Jerry and Lars come from far 
darker backgrounds than Angus and Mike.

You're way off there. The last album I can remember is for Power
Windows.

	Anyway, TFE was released on vinyl in case you don't know. It is very
rare and it was only available for a limited time. It is mentioned
during Part 8 of the TFE World Priemere interview, which is available at

Subject: In Defense of "Dog Years/TFE"

Hello Rush Fans,

Allow me to defend "Dog Years" and all of Test For Echo for that matter.
Ashamed as I may be to admit it, I lost interest in Rush in the mid 80's after
the release of GUP.  

At the age of 18 in 1984, I for one, did not like their change of pace on GUP,
so I took my musical interests elsewhere.  At the time, I just wanted them to
maintain the PW & MP sound a while longer . . . Signals was a more than enough
change for me at the time.

I have since gone back and caught up with the great sounds of PoW, HYF &
Presto, but it was RTB, Counterparts & especially TFE that truly re-ignited my
passion to listen to this era of Rush's music again with an open mind and
appreciate their creative integrity and changing sounds.

Seeing them on tour in Columbus, Ohio last year was the real clincher . . .
you could say that I felt like I had died and gone to doggie heaven : )

Anyhoo . . . Dog Years has a very good message to it and I totally agree with
"mrfranklin@west.raytheon.com" who wrote that this song has the "most raw
energy since Tom Sawyer".    

For that matter, the whole album has an aggressive, almost angst ridden feel
to it that I find more appealing with each spin in the CD player.

In closing, let me also partially agree with Michael who wrote:

<<You Bet Your Life (Is it just me, or did Billy Joel do this exact song, but
it was called 'We Didn't Start the Fire'?)>>

I don't think you can listen to this with an open mind and not hear the
similarities . . . by the way . . . Billy Joel's "Storm Front" CD containing
this song was released in October of '89 while RTB was released in July of '91
>. . .  just food for thought.

Peace & Health,
David

Subject: My favorite bands

Hi fellow Rushians,
	Anyway, I'm new to the mailing list. I've only been a member since
Monday. I'm a 14-year-old obsessed Rush fan and I'm from Connecticut. I
live in North Haven, Connecticut, but I really live on the border of
North Haven and Wallingford, Connecticut. Wallingford is the home of
Oakdale Theater (for those of you who heard about it.) "Yes" just had a
concert there. It's a great theater. Rush never had a concert there
though. It used to be a small crummy theater but they recently remodeled
it and made it much bigger so now a lot of bands want to go there. I
hope that Rush will have a concert there for the new live album (being
that I live so damn close to it. I can practically ride my bike over
there.)	
	Anyway, I'd like to list my favorite bands in no particular order:
	
	Rush (of course)
	Led Zeppelin (without a doubt)
	The Beatles
	The Greatful Dead
	The Jimi Hendrix Experience
	Boston
	Pink Floyd
	The Rolling Stones
	Aerosmith
	Yes

I would also like to list my idea of some of the world's greatest
musicians:

	Best Guitarist of all time: Jimi Hendrix
	2nd Best Guitarist of all time: Eric Clapton
	Best Percussionist (Drummer) of all time: Neil Peart (of course)
	2nd Best Percussionist of all time: John Bonham

Well, that's it. See you later fellow Rushians

Subject: Songs in Hell

Allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Joel.  I  live a little town
named Orlando.  You may have heard of it.  Have been subscribed this
list for quite some time now, but I rarely write.  This subject,
however, of 1 song to listen to in hell piqued my interest.

Well, here goes.  The one song I would listen to is NOT a Rush song.
Sorry guys.  It's my fav and it's probably the cheesiest you've ever
heard -- "Sailing" by Christopher Cross.  It would be pretty soothing
while I am sitting there in hell against my rock.  I would just sit back
and think of the ocean breeze and it would probably cool me down quite a
bit.

BUT, if I was going to pick a Rush song, it would have to be La Villa
Strangiato or YYZ.  Yes, I would miss Geddy singing, but these songs
show off their technical prowess more than most.  Maybe they'd even let
me bring an instrument with me to learn how to play along.

Subject: Re: Originality? RUSH sighting

OK, I had let the whole Alex Van Halen thing drop until Marskaoto posted in #
2063 about AVH's drum solo -  "Instead during his solo he played along to
video tracks of himself...I think it was an ingenious, imaginative,
interesting, pleasing and ORIGINAL way to do a drum solo." I couldn't let this
pass by without replying. As I believe Marie Antoinette said, "There's nothing
new except what's been forgotten." I remember seeing the British glam/pop/hard
rock band The SWEET on their only U.S. tour back in 1975. Their drummer, whose
name I forget, did the exact same thing!!! They had 3 screens above the stage
and synchronized 3 movie (film not video!) projectors of him playing drumset,
timpani, and I think some percussion. Now that WAS amazing as there were no
computers to run the whole thing. It was an act of sheer luck when it worked!
The moral of the story: There IS nothing new and everybody copies from
everybody else. I don't like Van Halen the band, but admire AVH for being a
great drummer. Comparing NP & AVH is like apples and oranges - they're both
good. Now leave him alone!

>Obligatory RUSH sighting. Back around the same time (mid 70's) I spent my
youth playing rock n roll at clubs in northern Wisconsin and the Upper
Peninsula. I can't remember where it is exactly, but on many of my trips the
main highway crossed state highway 2112. I always got a bit of a rush when we
drove by...

Hi,

With it being the holiday and all, i was wondering if anyone ever heard
Rush music as background for fireworks displays.  I was driving around one
day listening to one of my favorite station, and they happened to be
sponsoring a fireworks display and as the fireworks started, they opened
up with 2112 Overture.  I was psyched...

Thanks,

 This post is in regards to DJ Benjamin's question about "Stellar Dynamics"
 
 I too have a copy of Stellar Dynamics, it is an album recorded over 2
 nights in Cleveland I believe when Rush opened for either Kiss or
Aerosmith
 I'm not sure. It does have a really cool version of Fancy Dancer on it
 though. On the album it's called "Mystery Title"

That's about all I know. Just oput of curiosity, what number is your
 Electric Ladyland album. I own that one too and mine is number #057 out of
 500 made.

By the way DJ I tried to email this to you but it wouldn't go through. I
tried your homepage but it doesn't see, to exist. 

Oh well.

	Yes.  Mystic Rhythms was used as a bumper for a show called 1985, but
it was a NBC(not PBS ) news show.  Only NBC would start a news show in
the fall of the season and give it a dated name.  Anyway the show never
made it past the first break of the year.

	Also caught Plant and page last night.  Great show, but boy have they

Subject: Thoughts on Live Album/Fav. Jams

Well, as I ponder my dream setlist for the new live album(s), I can't
help but think Presto will be poorly represented because from the CP and
T4E tours, only "Show Don't Tell" was played.  Also, from RTB, only the
first threesongs made the cut (too bad they didn't play "The Big
Wheel"--I like it better than "Ghost...") on the two tours.  Anyways,
among the older stuff they should put on RED BARCHETTA (I like the new
middle where they drastically slow down the tempo and I love Geddy's bass
at the ending),LIMELIGHT, CLOSER TO THE HEART  (because it's tradition?),
HEMISPHERES PRELUDE (hey, it has to be represented), NATURAL SCIENCE,2112
and SUBDIVISIONS (only because of it being a personal fav.--I know it's
probably not going to make the cut).  It's tough making a setlist, when
you have so many great songs, you try it!  

Fav. song intro...CP tour "We've gone country"...intro to "a southern
song called Cold Farr."

On the album premiere, Peart said that "Dog Years" was written on the
morning after a nigt of "celebrating", and because he "'is a
professional", wrote the lyrics with humor.  Geezm you guys complainig
about the lyrics missed their humor again!  Do you guys understand about
Part 4 of Ganster of Boats Trilogy?  I son't mean to be flammatory, but
sometimes, they need to write a nonsensical song to lighten the album up,
anyone else agree?

The Lerxst solo thread made me think of some of my favorite jams in
songs, not necessarily just Lifeson by himself. 
 -After the middle part in "Jacob's Ladder" when the bass joins Alex and
Neil is matching the music with great percussion work.
 -The 2 minute-plus part in "The Camera Eye" right before the "Grim faced
and forbiding..." and it occurs in other parts just not as long
 -The end of Prime Mover when the music builds, "the point of surrender."

Finally, A Question for drummers:  When the drummer hits a type of
cymbal, it makes a sound that I always say sounds like rubbing sandpaper,
I apologize for my vagueness.  To give you an idea, it occurs a lot in
songs, but stands out at end of Subdivisions, Prime Mover, Jacob's Ladder
(see above), Tai Shan, etc.  HOw is that created?  What's it called?

Sorry again for long post, but I have a lot to say about RUSH.  Who
doesn't?

Hi folks,

There were a few folks here who remembered a band called MARA from
Cincinnati - a RUSH (among others) influanced original rock band.  Our
second album has been released in Europe and Japan, receiving VERY good
reviews over the last few months.

We have been informed that MARA was selected to preform at the Cincinnati
leg of VH-1's Rock Across America  - opening the show for The Torries and
Cheep Trick on July 4th.  The show is at the Timberwolf ampltheator at
Paramont's Kings Island.  The show is FREE with the cost of admition to
the park.

I just wanted to let the MARA fan's on TNMS know that we're still around,
still recording, and being recognized.  Your continued support is much
appreciated!

Thanks!

   Jim Questa - Keyboardist - MARA  -

Subject: Jumping In

Just writing a bit while waiting for my MD 4-track to finish copying.  This 
thing is an absolute quantum leap over my old Tascam Porta-03 cassette 
4-track (anyone else ever used one of those?), but every time you do _any_ 
digital editing function, even if it's deleting a 1/15th-of-a-second 
hesitation, you have to copy the _whole_ song before you can do another 
edit.  And copying a song can take over 5 minutes.

The song I'm working on is the first in my series of home-recorded Rush 
covers, which I mentioned a while back.  I'm covering one song from each of 
the studio albums in order and will (hopefully) put them on the Web 
somewhere.  The selection from _Rush_ on which I am currently working is 
"What You're Doing".  I was originally thinking "Working Man", but I went 
back and listened to it to learn it and darned if that song isn't at least 
half guitar solo/jam.  Fun in a band but a damn pain if you have to go 
through and lay down a starting rhythm guitar part BY YOURSELF...  WYD 
doesn't have that problem (though it repeats a LOT)...

To participate in a couple threads here:

People seem to be talking about their least favorite Rush songs.  Well, I 
love all of it, from the blue-collar blues-metal of _Rush_ to the high-prog 
late-70's stuff to the more radio-friendly '80s and onward, but the one 
song I _just_ can't get into is <BLASPHEMY ALERT> "Natural Science".
I KNOW that NS is considered one of their classics, but when I listen to 
it, the sections just don't hang together.  In my ears, they don't really 
add up to a song.  And some parts of it just embarass me when I hear them, 
particularly the lyrics to the third section (especially the last line of 
each stanza) - they just seem very clumsy and adolescent to me compared to 
Neil's normally tight writing.
The only parts of NS I really like are the very beginning (up to the 
"Wheels within wheels" part - and why is this section _repeated_ later in 
the song?) and the very end ("Wave upon wave"...).
I know what you're saying: "Then don't listen to it".  I usually don't - I 
listen to the beginning and skip the rest.
I don't really _hate_ this song, it's not a _bad_ song, it just seems like 
a real misstep for Rush, something I might expect adolescent Rush-wannabees 
to come up with, not the Boys themselves...

My favorite non-Rush bands (in no order):
Queen (first rock band I ever got into; their early stuff is still fun to 
       listen to)
Beatles (and some of the members' solo albums, esp. Paul)
Pink Floyd (while they still had Roger Waters)
The Who
Jimi Hendrix

Yes (up to and including _Going for the One_)
King Crimson (and Adrian Belew's solo stuff)
Genesis (especially the two albums made immediately after PG left)
David Bowie (esp the "Berlin Trilogy", that period)

Weather Report (and Jaco Pastorius' solo stuff)
Yellowjackets
Pat Metheny (don't laugh, he's a HELL of a guitarist)
Dave Weckl's solo albums

Pixies
Veruca Salt
Beck

Metallica
Pantera

     on one with Rick Rubin?)

>...and probably many others.  I think my CD collection has cracked the 400 
mark now.  :-9

Well, I'll let you go read something else now...  More news on the 
home-recorded covers when there is any.

Subject: When Van Halen was a band!

Dear TMNS subscribers,

        I've been reading a lot of posts about Van Halen, lately. I guess I
have to say that this band certainly had their heyday and glory, especially
from a standpoint of musical integrity, but only on their first four
releases. They packaged their gutsy, powerful arena bursting rock around
Eddie's talents, and the 1978-1983 era of the band is fondly remembered.

        Our local radio station has played "Fire in the Hole" a few times,
and it's a bit of a throwback to the good old days of VH. Eddie can still
play feversishly, but it's a shame we don't have that kind of music from
them all the time.

        Rush and Van Halen are two of the most successful rock bands in
history, but both acheived this success in different ways. Fortunately, our
Canadian heroes have made it without compromising or giving into the whims
of those who think they know more than they do about music. I really can't
say the same for Van Halen. I wonder in a few years when they are staring at
their 25th anniversary, if they truly can be happy about their musical past.

        I would say that Geddy, Alex, and Neil have been the only real
constant in musical excellence since the mid-70's. And I have no doubt that
this will be the case as we head into the new millenium.

Subject: re: zzz NNC NZC NRC guitar modes

In response to "Marianne M. Voogt" <mvoogt@interlynx.net> on 6/30/98:

>what are the fingerings for the various modes?
>locrian
>aoelian
>dorian
>phrygian
>lydian
>mixolydian
>harmonic minor

>and also the byzantine and gypsy scales?
>oh, and rather, not the fingerings, but rather the intervals (ie minor
second, minor third, sharp fifth etc . . .)

The way the modes are most commonly taught and almost never understood, is to
view them as a major scale starting from a different root note.  Meaning- D
dorian is the same as C major but starting on the 2nd note of the scale.
Viewing the modes of the C major scale gives us:  C Ionian (major scale), D
dorian, E phrygian, F lydian, G mixolydian, A aeolian, and B locrian.  Ok-
great...  What does that do for me??  

The easiest way to way to understand modes and how to actually use them, is to
view them as variations of the major scale, the most basic of all scales.
All major scales in all keys follow a particular pattern of intervals from
note to note.  That pattern of intervals being:  W  W  1/2  W  W  W  1/2
(W=whole step [2 frets]- 1/2=half step [1 fret]).  Following the pattern
starting from C, if we go up a whole step, we get D.  Up a whole step from D,
we get E.  Up a 1/2 step from E we get F.  Up a whole step from F, we get G.
Up a whole step from G, we get A.  Up a whole step from A, we get B.  And up a
1/2 step from B, we get C.  This is the basic way to build the major scale.
The major scale is seen by using the following formula: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7.
The modes can be seen as variations on that basic formula.  

Modes of the major scale 
              ("b"=lower note by half step, "#"=raise note by half step) 
1. Ionian:   1  2  3  4  5  6  7   (major scale)
2. Dorian:  1  2  b3  4  5  6  b7   (major scale with b3 and b7)   
3. Phrygian:  1  b2  b3  4  5  b6  b7   (major scale w/ b2, b3, b6, b7)
4. Lydian:  1  2  3  #4  5  6  7    (major scale w/ #4)
5. Mixolydian:  1  2  3  4  5  6  b7    (major scale w/ b7) 
6. Aeolian:  1  2  b3  4  5  b6  b7    (major scale w/ b3, b6, b7) 
7. Locrian:  1  b2  b3  4  b5  b6  b7    <major scale w/ b2, b3, b5, b6, b7)

With a root note of C, these formulas translate into:

1. C ionian:  C  D  E  F  G  A  B
2. C dorian:   C  D  Eb  F  G  A  Bb
3. C phrygian:  C  Db  Eb  F  G  Ab  Bb  
4. C lydian:  C  D  E  F#  G  A  B
5. C mixolydian:  C  D  E  F  G  A  Bb 
6. C aeolian:  C  D  Eb  F  G  Ab  Bb
7. C locrian:  C  Db  Eb  F  Gb  Ab  Bb

The harmonic minor scale can be seen is the same way-  1  2  b3  4  5  b6  7.
As a minor scale, it is more easily seen as a variation on the natural minor
scale- the aeolian mode.  The only difference being the raised 7th scale
degree.  All the modes of the harmonic minor scale can be mapped out in the
same way as I mapped out the modes of the major scale above.  I would
recommend doing this, as the most common way in which the harmonic minor scale
is used, is from it's various modes- the 5th mode being the most common.
Listen to the solo in "YYZ"- from a tonal center of E minor, Alex is soloing
over B major and C major chords.  Rather than doing something rather inane
like alternating between a B major scale and a C major scale ( which could
work, but would sound shifty and off balance), he realized that in the context
of E minor, B and C are the 5th and 6th modes of the E harmonic minor scale.
That is why the solo has a fairly exotic tonality while maintaining a strong
sense of logic.  Alex is damn good, people!!  Modes are essential learning for
all musicians who would like to expand the range of notes which are available
to them at any given time.  Any 7 note scale has 7 modes- learn them all! 

The byzantine and gypsy scales are most likely alternate names for any of the
more exotic "eastern" scales which exist.  Gypsy minor, in some circles,  is
an alternate name for the harmonic minor scale.  If you're interested in
scales, I would highly recommend getting The Guitar Grimoire-scales and modes,
by Adam Kadmon.  It's an exhaustive compendium of both western and exotic
scales and modes.  All of the Frank Gambale instructional books and videos are
excellent as well.  If you have questions about anything related to guitar,
theory, Rush, or Prog rock, please feel free to e-mail me!

Subject: In Defense of Rush

I'd really like to post something positive, but instead I'll just post my 10
LEAST FAVORITE SONGS!

Seriously, I must stand on my holier-than-thou pedestal and speak my peace.  I
know from personal correspondence that many of you out there in Rushia will
agree with me, and I apologize for having to subject you to this.

I understood the NMS was founded to discuss Rush without negative criticism
found in other Internet forums from people who don't fully appreciate Rush or
their music.  Constructive criticism is one thing, but is posting one's 10
least favorite Rush songs really constructive?  Is criticising any Rush song
constructive?  If not, what's the point?

One man's treasure is another man's garbage.

I can understand that out of the 129 original songs this band has created,
there are actually some songs not everybody likes.  But if listening to Rush
causes you physical pain, please change the station, turn it off, or pull your
head out of wherever the pain is coming from.  Perhaps we should ask Rush to
write a personal apology to the NMS for the phycial discomfort they induce
with their music.  Or maybe we should have them get our "ok" before the next
studio album is released to make sure there are no "filler" tunes!

Although I've seen lots of "what I hate about Rush" posts on the NMS before,
never before have I heard a Rush fan compare them to Muzak (i.e. "Everyday
Glory").  "I think I'm going bald" is about growing up and losing one's
naivety (imo), too bad people can't understand that.  "Once we loved the
flowers, now we ask the price of the land" is an incredible metaphor for this.
We are not forced by the song, however, to decide if losing one's naivety is a
bad thing.  

"Neurotica" has one weakness - an over repetitive chorus.  But if you can't
stomach Geddy's voice without feeling physical pain, try reading the lyrics.
You just don't get it, baby don't you ask yourself why?

>From what I've seen, most of the songs people complain about have a similar
problem, where the chorus may be too cheezy for them or not "catchy" enough.
Instead of immediately classifying them as throw away songs, try "hearing"
some of these songs for a change.  The only Rush filler song I've ever heard
of was New World Man (project 3:56).  How come that one didn't make the list?
I can easily argue that the members of Rush have dedicated their lives to
their music, therefore how can you so casually assume they would release a
song they didn't believe worthy to be a "Rush" tune just to fill an album?

I'm starting to feel lucky that I can actually spin any Rush disc without
feeling the compelling urge to send a post to TNMS bitching about a song I
don't think is "worthy" of Rush.  Next time, send a post to another band's
list telling what you don't like about Rush, ok?  You might get someone to
chime in.  Spare us.  

I can't wait for the live album to come out, so I can read the flames about
how much it sucks.
