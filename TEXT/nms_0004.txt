Subject: opening acts

Well let see how many opening acts I can remember. Farewell to Kings was
Max Webster, and U.F.O. , Hemispheres was I think Pat Travers, Permenent
Waves was 38 Special, Moving Pictures was I think F.M.  Well I was about
16 years old when I saw the Farewell to Kings tour, it made quite an impression
I haven't missed a Seattle date since.

Subject: Bootlegs and other miscellanea

RUSH's views on bootlegging: To the best of my knowledge, they are militantly
against it. At least this is what I have heard from various people. I think
it has not so much to do with lost profits but rather that their perfectionist
nature compels them to be this way. They would prefer that fans would only have
tapes of live performances that they have gone over first to make sure they
were perfect. Neil for instance would cringe at the thought of a bootleg of
him playing out of time on a song (such as had happened on the first date of
the tour).

Promotion of new groups: A group of us talked with the lead singer of Mr. Big
while he was up here in Worcester, and this question came up. He also had wondere
...wondered why RUSH had an opening act, since in his opinion they were big
enough not to need one. They replied that the remembered that when they were
starting out a lot of groups that were big at that time, Kiss for example,
gave them a chance, and they wanted to do the same. There ya have it

Hmmmm, I forget what else I was going to say....oh yeah, we also talked to
Larry Allen and he said that Rush was not going to return to England or Europe
in the future period. He stated also that he didn't know why. Guess they want
to keep the length of the tour down. In any case, the 29th was the end of the
tour. I would doubt that Rolling Stone is an authoritative source of RUSH
info, considering the high regard they hold them in. But what does RS know
anyways?

Sorry if a lot of this has been covered already, but I'm catching up on my
mail here.....Bye!

I know this isn't really related to RUSH, but a few people mentioned that
their favorite RUSH opening band was Marillion. Do any of you have bootlegs
of this, or any other, Marillion show? I would be eternally grateful to
hear from you!

From: RUSH Fans Digest #2

&gt;   Another question is - The Dead are cool about taping their concerts.  Are
&gt;Rush?  Do they mind boots made, if not are we actually allowed to tape them?

I get the impression that they aren't too hot on the idea of their music
being bootlegged.  If I remember correctly, in an older issue of the RUSH
Backstage Club mailing, (in the Q&A part) Neil was asked about a song they
did on a bootleg live recording (I believe I recognized it as from 'Electric
Lady' tape).  His answer was he was unaware of any such recording, and that
bootlegs were illegal.  But then again, he's also said that all their songs
are out on their studio albums, which isn't correct, unless he doesn't count
the time before he joined.  (I'm referring to "Not Fade Away" b/w "You Can't
Fight It".)

The general prohibition against bootlegs is that it deprives the artist(s)
of some of their revenue.  I guess they figure if you get a boot, you won't
buy the albums.  While this may be a somewhat plausable argument, I think it
depends on why you want/get the boot.  If you fit the above scenario, then
you may be depriving the artist(s) of revenue.  Then there is the other side
of the coin; the fan who has all their albums/CDs (or both, in my case), has
all the videos, a bunch of EP's, etc., and still wants more.  As long as the
bootlegs in this case are for personal consumption and not for profit (in
the event you give a copy away), I see no problem.  Unfortunately, I don't
think the law would make the distinction... or would they?

# My problem is the following.  Rush has produced a very wide variety of
# music over the years.  I favor different Rush albums/songs
# depending on what state my life is in.  Granted, I have no formula to
# determine which album/song to listen to when I feel a certain way.  I bring
# this up because I wonder if any one else's taste shifts over the

[..]

Maybe this is what Rush is trying to achieve in their listeners?!?  Maybe they
want you to have MANY favorite songs (as I do).  You notice that Rush has been
around for almost 20 yrs and has never fallen into the rock-n-roll "rut" as
most bands do.  Soon as when they get a sound that they master and is
successful/popular, they change it.  First of all, Rush gets bored with the
same sound for a long period of time and I'm sure that we, the listeners,
would get bored too.  I'm sure Rush knows this.  Granted, there are those that
crave the yrs around the Permanent Waves/Moving Pictures era and wish Rush
still sound like this but I personally like the style changes through-out the
years and I'm sure many of you do also.  It keeps you on your toes and makes
you wonder what the next album is going to sound like (there's already been
thoughts about this on this list).  This could be why we like them so much (at
least this is my reasoning).
Just some thoughts to munch on...

BTW, thanks for the info on the opening acts, etc.

Subject: RUSH concerts in '84 in Honolulu (ahhhh!)

For a list of all the shows they've done, I can add on just two:

      11/23/84 at the NBC Arena in Honolulu :Rush & Stricnine (sp?)
      11/24/84 at the NBC Arena in Honolulu :Rush & Stricnine

Stricnine was a local band.  They weren't bad, but they DEFINITELY
needed a new singer!!!  Worse than Mr. Big, even.  I didn't go to the
first concert, but I went to the second.  Three small anecdotes about
the time they were here---

	When I was looking at the RUSH concert list Jake came up with,
I noticed the concert date for 6/1/75 and laughed.  When RUSH were
down here, one of the dj's from 98rock did an interview with Geddy
over the phone.  He said he remembered opening for Kiss way back when,
and when they got off the stage, Kiss threw pies in their faces!
Alex, apparently, was not too thrilled...

	One of the dj's mentioned he was talking to Ken Rosene, the
local promoter.  Apparently (and this has got to be one of my all-time
favourite RUSH stories!), when they were in LA, Rosene had gone
backstage to tell RUSH that the opening act had just finished and they
had 20 min before going on.  As he opened the door, he was "dismayed"
(his word) at the sight--the Boyz were busy reading magazines!  Geddy
was reading "Scientific American", Alex was reading "Popular Mechanics"
and Neil was reading a science fiction/fantasy mag (probably
"Starlog").  I can just see it!  I guess Rosene didn't have any
experience with a band that reads mags instead of "warming up" before
going onstage!!  I just think that's great!  I wonder what else they do
backstage (watch baseball games, no doubt...).

	The second concert was, for me, the best concert I'd ever
seen!  Except it was probably, for them, their worst! The laser machine
broke down several hours before the show.  They scrambled to find a
part to replace the broken one, found one but it was too big, so they
had to do without it. During the concert, these stupid jackasses were
throwing these glowing plastic things on the stage!  Several almost hit
Alex's guitar, one of Neil's cymbals, and Geddy's base.  One almost hit
Geddy in the head!  One landed several feet from Geddy, and I kept
thinking, "if he steps on it and something happens to him I WILL KILL
THE IDIOT WHO THREW IT!!!"  I was having fits!!!  Unfortunately, that
wasn't the end of it--during "Vital Signs", Geddy was (finally)
enjoying himself.  When the time came to trigger the synth before the
second verse, he forgot!  He was caught in the middle of the stage with
Alex, and when he realized what happened, he quickly looked back at the
synth, but it was too late, and there was DEAD SILENCE onstage.  The
three of them were complete manicans.  I felt _so bad_ for Geddy, I sat
in my seat trying to will the synth to play! Didn't work, but when they
started playing again, he went back to the keyboards and never left the
spot.
I felt so bad for them; their first concerts in Hawaii and most
likely, their last! I hope no one else has any RUSH concert horror
stories!  I feel bad enough about that one!  Anyway, till next time...

Subject: old tour pairings

Now, this is reaching way back in the memory banks, but I seem to remember
from a long time ago (well, a relatively long time for me) a show at
the Peoria Civic Center featuring Rush and Heart. I think this was on
the Signals tour, but I'm not sure. I didn't see the show myself, I
justt remember ads for it on the radio. I don't know if they were touring
together or just got paired for a couple shows. Perhaps somebody can
definitely confirm or deny this.

Subject: Opening acts

I've seen rush many times. Here are some of the opening acts I can remember.
On the Hemispheres tour, the first time around the opening act was a
band called Starz. I've also seen Saxon (was that the 2nd Perm Waves?),
the John Butcher Axis (I believe on signals) and numerous others that
weren't notable enough for me to remember. The best opening acts I've seen
were Mr. Big (sorry guys I thought they were great), on Presto,
Tommy Shaw for the first show on Hold Your Fire (Rush played by themselves
at the second show at Hara Arena in Dayton) and the all time best opening
act on both the Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures tours was none other
than the late great Max Webster. They were absolutely incredible. I saw
in an article once that Geddy's favorite song was Sun Voices by the
Max Lobsters themselves. Does anyone know what these guys are up to these
days? I know Kim Mitchell put out an album after they broke up.
Speaking of the HYF show at Hara Arena, it was the last show of the tour
and near the end of the show, Geddy waved a guy up on stage. Seems it was
a Dominoes pizza delivery boy who had a large pizza for Alex. Alex even
stopped to take a few bites off a piece before they went on. The whole
place was cracking up.
Let's start those boot trees!!!!

Yep, he didn't say it at either Richfield or Columbus, as far as I remember.

&gt;other wackos in this talk session be interested in starting a tape tree for
&gt;Rush bootlegs?
Well, I don't know about being called a wacko (shut up Adam), but I'm always
interested in boots.  Espesially from the shows I saw this year (HINT anyone
who saw either of them!!!)

&gt;Hinano Akaka writes about HYF sybolism:
Yes, you missed a bunch.
1) The 15 beside the door.  HYF was the fifteenth album, including the live
   albums and the Archives.
2) The restaurant.
2a) Why isn't the T lighted in the sign.
3) Look at the vertical sign above the restaurant.  E XI(as one symbol)
   T(upside down).  And from the viewpoint of the man in the picture, what
   side is it on.
4) The lightpost in front of the restaurant.  The owl makes up the crosspiece
   for the two lights.
5) I disagree about the stairs or the buildings.  Try looking at the fireballs
   on the cover (especially) from an angle.  Looks like the Boyz on stage to
   me.
6) Look at the puddle, I can't tell for sure, but I think it is supposed to be
   P/G (sort of).
7) On the far left side of the tape (from our perspective) picture (not shown
   on CD or album) there is a sign that I couldn't make out.  Anyone want to
   take a shot at it?

Subject: Rush Openers on Power Windows

When Rush came to Cincinnati in '86 for the Power Windows Tour, Marillion
opened for them. Other opening Acts I can remember:

Grace Under Pressure: Fastway  (really kind of lame)
Power Windows: Marillion (Really good, but I think the sound man was asleep
               or something) and Steve Morse Band (Pretty good! Doesn't he
               play for Kansas now?)
Hold your Fire: Tommy Shaw (a pretty good show, ruined by the asshole next
                to me who apparently didn't like him too much, and kept
                flipping him the bird, blocking my view. I had to eventually
                say something to him. Showing off for his girlfriend, I think
                [she wasn't very impressed by his behavior either.]
Presto:         You know who. (I was disappointed.)

Who opened on the Signals show? I got there about halfway through their act,
and it seemed really forgettable.

Time to raise another question: What RUSH concert that you've seen have you
enjoyed the most? Has anyone ever been to an actually bad RUSH show? I'll
start by saying that 1) For me, Hold your Fire, March 1988 in Cincinnati
was the best show I've seen by them, and 2) NEVER!! Every show has been great!
This kind of consistency is most impressive.

	OK, here's a totally unfair Rush trivia question - read this and
quickly phone up your friends to gloat, because you know something they don't.
What is the last record made by a member of Rush?
A: Larry Gowan's new album.

	I was waiting for my bus, and to kill time peeked into a chain-record
store.  Gowan's new album is out, and the band features Jerry Marotta and
Tony Levin on drums and bass, Ken Greer (from Red Rider) on guitar, and.....
Alex Lifeson on guitar.  He's not listed as a "guest on..." one or two
songs, so I assume he does a lot of work on it.  They didn't have the
CD yet, so I didn't buy it - tomorrow.  I forget the title (maybe "Welcome
to the Brotherhood"?), but I'll post a review with all the essential info
late next week, if not earlier.  I'll have trouble doing it earlier
because tomorrow is the start of the Winnipeg Folk Festival, featuring
Mojo Nixon, the Forbidden Pigs, etc., and I'll be attending until Monday,
interviewing for a local radio station.

	P.S. - the song playing on my walkman at the time was
"Beneath, Between, Behind".  The previous song was Gowan's "Keep Up the Fight."
Great coincidence!
