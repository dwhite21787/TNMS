Just a little article:

 
                          RUSH!

by Martin Gibbs

I first got into Rush when I was 16—I was driving home from work on a 
hot summer afternoon, a cold coke in my hands, when a local classic rock 
station played "Dreamline" from RTB. I remember going at least twenty 
miles an hour over the speed limit, there was just something to that 
song that drove the soul; the reality of "We are only immortal/for a 
limited time". The radio announcer came on after the song and said "A 
great song from Rush, now here’s ZZ Top…"
Later in the week, I searched the local record store for the album and 
the song. I thought it would be easy—but by that time Rush had already 
released Counterparts. I was amazed at the number of albums this band 
called "Rush" had out. Maybe they were really great after all. At the 
time, I didn’t know the name of the song, I was looking for "WE are 
Young", or some tune like that. Giving in, I just bought Hold your fire, 
Counterparts and Moving Pictures. A big investment for a 16-year-old, 
but hey, I wasn’t paying rent at the time. 
I listened at home to all of those CDs, was slightly disappointed that I 
didn’t hear that one cool song, but I was addicted by the second note of 
"Force Ten", and was surprised that this band "Rush" also did "Tom 
Sawyer", "Time Stand Still", "Stick it Out", "Nobody’s Hero" and 
"Limelight". No wonder they sounded familiar. By the time I graduated 
from high school, I was hooked on Rush, and had amassed a couple more 
albums A Show of Hands, and Counterparts.
After high school, I won a scholarship to be a foreign exchange student 
in Germany. Rush still remained my favorite band, in fact, my affection 
for the band grew stronger in Germany. Being away from home, living out 
my dreams ("A spirit with a vision/is a dream/with a mission"), and 
having a blast ("animate me"), Rush seemed to be the music for my moods. 
There was always a Rush song I could listen to fit the mood.
Except that one song I'd heard when I was only 16
	One day I wandered into the record store in my "home" town of Bonn. In 
Germany, mind you, CDs cost about 35 to 40 Marks, which is about 26 
bucks. A lot of money for one CD! I wandered to the "R"s, but never 
thought I'd find..RUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Here, in Europe, in a country which listens to American pop and Techno, 
there was Rush. I perused the CDs. I had most of them, but I picked one 
up that had a cool cover on it..
ROLL THE BONES
I bought it reluctantly. A lot of money, but hey, it’s Rush.
Popping the CD into my Discman I pushed play, and waited, only to hear 
the shrill beep, letting me know that the batteries were dead. So, I 
shelled out another ten dollars for four AA batteries and fired the 
Discman up.
I nearly screamed when the first song blasted in my ears, I wished my 
damned Discman would go LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER! People looked at me 
funny, bouncing my head and grinning as I walked down the street. I 
listened to that song perhaps ten times before venturing out into the 
"rest’ of the album.
It wasn’t until I ventured to the eastern part of Germany that I 
listened, I mean really listened to "Heresy". In fact, I was on the 
train to a town called Weimar when that song came into my headphones. I 
looked out upon "that dull gray world/from Moscow to Berlin" and felt as 
if this band somehow was able to get into my head, read my thoughts, and 
play a song that captured my emotions.
A Rush addict was born somewhere in Europe, in the dusty, dilapidated 
region between Erfurt and Weimar, Germany.
I took a sort of a hiatus from Rush, only buying Test for Echo when it 
first came out, but it wasn’t until I ran across them on the Internet, 
when I ran out and bought the rest of the albums, finishing my 
collection, costing my some money—but money well spent.
Grace Under Pressure, after about 15 listenings, has become a great 
album in my eyes, so has Signals, Power Windows and especially the older 
material of Caress of Steel, 2112, and Fly By Night, especially the 
lyrical quality of "Beneath, Between, Behind." 
Musically speaking, I am a trumpet player, and really get into music. 
Neil Peart still blows me away on almost every song, Alex’s guitar work 
is nothing short of genius—he reminds me so of Andre Segovia when he 
plays "Broon’s Bane" on Exit Stage Left, and "La Villa Strangiato". As 
for Geddy, I don’t think his voice is annoying, I think it’s unique and 
that he is by far the best bass player—his lines in "Big Money", 
"Marathon" and "Subdivisions" blow me away.
Now I’m a severe Rush addict, and will always be. I can’t wait until 
they do "2112" in 2112!
And it started so innocent, screaming down the highway in my little Ford 
Escort, returning from work at Target, an ice-cold Coke in hand, the 
little speakers playing "Dreamline" as loud as they could.

The Rush Addiction
by Martin Gibbs

Most people get hooked on cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, crack or 
amphetamines. It’s starts with peer pressure, with a divorce, depression 
or just plain desire to "be cool". They get hooked for life, spend every 
last dime feeding the addiction, every ounce of energy is concentrated 
on "getting high". Their bodies rot dreadfully, their minds corroded by 
chemicals and apathy, their hearts engrossed in boundless energy to beat 
four times the norm, to explode out of their chests from misuse. Most 
people pick drugs for their addictions.
Others choose dangerous behaviors upon which to get hooked. They eat 
themselves to 400 pounds and heart disease, they drive with malice, 
insanity and stupidity, they get hooked on shopping, frittering away 
money on aimless thrills of material possession. Still others get their 
brains locked into the Internet, into numerous chat rooms where wild 
fantasies are "virtually" carried out. Children get neglected, work is 
forgotten, household chores left for another century—while they surf the 
Web. 
But there are other addictions out there, just as harmful—the addiction 
to being famous, being recognized and lauded, the addiction to hating 
oneself, the addiction to exercise, an addiction to chocolate, to 
reading, to writing, to sitting on a park bench and watching the world 
go by, an addiction to the sun, to the cold, and even an addiction to 
addictions.
There are, however, some of us who do not need these superficial 
thrills, these futile attempts at recognition, at self-indulgence. We 
only desire pulsing rhythms, driving guitars, even high-pitched 
wailing—lyrics that flow in our conscious and unconscious, awaking our 
inner drive, our philosophies, dreams and failures. Three men who can 
turn a stage or a studio into an alter of humanity, of that which ties 
us all together, and make it sound as if they are twenty men. Our 
spirits have a vision of what all should be, and embark on a mission to 
get what they crave--
Music.
We are hooked on music.
Not any kind of music, not pounding heavy metal, not pointless dance or 
Techno. We crave songs like "Afterimage", "Losing It", "Half the World", 
"Marathon" and "Mission", where the hopes and dreams of the world, the 
fears, the sadness, the hope and the glory, the reality of lived dreams, 
come blaring out speakers and into our souls.
We crave that band which has never split up, which has eloquently 
changed its style to match the times, yet has produced masterpieces that 
are timeless—a band made up of men dedicated to music and to their 
families. Men who are not addicted to anything but the symphony of our 
lives—music. Three geniuses of rock. A lyricist/drummer who has seen the 
world and doesn’t just pretend to, a guitarist reminiscent of Andre 
Segovia, and a bass player who has no one to compare to but himself. We 
are hooked on their music, their existence, and their poignant messages 
which permeate every song, every note, and every moment of silence in 
their songs.
We have an addiction.
An addiction to

Hi,
Can anybody tell me what is the status of the band right now. Are they
planing to jump into the studio again ?, Are they taking some time for
themselves?, Is it true they might release a new live album ?, What are

RE: Geddy's Amazing Changing Voice

Joseph, on the section of "Fly By Night" you mention, Geddy's voice is
either flanged or phased. Flangers and phase shifters are sound effect
devices more commonly used for guitars, and without going into the gory
details (as if I knew them), suffice it to say that these devices create
"swirling" or "shifting" sounds. Try exhaling and slowly closing and
opening your mouth and listen as the sound changes - this is a
"mechanical" version of these effects.

On "Spirit of Radio" when Geddy sings "yeah, your honesty", he's
changing his voice naturally - no effects. I like to think it's because
he feels those words passionately, but there might also have been some
little in-joke about the line that made him exaggerate it so obviously,
instead. 

Alex's little display of visual humor during the line "One likes to
believe..." is hilarious. I've witnessed it on at least two tours, and I
hope it's documented on video so Joseph can see it and get an idea of
what I mean with "in-joke".

OK I'd definitly agree w/ you about outdoor vs. indoor shows.  I too saw 
Rush at both the Fleet Center and Great Woods and Great Woods rocked.  
The Fleet center was really good but outside both the band and the crowd 
seemed more into it.  Not to mention Neil's drum solo at Great Woods 
kicked the solo at the Fleet Center's A$$

All right good idea for a thread but I hope you were being sarcastic 
about Matchbox 20.  I have little respect for that band, they sound like 
most other bands that are coming out now. I'm only 19 and in the thick 
of all this crap that people are trying to pass off as good music.  I'd 
agree w/ your other choices because of their distinct sound, I'd also 
like to add Tool to that list. Also as a musician in several Providence 
/ Boston bands I think it would be great to get some local talent from 
the different cities involved too.

 Peter Kinnecom wrote a great post about what Rush means to him, and I'll
add some comments.

>>>>>>>>
 Maybe to the members, Rush is simply a band, but to me it stands for more.  
<<<<<<<<<<<

I think that's probably true for the band as well. They may have started as
thinking of themselves as 'simply a band' or just three guys who can play a
little. But once they gelled together as musicians, I practically guarantee
that they can sense that Fourth thing. The Thing They Create Together. The
Whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

>>>>>>>>
The Spirit of Rush (to me) is 3 guys who are ever-
exploring.  3 guys who want to make new music, not just a takeoff of their
last song.  
<<<<<<<<<<<

Exploring, yes. But its *more* than that. Or rather, there is another
dimension to it. I'm not a musician (nor do I play one on tv), but I am
enough of a fan and student of live music to be able to recognize when a
band is more than a band, and when they have that Other thing goin' on.
This, to me, is one thing that Rush has in common with The Grateful Dead.
They shape another dimension with their intertwining music. Let me say that
again, because its a pretty complicated thought. They shape another
dimension with their intertwining music. I'm sure that many of you can
'sense' this at shows. Its almost tangible, but rarely visible (unless
you've got good drugs). What is so uncanny about it is the way that three
different people can work together to explore and shape and create
something we cannot touch, smell, or see (without the aid of good drugs).
But its definitely there, and it does 'touch' us one way or another,
doesn't it? 

If that last paragraph didn't make any sense to you, ask Julien.

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

On another topic entirely, I want to thank the folks who helped me ID that
photo. I agree that its probably from MP, as the guy I got it from was very
into the 'old rush', and saw many show around that time. (I myself didn't
see any shows until PW, although I had been listening since 2112)

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Yet another topic: 
I was driving along listening to Mirrors yesterday, and it occurred to me
how awesome it is that these guys are still making music. Why? Think about
it. If you were a singer with Geddy's voice back when they began, you'd be
imagining a certain direction that your muscial career was going to take.
Yeah, man, I'm going to wail and screetch my way to the top, and we're
gonna rip it up for decades to come! And then that vocal tone and range
started to dry up on you, and you think, 'Shit! What am I gonna do now?!'
Would you have the balls to keep on singing? Because you must realize, when
you think about it, that the whole band had to rearrange their approach to
music. I know they would've changed and explored different sounds anyway,
but they HAD to change due to Ged's voice changing. If they wanted to
survive as Rush. And they did. My point? Most other bands in this day and
age would've either got a new lead singer (VH), or called it quits
altogether. Rush has evolved--we all know that. But keep in mind that
evolution has been guided not only by decisions the three of them have
made, but working around age and still producing the Rush Standard of
Excellence is what makes them truly Great; beyond any critical acclaim like
the R&RHoF or any top 100 list.

I Love this Band!!

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Last thing: You know how spam email sometimes gets sent with a header you
can't trace? While I don't think that Julien was Alex, like some people
postulated,  I'd bet he comes on the list sometimes as
"whoever@where-ever.com" and posts something and then goes away. Every once
in awhile I read a post that sounds as if it had to come from someone in
the band, or someone very close to them.

So you never know--*I* could be Alex.

I saw a fantastic band last weekend that do amazing Rush covers. 
They're called Little Green Men, and they play various clubs around the
D/FW metroplex.  They're a three piece just like Rush, and their bass
player (Steele) sings and plays keyboards like Geddy.  They're
fantastic!  Their original music is excellent as well, and they also do
covers from other 80's and 90's rock bands.

I saw their show on April 10th, and they did the following Rush covers:

Analog Kid
Subdivisions
The Trees (including Broone's Bane)
YYZ
La Villa Strangiato
Limelight
The Spirit of Radio
Driven
Red Barchetta

They said they can play over 30 Rush tunes, so go out to their show and
request one!  Their website has dates and locations for their shows and
more info about them:

Go out and see their show, and tell them you heard about them on NMS!

Ryan Waggoner mentions purchasing 2112 and CoS...

Ryan says:
"(sorry, but the studio APTB sucks when you're used to hearin' the killer
live version!)"

and Snapdad responds:
Yeah, but Ryan, if you give them both a listen, you'll note that they're two
different animals... I believe the live version isn't as long as the album
version, I could be wrong, but it's been eons since i've had the complete
E:SL (I guess I could just reference Chronicles, but i'm @ werk.) Anyways,
the LIVE version doesn't have the highly coveted 'Toke' sound that Geddy
makes before they bust into the powerful solo part. That's too bad right
there... 

Also, the drum parts are completely different as well. Of course, on the
live recording, you've got those super heavy Moog's going on which really
fills out the low end nicely, but again, it's not a studio recording. Rush
does really well in the studio as we would all tend to agree.  They both do
contain what I refer to as the 'Disco Segway', which is a bonus. 

Either way, both versions are really nice... hope you get to liking the
studio version.
(the toke alone is worth it...)

Anyways, glad you got these two albums, enjoy!

Subject: I get knocked down, but I get up

I think Rush should tour with Chumbawumba.  It'd be great, a one-hit wonder 
band that gets too much credit, opening up for a very talented band that
gets no credit. Maybe they could get together and make
some songs.  Chumba could take over writing for Neil, and Neil could drum
on Chumbawumba.  They could do a re-mix of "I get knocked down.." but in
7/8 time signature, and maybe do a new version of "2112" with an all new
drum track, complete with heavy bass.  Instead of "Attention all Planets
of the Solar Federation", we could have a chorus of drunk people chanting
"Neil gets knocked down, but he gets up again..".  Yeah, that's the
ticket.  I betcha Rolling Stone would still not write about them, tho'.
Ah well

Subject: rush festival lineup

First off Rush would have to include Primus in their festival.  With 
that in mind it would be great to see Geddy and Les on the same stage 
battling on bass.  But other than that my top five would be:

5.  Faith No More - too wild and weird not to have along.
4.	June of 44 - little known college band, but rock out quite nicely.
3.	Uncle Tupelo - have broken up, but would be nice to see get back 
together.  Probably my favorite 3 man band next to Rush, and the 
songwriting is pretty damn good too.
2.	Rocket From the Crypt - great opening band.
1.	Pavement - a song of theirs talks about Geddy's voice so might as 
well invite them too.  (song is "stereo" on Brighten the Corners" , 
give a listen to it, quite funny.)

I always wondered about that line too, so I'm looking forward to reading
other responses. I've been sitting here thinking about it though, and
here are some thoughts.

"A crown of thorns" is of course an allusion to Christ, as Aaron said.
But Christ only got really pissed once (money changers in the temple,
you know), so what does he have to do with anger? The allusion is more
specifically to Christ's martyrdom and therefore to martyrdom in general
(the image is richer than this simplification, but I won't get into
that). When we are angry do we make martyrs of ourselves? That brings me
close to an understanding of the next line. The golden rule is "Do unto
others as you would have them do unto you," but there are at least a
couple of ways to reverse it. I was always thinking of the "reverse" in
terms of changing what you would do to others, but another way to
reverse it is to do unto yourself what you would want done to others.
When we are angry, we often cause more pain to ourselves than to those
with whom we are angry; i.e., anger hurts. I get a picture of bitterness
eating away at the angry individual. I think this fits. What d'ya think
all?

Hey Rush-Heads!

A few weeks ago, there was some discussion about what actors should portray
the boys should their story ever hit the bigscreen.  There were some strong
suggestions thrown around, but how's this one?

Refer to any X-files episode featuring the 3 computer geeks that make up
"The Lone Gunmen".  (Please, no flames if this is somehow inaccurate.  I
know posting X-files content on this group is probably asking for
trouble...)

Anyway... the tall, stingy-haired guy.  With the glasses.  And the nose. 
The one that one of his buddies said "...with that long hair, you'd be the
first to get traded for cigarettes in prison..."   That guy....

That's our Geddy, hands down the best dead ringer for Mr. Lee I've ever
seen, or heard.

   [ I *DEFINITELY* agree! The first time I saw him I said "what is Geddy

I recall Neil saying on the premier for T4E that reality can't be virtual.
Reality is Real. (to quote from "The Masked Rider", "sometimes all too
real!"). I wanted to quote him from the premier but I've misplaced the
tape I had. Looks like I'll have to use my "virtual" download device to
listen to the premier again! Although I agree that the lyrics are a little
"cheesy", Virtuality Rocks. I have the same opinion of Totem (the lyrics

Subject: Birmingham tornado.  (long post, but worth it.)

Hi folks...

As you can see, I have not been carrying the banner of KAR for a while
now... let's let it lie for a while.  

Honestly, I have seen more acts of heroism and individual inspiration in
the last week than you can ever pull out of a Rush lyric.  For those of
you who don't know, I am a reporter for the ABC affiliate here in
Birmingham, Alabama.  

Last Wednesday (the 8th) went as normal until about 8 o-clock, when an
F-5 tornado skipped across the central part of our state.  33 people
lost their lives... hundreds were injured... and more than a thousand
homes were outright destroyed or damaged.  NOT a bunch of "trailer
trash" as many like to joke.  Mother Nature unleashed winds in excess of
260 miles per hour.

My crew was headed towards an area that included a school - - scanner
reports indicated the school no longer existed.  We never made it there,
as downed trees boxed us in along a semi-rural neighborhood.  We did
some live coverage there, but my cameraman and I spent more than half of
our time there helping dig people out of rubble.  There simply weren't
enough rescue people to go around, so anyone and everyone with a light
were commandeered into forming search parties.

Never in my career have I seen so many total strangers pitch in, of one
mind, and collectively help their neighbors.  And it just didn't happen
where I was... the tornado cut a swath along the ground 31 miles long
and a half a mile wide.

If you want to talk about "Everyday Heroes", then don't look to your CD
players... look at your neighbors.

Tonight (Wednesday the 15th) I am putting together a 4-5 minute long
story highlighting the very worst of the damage, and the very best of
the human spirit our news department has witnessed.  For those of you
who aren't familiar with TV news, that's an unusually long story.
(Obligatory Rush Content - - I'm planning on sneaking in the
instrumental bridge from "Different Strings" into the piece.)  I wish
there was a way everyone could get a chance to see it... Our web-site
and server can't handle putting it up right now.  Maybe one day...

In the meantime, please keep the people of Birmingham and Central
Alabama in your prayers.  These are good people.  They have families.
Many now have no homes, no water, and no utilities.  And they perservere
nonetheless.

"If the future's looking dark
    we're the ones who have to shine
 If there's no one in control
    we're the ones who draw the line.
 Though we live in trying times
    we're the ones who have to try
 And though we know that time has wings
    we're the ones who have to fly.

 Rise from the ashes - - a blaze of Everyday Glory."

Subject: making sense of it all

In response to some of the recent comments about how we have felt 
about Rish directions, I should like to chip in my two-penneth.  
First, to the fellow who thought Camera Eye and Witch Hunt were part 
of the same song, I go along with that.  It took me ages to separate 
them in my subconcious.  I'm also with Ryan Stimpoy on MP.  For ages 
I could not turn it over - we are, after all, talking vinyl.  But 
then, after a side like that opener, what do you expect.  There is 
something to be said here about the demise od side one and two.  I 
remember Bono of U2 crapping on about trying to get away from the 
idea of two sides, round about the Joshua Tree, but in a sense he 
foresaw what was happening with the CD.  It seems undeniable to me 
that the structure of albums has changed with the shift to cds. I was 
trying to rethink TFE only the other day on that basis.
Anyway, back to the plot.  Subdivisions for me was some great tunes 
marred by too much synth.  Let's face it, we all thought that at the 
time, but we lived with it, and then live it was just transformed - 
Countdown at Wembley blew me away, both nights.  I had, and still 
have, real problems with Grace, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire.  
The album cover for GUP, which has been getting some rave reviews 
lately, I found just bad art, while Geddy's hair on the back cover 
was too frightening for words.  Even the great Karsh could not make 
the ugly brothers look smooth.
This has been going on too long.  I'll be back.
By the way, I loved the Three at Last gag.  Release date Bastille Day 
  how we all chortled.

I picked up vinyl copies of: Archives, FBN, 2112 (two copies), AFTK,
ATWAS (trifold), PW, MP, ESL, SIG, GUP and HEM in similar fashion (about
$3 each at a flea market). What was that guy thinking, selling an ATWAS
trifold for $3? Beats me. His loss, my gain!

As to your question regarding the differences between the two copies of
2112: the one with the foldout and lyrics was pressed closer to the
original release of the album. Both of mine are foldouts, but the labels
on the vinyl differ. My favorite (sadly scratched beyond playability)
has the tracklisting printed over a color image the of the Chicago
skyline that looks like it could have been taken from street level,
looking up, at about Chicago Ave. and Lake Shore Dr. (four blocks north
of my building). It shows the Hancock building on the right, the water
tower in the center and the Marina Towers on the left (if you know
Chicago, you KNOW that this was artificially generated ;-) ). The other
label just has a big MERCURY in some kind of script font emblazoned in
orange.

The point, though, is that record companies remove cost from reprints
the same way book companies do (they eliminate the foldout; they replace
a printed sleeve (lyrics, pictures, etc) with a blank one or with one
that has advertising on it; they use a 1 or 2 color label instead of a 3
or 4 color label.). The key to identifying first pressings lies in the
codes that look like they're scratched into the unused area just around
the label. Real collectors (I'm NOT one of them) can use these codes to
identify an LP's generation (similar to the 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 on the
copyright page of a book; the lowest number is the print run; if you
have a 1, you have a first edition (works for both hard cover and
paperback)).

Hope this helps.

Good question. Let's try something.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
proactive(?)

reverse

As others do to you, do it back!

To me it seems the golden rule in reverse would mean
to be nice, rude, angry, if that was the way you were
treated by someone. I was taught the Golden Rule a
very long time ago in elementary church class, so I
would tend to say that both lines of the song are

Hello all!
I just got Caress of Steel this week, and I've given it a few listen-throughs.
I love _I think I'm going Bald_, great tune if you're in a humorous mood.  But
the one thing that caught my attention was the music to part 3 of the
Necromancer.  Right after the voice narration is done, and before Geddy starts
singing, the music sounds just like the Wallflower's song _Three Marlenas.
Different tones, but definitely the same arrangement of notes.  Give it a
listen and see if you think so too.  And bear in mind, Caress of Steel came
out about twenty years before the Wallflowers CD, not on the same day as in
the CP/ Pearl Jam comparison.

Subject: Alexs Victor Sound/Dinosaur puupet show..

Hey folks:

Couple things on this days agenda. First off, at the Toronto T4e show on
July2, 97, it was sooo hillarious to see the guys poke a bit of fun at
themselves with the "Dinosaur stampede" during Tom Sawyer, and the Dino
puppets...hehehe. I even remeber Neil smiling and giggling as he is
watching this go on. If a band can't even laugh at themselves once in a
while, then hey, whats the point..hehe. It was brilliant...my daugther
thought I was going hystarical. Especially during Tom Sawyer, which, I
am one of those fans, who kinda wish they'd put that song to R.I.P.
Hehe..

Also, it seems alot of people are really into Alex's sound during the
PoW, HYF, Presto days. Well, I think during those times, Alex played
more "ontop" of the music, rather then within it. Don't get me wrong, I
love those albums, but when I heard Alex's cranked distorted feedback
for the first time during Stick It Out, I thought..YESSSSSSSSS!!!...Alex
was now front and center with his guitar work. The textural stuff is
beautiful, and I think he proved he can still do it better then ever on
songs like Resist and Where's My Thing, but Alex is now IN YOUR FACE,
without the use of over-saturatred effects. I remeber listening to HYF,
and the guitar solo in Turn the Page, that started it for me. I had this
feeling Alex would be best at "going for the jugular". I think Victor is
a great album, and I like the fact that it emphasizes more of HIM, then
what Rush does, simply because if I wanted another Rush album, I woulda
waited for Test for A Cow...err..Echo..hehe..sorry:) I think Alex is now
at the point in his guitar playing where he can play pretty much
ANYTHING he would like, and it is that diversity and "heated passion" he
puts into his guitar playing, rather then just trying to do technical
stuff. Thats why I am looking forward to Victor II, and the next Rush
studio album...'cause I think Alex has matured beyond even what he
thought possible as a guitar player. PLUS, I just LOVE how AWESOME those
nice black Marshalls look humming away behind ALex as he
shreds....simply F***ing unbelievable.

Anyways, enough of my rant for today,
Peace
James
hopeflguy@sprint.ca

p.s. My suggestion for the title of the Rush live album..."Lick My Love
Pump"...gotta pay a nod to Spinal Tap, since Neil did so with
ATWAS...hehehe. Plus, heck, maybe Bill Clinton would even buy it, just
for the title..hehehe..:))

Subject: Rock and Bowl with Rush???

Hi Rush Fans,
  Has anyone ever bowled to the blaring tunes of Rush?  Well, a few
weeks ago, I went to try a new thing called 'Rock and Bowl' and believe
it or not, when the lights went out and the music started, the first two
songs were 'The Spirit of Radio' and 'Red Barchetta".  It was awesome,
then about 1/2 an hour later, more Rush tunes.  

Well, me being the curious person that I am, had to wander over to the
D.J.'s booth and see who was playing this music and I come to find out
that it is a guy who was just two rows in front of me at the San Diego
show last year, his name is Larry.
Very cool guy,  he's a drummer in a band that plays mostly Rush songs.
Now, I'm not a huge bowling fan, but I had a great time bowling to Rush
tunes.
So, if you're ever in Tustin, California around 10:00pm on a Saturday
night and feel like bowling to Rush tunes, drop by the local bowling
alley and have a blast.

Subject: Sublime Rush Experience

First of all, thank you, Mr. Breckow, for a fantastic post about how Rush
means so much to your life. And you wrote, "What I'd really like to hear
about are some of your most SUBLIME 
Rush-connected memories.  Not just the ordinary "Dude, the Presto concert 
was truly righteous," but the truly extraordinary, snapshot-in-time, 
out-of-body experiences that permanently cling to your memory banks."

Great question. I hope lots of people respond. I'm interested.

I have a memory to share. It's a very simple one. It's just a little
moment. But it's a moment I've never forgotten and never will forget. I'm
not sure exactly why it was so powerful. It just was.

I should say first that I am 36 years old and was introduced to Rush when
ATWAS was released. I was about 15 years old -- a high school student in
Port Aransas, Texas -- on the coast, near Corpus Christi. One day, I was
being given a ride home from school by an older friend. His name was Mark
Klotz. He was kind of a weird guy. He had a haircut and glasses like Austin
Powers but dressed like Jeff Spicolli. And he had a big, vertical scar on
his throat. He claimed it was a birthmark. Like I said: Weird.

Anyway, we were cruising in his early 1970s muscle car and listening to
Judas Priest (Sin after Sin) on his 8-track tape player. When we got to my
house, he offered to let me borrow a tape. "You'll like this," he said. He
handed me the ATWAS 8-track. I took it to my bedroom and plugged it in.

Euphoria.

But this isn't the persistent memory I was talking about. The memory was
etched in my quivering little brain when I attended my first Rush concert a
few months later. It was the ATWAS tour stop in Corpus Christi. It was not
just my first Rush concert. It was my first concert, period. I walked into
the Corpus Christi Auditorium -- a quonset hut on steroids -- and instantly
was enveloped by great, billowing clouds of Mary G. Wanna smoke. I had
never smelled the stuff before. That's another thing that carves itself
indelibly in your memory.

Suddenly, the lights went down, the crowd roared, the Marshalls were
cranked way up, and the next moment is the one I'll never forget.

After months and months of playing Mark Klotz's 8-track tape over and over,
falling in love with Rush and particularly with the intensity of Neil's
drumming, after never having been to a concert my whole life, I was frozen
in place as three spotlights hit the stage -- one on each of the boys --
and Rush slammed into the opening chords of "Bastille Day." I looked right
at Neil, and he seemed to be looking right at me. (I'm sure he wasn't, but
it sure seemed that way, and boy, was it cool.) And, while he seemed to be
looking right at me, Neil held one of his sticks high in the air and
twirled it in one of his hands like a baton during those breaks in the
first few bars of "Bastille Day," when Alex is playing by himself. Twirling
a drumstick like a baton might seem really dated and cliche and silly and
easy today. But, to me, back then, it was a sublime moment. It wasn't just
the twirling of the drumstick that got to me, of course. It was that and
everything else -- being only 15 or 16, so full of energy, newly fueled up
on Rush, at my first concert, smelling that weird smell, feeling my guts
ripple under that rumbling stack of  Marshalls for the first time ever ...

Man, what a concert it was.

Today, I have an album or CD for every release Rush ever has put out. I
might even still have poor Mark Klotz's 8-track tape.

Thanks again, Mr. Breckow, for jarring this memory from my little brain.

Subject: Neil's Drumming on territories

HI all,

I played Territories in a Rush cover band i was in "ForceTen" (can ya tell 
which album was our favorite?)  It's called overdubbing, OR a drum machine, 
take your pick, but i would think Neil would of overdubbed as opposed to a 
drum machine.  Personally in our band we had it sequenced and i played on top 
of it.  Plus , neil doesn't have roto toms, they are called Concert Toms.  
Hope this helps

Anyone hear Test for Echo on the leafs hawks game?  I wish we could
hear that song at the United Center in Chicago.  It was in the 
beginning of the second period.

It has been written, by the prophet Jack Hesse

Actually, I came up with a great idea that could save the band a lot of
money when it comes to doing 'live' albums.  (I got this idea while
listening to the radio, and hearing a version of Tom Sawyer I was
unfamilar with...)

Pull out all the old albums, and put together a set list of songs.  Dig
out the masters of these songs, put a little reverb on every single
track, dub in audience noise...you have the next 'live' album!!!  :)

(I shouldn't say that, since the ESL version of APTB rocks all over the
2112 version, IMAO.)

Just a thought!

"If a turtle loses his shell, is it naked or homeless?"

Wonder if Christopher Guest or Michael McKean had heard this name before
creating the Spinal Tap characters? ;)

They also do a mean Smell the Glove.
