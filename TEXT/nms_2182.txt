Subject: Rush & Triumph : Canadian Precious Metal

Hello to all Rush fanatics,

In reply to the "Fight The Good Fight" question, as it was indicated
earlier, TRIUMPH released that song in 1981, on the Allied Forces album.  

Here are a few similarities between Rush and Triumph.

Hometown: Toronto, Ontario (Canada)
Number of musicians: (3) Trio
Cool album-art : Just A Game, Never Surrender, Thunder 7, PW, MP, etc
Guitar Gods: Rik Emmett & Alex Lifeson
Music: Hard Rock, Progressive, Instrumentals, etc
Live: Great live bands with excellent "production"
Lead singers: High pitched voices (Geddy & Rik)

Here are a few differences between the two bands.

Fan base: Rush (die hard, loyal, fanatic) = 40 million albums sold
                 Triumph (not so loyal) = 15 million albums sold

Musicians: Rush (Alex, Neil & Geddy = Virtuosos)
                  Triumph (Rik Emmett - Guitars = Virtuoso)

Recording Studios: 
Rush's association with Le Studio (MH, Quebec) = privately owned
Triumph use to own the Metalworks Studio in Mississauga, Ontario

In all honesty, if you are a RUSH fan, would should give Triumph a listen. 
For the record, in 1987, Alex Lifeson and Rik Emmett did collaborate on a
"Guitar Player" soundpage called "Beyond Borders" along with two other
Canadian guitarists: Liona "First Lady of Guitar" Boyd and jazz maestro Ed
Bickert.  This instrumental was written by Rik Emmett, and I remember Alex
playing some fine guitar solos on it.

Regards,

Frank

Subject: Anality

Could it be that I have more in common with all you people than just Rush? Are
we all really anal?

I also "alphabetize my CD's and put them in chronological order according to
group (Rush's eponymous album first, followed by FBN, COS, ad nauseum)," as
Simon said. He also noted, "That's pretty anal."

Also, ALL of my CD's have to be perfectly straight-up when I put them back in
the case so when you open the case, you see the the CD in its "proper"
position. To annoy me, everyone opens my CD cases and turns the CD's slightly.

Anal enough? (But I don't wash my hands 500 times a day--I'm kinda normal.)

Hello all... long time, all lurk...

For those of who who may not know, some friends of mine have been waging
an internet campaign to screw with eMpTyV...  We logged on en masse to
the Total Request website, and managed to get the New Kids on the Block
onto the top ten countdown.  It debuted at number two.  (Heh heh heh.)

No flames please... I didn't pick the song, I just helped out.

Carson Daly has allegedly thrown down the gauntlet, saying we can't do
it again.

Ha.

Let's hit 'em hard, guys.  And after they lock that song out, I'll talk
my friends into putting Subdivisions over the top...

POP: NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK'S REVIVAL
	(New York-AP) -- Don't underestimate the power of the Internet.
That's what M-T-V has learned, when an eleven-year-old song turned
up in its "Total Request Live" countdown. Apparently a chain
e-mail campaign called for people to log onto M-T-V's website and
request "Hangin' Tough" by New Kids on the Block. Enough people
did to land the song at number two on yesterday's countdown.

<What are your moments?  What music, songs, etc do you find so beautiful
that they bring goosebumps?>

I love finding that I haven't listened to a CD for a long time, months or
even a year.  Then playing it and rediscovering the music.  I experienced
this just this week with Presto.  I put it in and I rediscovered so many of
the beautiful moments in the album that I had forgotten or never even
noticed.  There's always discussion here about Alex as a great guitarist.
Presto really shows his talent for producing ethereal sounds.  He used a
style then that was very unaggressive but it suited the songs so well and
made them very rich in texture, sound and emotion.  Scars is one of my
favorite songs and has been since I first heard it, but I always liked it
for the driving bass and drums.  After 9+ years and countless listenings I
finally heard something in the guitar that I had been missing.  Same thing
with Chain Lightning where the light touch in the chorus is just awesome.
So for this week those are the two songs I find most beautiful.

Subject: first Rush

My first Rush experience was in 7th grade, not long after Signals came out.
New World Man was being played by my music class teacher.  She tried so hard
to have the newest music for the class, bless her. Not long after my dad gave
me Archives for my birthday, and I was permanently hooked.  My first show was
Power Windows, 48th row, main floor at the Rosemont Horizon.  What a show....
I think Geddy rearranged my rib cage during YYZ with one of his solos. :)  

The show I most regret missing.... Berlin on the RTB tour.... 5 or 6k
capacity, 1.5k tickets sold.... still kicking myself for missing that.

Subject: Rush in Taiwan

Talk about finding Rush in out of the way places...

I do a good bit of business travel to China  and Taiwan.  On my last
trip to Taiwan (Jan/Feb) I had a couple of Rush encounters.

First, anyone ever heard of Channel [V]?  It's an Asian MTV kinda
thing.  Actually, the hotels have both Channel [V] and MTV Asia, but I
watch Channel [V] almost exclusively.  Anyway, in one afternoon, while
working in my hotel room, I heard a few seconds of three different Rush
songs on Channel [V].  It was on these little fill-in video bits they do
between songs, or between VJ's, etc.  First I heard a few seconds of the
intro to Limelight.  Of course I  immediately sent off an email to a
friend working in Taiwan that I new would appreciate it.  A little bit
later, it was the intro to Red Barchetta.  As soon as I could, I started
working on another email to the same person.  Before I could send that
one, they went to another comercial...and it had the intro to
Subdivisions...so I had to add that to the second email.  I heard those
same three intros again later, but I believe that was all there was.

Second one.  We were at a record store, in Taiwan, and I half-jokingly
asked one of the record store guys if they had any Rush.  I had never
seen a Chinese-release Rush CD, but I would certainly buy it if I did.
That guy didn't know who I was talking about, but he mentioned it to his
manger, who, in his better than average English, said he knew Rush.
"Three guys...from Canada...Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio.."  He sent the
other guy on a search, and the only Rush CD they had in the place turned
out to be a non-official release (trying to be nice and not say bootleg)
that appears to have come from Italy.  I believe the name is "Temples of
Syrinx."  I couldn't help but buy it.

Greetings Rush Enthusiasts, 
I just got back from a sneak-preview of the movie "EdTV".  There is a scene in
the movie where Ed is wearing a Rush T-shirt!  I couldn't believe it!  It is
sort of inconspicuous, but I would say I am 99.9% positive it was a Rush T!  I
almost leaped out of my chair with excitement!  I won't give away the T-shirt
or the scene in case anyone is planning on seeing the movie.  I am sure
someone else will post about it anyway!

Subject: Rush sighting (sort of); Rush intro

Hey!

Long time reader, first time poster (?).  Just wanted to mention that I saw
the movie "EdTV" and Matthew McConaughey in one scene is wearing a Rush t-
shirt!  It is obscured a bit by a sweat jacket, but it is unmistakebly the Man
vs. The Red Star! Pretty cool if you ask me.

As for my intro to Rush:  back in 1980 my  buddy and I were really into Atari
Space Invaders.  The only problem was that the Atari belonged to his jerky
brother-in-law.  So when our school went on strike we had plenty of time to
sneak in some games. We also took a liking to his 8 - track (yes I said  8 -
track).  He had one cassette with a cool label on it that included a newspaper
with an historic headline.  We plopped it in and we were changed forever!  The
first time I heard Neil's ride cymbal I knew that's what I wanted to do.  I've
been drumming ever since.  I can't believe that was almost twenty years ago!
Anyway, that is my little story.  Now back to my plans for world domination.
Please don't take my little totalitarianism personally.  It's just my destiny.

Subject: vs.?

I'm not fully up to date on my TNMS reading so I don't know where this
discussion on the false definitions of liberal vs. conservative is going,
but...

I think some people reading this might have heard of a band called Rush who
wrote an album/composition called Hemispheres which explores the truth found
in dichotomy.  Perhaps we should all review the material, eh?   Reactive
feeling (liberalism) w/out understanding causes nothing but confusion;
material analysis (conservatism) w/out emotion results in nothing pain.  The
truth is not some compromise between the extremes, but a synthesis of the
whole.

Now, what about the split between fate & freewill?  Another great dichotomy
that strikes at the core of what it is to be human in the modern age.  Those
most blessed with ability (usually by circumstances, sometimes by achievement)
are those with the greatest response-ability (ability to respond) to take the
initiative to make positive changes.  If not us (everyone reading this is a
privileged member of the human race), who; if not now (on the cusp of
perpetual everyday glory or collective decline), when?  Fate has dealt you the
position of "high-place", it is your freewill to make of it what you may!

We can Research all we want and Reflect on what it all means, but it is the
third "R"- Respect that is the cement that holds it all togther for us
sentients.  Respect for self and for others- respect for the external universe
and the internal universe- respect for the things that are known and respect
for the unknown- respect for that which you believe and respect for that which
you deny.

Isn't it great that so many disparate folks can get together and mold a new
reality (closer to the heart- they are really compassionate individualists at
the core) based on the catalyst of a "pop" band (I actually see their writing
as a continuation of the great moral scripts of humanity).  The future is ours
(fellow Children of the Divine)- seize it!

"With the heart & mind united in a single, perfect sphere."

P.S.  In all this guitar player stuff, no one has mentioned Carlos Santana.
He's no speed freek, but what a soul!

Subject: Drummers and stuff

Here we go....

Let me start off with a personal flame (Rush.mgr forgive me, please).
I'm bleeding pissed off!  Some low-life wanna be burgler broke into my 
jeep (actually it's a Daihatsu Rocky with a soft-top)and stole my whole 
RUSH collection (along with Queensryche, Kansas, Live, and others.  The 
really sad part about this is that I KNOW the crack smoker that took the 
stuff listens (when he can get his hands on someone else's radio, 
etc)crap like Snoop Doggy Dogg.  I have an old broken FBN vinyl...shards 
and pieces, really....that I'd be more than happy to shove up his ass if 
he wants RUSH THAT BADLY.  Idiot didn't even take my speaker box...just 
my CD's.  This all happened on Christmas Eve '98...just 2 1/2 months 
after I had received DS for my birthday...yes he got that too.
About the "Best Drummers" Phil vs. Neil debate...
Personally, I believe that Neil is the most complex percussionist that 
rock has ever seen.  Sure Phil played some interesting stuff with 
Genesis, but c'mon folks...
And why has no one mentioned Phil Ehart (Erhart??) of Kansas??  Since 
that puke stole my cd's, I've been listening to a bunch of old tapes 
that I had lying hither and tither (there were a few scttered about yon 
as well) and several are Kansas.  Ehart (Erhart?) was a very technical, 
precise drummer playing some complexly arranged stuff.  His kit was HUGE 
(yes I have seen them in concert a couple of times)and he managed to use 
all of it.
My first RUSH experience??  I was 16 (34 now, you do the math, I'm a 
student of human interaction and Philosophy..not a mathemetician) and 
making out with my then girlfriend when she said, "Be right back".  Two 
minutes later, I was hearing "The Trees" - weird to make out to, but 
hey, adolescent hormones being what they are, y'know.  I was so 
enthralled that I forgot about her (momentarily..I won't go into 
specifics, but there was one thing she was REALLY good at!).  She let 
the entire album play while we got back to we had been doing.  That 
night, I went out and bought every RUSH vinyl the store had to 
offer...MP, 2112, Hemispheres, FBN, CoS, FtK...I had a pretty good job 
and generous parents.  I've been a die-hard ever since.  As soon as I 
can find it (it's packed away) I'll scan my old "RUSHFAN" Nevada license 
plate for the website.

25 or do we want more??

Subject: The first record or album you ever owned

    Heres something that may make you think real hard, or you know
it right away, and still may be listening to even now. What is the first
album you remember calling your own. It can't be your older sister
or brothers albums, although they undoubtably had an influence, weither
it be positive or negative, that might of steered you in one direction or
another. Maybe you got it for a gift, or saved up your allowence..whatever.
Its interesting to see what attracted you to a certain band or album and then
try to figure out how you ended up listening to what you listen to these
days.
    My first record was a Stevie Wonder 45 " Fascination", in December of '69'.
Does that date me or what? It was followed by Three dog Night, Beatles, Cream,
The Band, Jefferson Airplane, Jeff Beck,Zepplin, Bad Company.... and so on.
Ah the memorys.

Not that they're in the same league, but as we fuzz through this weird time
waiting for some type of shoe to drop from Our Holy Trinity, I recommend
trying these guys from Chicago: Dovetail Joint. The guitars are a little
weak, and the production seems juvenile, but there's a certain energy to it
that has Rush like qualities. Check out "Oh My God" in particular.

Subject: Rush - hoohowwerrwen - what?

Sophomore year of high school, five years ago (wow!  it doesn't seem THAT 
long...!).  I was at a private high school in Atlanta whose band, orchestra and 
choir members took a trip to Orlando every year to compete in festivals and go 
to Disneyworld while we were at it.  During the latter part of the vacation, I 
was touring Epcot with a couple of older guys who kept singing the melodies to 
what turned out to be Rush songs ("Daah dah daah dah dah-dah-dah-dah" etc.).  I 
asked them what on earth they were doing and they mentioned Rush.

Now, at this point in my life I didn't know much about rock music (having only 
discovered Queen the previous summer) and was anxious to learn, so I asked them 
to recommend an album.  They recommended ASOH if I was more into keyboards and 
poppy stuff, or ESL (or maybe ATWAS) if I was more into old-fashioned 70s rock. 
Being leery of "dinosaur rock" at the time, I selected the former.

The thing that blew me away, apart from the drumming (I was still only a 
fledgling drummer at that point), was the keyboards.  The only place I'd heard 
synths before was cheesy '80s pop, so I was like, "Wow!  Keyboards being used 
_tastefully_).  Over the next year or so I acquired the rest of their albums.

Even though I personally think Rush was at their most interesting back around 
AFTK, ASOH still has great sentimental value for me.

And, to prolong The Thread That Would Not Die a bit more ^_^, I think Neil and 
Phil Collins are at the top of two very different schools of drumming.  PC is 
very much a jazz-style drummer - wide changes in dynamics, a lot of information 
in each note.  Neil seems to be more along the one-man-percussion line - he uses
more notes and more different sounds.  He is also a more "literal" drummer, if 
you know what I mean.
Also, as has been mentioned before, you can _hear_ how much harder Neil is 
trying.  For someone like Phil, a child prodigy who probably never had to put in
the hours that Neil surely did, the notes and rhythms flow out so naturally that
he feels free to inflect a bit more, whereas Neil has doubtless spent so much 
time on consistency and mobility drills that it's more comfortable for him to 
use more different instruments as his voices.  Both drummers have a wide range 
of sounds - Phil just uses a smaller drumset to convey his.

Neither approach is superior or inferior - in fact, it's best to be able to do 
either or both.  Being able to master a big kit like Neil does and pull out lots
of weird rhythms and sounds is invaluable for advanced forms of rock, but I've 
always been really impressed with the guys who are so expressive on the kit that
they can make even a simple backing beat sound riveting.  Like PC, or Stewart 
Copeland, or (in a slightly different way) Bill Bruford (who half the time 
doesn't even bother with the traditional snare-bass-and-eighth-note-ride and 
goes even simpler - at least in his heyday).
That's what's so fun about music - there are a million different ways to do any 
one thing...

Subject: Re: TNMS #2181 - Best Bassist

	As far as 'Best Bassist' goes, other than Ged of course, I would have to
say John Myung of Dream Theater.  If you've ever seen them in concert,
Myung is a very "studious", for lack of a better term, bass player.  He
rarely interacts with the crowd, even when someone else in the band
acknowledges him on a song.  	If anyone here on the list has seen DT's
video release "5 Years In A LIVEtime", when Portnoy is walking through the
tour bus, pointing his home video camera at other band members, and members
of the crew, while saying their nicknames, when he gets to Myung, Myung is
sitting there fiddling with his bass...on the tour bus for cryin' out loud!
 LOL!  By the way, Portnoy's nickname for Myung is "Geez Louise!"  I
thought that was quite humorous. :-)

	Anyone else think Myung totally rules??

Cheers...

Subject: Intro and Anal

I feel somewhat left out because I have no great "Boom! It happened!" =
story to tell about my conversion to Rush fanatic.  For me, it was a =
process that took two or three years.  However, I can relate one story =
that will forever linger in my mind.  My introduction to Rush took place =
around 1982 when I was about 13 years old.  I remember being familiar =
with several of Rush's AOR hits (this was also about the time I stopped =
being afraid of "hard rock" and realized what BS Top 40 was) from heaing =
them on the radio, but I had not yet shifted my allegience from Journey. =
 One evening, my best friend and I set out on a trip to the mall, =
chauffered by his older brother.  I remember sitting in the back of his =
brother's orange Pinto (had I known the danger I was in...)  and =
listening to the radio and tapes.  At one point, the brother inserted =
"E..SL" into the Pioneer stereo and eventually it got to playing YYZ.  I =
can remember sitting in that Pinto listening to what felt like a =
half-hour drum solo and thinking "Is that guy a machine or what?!"  I =
was floored!  I had never heard anything like it before.  As I became =
more and more acquainted with this wonderous band, I came to admire them =
most for their intelligent lyrics and their incredible skills.  My first =
concert experience was April 15 (I think) 1986 at the Spectrum in =
Philly!  What a show!  Blue Oyster Cult opened (how's that for coming =
full circle!) and I had floor seats!
One a similar note, i brought my college roommate to the TFE tour in the =
Corestates Center (now appropriately called the FU Center) for his first =
Rush show.  Now, this guy was raised on MC Hammer, Heavy D, Madonna and =
the usual Top 40 schmegma.  During the drum solo, at the part where Neil =
inconceivably speeds up when you already thought he was playing at =
inhuman speed, and I heard my friend say "You gotta be fucking kidding!" =
 Sorta brought me back to the Pinto.

Finally, someone wrote:
"I don't think that's so anal. When you also keep a spreadsheet
personal "discography", alpha, by release date and *must* update
it every time a change occurs, well there may be a need for therapy."

And I thought I was the only person who did this!  Well let me say, I AM =
a therapist and if this is your only symptom/behavior, don't go looking =
for meds just yet.  Frankly, I believe that if I didn't organize my over =
300 albums (LP, CD and cassette) I would absolutely lose my mind. (Oh =
no!  More mental health humor - truly unintended)

Subject: First RUSH Experience

About 1980ish, can't say exactly when.  I was sitting in my room doing
homework.  Suddenly, I hear that trippy freako-laser sound at the beginning
of 2112, really loud.  My brother Dave had decided he was going to crank a
little Rush.  It's as familiar as my own name now, but when you've never
heard it before, and you're not prepared, it can really freak ya'.  Shortly
thereafter, I began to hear SoR on the radio.....did it for me.

Subject: Yo La Tengo and Rush

hi all,

about a month ago we[1] were in New York, over from London, and to cut a long
story short we saw a preview copy of a video by Matador Records' very own Yo
La Tengo. Now, I can't remember what the song was called, but the basic plot
was "band do very boring video, record company execs say 'that won't sell
records' and they send the band to rock school where they learn about poodle
perm haircuts, make up, spiky guitars, tight leather trousers... you get the
general idea" 

Anyway, one of the classes (set outdoors beneath a tree, echoing a scene in
"the prime of miss jean brodie", probably unintentionally) is Rock Lyrics, and
I had a feeling Rush would turn up somewhere in this video. Sure enough,
there's a David St Hubbins lookalike brandishing a gatefold 12" of AFTK
instructing the kids "And the men who hold high places must be the ones who
start...". Actually LOL, and briefly wonder if Helium do YYZ at their gigs.

take care,
P

[1] the band known as 'pout', London based new wave & rock & pop, for which I
play bass. Not a Jazz or a Rick 4001 (if I had the money...) but a Precision and
a Bass Collection with a bit of overdrive - and guess whose bass it sounds
like.
That's right, Ed from Ultrafine. And Geddy too :-)

Subject: Introduction to Rush

I honestly can't remember a time when I wasn't into Rush. I was 
fortunate enough to have older siblings that were really into Rush. I 
have grown up with Rush all my life, so in essence, you can say that I 
was born "listening to Rush". (I was born in '82 :] ) I liked their 
music, even before I was old enough to understand anything about them! 
I'd have to say, that the number one reason that I started playing drums 
(14 years ago) was Neil Peart. I can't remember ever being influenced by 
anyone else or why I chose that particular instrument. Nowadays, I've 
sorta borrowed and taken some aspects of other players techniques and 
styles, and appreciated the instrument (and music in general) and its 
versatility. All in all, Rush is without a doubt a part of me, and the 
one reason I got into music in the first place.

When I saw the CP tour in Phoenix, they had Candlebox open up and they were
terrible!  After the fifth song people were chucking beer at them (which I
don't agree with, but geeesh, the fifth song sounded like the first four!)

When they finally said "This will be our last song tonight...." people gave
them a standing ovation in thanks that it would soon be over!  I know Primus
opened for some of the shows on that tour, wish they would have been there
for Phoenix.

Anyone ever listen to Toy Matinee?  Tight, intricate, well recorded and very
interesting music.  I dug it out after not hearing it for a couple of years.
Strange how you can forget about one of your favorite CDs, put it in and

OK...About the symphony tribute; Will someone PLEASE email me the

RUSH.  Then again, they're into the Backstreet Boys....[Buttstreak 
Boys?])
Also, just for general info...Anybody have any suggestions on the 
following:
I am designing a class to be taught at the Junior College level.  It 
will deal with representations of self and ideology in World Literature 
and Popular Music and I am planning to use RUSH (along with others...I 
need a wide sweep of genres).  What I need are books that examine RUSH 
and their (Neil's, really) lyrical content/influences.  Yes I know about 
Ayn Rand...
For example:  Are there indications of Buddhist/Daoist/Secular 
Humanist/etc philosophies woven into the lyrics, and what I need is at 
least one title that supports this kind of tack.

Thanks!!

>"JOHN BARTHE" said:

Yep.  It's a hoax.  don't worry about it.  Angered a lot of people, but
not a word of truth in it.

I'm back from Kuwait.  AFN played a bunch of new stuff, some good, some
vomitous (a-Lameass Morissette), and no Rush, of course (Fooled them--I
took CD's).  There was a country station, a talk station, an Arabic
calssical station, an Arabic top 20 station, an Arabic oldies station. 
Guess what?  no Rush there, either.  Not even Xanadu. Went to the
minimal exchange.  No Rush there.  Not even bad 3rd world boots from the
UAE.

So, I was using headphones for once, carefully blasting DS into my
tympanic membranes, and was listening to Driven.  I hear BOTH acoustic
and electric guitar during parts of it, and it sounds like two different
riffs.  Either:
A)  Alex is splitting the signal and using serious process and delay on
the electric side (likely) (and he has both pickups on the guitar) or,
2)  Geddy is using a pitch shifter on his bass to double the riff
(unlikely) or,
iii) They sampled the electric or acoustic riff so both could be
together (virtually impossible)
Sean, anyone else, got any idears?   

And after a good comedy act came through the base, I had this dream that
Rush was set up to give an on base concert (see what Rush deprivation
does to you?).  The drum solo (I was listening to RM while napping) had
everyone shocked into silence.

If you want any war stories from Kuwait, let me know.  
For the civilians:  A fairy tale starts, "Once upon a time..." and a war
story starts, "No shit, there I was.  Thought I was gonna die..." (not
quite, but we did have an attack warning while I was sitting in a field
of unexploded ordnance, unable to run for cover)

And a great quote from Arthur C. Clarke:  "An intellectual is someone
who has been educated beyond their intelligence."
