Subject: peart as an adjective

        During an episode of boredom, I discovered that "peart" was in the
dictionary.  According to Webster's, it's defined as follows:

        peart - adj. [var. of PERT] [Dial.] lively, chipper, sprightly,
                smart, etc.--peart'|ly adv.

        Sure this is meaningless.  I guess I'm just bored again.

        You know you're a Rush fan when:

                - you take special note of the appearance of the numbers
                  '2112' on your vehicle's odometer

I'm going to stretch the live-album-missing-stuff to one of the concerts I've
seen.  It was the Power Windows show in Lafayette, La on Territories.  That
unbelievably bad-ass bass synth part at the beginning was missing.  You know,
that part that goes zheuBWAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!  I was really dissapointed
because bass is my favorite instrument -- I get chills listening to Ged's
parts (I just got one thinking about it!).  Anyway, I saw the same show a
couple of days later in Houston and it was there, only it went BWAHHHHHHHH!!,
without the 'zheu'.

I know there have probably been concert-horror-stories-sweeps on TNMS before,
but I've got one that will chill your blood.  At the Lafayette show (I had
blocked it out for awhile) Geddy completely botched the beginning of Witch
Hunt.  The crowd had gone nuts when they started it, and had died down a little
when it hit full volume.  Well, it came time for 'The night is black...', and
well, nothing!  Ged wasn't there!  My mouth (as well as several thousand
others) just fell to the floor.  Then, low and behold, Alex lost it!  He was
looking around VERY surprised.  But, thanks to Neil, it came back together.
He came in right where he was supposed to, then Ged and Alex fell right in.
I had never seen them screw up before, so that night I saw what Neil later
meant by `I know perfects not for real...'.  Actually, that whole show kind of
sucked.  It was in the new 'Cajun Dome' and it sounded like crap.  Ged had
a hard time hearing himself sing, and any chance he got he put a finger to his
ear.  I haven't had any luck with Louisianna shows -- they played without much
passion at a show in Lake Charles. Anyway...

In the last issue of TNMS somebody said they think Rush is getting better and
better (sorry, I can't recall who it was).  I agree.  I have continually liked
each new album they come out with better than the previous ones.  I still have
a fondness for their early stuff (Ged going nutso with bass lines), mainly
since it was what I heard first -- Rush was still NEW to me.  I'm not saying
they've grown old to me -- the newness has just worn off.  I wish I had never
heard of them so I could live it all again!  Hearing Hemispheres debut on the
radio was amazing! Anyway...

(Sorry about all this babbling, I just finished a probability test and I'm
fried.)

[ Remember people, let's try to keep the posts civil...          :rush-mgr ]

In TNMS 06/20/91 Gregg Jaeger showed us the letter he had written to the
Rolling Stone editorial. All I could do was laugh.
I mean, yeah, Rolling stone magazine is not a real music-mag but still,
whoever wrote the review about Presto may think the album is crap. To be
honest, I think also that Presto IS crap. Just like HYF. All these Gregg
Jaeger-types really work against themselves while trying to convince every-
one that Rush is the ultimate band. It isn't. Can you guys believe that every-
body DOES NOT have to like Rush? The Rush fanatics in rec.music.misc and alt.
rock-n-roll are really [insert the f-word here] stupid. Just as are the people
who put all their mental energy into the phrase "Rush is crap". But hey, if
someone really thinks this is true, LET IT BE that way!
You are right about one thing: the guy who did the review in RS didn't know
a thing about Rush. But who cares, really? Does it really piss you off if
some ignorant says that Rush is crap? Does it piss you off if some all-knowing
Rush-expert and musical genius says that Rush is crap? Guys, opinions are
OPINIONS! You don't have to flame someone about his opinion.
One thing to Gregg Jaeger: do not take all this too personally. This thought
had grown inside for a while and now I had to let it out. You know these "keep
faith" guys who are posting to this list - they really make me puke and I
actually considered very seriously unsubscribing to this whole mailing list.
I joined TNMS to hear news and interpretations and such of Rush, not to see
mindless Rush-worshipers drooling around.

If you have to flame me, do it via email. Let's not waste any more bandwidth
on meaningless messages. I'll promise you all those flames will go straight
to the place they belong: trashcan. However, all other comments are very
welcome.

Rush-mgr: I will absolutely NOT write another message like this to TNMS. I
will rather unsubscribe if people still keep on writing messages around the
subject "how Rush and I felt comfortable with each other in my daydreams".
If you like to make TNMS a playground, you can do that. But at that point
I'll get the f*ck outta here.

Subject: Eddie and Gordo

  It _is_ interesting that Eddie VH makes a musical allusion to
``Xanadu'' in ``Pleasure Dome'' of his latest LP, F.U.C.K. (nasty
acronym!), in addition to the choice of song title -- now what about
``Man with a Mission''? Eddie is clearly the Paganini of the electric
guitar, but what about the band's lyrics? They sure do make one appreciate
the fact that Rush don't spend their entire life thinking about sex
and alcohol! Contrast Rush's ``Mission'' and VH's ``...Mission''! Though
I must say that this album is the proper successor to 1984! Solid.
Thanks for the disc guys!

 It is also nice to see Rush acknowledged by other musicians, if not
by the music press (in general). I noticed a discussion in Sting's
_Bring on the Night_ video that Rush's stage show was mentioned (as a
standard of quality): while the Paris concert was being organized
there was some discussion about the stage and lighting and Sting's
manager (I believe) says ``... like Rush's.''

I think it's only a matter of time before Rush get their due --
though, as for Van Gogh, it might take the ending of their production
to bring true appreciation...

  HAG2@vms.cs.pitt.edu was wondering why that voice in the A show

show up.

  Well, it did.  but it was faint. If you listen, you'll hear it.

  Well, I've decided to start reading the Digest again.  I was on
Merit a couple of days ago using IRC (the Merit\MS-DOS client),
and I met a couple of RUSH fans, like I (Rocinante, wow, remember
By-Tor??), and some of them were on the mailing list for the
digest..  So I decided to start reading and posting again..

  I'm listening to Moving Pictures right now, on Camera Eye.  Love

   Well..  Gotta split.

This got bounced when syrinx was down hope it isn't too out of date:

	Yeah, it's happened to me too.  I can't remember the whole thing (I've
actually had several) but they usually involved just "hanging out".
	There was the one where we were in Geddys mothers house and there was
an earthquake and Lerxst drove up in a Chevy Nova wondering what was
going on...
	 And then there was one where I was in my room and Geddy was sitting at
my roomates desk and we were just talking about non-music related stuff.
I remember waking up really upset that I didn't ask when the new album
was coming out.  I guess if he had told me it was to be called Roll the
Bones I'd have woken up 'knowing' it was a dream.
---
	Speaking of the new album, I've been hearing complaints about the speed
of production.  Am I the only one that sees this as a BONUS?  Some of
the bands best work was written and recorded in a day!  Force Ten, Vital
Signs, New World Man.  I think there have been others.  Rush has the
capability to be highly creative in a short period of time.
	 My personal hope is that the short time-span means they won't run the
risk of overproduction.  They have been bordering on it for a while.
	Any one know who's producing this one?  I'm curious to guess what the
sound will be.

I guess I'd be surprised if this was anything more than a
coincidence, based on the Rush/Van Halen feud back in the early
80's.

What?  You hadn't heard about that?  Well...

Okay, I'll try to summarize what I can remember about it from the
numerous magazine articles I read back then on the subject.  I
take no responsibility for any inaccuracies which may have crept
into the dark, cobwebbed corners of my memory in the years since.

Apparently once when both Rush and Van Halen were both playing
the same town in the same night (different venues), Rush had
rented some place for a get-together after the show.  Van Halen
showed up and basically took over this party, but the members of
Rush apparently didn't have any particular objection to that.

Things got a little heated later, though, when Eddie Van Halen
and Alex Lifeson were sitting together at a table, and Alex was
playing a tape of some Rush song.  I believe Eddie's quote about
the critical moment was something like "Alex [Lifeson] said
something about the song, and then somehow my beer got into the
tape recorder &lt;smirk&gt;."  (Apparently he wasn't impressed with
what he was hearing.)

Anyway, Van Halen left shortly thereafter... I don't remember if
there was actually any yelling or anything, but the members of
Rush and their crew were not happy.

Now for the capper: Van Halen had rented some other place for a
private party of their own (I don't remember if this was the same
night or not).  Well, Geddy Lee showed up at the party, intending
to apologize for the earlier incident and mend the ways.  Well,
Van Halen's bouncers didn't know Geddy from Adam, and before he
had a chance to say a word they unceremoniously tossed him out on
his ear.

Understandably, Geddy chose not to make a second attempt at
diplomacy.

I don't know if the two bands ever ironed out their differences,
but at least back then they were hardly the best of friends.

&gt;   As for his vocal ability... I read once that in a Canadian show Alex
sang &gt;the
&gt;WHOLE SHOW because Geddy's voice was sore/irritated/something. The crowd was
&gt;AMAZED to say the least...

     I have had to opportunity to work as a stage technican for Rush on
several occassions and once asked Alex about his vocals.  I was puzzled
because he will often sing during sound checks but does very little
live.  It turns out that he just hasn't developed the ability to play
and sing at the same time like Geddy can.

 Yad ho, groja UL

    This is my first post to NMS, and I'd like to make it a good one.
I had a few questions about stuff. First of all I've got FBN and COS on
cassette, and the order of the songs is different than the CD versions.
This doesn't matter too much on FBN because the songs are relatively
independent (except By-Tor and the Snow Dog which is kept intact).
However on COS the different order totally screws up the album because the
"Fountain of Lamneth" is broken up.  "Didacts and Narpets" follows "Bastille
Day" and "In The Valley" is also stuck in there between "Lakeside Park" and
"...Bald".  It's very hard to appreciate "...Lamneth" when you have to keep
fast forwarding and rewinding the tape.  (Thank goodness they kept "The
Necromancer" together)  Is this just my goofy copy, or are all of the cassette
messed up this way?  Also on "Force Ten" why doesn't Geddy sing the lyrics:
'Rising falling at force ten   we twist the world and ride the wind'?  Just
wondering?  Also is it just me or do the versions of "Subdivisions" and
"New World Man" on Chronicles seem to be faster and much more energetic than
the Signals version.  I like them better on Chronicles.  Did they just copy
the songs to make the compilation or did they re-record some of them, this
might have made the difference?  (By the way, for the record, my CD of ASOH
has a muffled "Subdivisions" as well.)

 By the way, the lyrics to DEW on the syrinx doesn't contain the part about
the tip of the iceberg, just thought I'd let you know.

I went to the premiere showing of Laser Rush here in Pittsburgh on Friday, and
I must say, it was the best laserium show I've seen yet.  (And I don't mean
just because it was free, either :-).  They included most of my off-the-wall
predictions of what songs they would play (i.e. the ones I hoped they'd play,
but was *sure* they wouldn't!).  There was a two-song encore, as well (I think
the standard at Buhl is one song).  Some "stock" laser effects were included
(I distincly remember one sequence from Laser Hysteria), but there were also a
number of custom sequences made for the Rush show alone.  I highly recommend
it to any Rush fans in earhsot of the NMS or the Pittsburgh area.

        Welp this is my first time here and I must say I am very impressed.
As a Rush fan I have been looking for a forum like this for a hell of a long
time and now I'm glad I have found it.

        First, I had been looking at my CD covers recently and if you
haven't noticed yet, which I am sure you have, they all contain from at
least  p/g  on, three objects that represent the boys in some way or
another.  On grace under pressure you can notice the three drops of water
in the lower right half of the picture, and of course the three older t.v.
sets on Power Windows and the three balls on HYF.  But what about Presto?

I may be stretching this a bit far but if you look at the artwork closely
you notice three rabbits obviously at the top of the hill.  May the one on
the left represent Alex, the one on the right Geddy and the one perched
atop the top hat Neil on the drum kit.  It's just a thought.

I am also going to be starting up, here in a short period of time, a new
Rush fan magazine.  So if anyone has some suggestions let me know.  Or if
anyone is interested in contributing let me know.  Thanks!

[ For starters, you might check out the currently-existing Rush fan magazne,
  called "The Spirit Of Rush".  The Yes e-mail mailing list is also a good
  magazine format; much more formal than the NMS.                 :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Album production speed?

	 &gt; 1.  It usually IS a bad thing to produce an album quickly.  As
	 &gt; any one that has EVER done ANY recording knows, it takes
	 &gt; FOREVER to get even one song to the level of satisfaction that
	 &gt; the players are looking for.  When an album is done quickly
	 &gt; this is most assuredly a sign of intense pressure from the
	 &gt; record company to pump out the product and make MONEY.

I wouldn't necessarily agree with this, though of course, "quickly" is
a subjective, meaningless term, really.  And every album is going to
lay down differently due to numerous forseeable and unforseeable
factors. First of all, I have *some* experience in putting out an
album, but with substantially less record company backing than the
Boyz :-).  Anyway, there are many phases the band will go through to
put an album out, and recording the tracks is often the shortest part
of the process.  We all know how good of musicians the Boyz are, but
more importantly, they have lots of experience *playing together*.
And one of the most important factors in getting the basic tracks
recorded is the preparation and experience of the musicians involved
(true, "outside" factors such as the producer/engineer team, studio,
etc factor in too, but at Rush's level, I'm sure this stuff is
top-notch, though their chemistry with the musicians is important
too).  I'm sure that after the writing process is complete (which
could definitely happen on the road or within a few months of intense
day-long rehersals -- it is their job after all), the guys would
practice very hard until they were sufficiently prepared to record. By
that I mean, that you are not figuring things out in the studio (at
$100's of dollars an hour), *and* that you are so comfortable with
what you're playing and what the group is playing, that those
spontaneous "magic" studio moments can occur.  That's where playing
with the same guys for 15-odd years can help (to say the least!).
And, if you're renting out a studio for a couple of weeks block, you
mic the drums, get your levels and *leave it overnight*.  That way,
once your sound is happening (which admittedly can take some time),
you leave it set up so that you can begin recording the next day with
little set up time. When we recorded, we were so well rehearsed that
the basic tracks for 8 songs went down in 3 days (most with 1 or 2
takes) and everything was recorded in 2 weeks, and I still think after
3 years that the performances hold up well.  Sure, they Boyz have lots
of keys and sequences, etc, but I don't think that would take too much
time.

The longest process in producing the actual music is definitely the
mixing/mastering stage. Some songs will just fall into place and with
today's automated systems (i.e. reproducable fades, punch-ins, etc),
each of these may take a day or two to mix.  Some songs are a b*tch to
mix and they could certainly take longer to get down but eventually
they do get mixed. The things that take up *lots* of time in getting
the album to market are things like the liner notes, art work,
manufacturing process, distribution, advertising and the like.  Just
to give an idea, when we did our album, we started the art work before
we went into the studio and yet we were *still* waiting for the final
art by the time the masters had been sent to the manufacturer.

	 &gt; 2.  Being a musician for the last 15 years (and growing up
	 &gt; learning and playing Rush materiala and jazz fusion stuff) I
	 &gt; have finally learned that great players and musicianship don't
	 &gt; mean great music.  You can't take monster players and put them
	 &gt; in a band and automatically have "great" music.  Great music is
	 &gt; music that is written from the heart and soul of the writer
	 &gt; regardless if they can play 64th note triplets or not.  I've
	 &gt; listened to alot of incredible players and bands over the years
	 &gt; and some of my favorite music is made by guys who are quite a
	 &gt; bit less then virtuoses.

Agreed. 100%. I'll take chemistry over virtuosity every time. Its can
be incredible (if rare) when their both there.

&gt;From: Doug Grumann &lt;dougg@hpptc16.rose.hp.com&gt;

&gt;Its been fun seeing posts lately to the mailing list from Dave Rubin.
&gt;I worked with Dave Rubin for several years at HP.  He's a good drummer,
&gt;and has played intermittently with different Bay Area groups doing
&gt;different kinds of music.  He's into Rush, but mostly plays fusion-type
&gt;stuff.  He left HP around a year ago to work for SyBase. (drubin@sybase.com)
&gt;
&gt;Dave: Does this sound like you?  No?  Will the real Dave Rubin please stand
&gt;up?  I forwarded Dave Rubin's post to TNMS to Dave Rubin.  Dave said that
&gt;he didn't agree with Dave's opinions.
Well ... I do play drums (but I'm a keyboardist by nature) and I am into
fusion-type stuff ... but I'm just another Dave in the endless sea of Rubins.

&gt;1.  It usually IS a bad thing to produce an album quickly.  As any one that
&gt;    has EVER done ANY recording knows, it takes FOREVER to get even one song
&gt;    to the level of satisfaction that the players are looking for.  When
&gt;    an album is done quickly this is most assuredly a sign of intense
&gt;    pressure from the record company to pump out the product and make MONEY.

Well, I do agree that it is in general bad to record an entire album quickly.
The idea I was getting at is that sometimes it is impossible to replicate the
FEEL of a song as it comes through on the initial recording or demo.  I
have recorded many a keyboard part on a rough demo, and even re-recording
the part note-for-note did not reproduce the feel of the original.  As told in
various Rush interviews, the initial tracks on most Rush songs are recorded
live, with Neil's drum track being the only part that is kept (not
re-recorded).  Neil's ad-libs and variations often become the basis of some
other parts, particularly some bass riffs.  That is why (IMHO) Rush's songs
sound very well thought out and produced, but retain a great deal of energy
and feel (and also why they are a GREAT live band).

&gt;2.  Being a musician for the last 15 years (and growing up learning and
&gt;    playing Rush materiala and jazz fusion stuff) I have finally learned
&gt;    that great players and musicianship don't mean great music.  You can't
&gt;    take monster players and put them in a band and automatically have
&gt;    "great" music.  Great music is music that is written from the heart
&gt;    and soul of the writer regardless if they can play 64th note triplets
&gt;    or not.  I've listened to alot of incredible players and bands over the
&gt;    years and some of my favorite music is made by guys who are quite a bit
&gt;    less then virtuoses.

Absolutely!  I've been in a few bands, with mostly high caliber musicians.
But if the chemistry is not there, it doesn't matter how good your chops are!
The strong personalities (dare I say ego?) that sometimes accompany good
musicians can get in the way and ruin a band.  It's the songwriting that's
important, and then the chemistry of the band to get the songs to come across.
Rush, in addition to being superb musicians and songwriters, have a GREAT
chemistry and that's why I say it would be difficult for them to record a
truly BAD album (mediocre is another story).

yo rushians--

I believe that "La Villa Strangiato" is Italian, not Spanish, because
Spanish adjectives end in "do" or "da".  One should note, however, that
there is some mixing of languages elsewhere in the song, as in "Buenas
Noches, Mein Froinds".  I've never heard a Spanish word "strangiado",
which means very little as I'm not fluent, but "villa" usually does
mean "house".  Thus I'm more inclined to believe the Italian derivation.
Any Italian speakers out there want to blow me out of the water?  I'm
merely a third-generation agnolotti eater.  :-)

What indeed, I will have you know that NO ONE from here is native (except
for a few indians.) The rest of us migrated from colder climes.

I do know what a Maple looks like, but the Oaks have wiped them out here.
The mountains that surround Tucson are high enough that there are all kinds
of trees (which are not cactus). And northern Arizona is filled with that
kind of forest as well.

Hinano Akaka writes:
&gt; ... about the longevity of Rush ... I'm hoping they'll be like
&gt; what Genesis is like now -- doing projects with other people
&gt; for a few years and then getting together when they have the
&gt; time/enthusiasm ... and doing a project ...

leading Gordon MacKinney &lt;gordon@hpbblb.bbn.hp.com&gt; to ask:

&gt; Readers: Can solo projects damage the Rush "magic"?

My perception of the effect of the direction of solo projects on bands is
a little more complicated: It depends strongly on the reasons for the
undertaking. If my reading of the FAQL is correct, most of the projects
the Boyz have engaged in, outside of Rush, have involved newer artists who
were seeking some guidance(?) and one member of the band or another felt
it was in everyone's best interests if said group got some recognition for
their talents.

For contrast, look at Danny Elfman of Oingo Boingo. OB is just about dead
now, because of Elfman's concentration on other projects, most notably
soundtracks. Even their most recent album shows this, since Elfman is the
dominating influence in the creative direction of OB, and one senses that
the rest of the band, while they may not begrudge Elfman's success or his
desire to do outside projects, is less enthusiastic than before.

Rush probably won't suffer this fate. With three people to share in the
creative load, and their seemingly endless desire to search for new
directions, even if one member loses(hopefully only temporarily) the
inspiration necessary to continue, the band as a whole can probably
survive in a form that none us will see as 'bad' or 'stale.' If, on the
other hand, a member develops an ego problem, breakup is inevitible. But I
cannot see this happening. "Star complex" is something you get early on in
a career such as the Boyz have chosen. I think I will be "over the hill"
before Rush stops producing the music we all know and love, and I think
that by that point(say when they're nearly sixty!) they should be allowed
to retire when they see fit. But that leaves us a lot of time to debate
the merits of what they have to say and play before we have to worry about
it...
