I heard on my radio station that DS is the last live performence cd that 
RUSH will release.  I also heard that they might be down for good soon?  
THey Said the Geddy are waiting on Alex and Neil to decide what they 
want to do.  What the heck.  I have never seen them live I hop-e to see

Yo,

I, too, have been dicked out of my boots that I was oh so excited to be
getting!  Yippie!  What a dick.  My boots have "being mailed" since June on
orders that I had from 6 months before that.  To give you an idea of how long
I have been waiting, I have moved twice since I placed my order!!!

Anyhow, Bahr's address is durnik@goodnet.com and his wife's address (who is
supposedly doing the shipping) is emerald@goodnet.com

He is supposedly running a gaming center somewhere in Mesa.  It's called
Wizard's Tower Gaming Center.  I used to live in Phoenix, but I moved
(TWICE!!!) before this place even opened.  I don't know the number, but I'm
sure that he would deny any involvement with anything relating to Prism, but I
guess you could giving it a try.  Call informationg and ask for area code 602,
Mesa, and the name of the store and email me if you get the number!

Good luck, you're gonna need it!

Rush content:  For some reason, I find myself listening to 2112 over and over
again (from DS).  I have all of the other tunes about 8 times on different
rare recordings, but I don't have a good version of 2112.

There are probably a lot of us who simply can't afford the $50+ for the Japanese
version of DS.  What to do, what to do.  If you really want the Japanese DS
feeling at no cost to you, download WinAmp (www.winamp.com).  It allows you to
make playlists with MP3s and CD audio tracks.  Simply make a playlist out of DS
Disc 2 and then stick your Force Ten MP3 (available at the NMS homepage) in on
track ten.  Force Ten, track ten, get it?

   [ Force Ten is on disc two, between Natural Science and The Spirit of
     Radio (making it track 10). 

     It was recorded at Cincinnati's Riverbend on June 4, 1997.    : rush-mgr ]

First, I agree that the 2/3 section near the beginning is a respectful to nod
to Max Roach, who I guess did this kind of part many years before Bozzio?   I
don't know, but certainly it is like The Drum Also Waltzes.  Perhaps it is
even a nod to Bill Bruford....?

I hate to call ya on something but I've never even heard of a 2/3 time sig.

Subject: Relayer by Yes not as good as I thought

Back a few weeks ago, I read a post where some
interviewer asked Geddy what album he would salvage if
his house was about to burn down.  To which he
immediately responded, "Relayer by Yes".     After that, I
went out and purchased Relayer and I am fairly
unimpressed with the album.  I would have thought that there
would be some really great bass playing because many
other people on TNMS agreed with Geddy's
recommendation.   
Can someone out there help me appreciate the album
better?  I'm thinking that I just wasted $14.00.

No question about it -- the world's fastest Rock & Roll
guitarist is Nuno Betterncourt from the recently disbanded
"Extreeme".  If anyone cares to doubt me, please listen to
the following tracks:

First part of He-Man Woman Hater from their album
"Pornograffitti"

Midnight Express from their album "Waiting for the
Punchline"

If anyone can think of a musician with faster chops, please
name artist, album and track.  Although I am quite certain
that there is not another as fast as Nuno.

Thanks,
Brad

To settle the BMG debate once and for all, the following is taken from the
BMG web site, in their FAQ listing:

>>>
Are the Club's CDs and tapes as good as the ones I can buy
in the store? 

        You have our promise. The product sold to our
        membership is of the highest quality and is exactly the
        same as the product sold in retail stores. 

        You may find it interesting to know that our Club does
        not actually manufacture cassettes or compact discs.
        We obtain our inventory from manufacturers who
        produce the selections for retail stores, as well as for
        the Club. For inventory purposes we indicate our
        product has been manufactured for our Club and attach
        our unique selection number. 

        We stand 100% behind our product - and guarantee
        replacement or credit to your account if you should
        receive a defective selection. 
<<<

If you want to check for yourself, hop on over to:

http://www.bmgmusicservice.com/top.jhtml?page=%2Fpop%2Findex.jhtml&club=pop

and then hit the FAQ button on the left.  The pertinent question is in the
subsection entitled "Miscellaneous."

Thanks to all on responding to my "digital is digital" claim (and to all
others who offered their $0.02).  I admit that this statement was not 100%
accurate, and I appreciate the education.  However, my main point was that
BMG deals only with the real McCoy, not some cheap imitation.  I could see
why collectors don't like these versions, since they are tainted with the
BMG stamp.  However, for those of you who buy CDs simply for the music
(like me), the BMG versions are completely satisfactory.

I hope this ends the debate.

Regards,

William MacDonald

Subject: Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame.

Could somebody tell me--I don't know--does every band require a petition
to get in or is it decided by a panel of writers like baseball's?

It seems to me that there are a lot of Phil Rizzutos, so to speak, in
the Rock and Roll Hall. I don't see how Rush could NOT be inducted,
given their enormous contribution. In other words, if they need to be
told, the hell with them.

22 certified gold records. Their entire catalog. That's at least
11,000,000 times someone saw fit to buy a Rush record. That's not good
enough? Let me rephrase that--THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH? Okay, what about
all the ticket sales? I don't know, but I imagine that's in the
10,000,000 range too.

The point is that Rush unquestionably deserves to be there, and while I
think it's nice that their fans are willing to draw up a petition, it
shouldn't even be necessary. If The Dead is in, Rush should be in. My
opinion is that they probably will get there eventually, but then again
they might be ignored just like they are by all the institutions in
popular music. The shame of it is that Rush has made a buck or two for a
lot of people.

It's probably not as important as we may make it out to be, but it does
irk me to think about it and EXPECT our heroes to get the shaft again
when it comes to recognition. But then again, the same mainstream folks
that buy Spice Girls CD's are the ones that elected Bill
Clinton--twice--so why should they consider honesty and integrity to be
factors?

I'm not wasting my time petitioning the ignorant. I've got better things
to do.

Subject: re: Rush Remasters

Ever hear the original Hemispheres CD? Considering what they had to work
with I thought they did a WONDERFUL job on the remaster. Put any of the
originals next to the remaster and you'll notice a dramatic difference.
To my ears, the Zep remasters have a tinny sound, by far inferior to the
Rush discs ( although the music is great!).

Just an opinion,

Kevin Haines wrote:

Gang,

Am I the only person who was a little disappointed with the quality of 
the remastering of Hemispheres? Specifically, the tape hiss at the
start of La Villa bugs me. I know on the Led Zeppelin Remasters they
did an exceptional job of cleaning stuff like that up, so my question
is was Geddy, Alex or Neil involved in the Remastering, or was this
all done by Mercury?  In the case of the Led Zep stuff, Jimmy Page
himself was heavily involved in the remastering process and I suspect
that contributed to the excellent job done.

As far as I can recall I didn't notice this sort of tape hiss in
Rivendell, so would this have something to do with the level of
dynamics in La Villa?

Subject: Top 20

To Matt M.

Liked your list of Rush's top 20 albums, but I just want to disagree =
with you on one point.
Your choice of Grace Under Pressure as Rush's weakest work.  This album =
is one of my favorites.  While I probably a gree with you on the rest of =
your selections, I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the first =
new album they released after I became a Rush fan.  Yes, I know its =
dark, but I love dark.  I love the balance between rough, edgy guitars =
and rough, edgy keyboards.  Geddy has been said to dislike the album =
because the period it represents is a dark one for him, but I have =
always liked the anger that I hear in their playing.  This album is =
unlike any of their other albums except 2112 in that they allow their =
emotions to show.  Sure they weren't happy, but most of their other =
albums have an air of detached objectivism.  This album exposes raw =
emotion on their part.  Even a song like "Red Lenses" has a darkness to =
it.  They never before and have never since balanced their guitars a =
keyboards so well with the possible exception of "Counterparts."  At =
least in my opinion.  Finally, perhaps they did sound more mainstream, =
musically at the time, but contrast their subject matter and tones with =
such early 80's contemporaries such as Culture Club, Spandau Ballet, =
Night Ranger and Phil Collins.  Those folks were all having great fun =
and feelin' good.  Rush was pissed!  Sorry, but I enjoy the latter in my =
music.

Tracy Smith Writes:

This was a total surprise Rush moment. It happened last Wednesday, around 
6 p.m. or so...

I was driving home from a particularly rough day at work and happened to 
switch channels to 93.1 Arrow, here in Southern California. It is an 
oldies-type station, rock and roll 60-70s stuff.

I was completely surprise to here New World Man...I don't think I have 
ever heard that song on the radio...others may have, but not me.

I sat there enjoying the moment and then triply enjoyed the DJs talking 
about how great Rush *is*, how wonderful they are as muscians, and Neil 
as a writer. It was great (one of the DJs was Joe Benson...late of KLOS 
and probably KMET???). I should have not been surprised but I was to have 
such a great moment and so out of the blue!

There is hope yet... :-)
Tracy

Hey Tracy, I live in L.A. too and I heard the song the same time that you did.
It was quite astonishing to be hearing Rush at that time.  As you were, I was
driving home from work and there it was.  I was totally surprised!  Joe Benson
is the L.A. radio legend as is Bob Coburn.  Maybe some day Arrow will turn
into an all RUSH station!

Someone asked about the guitar speed demons: Al Dimeola plays fast when
he wants to. Someone recently recommend "Race with Devil on Spanish
Highway." It's fast at times, but not at the expense of the music.

Others you might want to try are Yngwe Malmsteen (sp?) and Tony
MacAlpine. Seems like classically trained guitarists who slide over into
rock can play faster than anyone, but as others have pointed out, speed
isn't necessarily great music.

Does the fashion in which the "tinkerlith" appears throughout the DS
linernotes remind anyone else of "the obelisk" from Led Zeppelin's "Presense"
album?  The way it just randomly appears here and there?

And by the way, in an earlier post, my Margie reference was to "Fargo" and not
"Pulp Fiction" (had you thinking though, didn't I?).

Hanstones mentioned By-Tor as the first epic song.

Han, I'm not sure if By-Tor quite counts as an epic, I think the
definition of "epic" is a little subjective no matter what.  Personally
I would agree with you, I think By-Tor IS.

But even if you don't count By-Tor, then "Fountain of Lamneth" is the
first true epic (being a whole album side and whatnot), even if it's
not my favorite song and it's on my least favorite album.  I guess
Matt M. forgot about that one.  So Xanadu still wouldn't be the first
epic.  :-)

Here's an interesting point of view, speaking of "epic songs".....
Would "La Villa" be considered an epic?  Even though there are no
lyrics, it sort of tells a story when the music is examined in the
context of the titles of the various sections....

>The fact is, I knew it was a joke, everyone knew it was a joke.

Well for starters, maybe you're right and you caught me on a bad day.
BUT you offered up some pretty harsh criticism against something that
you supposedly knew was a joke.  You made me feel like it's a friggin
CRIME for someone to express a little tongue-in-cheek humor.  After all,
it was around 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning when I wrote that and I was
feeling weird.  I didn't think that was such a crime considering some
of the posts I've seen on TNMS. (not referring to yours)

And I *did* read your post.  You said that only losers and non-talents
are in the ROR HOF, and you said that you didn't think Rush should be
associated with such crappy bands.  Nowhere did I "twist your words"
to fit my intentions.

There are plenty of crappy bands they play on the radio, does that mean
we shouldn't urge DJ's to play more Rush?  I'm THRILLED when I hear
WNEW play their occasional Rush song (usually around whenever a new
album comes out) even if 90% of the time it's Limelight.

There are plenty of crappy albums they sell in record stores, does that
mean we shouldn't pester the store mgrs to keep up posted as to when
they are expecting their shipment when a new Rush album comes out?

Furthermore I never said (nor implied) that dissenting opinions should
not be tolerated on the NMS, what I DID say is that criticizing *ME*
because I choose to support the campaign STARTED BY TNMS is wrong.
Rather you should be criticizing the administrators of TNMS if you
feel so strongly about the ROR HOF issue.

Oh and one other thing.  You lost me somewhere with your Niagra Falls
comment.  I am doing something CONTRARY to what people (i.e. you) are
telling me, I'm not doing anything that 90% of people tell me to do,
and I normally don't.

Subject: The BMG saga

I have been a member of BMG for the past couple of years. I have been
talking to a friend of mine about this "CD quality" thing so he brought over
his store-bought re-master of Moving Pictures and we made a comparison to my
BMG version. It is identical. The track timings, overall sound, everything!
The only difference between the 2 re-masterings is that the BMG copy has
"BMG" on the disk and the sleeve and cost me next to nothing (11 CDs for the
cost of 1 - ya can't beat it!) and the retail version cost him $16. We put
both discs in the changer of a high quality stereo system and switched back
and forth between the two and they sound exactly the same. Is it possible
that BMG just takes the regular release CD and copies it? That's my bet. Why
would they do anything else? That would just add to the expense of producing
them when they were already remastered? I realize that the BMG disks will
probably be worth less in the future because they have the BMG name printed
on them, and it is possible that they use a lesser quality disc, but my ear
could not tell any difference in sound. Besides, if you're THAT worried
about your CD being more valuable in the future without the BMG name on it,
think about the fact that there are already a quadra-bazillion copies of
these CDs released and the possibility of your CD being worth anything more
is next to none unless it's some kind of rare limited release. In this day
and age it's hard to find quality and value in the same product but I
personally feel that BMG has it pegged!

There goes your credibility. "Thinking" is not something that comes to mind
when I hear the word Republican. Besides, remember that this list is
international; those of us outside the USA really don't care about your

I was surprised last night when on the radio during a twenty song
music block on a Minneapolis radio station that Force Ten came on
followed by Tom Sawyer.  Rush gets a fair amount of airplay for their
older material, but this is the *first* time I have ever heard
anything from HYF on the radio.  Maybe there is hope for the radio
after all.

I personally think both political parties are full of $hit. Instead of
dealing with real concerns in an educated fashion, they build up dogmas and
perpetuate this ridiculous rivalry between each other. Why???? No wonder
this country is going to hell: no one can think for themselves anymore!
