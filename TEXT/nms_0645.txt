Subject: Rush'n'baseball; Ged the producer

Hmmmm...
     The only baseball connection that readily comes to mind is on the
Sid[D, uh sorry about that, Signals album sleeve which lists the
positions everyone played (Ged was pitcher, I believe). Also, in one of
the recent tourbooks, Neil describes a late night bus ride with Geddy
looking over a sports page, checking out the latest scores.
     In  an unrelated note, Geddy produced an album by a group called
Boys+wx Brigade, dammit,   Boys Brigade. This was in about '83. Anyone
know ab out it?
     Sorry about the typing quaality, but my keyboard is fighting me....

Subject: Alex Van Halen is Overrated

This is a reply/flame to the bozo that claims that Alex Van Halen and
Frank Beard are better drummers than Neil.

First of all, I have always thought Alex VH to be _very_ overrated.  Talk
about overdoing it on the cymbals!  The boy ain't bad, but he sure isn't
anything special.  Actually, his brother Eddie is the only major talent
in the band (don't even get me started with Mike Anthony and how overrated
he is!).

Second of all, I am not going to dispute your tastes too much -- if you
prefer to listen to the straight-ahead mechanistic drumming of Frank Beard
or the "how many times can I bash my cymbals" style of Alex Van Halen, so
be it -- whatever floats your boat.  But you are COMPLETELY off-base by
putting either one of those bozos in a class with Neil, who has more
technical mastery and generally interesting drum parts than the two of them
put together.

Next thing you'll be telling us is that Sting is a great bassist, or
_Rolling Stone_ magazine isn't a politically correct fashion rag.

But hey, if that's what you like to listen to, be my guest.

Chris

    [ Ok, boys and girls let's not get this thing into a flame war now.
      constructive arguments against this is welcomed.  Brace yourself
      Chris you'll probably get some from this post.  :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Playing WMT?

I was looking at the tab for Where's My Thing, and it's not getting me
very far.  Possibly because I play keyboard...but that's beside the
point.  I tried playing the intro chords based on the tab, and they just
don't sound right.  Is the tab that I found correct and it's just a
guitar thing, or what?  I mean, it really doesn't sound right...  :-)

Also, the tab is very strictly tab.  Can anyone either add in chord
names to the tab or create a chord-only version?  Would be muchly
helpful for me, and I assume for any other un-guitarists out there.  (On
a slightly related note, anyone have an extra guitar out there?  I want
to learn.. (-:  )

G'Evening, all...

   First post, and all that. I wanted to mention George's reference
to 1001001 being 111 in octal, which could be a reference to the three
guys in the band....I've stretched it further than that, sir: if you
number the letters of the English alphabet 1-26, and then add up all
the letters in the word "RED" (whose proliferation we are all familiar
with: Red Star of 2112, Red Lenses, Red Barchetta, cover of Hold Your
Fire, etc., etc.), they come out R(#18)-E(#5)-D(#4), which adds up to
27....which is 3 CUBED....not only a reference to the three members of
the band, but their interdependent synergistic relationship which gives
rise to the band itself]
(If Rush fans are called Rushians...was this red star thing THAT
premonitory?....)
Still Strangiato after all these years...

&gt; After freewill, I thought it was time to re-evaluate
&gt; another song...Losin-it from SIG. Why-o-Why was this
&gt; not released as a single? (Anybody from Mercury Recs
&gt; reading this!)...poetic,lyrical, sad and yet with
&gt; an uplifting message "better to have known...".

Au contraire, the lines are:

    Sadder still to watch it die
    Than NEVER to have known it
    For you, the blind who once could see
    The bell tolls for thee

It's reversing the old "'tis better to have loved and lost..."

For the record, I disagree with him...

&gt; Hmmm. Anything real to say?  Well, yes.  I have the CD singles for Roll the
&gt; Bones w/ "It's a Rap" parts 2 and 3 (Geddy and Neil).  Anyone have a copy of
&gt; the single w/ Part 1 (Alex) they'd be willing to part with?

It's a vinyl single, y'know.  Try the place where I got it: The
Turntable here in Palatine, (708) 705-5445, I believe.

[re: YYZ]

&gt; Has anybody ever seen bass tablature (or sheet music) for this song?  I
&gt; can improvise my own little second fill, but Geddy's is so terrific I'd
&gt; love to know what the notes are.

I have it some somewhere, in one of those hand-transcribed spiral binder
books.  I can't verify its accuracy, as I've never tried actually
learning it past the first few measures.

I assume we all have seen the latest Guitar School magazine where they
transcribe "Limelight", right?

Subject: E-mail Correspondence with Neil
Date: Thu, 18 Mar 93 07:39:04 EST

Hi there.
     Thank you very much for placing me on your mailing list.  I will have
admit that I am new to The National Midnight Star and what services the Rush
mailing list offers but I am very interested to delve into it and learn more.
     I hope that I am addressing my questions to the right person.  I must 
plead ignorance here.  I am brand new to the world of E-mail.  Just have a few
questions.

1)  Do you know of any way of possible E-mail correspondance with Neil Peart?
 I have been interested for some time in corresponding to him.  I guess
 regular mail service works just as well to.

   [ Far as I know, none of them have email addresses :rush-mgr ]

2)  Is there a way of looking back into the FAQL of past months?

   [ There's a mailserver where you can request for the FAQL, see the
     tail end of the digest on how to use this service.     :rush-mgr ]

3)  In a recent reply to me,  the statement was made that "appropriate topics
    are welcome, and flames are discouraged."

I do not understand what flames are.  Please define what this is within it's
context.  Just curious what it means.

    [ Flames are comments/actions that people make (generally of a
      negative nature) that attacks the individual.  Ie:  If I were to
      say you are a fool because of such and such, and you're an idiot because
      of what you've posted, etc..etc.. This would be a flame.  Flames
      of course are discouraged on this mailing list.  :rush-mgr ]

                                          Sincerely
                                                       Detayled@AOL.COM

From: mspring@hvlpa.att.com!

Fellow Rushians,

I do share Brian D.'s extreme enjoyment of BB&B. I consider it as the
definition of the Early Rush Sound (Post 'Rush' & pre AFTK) -&gt; the
extreme unisone (is that English?;^) stuff in it, the weird rythm played
by Neil, the briliant singing of Ged, great lyrics. It's just (MHO)OIMHO)
one of their best (perhaps THE best) shorter tunes they have ever made.

Wasn't it (BTW) written by Alex? I love this song 8^))))))))))))

While I'm here ('cause we're here :) I have a question. Ones upon a time...
I read an interview with Neil where he explained a little bit the live
performance of 'Time Stands Still'. He said they used a click-track to
synchronise the music with the background film and it was quite difficult
to perform this. He also said that it has happened that it all went wrong:
he threw off his headphone and they stopped playing the song. Now, here
is my question:

Is there an NMS'er out there who has ever seen this, Rush screwing up
on 'Time Stands Still' (or any other _Click-Track-Based-Song_)? I
find it hard to imagine a technical perfect band like Rush, screwing
up a song on a live performance. Just out of curiousity.

    [ I've seen plenty of concerts where the video is out of synch with
      the music, this has happened at times on Time Stand Still and
      Subdivisions ie: basement bar footage shown while singing "in back of
      cars", etc..					:rush-mgr ]

(BTW, I like cycling, just like NP ; Who said that cycling wasn't a
real sport or something like that ? ;^)

Subject: Rush UK chart "hits"

Going back to the rather old thread about New World Man being the only single
to have made it into the US Top 40, I managed to find a battered old copy of
The Guinness Book of Hit Singles the other day.  It lists the top UK chart
position for all singles since that chart began in about 1957.  Here is the
entry for Rush:

Total number of weeks in chart: 36

Rel. Date  Title                                      Highest   Weeks in

15 Mar 80  Spirit of Radio                              13        7
28 Mar 81  Vital Signs/A Passage to Bangkok             41        4
31 Oct 81  Tom Sawyer                                   25        6
4  Sep 82  New World Man                                42        3

26 May 84  The Body Electric                            56        3
12 Oct 85  The Big Money                                46        3

Spirit of Radio reached number 13!!!  Very surprising!!!

Unfortunately, the book was pretty out of date, so that's as far as it goes.
Does anyone else in the UK have a more up to date copy?  And, while I think
of it, does anyone have a copy of the Guinness Book of Hit Albums?  Get it
posted!

Subject: Rush and Grammy's/Juno's

&gt;	...I know for sure that they won the Best Instrumental in
&gt; 1982, not 1981!

	No you don't.  Rush has never won a Grammy.  The Grammy's are
awarded to performers for a performance(s) in the previous year.
Thus, 'YYZ' was nominated IN 1982 FOR 1981 (the year MP came out).
Therefore, the 1992 nomination of 1991's 'Where's My Thing' (the year
RTB came out) was the 10th anniversary of when 1981's 'YYZ' was
nominated (1982).

	To avoid further speculation:

The Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance
-------------------------------------------------------

1992  Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, 'Little Wing'
1991  Eric Johnson, 'Cliffs of Dover'  &lt;---- 'WMT' lost
1990  The Vaughan Brothers, 'D/FW'
1989  Jeff Beck, 'Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop'
1988  Carlos Santana, 'Blues for Salvador'
1987  Frank Zappa, 'Jazz from Hell'
1986  The Art of Noise, 'Peter Gunn'
1985  Jeff Beck, 'Escape'
1984  Yes, 'Cinema'
1983  Sting, 'Brimstone and Treacle'
1982  A Flock of Seagulls, 'D.N.A.'
1981  The Police, 'Behind My Camel'  &lt;---- 'YYZ' lost
1980  The Police, 'Regatta de Blanc'
1979  Wings, 'Rockestra'

NOTE:  The year is when the recording was released.  The award was
       given the following year.

	As for Juno Awards (yes, the year thing applies here to), Rush
has won the following:

1978 Group of the Year
1977 Group of the Year

1974 Most Promising Group of the Year (i.e. best new artist)

And Hugh Syme has won the following:

1990 for 'Presto'/Rush
1989 for 'Levity'/Ian Thomas
1986 with Dimo Safari (no album stated, guess: 'PoW')
1981 with Deborah Samuel (no album stated, guess: 'MP')

   [ Speaking of Hugh Syme, if you take a look at the new Page/Coverdale
     CD you'll notice that he did the art direction for that CD! :rush-mgr ]

	The guesses were arrived at due to the fact that the
co-winners are credited for their work in the respective Rush albums.

	I have no info on the Juno's for the 1991 and 1992 years.

Subject: Yet another poll idea....

Greetings and salutations!  All of this talk about Rush on the radio has
inspired me to try my hand at running a poll.  How's this for a topic:
How do the different Rush songs stack up when it comes to actually being
played on the radio?  Here's how I'll work this -- when any of you hear
a Rush song on the radio, simply e-mail me telling me you heard X song
(or X, Y, and Z songs, or whatever).  I'll run this for a week or so, and
then let you all know what DJ's are actually playing.  So start sending
those Rush Radio Reports to me at
					AAWST3@vms.cis.pitt.edu
								     and I'll
start tabulating them.  Nice, easy, painless, and possibly interesting to a
few people.  So participate!

I must agree with Brian D.  BB&B is a great tune.  Lyric, guitar, bass, and
percussion are outstanding and very powerful.  Being a drummer, I tend to
notice the percussion more than the guitar and bass.  Neil really throws
some tricky stuff in there.  I love that tune.

Subject:      Rush and Spinal Tap

Hi, all --

Someone asked if _This is Spinal Tap_ was based on Rush...

Having just watched this movie for about my 10th time, I can say with all
confidence that, while Rush was probably among the worst offenders during
the 70s/early 80s, Spinal Tap is a parody of *all* progressive rock/
heavy metal bands whose musical and aesthetic excesses needed a good punc-
turing. When I watch Spinal Tap, I see the Moody Blues, Blue Oyster Cult,
Slade, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Judas Priest, and the infinite number of
other groups that placed gothic and/or mythic themes at the forefront
of their acts and appealed mostly to 14-year-old boys (this is not a slam
on any 14-year-old boys who might be out there : ) ).

Rush, thankfully, seems to have outgrown their Spinal Tap period (I am
emphatically *not* starting the old v. new debate again). Those groups
who couldn't are gone. _This is Spinal Tap_ is, to put it simply,
about dinosaurs.

I'm sure everyone who's seen Spinal Tap has a favorite scene -- mine
all involve Nigel Tufnel, although I'm torn between his Dm trilogy
in progress, "Lick My Love Pump"; his retuning the violin he rubs
across the guitar strings during his noisy, self-indulgent guitar
solo; and his amps that "go to eleven"...

HI, MY NAME IS BILL AND IM NEW TO NMS.  I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE HAS HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT A NEW RUSH ALBUM COMING OUT.  DONT GET ME WRONG - I LOVE ALL
OF MY RUSH ALBUMS AND COULD LISTEN TO THEM FOR YEARS BUT IT SADDENS ME WHEN
I GO INTO A RECORD STORE AND CANT BUY ANY RUSH SIMPLY BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE
EVERY ALBUM. OH WELL.  ALSO I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE KNEW WHERE I COULD GET
MY HANDS ON RUSH CD SINGLES.  THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND. THANKS


    [ Bill, it's not necessary to type in all UPPERCASE (looks like you're 
      shouting!) As for the new album, stay tune, something will be
      posted very soon about details of the album and tour.  :rush-mgr ]

Subject: baseball, GIF files

          Greetings, in response to the cubsfan's (mike i think)
          baseball post, there are baseball references on the Signals
          insert (it mentions former Expo Warren Cromartie, sp?).
          Also, the GUP tour book, i think that's the one, has a
          picture of Geddy in concert with an Expo's jersey on.
          (aside, sorry cubsfan about the '84 crushing of the Cubs by
          the Pads, you probably heard me shouting "40 more years" to
          you from the Murph in game 5).

          Does anybody out there know if there's a way to use GIF
          files on a PC with Word for Windows or OS/2 picture viewer?
          Or am I out of luck?

          To brian, I very much like Beneath, Between, and Behind.  I
          don't think I've seen anything posted about it.  Great tune.

          Hey ho wish you well,
          Matt

          Well, I was only kid, lost in a religous maze
          Believing there's some good in the holy-roller craze
          But I'll not create a god to justify my ways
          So, I listen for his praise

Subject: Radio air Play and "Beneath, Between and Behind"

Hi kids,

    Haven't posted in a while.  Anyway, all you people that list all the
songs that you hear on your local radio stations just have to knock it
off.  Here in the Philly area, we don't get shit for variety.  We just get
the "main stream" Rush tunes like:

	Limelight		Roll the Bones		The Spirit of Radio
	Red Barchetta		Dreamline		Freewill
	Subdivisions		Ghost of a Chance	Tom Sawyer
	New World Man		Fly By Night
	Distant Early Warning	Closer to the Heart

These are the only songs that I've heard on a semi-regular basis here!!!
Just once, I'd like to here WMMR play something totally out of the ordinary!
Something like "Cygnus X-1" or "Witch Hunt" or "La Villa Strangiato" would be
great.  Someone said that in Texas they heard "Cygnus X-1", someone else
heard "Lock and Key", etc...  Needless to say I'm a little envious.  We
don't even get "Working Man" or anything from Power Windows or Presto!
Life sucks, then you die.

   Oh, I just wanted to say that I agree with whoever brought up "Beneath,
Between and Behind."  I have a special liking for that song too.  I'm not
sure why, dammit, I just do.

   Thanks go out to John Santore for the work on the convention!!
	(Hey, Don, are you goin' with me or what, you slacker?!)

Subject: YYZ Bass Tab - 2nd riff

All right, I suppose everyone is getting a little tired of this subject, but
being a Rush purist, I'm goin to give my two cents.  Last issue the bass tab
was posted by someone as follows:

               slide
                  |
-5-5---7-5---5---4^5---5---------
-----7-----7---7-----7---7-6-5---
-------------------------------7-
---------------------------------

I am in a band with a bassist who swears this is correct.  However, I will
die fighting with the belief that that last note (the 16th note) does not
exist in the original bass line (Moving Pictures).  I believe the bass tab to
be this:

               slide
                  |
-5-5---7-5---5---4^5---5---------
-----7-----7---7-----7---7-6-5---
---------------------------------

with the last note being held over for the duration of an eighth note instead
of a sixteenth.
