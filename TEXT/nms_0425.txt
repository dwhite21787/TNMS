Hi all, I've got good news and bad news.  The bad news is that I haven't
had a chance to get through all the admin mail, so some of you who tried
to unsub. may still get a copy of this.  Sorry folks, I'm going as fast as
I can!  The good news is that since I missed Wed/Thurs, today will be a
double issue again.

On to more bad news, for those EAST COAST FANS planning on going to Baltimore
Maryland for the March show.  A list member (hi Skip) called the Baltimore
Arena, and they've said THE SHOW IS CANCELLED.  (Bummer)  They apparently
aren't saying if/when it's rescheduled, but that show is OFF.  On a related
topic, another member (hi Neal) mentioned that some Spring East coast dates
have been changed, some with a change of venue.  If anyone has an up-to-date
tour list for the East coast, could you please post it?

In the "For-what-it's-worth" department, definitely count me in on an NMS
official shirt - I may take more than one.

That's all for now, still trying to find a few minutes to read admin mail;
please hang in with me.  I'll announce when it's caught up.

Well the Sac show came and went with the energy of a storm.  I have to
say that the drive was well worth it, and the 10th row seats were plenty
close.

I won't bore you with details that have already been brought up.  But I
pewrsonally feel that the stage setup, that someone earlier said they
disliked, was fantastic.  Different borders would drop around the video
screen, wether it be dice, skulls, or the moving pictures arches, it was
very very nice.

Also there are these flaps that open up on the stage to produce this red
and blue glow.  It looked great!

I have to say that the energy and power of this show, in my mind blows
Presto away.  I have never seen Geddy so active, running around and
jumping and just having fun!  I have not even seen that much action on
older concert videos.

And of course Alex was the clown he is, playing on his back, chasing
geddy around the stage!

Out of 5 stars this show get's five if not more.

I don't understand what the negative reviews of the show were all aboput
at the beginning of the tour.  I guess the boys had to get into the roll
of things, well they are on a roll now.  I have to agree with the user
that said this is the best he has ever seen them, (and this guy has been
to concerts since signals)!

Well, lookin forward to Oakland!  Any NMSers that see this in time, check
out row K seat 6 section 2, ane we can chat!

Subject: finger lakes / tour book sale

hello all. I have a piece of unconfirmed information that I am almost sure
will be soon pronounced fact. Rush will be stopping by the Finger Lakes area
in June or July on their outdoor venue jaunt (Finger Lakes performing arts
center, I presume). This is simply stellar news for all New Yorker's, myself
included; an outdoor Rush show must be one to tell the grandchildren about.
Is anyone by any chance familiar with the performing arts center in the finger
lakes area, which is where i am guessing they will perform? (my source only
had this city (no others), and no definite venue to speak of). how many seats
are in this venue- is it new or old- is it majestic or dive-like? Any related
info would be appreciated- I have no doubts that my source will be right on 
thisone, but I hope this early info won't dash anyones spirits too much if this
falls through.

also, i have extra copies of the Power Windows, Signals, P/G, and Hold Your
Fire tour programs (mint condition). If anyone is interested, feel free to
mail me.    thanx.

Subject: Ok...My Turn!

Now that most every NMSer who saw the Las Cruces show has spoken, I thought
I'd add my $0.02 (& not repeat anything!) to the cause!!

First - it was really great meeting all you fellow NMS subscribers (Ian,
Dan (& Rich), & Elise) & being able to talk about Rush for 6 hrs straight
on the way over to the show!! I can verify Elise's brush with fame - I saw
the autographs! Wowo! I wish we woulda known that you guys from Colorado
were there too - we coulda had a pretty big NMS get-together... Cool deal
on y'all meeting the boys in the bar afterwards! Maybe everyone from the
ol' Southwest can get together for the Phoenix show....

Second - the concert itself was fabulous! I think Dan & Elise managed to
cover all the details, so I won't go into it...besides, I didn't say
SPOILER anywhere up above!  ;-)  All I have is a few adjective-type things
to contribute: power, loud, rockin', the essence of bass-ness throughout,
guitar-fabulousness on WMT?, may-we-all-bow- to-Neil-after-the-solo kinda
action, & it all seemed like a dream.... albeit, one of the best I've ever
had!!

Third - I'd like to thank all of you people who saw the earlier shows,
posted about them, & were kind enough to say "SPOILER" all over the place.
It was incredibly hard to hit &lt;return&gt; through 2+ months of NMSs while only
peeking out of the corner of one eye to find the other messages. I saved
'em all to read after the show & it was really neat to see what they did on
the 1st leg & read about all the funny bits - most of which were repeated
at this show! (btw - hey, Dan - they did play GoaC on the 1st leg of the
tour...)  Thanks again, people!!!

Waitin' for RUSH to rock the west-ish side of the desert,

Pat

I am very interested in hearing what people have to say about Priums out on the
West Coast. Do people like them or what?  How is the general public's response
been to this talented trio?
Do the fans think this is a good opening act for the boyz?

Love to hear some opinions.

Subject: RUSH cover band

   I just recently saw a flyer for a RUSH cover band called Subdivisions.
They will be playing Clark University here in Worcester, Ma on Feb 7.
Anyway, my question is this- Are they any good? Do they do the Boyz
justice? I will probably go to see them no matter what but I just want to
know what to expect.  For any body interested they will also be playing at
the L.I.E. Club in Birmingham NY on Jan 31(9:00pm), Grovers in Beverly, Ma
(9:00pm) and at S.R.O. Cafe in Staten Is.,NY(10
whoops ----- (10:30pm)

 Just thought I would mention- I saw them in Worcester on Dec 10.  THEY WERE
GREATTTTTTTT!!!!!!!  I had front row seats(couldn't really see Neil though
because Alex's monitor was in the way) I think this album is by far one of
their best(only my opinion). I like the direction they are headed in musically.

Another question- can anybody in the Mass-RI area tell me where I can pick
up RUSH cd bootlegs. I am particularly interested in places in the
Worcester area or Southeastern Mass area although any answers to my
question would be appreciated. My e-mail address is murpup@wpi.wpi.edu

PS I AM PSYCHED!!! I CAUGHT ALEX'S PICK AT THE CONCERT. THE ONLY ONE
THROWN THE ENTIRE NIGHT!!!

[ about the NMS T-shirt idea ]

Cheryl&gt; The best brainstorm I've had so far is to have the shirt look
Cheryl&gt; like the front of one of those National Enquirer/Star etc. rags and
Cheryl&gt; instead of Liz and Dolly and JFK and Ellllvis we can have Geddy and
Cheryl&gt; Alex and Neil and Ellll--er, um, I mean...well, you get the picture.
Cheryl&gt; Make up some good juicy headlines and we're all set.

Sounds good, you could invent some juicy headlines like "Mr. Peart
Confesses: I Have Cancer", "Red Barchetta Owner Breaks 42 Motor Laws
At Once" and stuff like that :-)

Might be a good idea to have a "newspaper page" on the back, too.

[ Maybe we could put "Truman Defeats Dewey" on it?  :-)          :rush-mgr ]

He lives in Biloxi, MI, a six hour drive from Shreveport, and so his local

        96.9 FM out here in Utica NY held a Superbowl of rock 'n roll too.
After all the playoffs, it came down to Eric Clapton and Rush.  Although

Stupid question. I got what I think are either really _good_ seats
or reeeeally _bad_ seats depending on the stage set-up. For the
Miami show, they've sold the seats behind the stage, not just around
the sides. I mean BEHIND the stage. I've got 1st row to the right
and a bit behind.

Problem is, I've never seen em set-up such a stage at the Miami
Arena, and was wondering if any other concerts were set-up like this
with folks getting the rear-end view?

I have had a couple of server request bounced back to me.  It appears
that the hacked version of ELM that I am using is having problems
forming return addresses for certain people.  This results in the user
not receiving any response back from the server.  The HELP file
contains instructions for getting around this, and I wish to restate
them here for all to notice.

The best solution is to provide an address that the server will use
irregardless of the From_ or From: lines.  This is accomplished one of
two ways.  A Reply-To: line in your header or in the body of your
message.

A domain style (user@site.domain) is best to use.  If you wish to
experiment, send request for HELP, as that is a relatively small file.
FYI, the server is running under SystemV on an Intergraph workstation.
The software is a hacked version of ELM 2.3 and SENDMAIL is running.

As always, your questions and comments would be most appreciated.

Hello, all

Does anyone have any guesses as to how many more LP's Rush will release in
the future?  I hope they're still around for awhile.

&gt; Yeah 'BCN!!!  They've been playing "Ghost" like the new hit single of the 
year.

yea, it's great, isn't it? And most of the other stations have been
picking up on it too!

Hi, just wondering if anyone has any concert footage of Rush in there
collections... if you do, would you mind sending me mail, cause I'd love to get
my hands on some. Could you also tell me what tour the footage is from?

Thanx.

I know that someone posts this everyday and I'm sorry.
But I want a bootleg of the RTB show....bad!!!

If anyone has one of either of the
Cleveland shows, that would be prime, but please, anyone
who has a good copy please email me!!!!!!
Of course, I'll pay the expenses plus a little trouble $$$$.

Thanks...Nick.

Subject: Request magazine
From: tiverson@lynx.northeastern.edu!

	Ah, yes, Request...what a wonderful magazine.
	Sad as I am to say it, I work part-time for Sam Goody, part of the
Musicland Group, which puts out Request.  We have to force this piece of
garbage on everyone who buys something, so the dissemination of anti-Rush
attitudes among the unititiated is sadly widespread. (sigh)
	The worst thing is--Request is just a sad attempt by Musicland to
copy Tower Record's in-store mag, Pulse.  You will be happy to know, however,
that the Rush review garnered many, many protest letters to the mag, and the
editor who wrote the review is under fire for that and another really silly
article he wrote about the "most overrated artists" (fr'instance, Clapton,
The Doors, etc.--basically anyone college radio doesn't play).  I'm sure
the "Rush fans are the worst" attitude came about because of the reponse to
the RTB review, but who knows?  Who cares?  My advice:  _don't_ accept it
when you're offered it, or better yet--take 10.  Less circulation.  ;-)
	To those of you who seemed perplexed by my posting earlier about "Not
Fade Away" being the best song Rush has ever done, etc., I hope you all
realized that is was sarcasm.  Feel free to email me if you still don't get
it.

Subject: Polls, polls, pot

I wonder how that Sean person has such a strong interest in his
poll. I mean, he's been sending remainders about it for almost
every TNMS for the past few weeks. It's getting a bit boring,
I tell ya! I think that the people who want to take part in
such a poll definitely have noticed its existence already and
therefore have voted.

I don't like polls in general at all (but that doesn't mean
that I would want to forbid them. I'm just getting a bit
bored..). Statistics are like bikinis, they show a lot but
hide the important stuff. :-)

By the way, about A Passage To Bangkok. Is Bangkok some sort
of a hashis center of the east? I mean, the song is about
smoking pot but I don't know why did they choose to go to
Bangkok. Goa would have been a lot better choice IMO. ;-)

[ Umm, isn't Bangkok in THAIland?  (Is it still Thailand?)  Back in the
  70's, Thai Stick was the Best you could get, period.  Better than hash,
  Panama Red, Columbian Gold, etc.  Uhh, from what I was *told*, of
  course.  ;-)                                                   :rush-mgr ]

Subject:  CD Bootlegs...

Hi folx...

      Some people in the past have asked about RUSH CD bootlegs. I'll
once again share what I know about them. Others may claim otherwise but
here's what I know...

TEMPLE OF SYRINX                         As far as I'm concerned, all four
LIFE UNDER PRESSURE                      of these CD's are copies of the
CURRENTLY EN VOGUE                       GRACE UNDER PRESSURE tour video,
ENEMIES WITHIN AND BEYOND                with slight variations and edits.
                                         Each package has different dates
                                         and titles, but the recording is
                                         definately the same.

RUSHIAN ROULETTE                         1979 Pinktop Festival. Previously
                                         available on LP. Decent quality.

RED STARS OF SOLAR FEDERATION            Poor quality direct copy of the
                                         EXIT...STAGE LEFT video, with
                                         soundbites interspersed between
                                         songs.

        I've purchased these at about $30 or so a piece here in NYC. If
anyone is interested, I'll be willing to sell my copies of these for about
$25 (I'll ever cover S&H). If you're interested, contact me at one of the
address below. Oh, and if anyone is intersted, I also have a PROMO only
copy of "Where's My Thing?" single for $6. Its sort of a picture disc (I
guess) as it has the skeleton, like on the RTB CD, printed in bone white
on the front. Well, thats all for now...
