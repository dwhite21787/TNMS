Subject:      Uncommon CDs II

   After reading the interjection from the manager yesterday as to my proposal
of a survey on various "uncommon" CDs I thought it worthy to note that I have
in fact read this compilation that Meg so generously sent me.  However, it
doesn't contain listings for all the CDs on the list, nor probably, all the
"uncommon" CDs available.  I also thought that perhaps a wider variety of
opinions and a more numerical scale may be useful.  Plus as we're all Rush
fans we could maybe even rate them according to our view on overall likability.
Oh well, just an idea I thought I'd put forth.  The greater the number the
responses the better we could evaluate these albums for everyone else.
Thanks again for the time.

Subject: HUGH SYME TURNS UP WHERE?

Trivial Observation of the Day: I saw a band called ME PHI ME on Letterman
a couple of nights ago, and I liked their music: a blend of acoustic
guitars/rap/actual singing, etc. It sounds strange, but I thought it was
pretty good. Well, I saw the album in the local shop, and bought it. The
artwork was pretty cool, and lo and behold, Hugh Syme was responsible for
the design! Incidentally, the lyrics are very much in the individualistic
mode of Rush music. It is an interesting change of pace--recommended!

Subject: Profits and "Angel Rat"

Hi kids,

  First of all, if profits for the "you-know-what" were to be made, maybe
a good ideas would be to donate the big money to AIDS research just as
Rush did in the not so distant past.  It's a lot easier than hunting out
their favorite charities and it's also something that we all know that
they believe in.

  I just flipped through the FAQ and saw the answers to outside projects
by Geddy, Alex, and Neil.  It's listed that VoiVod's album _Angel Rat_ wa
produced by Geddy Lee.  I recently went to the local record store to check
out this album and found that it's NOT Geddy, it's Terry Brown.  I didn't
buy the album and there may be reference to Geddy on the inside liner
notes, but the outside of the package clearly says "Produced by Terry Brown."

    [ Be sure and let Dan Delany - our keeper of the FAQL know! :rush-mgr ]

  A friend of mine in my Rock Lyrics Philosophy class mentioned something
interesting to me today.  He said that there is a remake of a movie
entitled _Metropolis_ and that it's soundtrack is all rock and includes
Rush.  Can anyone confirm it?  I haven't made a run to Blockbuster yet in
order to try and hunt down the flick.  I just wanted to see if anyone on
the NMS had heard this.

Someone said (sorry, I lost who):

&gt;Also, has anyone really looked closely at the photo on the inside of the RTB
&gt;CD?  It looks at first like an elephant's tail, but is it really?  Look
&gt;closely, you'll see what I mean.  And--- in the liner notes, it says:
&gt;
		"Brought to you by the letter 'b'".
&gt;
&gt;To me, the "b" might stand for Bones, but what do you think?

Why are you staring at a photo of the business end of an elephant? :)
The only other thing I can think of is maybe a blowup of a hair follicle??

The letter "b" stands for Butt.

Also, the Rush/Zep hybrid songs were ridiculus.  I loved 'em!  How about these:

Babe, I'm gonna leave you face up        Your time is gonna stand still
The spirit of custard pie                Trampled under the wheels

Subject: RUSH cover band

Hello, fello RUSHians.  This is my first post, but it will be brief.  I wanted
to tell you about a great RUSH cover band that was mentioned once before.
They are called Power Windows and they play in the New York and New Jersey
areas.  They are incredible, sounding almost exactly like the real band, and I
highly recommend going to see them if you live in the area.  I have seen them
a number of times, and every time they get better.

Here is a list of up coming dates:

Date        Club                City                Telephone

Thu 2/4     Rock N Roll Cafe    New York City       212-677-7630
Fri 2/19    Low Down            Mt. Vernon, NY      914-667-5422
Sat 2/27    Lips                Farmingdale, NY     516-731-9540
Sun 2/28    Rock the House      Wallington, NJ      201-916-1677

There are no times given, so you have to call the club to verify the date,
time and any cover charges.

They aren't the real thing, but until the real RUSH comes around again, they
should satify every RUSH craving that you experience.

P.S. BTW, Dream Theater is an awesome band as well.  Not the most complicated
of music, but nonetheless, very good.

Subject: re:VICEMAN

Hey
Well, vice, I saw your letter and had to reply. I was thinking about what
you were saying about the slowed down bootleg you had. That made me think
of how ESL is slowed down, both the CD and the video, especially Xanadu.
Then I thought about the current conversation about X on AFTK; about it
being tuned up slightly. I play guitar, and in my jam sessions w/AFTK,
I've also noticed this. What's this mystery surrounding Xanadu?? Could it
be possible that maybe they had a tough time recording up to speed, so did
it slower and THEN laid the vocal tracks?? Ged didn't have to sing while
he played bass, in fact, he rarely did.(Look at the video for limelight)
This would account for no real change in Ged's voice. If this is true, it
would also explain the slow version on ESL. It doesn't make sense to
retune up about 1/4 of a step for one song, and then tune back down to
A=440 for the rest of the album, cuz AFTK and Closer are standard tuned.
Hmmm. Well, it's something to think about. I've often wondered about this.
One more thing. There was a comment last week about a quick bit of noise
in one of the last choruses of Enemy W/In. Could this be one of Ged's
many pops during the song. He was using quite a bit of punchy midrange,
and snappin and poppin all over the place? Oh well, just a thought. Hey, I
like the "Gangster of Boots" title and the song list. Anybody know
possible when and how much this will be??? Later-

Subject: Fav solos

Hi
I'm sure this has been brought up before I arrived, but I'm interested in
hearing people's favorite solos. I was watching ASOH video admiring the
unique style of Alex's playing. I've been playing guitar myself for about
5 years, and been analyzing his style since my first year. It seems that I
still find his solos interesting. It must be the use of unusual
chord shapes within the solos. So... I'd like to hear some feedback about
his style and fav solos.

Top 10 solos:
Spirit of Radio
Mission (outro solo on ASOH video)
Red Sector A
Limelight
Xanadu
Kid Gloves
The Weapon
The Trees
The Necromancer (Part III, Return of the Prince)
YYZ

Subject: Backing up a good point

Chris (in NMS#603) has an interesting point, about a certain CD. It
certainly does appear that Rush would *really* not like us to do this. And
of course with copyrighted material on it (as I understand), it 'has the
dubious nature'. I was all for this CD, but Chris' post convinced me otherwise.
It certainly seems that lots of people are for the idea - I mean, *I'd* like
this thing, but I think we need to reconsider.

Remember, talking about it is not a problem, so we can step down. If it gets
produced, we are - to say the least - in a difficult situation.

Subject:      Hey! That sounds like Rush

Someone was mentioning similarities between Rush and Led Zep the other day:
How about these:

The Return of the King (COS) sounds just like Teenage Wasteland by The Who

The beginning of Sweet Child of Mine by GNR is a blatant rip - off of Alex's
intro guitar riff in Xanadu. (especially how the bass and drums come in during
the riff)

The beginning of Beneath, Between, and Behind always sounded like AC/DC to me
but I can't think of a specific song.

I also agree that the beginning of Fountain of Lamneth (after the vocals) is
similar to the end of Zep's That's the Way.

Thats all I can think of right know.

By the way, on WHCN (Hartford) yesterday, Jim Koplik, an area concert promoter
said that Rush was currently writing but not yet recording.  (Maybe in a
Seattle farmhouse somewhere?)

Subject:    Boot the Boot!

My $0.05 (it's OK, I can just about afford it!) regarding 'Gangster of Boots':

I agree wholeheartedly with Chris Michael's comments regarding the legality
and ethics of producing this CD. I don't WANT to be a wet blanket, as I
would enjoy the end product immensely, but we must consider our possible
actions very carefully. May I suggest (as a way of offering ourselves some
protection), that all discussion regarding 'Gangster of Boots' (GREAT name!)
is taken off the NMS in future? I also think that the name would have to be 
changed as it has been bandied about far too much already on the net, so it 
would be easily traceable.

Another point; Dominic Binks (just down the M4 from me in Bristol!) had a
wonderful suggestion. Rush should be asked. Admittedly if they said no we'd be
buggered, but if we suggested that they were sold at cost price, or with a
charity markup they may be more amenable. It's got to be worth a go. If you
like, I could organise contacting Anthem. Just a thought anyway.

Dan Zivijinovich Ross, I would love copies of the first single. Get in touch,
OK? I have a few Rush things I could trade.

Finally, a belated apology to Anna Matyas for my Dire Straits criticism some
time ago. It was purely my own opinion, and I didn't intend to upset anybody.
Sorry!

Subject: Force Ten origin

Hey there...

Though it may be possible that Force Ten was named because the band was
forced to put a tenth song on the album, I have a different explanation
for the title of the song.  I believe that the title is a reference to
"force ten" on the Beaufort scale, which was developed by Admiral
Beaufort of the British Navy in the nineteenth century.  The Beaufort
scale can be used for estimating wind speed based on observations in
nature, rather than using instruments.

"Force ten" is the *storm* category (sometimes called *whole gale*) with
estimated wind speeds of 55-63 mph.  Observationally, force ten is
seldom observed inland, and is characterized by uprooted trees and
considerable structural damage.

It should be noted that the Beaufort scale ranges from "force zero"
(calm winds) to "force twelve" (hurricane winds).

This explanation would be appropriate to the song "Force Ten" since
several references are made to storms in the lyrics, i.e., "Look in
to the eye of the storm; look out for the force without form; look
around at the sight and sound; look in, look out, look around."

Until later...

Hello all,

Not to beat a dead and long decayed horse, but. . . If anyone read yesterday's
_New_York_Times_, (26, January, 1993) there was an article about computer cops
patroling cyberspace.  The article made specific reference to internet and
posting boards.  Now, granted, the article mostly mentioned "serious"
infractions; like credit card fraud, stealing AT&T long distance service, and
distribution of child pornography.  However, I think it is a safe assumption
that if anyone is interested, they can track our efforts to produce a boot.
The key phrase is "if they are interested".  In any case, I'm cautiously for the
CD, but I urge disgression by all involved.  I also think that adding on a few
extra $$ and donating all proceeds to Rush's favorite charity is the way to go.

Subject: revenue?  what revenue?

OK...thoughts on the pending "collection" of songs...

Keep the price low.  Lower price means more people will be able to buy it
(duh).  And no adding on extra money.  First, as someone else has already
said, the band doesn't need the money.  Second, maybe they have hangups abt
having their charities accepting "ill-gotten gains."  Third, maybe some
potential buyers (this one included) aren't interested in the above idea.
For example, I like U2, but all this Amnesty Intl / Greenpeace stuff they
bombard the listener with is IMO annoying.  The whole 'musicians & their
causes' thing is irritating (Can you say Sinead O'Connor?).  Nobody who bought
Achtung Baby did so because U2 wants Windscale shut (OK, maybe two people in
Cambridge, MA did).  Yes, the money I have spent on ~ 15 Rush albums / CDs
and 5 shows (plus T-shirts) indirectly might go to something, but that's the
band's choice.  Once I buy that $80 T-shirt, it's not my money anymore.  But
while it is, no "surcharges" please.
OK, down from the soapbox.

From: "Musmanno Joe "
Subject: boot hysteria

I've been following the to-boot-or-not-to-boot thread and I'm here to back up
the opinions so eloquently put forth by Chris Michael.  Due to mail problems,
I only receive about every other issue of TNMS, and I sometimes get them late,
so please forgive me if I'm redundant with anyone or posting something after
someone has said, "please post no more on this subject."

I do not believe that donating proceeds to Rush or to some charity in any way
justifies the act of producing a boot.  Even worse, the argument that, "we love
Rush, and we want more material, and since they won't give it to us, it is
our *right* to take it" carries any cogency at all.  OK, we do love Rush, and
we go out of our way to collect material, perhaps even to the point of paying
money for illegal recordings.  But the mere fact that we want it doesn't mean it
is OK for us to get it without consideration of the consequences.

Someone recently posted an article claiming, "If Rush is so against bootlegs,
they would have released more live albums, at least one for every other tour.
Since they haven't, fans have the right to aquire bootlegs, as long as it isn't
done for profit.  (The CD *isn't* for profit)"

This is utterly rediculous.  First of all, the idea that if Rush--or *any*
band--is against bootlegs they would release more live albums simply cannot
be reconciled.  Simply because someone won't give you something doesn't mean
you are justified in stealing it.  That Rush has only released three live
albums worldwide has no bearing on the legality or *morality* of bootlegging.
Secondly, the profit only matters to the legal people.  If it's not done for
profit, it's no less illegal, but there's little point in litigating.  So, OK,
if sued you're not likely to lose much.  This does not change the issue in the
slightest.

Nor does the 'Robin Hood' notion really justify it.  You may see yourselves
as starving for more Rush music, and anyone who delivers it to you is viewed
as a savior.  But remember always, that Robin Hood was a theif.  According to
legend, he stole from a tyrannous sherrif and gave to the people.  We all have
our own opinions about that.  But you are not talking about stealing from a
tyrannous sherrif.  You are talking about stealing from Rush.

I do not know for fact, but I strongly believe that Rush abhors the notion of
a Robin Hood, anyway.  They give to charity because they *want* to, and would
probably fight tooth-and-nail against someone *stealing* from them to give to
charity--even if it is the same charity they would volunteer gifts to.

I apologize if this sounds like a flame.  I truly do not intend it to.  Rather,
I intend this to serve as a reminder:  keep your actions in perspective.  Do
not fool yourselves into thinking that Rush would approve of this action at
all.  Indeed, many Rush *fans* do not even approve.  Sure, my curiosity kills
me.  I would LOVE to hear all these recordings.  But I don't usually buy
bootlegs.  Instead, I spend my money on tickets to Rush shows.  It's not as
convenient as a boot that I can play in my car anytime I want, but it is
something that both I and The Boyz can endorse.

Consider:  there has been a great deal of discussion as to whether _The
Gangster of Boots_ is a good title and what should go on the cover of a
"Rush fan's Rush boot."  But think about it, whom are you trying to impress?
Certainly not The Boyz, given all the trouble they go to to have "No cameras
or recording devices" printed on each and every concert ticket.

Perhaps a better way to direct this energy is to beg and plead with Anthem
Entertainment Group to release some of this stuff.  I admit it's unlikely
and not as easy as making your own boot.  But when you are deciding whether
this is a good idea or not, perhaps you might consider what The Boyz would
say if they were talking with you about it.  In the End, isn't it better to
think that Whatever You're Doing, they would smile and quietly thank you for
it?  Or would you rather they be angry with you?  Personally, I would think
that if Neil came to my house and saw all my albums, posters, ticket stubs,
t-shirts, and broken drumsticks, he'd be flattered.  But if he saw that I was
organizing a collection of bootleg material for distribution, he'd be more
than a little dismayed.

Thanks for the Time and Trouble...

Subject: I just keep bumping into them

          Ok, so I'm just cruising around downtown, minding my own,
          when I bump into Geddy and Alex again (Neil is keeping
          himself intact behind barriers, as usual).  So, I run this
          CD thing by them.  They respond, "1500 fans, huh? A
          newsletter devoted entirely to us?  Well, gosh-dang, I bet
          we've sold about 7,000 t-shirts, 6,000 tour books, 20,000
          albums/tapes/CDs, 5,000 posters, and 7,000
          pins/bandannas/and other misc crap to them alone.  And we
          mark all that stuff up about 487%.  So whats a little
          non-profit bootleg. And so what if we sound like shit on
          some of these recordings; these people would buy a recording
          of us tapping forks on our dinner china."  Then we parted as
          Geddy crow-hopped down the street while shrieking "Thank
          you, and good night."

          I think there is a Rush song lyric that can some up this and
          some of the recent posts on the NMS regarding the CD idea:

          "We see what we want to see"
