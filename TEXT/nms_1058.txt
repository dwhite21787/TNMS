Subject: NEW ALBUM!

here's what i heard:
TORONTO (Anthem-net) - Local rock icons Rush have recently completed
recording of their 16th and final studio album, their 20th overall.  The
album, titled _All's Well..._, to be released March 28 in CD format only,
will consist of a single 64 minute song.  Returning to their more
progressive style of the late '70's, this song will have numerous lengthy
self-indulgent instrumental breaks, and a common lyrical theme based on
the concepts of mortality, old age, retirement, and denture care.
Because of the strenuous nature of the material written for this album,
and the increasing age of the members of the band, former guitarist
extraordinaire of Loverboy, Paul Dean, was brought in to assist with some
overdubs, and likely will tour with the band on their "Sort of Semi-Tour
of Western New York and Southern Ontario Because We're Too Old To Go Any
Farther."  The three-city tour is expected to be of special interest to
older fans, and will include a half-hour intermission during which all
members of the audience will receive a complimentary dose of Geritol.
With them on tour will be an entourage of video and audio recording
equipment, which will result in a double live CD and accompanying video,
to be released in mid '96, titled _...That Ends Well_.  The tour is being
sponsered by the AARP, and Depends.

Subject: new to NMS

Hello,

Well I have been reading the NMS for a month or so and figured I would
say hi.  Jim Robinson is my name and have been a Rush fan for 14 years.
I owe my intro to Rush to a great old friend who was a monster drummer
as early as 13 yrs old, his name Cary Stern.  Both in our sophmore year
of high school, fall 1981 and returning from a marching band competition when
I heard some of the greatest sounding music coming from the very back of
the bus.  2112 was blasting.  I turned off my antique headphones, they
had been playing my other but then only favorite band, Kansas, and found
out who it was.  Glad it happened.

I just wanted to thank Norman Birtley ( TNMS #1056) for his blast of
JAmbrose from Rutgers and JA 's rediculous comments (TNMS # 1055).

Lastly, if you folks out there like Dream Theatre then I suggest you
check out Fates Warning you will not be dissapointed.

Thanks for  letting me babble a bit.
Peace,
Jim R.

Heh, I remember that.  It was really quite funny.  As a matter of fact,
if memory serves, there was also an "article" about the boys taking a
LONG breather (read: several years).  I almost shit my pants before I
realized that it was April Fool's.
	Speaking of that issue, at the time I was reading a.m.r., and
somebody was getting into a heavy argument about the Merely Players
joke.  One guy was saying "Oh yeah, well I got this info from TNMS, so
there!"  It was very funny to finally clue him in.  Of course, was he
gracious about losing?  Hell no!  He got pissed.  Oh well.

Hello fellow TNMSers! This is my first posting, so go easy on me will ya'.

The first thing I have to say is that I agree with Tony Romano's posting
in TNMS #1056. ASOH is  definitely a good "chronicles of Rush's stuff
done primarily in the last 15 years. I particularly enjoy the last 4
songs on the first side (Marathon, Turn the Page, Manhattan Project, and
Mission) My tape is really worn out there, I'm going to need a new CD
copy soon so it won't wear out!

To continue the You Know... segment (YKYARFW):

YKYARFW you look at  posters for fraternities that say "RUSH YYZ" (yes,
that is a joke, no flames please) and immediately think Rush is playing
your college!

Just thought I'd put my t$0.02 in!

You might be interested to know that CD-V's hold a maximum of five minutes

some editing to get it on there.  So sorry, it won't be uncut.

Where was the CD-V pressed?  If it was either Discovery Systems or PDO UK,
you've got a dying disc (due to crap pressing standards) on your hands.
PDO UK does repressings if they still have the parts, but I don't know if
Discovery Systems is even still around.

Subject: Other Rush Pages

Far be from me to follow the crowd, but this is my first posting to TNMS.
So, to join in the trend, here's my story of how I finally saw the light. A
friend of mine in 8th grade kept playing this strange song with this really
neat synthesizer bit in it. Well, once I liked Tom Sawyer, I started
listening to the rest of MP and that was that. Another convert.

One thing I must say to all of you "dinosaurs" out there. As a person who
found Rush in the MP era, I feel that I was luckier than thee. Hearing what
they did in the MP days, it certainly gave a great feel for their
intellectual growth, and in 8th grade, learning about intellectual growth
was very important to me. Therefore, it gave an extra spice to someone
listening to AFTK or CoS the first time. I am curious for responses as to
when someone first noticed Rush affected their appreciation.

BTW, I did notice in one of the last NMS that someone mentioned another Rush
page. I have found a couple at:

http://ewi.ewi.org/~rroberts/pg/home.html and
http://american.recordings.com/cgi-bin/ubl?card+1039

Please forgive me if these are already public knowledge and I'm being
redundant, well then please forgive me. :)

Also, since it seems that speaking of other bands is not forbidden, I
thought I'd mention one. I've introduced King's-X to several other friends
of mine that are Rush fans and they have all loved them as well. Check out
"Gretchen Goes to Nebraska", I doubt that many of you will be disappointed.

Anyway, my turn to apologize for length.

Later, Rob

Subject: Rush on T.V.

Hello all,

	I hope you all read my "Prodigy" message.  Anyway, I've seen some posts
about Rush songs on T.V. (other than pitiful M.T.V.)

	The first time I heard them was a very cool moment in my
life.  I am a huge baseball fan (a la Geddy).  I was sitting watching a
baseball game last May with my then girlfriend.  As they went to commercial
after the end of an inning I heard in the background LTTA!  I flipped!  I
couldn't believe it - Rush and baseball at the same time!  Does life get any
better?

	The second, and last, time I heard them was sometime around
Thanksgiving this past year.  There was a cheesy special about celebrity's
hobbies.  Craig T. Nelson was this day's guest.  He is a racecar driver on the
side.  ...and what did I hear?  None other than Red Barchetta.  Again, I
flipped.

	We Rush fans are a bit whacked - but it's fun, isn't it?

>...you know you're a Rush fan when...
                 you go to record stores you sort all the Rush chronologically.

	...as of 2/27 we'll know what the deal with the next album is!

Subject: My Reactions....

	Fellow Rushians-

I just was reacting to a few things from the last post.  First, for Doug
on those Passage to Bangkok lyrics, it says in the bible(Visions) "Side
Two opens with 'APTB', a song about a fantasy journey to the finest
marijuana fields in the world and obviously the work of a T-H-C
connoisseur" Just wanted to clarify.
Also, I agree with the guy(sorry, forgot the name) who thinks some more
meanigful topics are in order.  I mean, what color Neil wears when the
moon is full is not of any true interest.
I think the bumper stickers could be great, I think incorporating the NMS
name or some logo would also be cool.
I am going to flame somewhat.  I felt Rush was insulted by Kasee(I think)
about similarities to Sara Maclaughlin, Tori Amos and Concrete Blonde.
First, Rush has musical talent, second they are true musicians, they
write cool songs, and don't have to cover Nirvana like Tori Amos to be
good, besides they are the boys are are the best band to ever be created,
we should are br grateful, If I hear Tori Amos in twenty years, I think I
will cry.  Flame me back personally on this one, we don't need a debate
on the list over this(wimps vs. Rush)

Hi All

This is my first posting, a Lurker moving out of the shadows! Well this morning
I happen to read a Kerrang (An English Rock Magazine) in the local newsagents
and discovered an interview with Neil.

Neil was answering questions about a new album which will include live material
and some reworked older studio stuff. He also went on to say that there maybe
a few USA concerts as well, which would be recorded for the new album.

If the report is to be believed then RUSH will be putting out a live/studio
album sometime in the coming year.

So does anyone in the USA know anymore about this? I'll transcribe the
interview for all to read and post it in the next couple of days.....

     I really got a kick out of Amy's posting, so I thought I'd add some
     of my own.

     "YOU KNOW YOU'RE A RUSH FAN WHEN..."

     -  You wish Geddy could still sing the high-octave scale near the
     beginning of 2112 Overture.

     -  You imitate the roaring crowd in The Spirit of Radio when Geddy
     says "Concert Hall!"

     -  You pretend to crack the "whip" in YYZ

     -  You can sing all the "lyrics" to La Villa Strangiato

     -  You've played By-Tor and the Snow Dog on high speed ("78" if you
     remember record players) to figure out what the low, growly sounds
     were saying.

     -  You wish the Hemispheres album was longer.

     -  You heard Lakeside Park and HAD to know what Canadian holiday was
     the 24th of May.

     -  You mistakenly got excited every time an ad for the movie "RUSH"
     came on TV.

     -  You can name all the "other" songs on 2112--and you LIKE them all!

     -  You can list every Rush song according to how high Geddy sings
     (or screams) on them.

     Keep it up!

Hey,
    I'm working as a counselor in a Middle and High School.  I've

Subject: psychodots/Barenaked Ladies

Greetings, fellow Rush fanatics!  This is my first posting to the list so
please be gentle.
A couple of days ago, someone posted about a band called the
psychodots.  As an official member of the psychodots fan club, I thought
perhaps I could pass along some additional info on the band.
The boys are based out of Cincinnati, OH and play shows locally on a
frequent basis.  They are also infrequently out of the Cincy area, so
check your local club listings.  They have two albums out on the
independent Strugglebaby label, so they may be slightly difficult to find
but definitely worth seeking out.  They're a great live band: I saw them
last summer with Adrian Belew at Bogart's in Cincy.  A better show in
recent memory I cannot recall (apart from the Barenaked Ladies a few
months later).  I also caught the band a couple weeks ago in Dayton, OH;
I was not disappointed.
Also available from the psychodots is an excellent EP titled _Blotter_.
It functions as a mini-best of, featuring five tracks from the first two
records as well as the superb and hilarious exclusive track, "Moaner".
It serves as a great introduction to the band, whom I would liken more to
a progressive or power pop band than our heroes, Rush.  If you have
trouble finding this in your local record shop, you can get it directly
from Strugglebaby for the nominal fee of $7 by writing to  HAL BERNARD
ENTERPRISES, PO Box 8385, Cincinnati, OH 45208.
FYI: the psychodots have existed in previous incarnations as hometown
heroes The Raisins in the late-70's/early 80's, and later with Adrian
Belew as The Bears in the mid-80's.  The Raisins album has just been made
available on CD (with bonus tracks, no less), but unfortunately I.R.S.
has seen fit to discontinue the Bears albums.
I am also a huge fan of the Barenaked Ladies.  Living in a small town in
Indiana, however, does not afford me many opportunities to see the boys
live or to seek out rare material: singles, videos, live shows, bootlegs,
et al.  If anyone on this list has any information on how to obtain these
things, please e-mail me directly.  You have my "gwatitude".  (KFM)

 - Jay Scott,
  Indiana University

P.S.  A posting from, I believe it was 2/7, concerning the Barenaked
Ladies song, "Grade 9" incorrectly credits a bit of "The Spirit Of Radio"
appearing near the end of the song.  It is in fact a bit of "Tom Sawyer"
that appears near the end (and I'm not sure Tyler couldn't have been
happier).  It this has already been amended, my apologies.

Okay, here is some totally useless and uniteresting info.:

The last issue of TNMS was #1056 and the TNMS has been a Digest for about 5
years.

1056 / 5 = 211.2

Isn't that amazing!  (I warned you not to read this.)

For those of you still reading, I have a 10" single called "RUSH 1110" on red
vinyl.  Side A has The Body Electric and side B has The Analog Kid and
Distant Early Warning.  I don't want to sell it, but I was wondering if anyone
 can tell me if it is worth "Big Money".

Subject: Jurassic Park pt IV

Well my lurking days are over.  IUve been following the NMS for about 9 months
now and much thanks to rush-mgr.  The post from Dino and a couple of the other
dinosaurs has finally brought me out of the closet (IUm 34).  I first saw  the
Boyz live Dec11 1976 at the Palladium in New York.  No such thing as a bad
seat and some of the best acoustics.  I have been a hard core fan ever since,
although a 4 year tour of duty(IUm in the U.S. Coast Guard) in Wilmington, NC
kind of cut me off from what was going on with TrealU music.  DonUt get me
wrong, I loved Wilmington, but top 40 stations just didnUt keep me informed
musically.  Regarding female Rush fans, I married a women who I immediately
fell for after having a totally intelligent conversation about how great a
bass player Geddy was.  Before I get flamed for the TintelligentU remark,
youUve got to realize that IUm talking about 13 years ago when if you talked
about how great Rush was, most people thought you were talking about a cheap

there are others who know what IUm talking about.  IUm getting ready to move
from D.C. to San Juan, PR for a 3 year tour.  My family and I are looking

Hey  Rush croanies.  Just had a couple thoughts for other fans.  I've
noticed some people asking about other bands to get into besides Rush.

Well I've been playing drums for about 12 years, been a DJ for the past
four and am also a music reviewer/critic.  To tell you the truth there
are to other bands outside the progressive style that deserve definite
attention.  The first is Soundgarden.  As Rush fans you'll appreciate
the honesty, depth and music wizardry these guys pull off.  Many of you
probably already know that, but I can't stress further that these guys
are extremely talented.  Check out some of Matt Cameron's playing,
you'll be impressed-Neil has already sung the praises of these guys.
The second band is TOOL.  Danny Carry has a similar style of smoothness
and complex sticking that Neil Peart is known for.  Yet these guys pull
off some amazing time changes that have even an avid Rush player
starting over.  Also these guys aren't as young and undeveloped as many
people who just caught them on the lallapalooza tour.  They play live
with digital precision and are extremely concerned with their music.
Danny Carry , the drummer is actually in his thirties and has logged
many studio hours playing  with a host of stars-even country.  Please,
check them out!  Try their last release, "UNDERTOW".  On the track. "4
degrees" and "Bottom", the last thirty seconds is classic Rush.  The
rest of the album is full with the stop-start syncopation and odd times
that all Rush fans can enjoy.  Besides that, don't be scared of Maynard
James Keenan's vocals, although dark , he has a wonderful voice that
turns oddly dissonant and the music just pulls you in.

I was recently  watching the SOH home video and hey drummers, isn't it
a bummer they cut out the last part of TRM?

anyway, try those bands.

Subject: Rush filler songs

Let me preface this message by explaining exactly the concept behind it...
I consider a song to be "filler" if it seems to just be taking up space on
the album, that it somehow doesn't seem to fit.  Now this is not to say the
song is bad; you will notice quite a few good songs on this list.  Generally,
filler songs give me the feeling that they were kinda somehow stuck on the
album at the last minute to complete the album.  You'll notice this in some of
the attached comments (and you will notice that the list is not *entirely*
serious as well)...
If you feel it necessary to flame me for this list, save your email, i'll just
delete it :)...
Although, if you have any feedback, contributions, etc, i'd love to hear your
suggestions.

List of my nominations for Rush fillers, in somewhat chronological order,
followed by possible comments I can imagine the band saying as they're writing
them.

Rush -- the whole album:
"Hey, Led Zeppelin is big, maybe we will be too if we sound just like them!"

FBN -- By-Tor and the Snow Dog
"Hmm, this song isn't long enough.  Let's add a slow Pink Floyd-ish part in
the middle."

CoS -- I Think I'm Going Bald
Neil: "I think I'm going bald!"
Geddy: "Cool, let's write a song about that!"

2112 -- the whole second side:
"Aw, crap, 2112 is only 20 minutes or so.  What do we do about the rest of
the LP?"

AFTK -- Cinderella Man
"Ok, let's let Geddy write one."
        Madrigal
"Let's write a madrigal... can anyone think of a name for it?"

Hs -- La Villa Strangiato
"Hmm, well this concept album is only 30 minutes long.  I know, let's write
an instrumental song and drag it out to about 10 minutes!"

PeW -- Different Strings
"Ok, let's write a slow song with a simple drum beat and hey, let's throw in
a random guitar solo at the end."

MP -- The Camera Eye
"Hey, let's take this four minute song and drag it out to ten minutes to
fill up the LP."

S -- Countdown
"Ok, we saw the Space Shuttle take off, let's whip out a song about it and
stick it at the end of our next album."

p/g -- Red Lenses
"Hmm, maybe someone will name an internet email digest after part of this song
someday."

PoW -- Emotion Detector
"Oops, we need another concept song."

HYF -- Open Secrets
"We really should give the listeners a break between Time Stand Still and
Second Nature."

Presto -- Everything except Show Don't Tell
"Ok, we wrote this one really cool song, now let's fill up the rest of the CD."
Alex: "No more keyboards!!!"

RTB -- Everything between Roll the Bones and Ghost of a Chance
"Hey, we can't have all our singles be right in a row on the CD!"

Cp -- The Speed of Love
"What the hell, let's throw this one on."

Note: Some songs on this list are not completely fillers -- just parts of them
seem rather "fillerish"...

In the Kerrang magazine here in the U.K. there was an interview with
Neil about their future. He said that though the band had been doing
their own stuff (Geddy has a new baby, Alex recording a guitar
symphony (!?!) and Neil with the Buddy thing) they are going to
realise a live album in autumn (or the fall as you guys say :) ) and
having a short anniversary tour in America and Canada. But the
interesting thing was that he said they might re-record some old
favourates for release. WOW, 2112 re-recorded, By-Tor rerecorded. I
cant wait!

Hello Rush Fans

	I know that this post is not Rush related, but I am at a lose as to
where to post this question. Since so many of you are really into musical
instruments and such this post is for you.
	I have a Gibson Les Paul guitar. I have been told that it is an LP 55
however in every Gibson Guitar book I have ever looked at there is no mention
of a LP 55. I have even taken the guitar to Gibson dealers and they can not
tell me what it is.
	My question is twofold. Is there such a thing as an LP 55 and if so
what are the identifing characterisits? And second is it rare and if so how
much would it be worth.

	Please send responses to me e-mail I don't want to bother the rest of
you with this non-Rush post.
	Thank you in advance for your help.

A band called thought Industry did Red Barchetta on their first demo.  i have

experimental band I have ever heard.  Very progressive(metal) in every way.
The lyrics are just long paragraphs with little coherance.  Interesting band!

Hi NMSers,

	I posted a couple of weeks looking for info about Rush posters.
I'm desperate and willing to drive just about anywhere in the NY, Mass.,
Vermont, New Hampshire area.  Or better yet, if someone knows of a mail
order place, please send me any information.  Other people have sent mail
directly to me inquiring if I had heard back, so it would be worth posting
for all to see.
	Secondly, I've always been a huge fan of Rush's live material, and
I'm sure most of the rest of you are as well.  What I've wondered about is
what live version of a song is most improved over the studio version.  This
isn't to say the studio version sucks, but for whatever reason, the live
recording is better.  Two examples that jump out at me are In the End (ATWAS)
and YYZ (ESL).  Any other suggestions?

Hi all

Here is the transcription of the interview which appeared in the Kerrang this
week.

TECHNICAL ECSTACY

BY Malcolm Dome

(Appeared in the English Magazine Kerrang No.533 Feb 18th.'95)

Canadian superstars RUSH to celebrate their anniversary with live album and gig
overload!
RUSH, the veteran Canadian Techno Metal Gods, plan to celebrate 20 years with
the same lineup by issuing a live album and re-recording some of their classic
material!
"We haven't got any plans to do what so many others have done and put out a box
set of unreleased and rare stuff, but we are considering re-doing some of our
early material," reveals ace drummer Neil Peart. "We also might well do some
celebratory shows in the US. These will probably be recorded for a live album,
although that's not certain.
Peart made his Rush recording debut on the band's second album, 'FLY BY NIGHT',
in 1975. In the ensuing two decades, the trio have been through several
dramatic shifts in image and musical direction.
"When I look back at what Rush have achieved over the past two decades, it's
really amazing," considers Peart."We never aimed to constantly evolve as
musicians and as a band, but we have always been sensitive to changes in the
musical climate".
"And we've been fortunate in that every time we've adapted our sound to stay
contemporary, our fans have more than accepted it."
That loyalty will shortly be put to the test once more. There will definitely
be an all-new Rush studio LP in the near future.
"As with everything currently going on with Rush, though, ideas for going in
the studio haven't even been discussed,"Peart admits."All three of us have been
busy on our own projects. Geddy (Lee, bass/vocals) became a father again only
recently and has been spending time with his family. Alex (Lifeson, guitar) has
been working with a musician friend of his on a guitar symphony. You know, the
sort of thing guitarists always seem to end up doing".
"And I've been busy with the 'Burning For Buddy' project!"
'Burning For Buddy', which was recently released through Atlantic, is an
all-star tribute album to the late, great Jazz drummer Buddy Rich. Peart, who
came up with the concept, co-produced the record.
" We've got people like Matt Sorum (Guns N' Roses) performing, just to show how
much influence Buddy has had on drumming per se," he explains.
"Since I got involved with it, my eyes have been opened to an entirely new
range of possibilities. And I'm sure this'll come across on future Rush
projects!"

*******************************************************************************
I hope all like this piece about the latest news, that we in the UK have got
about the bands plans. Sorry if it is all "old Hat" in the States. We are lucky
to hear anything about Rush over here!

Thanks be to the NMS and the Spirit of Rush for providing so much news!!!!

Subject: Rush the stage

	I'm a new subsciber & I just want to say that the NMS is great!  This
is the first time I've posted to this so I'll throw in my 2-cents worth
of RUSHisms (or is it 'ologies').  I've been heavily into them since
PeW & still love them today.  Like many of you I'm a musician (bass)
who got my chops jammin' to RUSH.  I remember when I first started
playing in '84 how it was an adventure trying to figure out their
tunes.  I was always amazed at their progressions & would say that
Hemispheres was the hardest to learn, they really pulled out all the
stops on that one.  Its interesting how their albums have certain keys
that are used along with a word or lyrical idea that stands out for
that particular album.  Beautiful.

	Anyway, how about some neurotic rants >
	What's humorous to me is when people say:

		 "You still like RUSH?"

	Is there even a response to this?

	Any band that has lyrics like
                      "Each ones life a novel no one else has read"
 	is untouchable.

Well, this is it. You may all know this already as I am getting behind in
my reading, but I will announce my discovery anyway.

According to ACCESS - The Rock Radio Magazine (a Canadian music
publication), Rush is "currently writing new material for a new record to
emerge sometime before the end of the year" - the tidbit in the column
indicates a studio album, not a live one, and that (as given by the
previous quotation) will be out before the end of 1995.

This information can be found in ACCESS vol. 1 #6 Feb. 1995 but I'm quite
doubtful that any of you people not located in Canada can get this.

I will send any more details I can get as they become available.

Subject: "Inside Stuff" plays Rush

Hello to all in Rush-land,

I was just watching "NBA Inside Stuff", a show hosted by Ahamad Rhashad
and someone else on NBC.  Anyways, during the last part of the show they
had a 2-3 minute highlight bit of all the big dunks during the previous
week, while "The Spirit of Radio" was used as the backgroung music.
During the song when Geddy yells "Concert Halls!", the showed a clip of
fans screaming at a NBA game.

I know this may seem trivial to a lot of you, but no one I know would
really care about this.  I had to tell someone, it's not often you seen
any Rush being played on network TV.  The last time for me was when they
did those "Counterparts" promos, before that, was the last
minute of the "Stick It Out" video on MTV at 2:00am.

Thanks,

During the end of "NBA Jam" on NBC Saturday afternoon, they played a live

basketball.

and all star game in it, but the clips were played to The Spirit of Radio!!!

Subject: Rush in KC / VH1 / Messianic Judaism

(1) To whomever posted about the allegation that Rush, while perhaps in
Kansas City, played 3 hours to make up for an ill opening act, I can
say that is not true.  I saw the show.  Rush was awesome, and did play
for a little over 2.5 hours if memory serves, but there was indeed an
opening act.
(2) I love watching THE BIG '80s on VH1, where they feature videos that
make me a little nostalgic and embarrassed about the 1980s.  Thing is,
I have never seen a RUSH video on this program.  Anyone caught Rush here?
They did, however, play SHE BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE by Thomas Dolby, which
rocked my world back in the early '80s and still rocks it.  If anyone
has such a taste, please let me know.

	Last night was my first actual sleeping dream involving the band
of our choice.  My girlfriend and I were doing some weird new scratch off
lottery game at our local grocery store and we scratced off a 561 dollar
winner.  The next thing I know I am an audience member at one of the many
talk shows on TV (I guess you can pick one, cause I don't know who it
was).  Any ways the topic was about celebrities who had paid their dues
and had to come up after lots of hard work, and were going to tell the
stories of their early days.
	The guests on the show that most concerned me were Niel Alex and Geddy
>.  Well that is probably the only reason I would dream of being in a talk
show's studio audience.  As the host was giving the audience a chance to
ask questions, I got to ask one.  I stood up and was thinking "do I call
Geddy, Geddy or Gary?"  And I don't remember what I addressed him as but
I I asked them something silly like " how did your families handle you
touring so much?"  And that was the end, funny the way dreams can screww
with your mind like that.  Hey JA catch the spirit or catch the spit!

So long,

Hey everyone!
	I just wanted to share something that happened to me last night.  Since
the beginning of the year, I have known that my R.A. loves Rush... but the
other night, when he was on rounds checking my floor... I was blasting HYF.  I
heard my doorbell.  I opened the door, and there he was with another R.A.  He
said "Hi, I'm Rob (I DO know his name), and this is Carolyn... and we just have
to (here, I thought he was going to say ".. tell you to turn that music down")
commend you on your great taste in music."  I laughed, partly because it was
funny, partly because I was embarrassed that I thought they heard me belting
out "Mission" (not a nice sound).  Anyway, maybe you had to be there...
	On a related note, if you work in a store that gets Muzak (yuck!), you
might find this interesting.  One of the managers that I work with loves Rush,
so one night, I hooked up my CD player to the Muzak system (I shut the
instrumentals off first, of course) and played Counterparts after we closed.
Working was much more enjoyable!
