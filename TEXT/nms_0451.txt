Subject: Rush & drug use
From: tiverson@lynx.northeastern.edu!

I had a coworker in high school who claimed to have smoked a joint with
Geddy after a MP show.  I never knew him to lie, so I guess I believe it.  I
would actually be _very_ surprised if all three did not use drugs at one time
or another.  There is some circumstantial evidence:
--Alex's comment about being "pretty messed up" around the time of COS.
--The obvious:  "A Passage To Bangkok".
--The era--they would have been pretty odd not to be taking drugs at that time.
--Take a look at Geddy in the ESL video.  Just a guess, but...
--As an objectivist, Neil would be very against the idea of anyone telling him
  what he could or could not put into his body.  This doesn't constitute
  proof of any kind, but it's something to consider.
I'm sure I'm missing some things, but that'll do for now.  I probably get
flamed for this, anyway.  As to the band's current position, I would imagine
a few friends having bad experiences and parenthood would affect their ideas
about drugs quite a bit.
						--Thor
PS  Maybe _not_ smoking is the reason Geddy can't sing as high anymore--he's
    not as relaxed!

Subject: Rush and Drugs

Mike Hansen asked if anyone knew about any drug abuse by the
boys in the early years.
Well, for one thing Mike, it's Geddy, not Getty!!!!!!!!

[ He might be getty if he starts hacking in Unix...  Sorry.        :rush-mgr ]

But back to your question. In the book Visions, there is a
story about one time the band was driving to a gig. This was
before they even released their first album yet, so they
were on a LONG drive. Like an 8 hour drive or something.
But this one time I guess they were so tired they had been
driving for 4 hours in the wrong direction. The book
also mentions that the car was full of pot smoke. Visions is the
official biography, so it's very accurate.

Personally, I couldn't care less.

         Well today was the day I had a chance to play Xanadu for my
Honors
British Literature class.  Well...  Here are some of the comments (note:
we didn't get to listen to it long enough to hear Geddy sing   thats
tomorrow)

   Girl who likes Chris Isaac and EMF  " Those sound like coconuts
HahahahahaHa!!!!! "

   Girl who hates Rush just because I like them  " This is where that guy
is going to start singing!!!   OOOOHHHHHH!!!"

   Guy who loves Boys to men and various pop stars  " Is that guy with
the weird voice ever going to sing"

   Rest of the Class "  HAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHA!!!!    (laughter)

     Well tomorrow is when the class can crunge at Geddy's voice.

 Everyone thought it was to long(it was only played for 5 min.)

My response was that they all had short attention spans

well...   I tried and no one liked it,  except for one girl( bless her
heart)

oh well...

any similar experiences?

Yo,

    I was listening to COS the other day, and in particular the track
"I think I'm going bald". Does anyone know what Geddy says/sings right
at the very end of this song, just as the music is fading out? I'm not
sure whether it is a real sentence, or just him saying 'lah, lah, lah'
or something like that. Anybody any ideas?

Subject:      the boyz in Tucson or Phoenix

Anyone knows if the boyz will play in Arizona this summer?
I live in northwestern Mexico, and Phoenix and Tucson are the closest
american cities. I have seen Rush live twice in Tucson, on the GUP and
PoW tours.
By the way, when they were there on the GUP tour, Geddy was hit by a flying
bottle while they were playing Distant Early Warning (I didn't do it!).
We had a "forced intermission" for about 15 minutes and they began to play
again. After the concert, Geddy was taken to a hospital, where he received
8 stitches.

Maybe that's the reason Rush hasn't been in Tucson for a long time.

Subject: Re: 03/18/92 - The National Midnight Star #449

&gt;Other Rush fans and myself have had a running discussion for some time now
&gt;about drug use and the boys.
&gt;From what I understand, they used to smoke marajuana, don't aymore.

&gt;Some of these fans have argued that the futuristic (or fantasy) settings
&gt;so prevalent in Rush's early albums was due to their drug use, while later
&gt;albums dealt with much more tangible material -- a sign that the boys were
&gt;off the dope and more "with reality".

This (and other things in the post) seem to me to show a basic ignorance
of drugs, especially marajuana.  First of all, just  because people
smoke MJ on occasion does NOT mean that they are addicted, or that it
runs their life.  As a matter of fact, most MJ users aren't addicted at
all.  It doesn't pervade every user's life, changing perceptions!  I'd
image that the reason the songs are more fantastic in earlier Rush is
that they were younger and generally more into fantasy in general.  A
lot of bands had fantastic songs.
Secondly, MJ is legal in parts of Canada (not Toronto, however).  From
what I understand, if you are caught with a small amount (just for
personal use) the police won't bother harassing you, even in Toronto.
Only in the US is everyone so anal about drugs.
Now, I'm just waiting for the search....

Howdy again...I want to make a small clarification.  To Alex and Hg, who
nicely told me what cyalume sticks are.  Thanks for the info, but I already
knew what they were.  It's my fault for phrasing my statement wrong, I
meant to wonder what the sticks themselves were, not the green stuff was
inside it.  My bust.

Oh and a reminder...anyone who'd be willing to copy a boot of the Richmond
show for a poor bootless Rush fan as myself, don't forget to email me
at the address above.  Thank you and have a swell day....( or something
to that effect.).

    You don't have to look very far. Just check out the lyric for
    Passage to Bangkok. It's about as drug influenced as a song can
    get.

&gt;about Getty (before they became a main-stream band) smoking dope on stage

    That's "Geddy" to us nitpickers out here. :)

&lt;when fans passed their joints to the front, and other such trash.  While
&lt;I don't think there is any validity to this story, I figure there might
&lt;be some truth in this somewhere.

    Well they certainly wouldn't be the first band to do such a thing,
    but it is pretty unlikely.

&lt;Well, saw Rush for the 10th time on Sunday.  Most enjoyable.  A few comments,

    I realize that it's not your fault Thor, but this shit makes me
    sick. 10 TIMES. They haven't come within 300 miles from where I
    am. There is no justice. :^)

    gonna come, I'll go see somebody else, so there!)

Oh well, the drug thread got resurrected again.

It's obvious that at the early days Rush did at least smoke marijuana.
Look at the lyric of A passage to Bangkok - it's all about smoking
marijuana. And so what? Jazz musicians often used marijuana even in
concerts 'cos it inspired them a lot. Smoking marijuana is a lot less
hazardous to your health than smoking tobacco (and if anyone wants to
discuss this matter, please do it via email - this is, after all,
a Rush digest). Rush are a perfect example of how safe smoking marijuana
can be if you do it responsibly; all the old potheads are currently
very intelligent and sane.

By the way, Lakeside park may also have a reference to smoking marijuana.
"Smoking on the piers" is the line that I'm thinking of...

Drugs have inspired a lot of people. Huxley, Lennon, Kesey, Grant etc
all used LSD and an infinite number of artists use other drugs -
including alcohol. No, drugs won't turn you into a great artist of
any kind but they might inspire you and give you an another view
upon the world. (experience talks ;-) ;-)
