Subject: RE: Skippable rush....

I think this thread needs to be elaborated on.  It's not so much that
any reader is claiming that these songs have an objective flaw, but that
they have not caught on yet with said listener.  There was a time when I
thought YYZ was a repulsive song, and thought that Natural Science was
overrated.  Now NS is my fave song pre-signals, and YYZ is high up there
too, 2nd among instrumentals next to LTTA.  I'm sure we all have songs
that caught on slowly.  Seeing as how I've been a fan for about a year
now (only 19, and I'm well on my way), I'd wager that I hit about the
average pace for picking up the fever.  So let's accept the fact that
some people haven't had the time to learn to appreciate all of the
intricacies of Rush.  After all, music is not objective and you'll never
teach someone to like a song; all you can do is let them decide for
themselves.
	Songs I'm still working on that apparently seem to be faves of other
fans:  
	Tom Sawyer - Music is great, but the lyrical message was, IMO, a weaker
version of the message in New World Man.  Please, someone show me where
these two songs diverge.  (Not that I don't like TS, but when you know
the song by heart <overplayed>, it doesn't seem as cool).
	Neurotica - Again, it seems that the tail end of RTB will take the
heat.  My only gripe about this song is the repetitive chorus.  Although
I love the repetitive ending chorus in War Paint.
	These would be my most-likely-to-ignore rush songs.  I never skip a
song in particular, I just move ahead to the ones I like better.  We can
all relate to that.  And I'm ready and willing to support anyone who
feels the need to support song X, from any album.  Might not do it well,
but I'll try.

Subject: Grammatrain

I was lucky enough to catch Grammatrain at Cornerstone Music Festival,
and it was an absolutely *incredible* show!!  If any of you hear that
Grammatrain will be anywhere near you soon, I highly recommend you go,
because they're breaking up after this tour.  This is quite unfortunate,
because they're a simply (for lack of a better word) INCREDIBLE band.  

Dalton Roraback (former bassist) has left the band to be with his wife
and "concentrait on starting a family".  ;)  (Sounds like fun.  :) )

Pete Stewart (lead singer/guitarist) is going to persue a solo career,
and has already signed a contract with ForeFront Communications.  His new
music is supposedly going to be along the lines of
power-pop/guitar-driven electronic music.

Paul Roraback (drummer) is going to be starting a new band called, I
believe, Depress (or Depressed?  I couldn't quite hear him at the press
conference), and it will include Grammatrain's current bassist (who took
over for Dalton) and the rhythm guitarist they are using on this tour. 
This new band will be "more of a musician's band" Paul said, and said
they may play 2112 Overture and even some Yes tunes in concert.  (Paul's
a HUGE Rush fan, and talks about Neil almost constantly, according to
Pete.)

Rush content:  Paul Roraback appears on the HM CD "The Mother Of All
Tribute Albums", playing the afore mentioned 2112 Overture.  He plays
**all** the instuments.  (He said he had to record the guitar tracks
about 30 times to finally get them right.)  He does some interesting
stuff with it, but stays pretty close to the original, too.  It's a great
update, not straying far from the original parts on any of the
instruments.  (He even sings the line "...And the meek shall inherit the
earth...", and it doesn't sound too bad...)

I really hope everyone checks Grammatrain out while they still can, and
then remembers to check out Depress(ed?) when the first album comes out. 
Could be interesting...almost guarenteed to be *VERY* prog.

(Also, check out their website for updates/possible future releases (they
may be rereleasing their indie album, as well as a live album from one of
their final shows, on an independent label, making them available only by
ordering from the website.  And, the possibility of a reunion later on,
they said, is not at all out of the question.):  <

Hello,
 The song you are referring to is The Mechanix and it is off of 
Megadeth's first album - "Killing is My Business and Business and 
Good." Mustaine wrote the music when he was in Metallica and took the 
song and redid the lyrics for his band.
 And I have seen Drain S.T.H. before and i have to disagree with you, 
they are a pretty good band. But so is Sevendust :)

My 2 cents.

Hello all,
     It is with heavy heart that I say "Neil, I am so sorry for your loss."
What a horrific year for this man! The pain must be unbearable! Yes, I know
his wife's illness was no secret to him, but My God! How much can 1 man take!
     Needless to say, I believe that the band we all know and love as RUSH has
taken it's last bow. Family is sooooooo much more important than your job!!
     But, let's not be down on this (too much)! A career spanning 24+ years,
16 studio records, and soon a forth live album (something to look forward to).
     We should all be MORE than thankful! How many acts out there last THIS
long and with mainly the same line up! We are truely blessed to be devoted to
these men.
     And on the plus side, we can look forward to NEW music from VICTOR, a
first (hopefully) solo album from Geddy, music and literature from Neil, and
who knows what else!
     DON'T GET ME WRONG! I DO NOT want the group to break up, but it would be
MORE than understandable if they did.
         Thanks for your time,
            Keith
P.S.
     For anybody who has flamed the rush-mgr for not posting this info.
sooner......
What the HELL is wrong with you people?! Facts have to be checked and privacy
has to be honored! Get a life already!!! The NMS is my personal favorite RUSH
site, and I will support it always. Remember folks, this is a fan based web
site, not the Associated Press!!!!

Subject: Scales, skippable, other

I'd like to thank KDAF39B@prodigy.com (MR MATT C BREFORD) for his 
incredibly info-packed post concerning favorite Lerxst solos.  You must've 
taken some serious music classes at some point (are you a music major 
perchance?  I sure ain't!)
When I thought about my favorite Rush guitar solos, I was disturbed to find 
that I could barely even remember any.  I could think of a few bits and 
pieces: the beginning of the "Cut to the Chase" solo (would that I could 
tap like that), the bit on "In the End" that I was _convinced_ featured a 
violin :-9, those awesome whammy dives on ?"Turn the Page"? (I KNOW it's on 
HYF).  I guess I mostly listen for song construction and effects and tones 
these days, being a budding home-studio guy...

Re the seven diatonic modes (scales):  Here's how I usually think of them.  
I think of Ionian as a "normal major scale" and Aeolian as a "normal minor 
scale" (hey, I started out on piano, and those were the two scales I was 
taught...).  Lydian and Mixolydian are the other two "major scales" (Lydian 
being a "major scale with a sharp 5th" and Mixo a "major scale with a flat 
7th").
Phrygian and Dorian are the two other "minor scales" (Phrygian having a 
flat 2nd and Dorian a sharp 6th when compared to Aeolian).  Locrian is a 
"weird-ass scale that nobody ever uses", or (more helpfully) an Aeolian 
scale with a flat 2nd and flat 5th.  Or what you get if you start on the 
7th note of an Ionian scale, or the 3rd of a Mixolydian, or so forth.
I haven't gone through and learned all the notes for any mode in any key 
(have you any idea how much WORK that would be? <G>).  I just learned the 
intervals that make up each scale, and I go by ear.  The interval chart in 
the long post in #2067 looked right to me.

Note: learning the modes will go a long way toward giving you a head for 
chord progressions...

Whoever said that "Rivendell" is skippable: I regret to have to agree with 
you.  I like the classical guitar (I admire anyone who can play _real_ 
classical stuff, I sure can't), but having actually _read_ Tolkien, the 
lyrics are just unlistenable (and the melody seems a bit unnatural, a bit 
off...).

Well, I finished my cover of "What You're Doing".  It took me all of the 
4th of July, but I did it.  No one will ever confuse it with the original.  
Everything is very heavy, distorted and Primus-y (too loud and too much 
bass during bounces), and since I can't screech as high as a young Geddy, I 
compensated by using more reverb.  The result is a very garage-y, very 90's 
sound I daresay.
I'm going to try to record it onto my computer tomorrow.  Depending on how 
it comes out and how big it is, I may upload it to my website.  And maybe 
this week, maybe next, work begins on my next cover: from FBN, "Anthem".

God, that's terrible about Neil's wife though.  Hope Neil pulls through.  I 
think he will; he's a strong, rational person who's already been through a 
fair bit in his life...

Hello,

I was both shocked and very saddened by the news of the passing of Neil
Peart's wife. I am left wondering how he is handling the loss of two of the
most important people in his life.
  The loss of a child is very hard for any family to endure, and I'm sure did
not help the health of his wife. But to lose an entire family must be very
hard on his emotional welfare regardless of whether he knew it was coming or
not!
  I have been a fan of Rush for over 24 years and have grown to love not only
the music, but the lyrics. Definitely a thinking mans rock group, and we have
Neil to thank for most of that.
  Please pass along my sincere sympathy and a prayer to Neil for peace of
mind.

	Well only being an occasional reader ( no time ) but huge fan, I read 
with a very heavy heart the news of Neil's latest challenge.  OF all days to 
decide to open up the old NMS.  They say things happen in 3s, I sure hope 
that #3 is some far off distant relative of his.

	Anyway as an upper of sorts I have some pictures that I took of the 
Pittsburgh show of last spring (3rd row ) on my site.  I also have some 
pictures of us in Toronto for the 1st Toronto show.  Hope these bring some 
fond memories of last years happier times.
	BTW where we sat in Toronto was the corporate section and some say 
the family of the Boyz were in that section.  There were a lot of older 
folks that were dressed rather nicely right in front of.  Could be???

Subject: No skippable songs?  OPEN YOUR EYES!

        As I was the one who got this whole thread going with my now
infamous 'Top 10 Skippable Rush songs' list, I thought it appropriate &
necessary to address all you folks out there who apparently think Rush can
do no wrong and just love the feeling of your lips on their collective ass:
        WAKE UP!  Geez!  Get this thru your head: If people don't hold Rush
to the high standards of excellence we've come to expect of them, they will
go straight into the gutter!  By sticking up for low quality filler songs
just to prove what a wonderful & devoted little Rush fan you are, you're
actually doing Rush a -great disservice-.  It seems to me that for a few of
you guys, Rush could put a dog turd on a silver platter and you'd lap it up
just because it has the Rush name associated with it!  If Rush isn't
constantly challenged by their listening public to be great musicians they
become lazy- that's human nature.  Do you really want to see Rush go down
the same road as Aerosmith, Van Halen, or, God forbid, the Rolling Stones??
Those bands have gone straight downhill largely because their audience lets
them, and still shells out the bucks for their crap.
        This is my last word on this subject, as I'm sick of having to
uphold what I deem a quite reasonable stance.  I personally feel a person
who cares about a band enough to speak out when he sees them writing
material that isn't up to their typical caliber is a more valuable fan than
someone who blindly accepts whatever rotten bones the band may toss their
way and humbly says "Thank you Sir, may I have another?"
        As for whether the NMS should or shouldn't be a place where
criticism is acceptable, why don't you just go watch some grass grow, as
that's a lot more fun than reading "Rush rules!" ten thousand times over.
                                         Flame away--

hey all here is my thought. has anyone noticed a great deal of
difference between tfe and the work in progress video. i had noticed a
bit of difference in the sound quality until time and motion. i can hear
a "howel" in the echos the loon part.check it out it is a different mix.
im not sure which mix came first but i do know they are different.Drums
are defenatly enhanced!!! so when they did the show they may have used
the mix.
i also know have a copy of the drum clinic from power windows.

Subject: Show some respect.

I'll be brief and to the point.  I know everyone wants to be the voice of
authority and seem quite respectable when it comes to knowledge and on top of
things on any subject concerning Rush.  That is fine because I for one feel a
great sense of fan loyalty towards their work.  They have played an enormous
part in my life for almost 20 years now.  Again, I know fans who contribute to
the NMS are as dedicated as say some fans are dedicated to such acts like
Madonna, Garth Brooks etc. where it becomes an almost obsession.
The point that I hope I'm making is that when Neil was unfairly hit with
another devastating tragedy, the only role we should play is the sympathetic
observer.  If there is some way you can point your love, condolences etc.
through means of religious prayer or by other appropriate means then no harm,
no foul.  But when we feel that this is our business and you make this "fan
talk" or even go as obscene to threaten the mgr., I for one take great offense
to this.
Neil is going through one of the most painful things a human being can ordeal
through.  This topic is not for us to deliberate or discuss.  Let's show the
utmost respect for a Rush member whom we deeply respect.  Keep this topic off
the floor for discussion digest.  This should not be a time to ponder the
future from this implication or other effects it has.  That doesn't matter
now, let's support him and family with our thoughts and not speculate and
generate topics spurned by this second tragedy.
I know the great majority of you are not in the category of "threatmakers".
What the mgr. stated in Administrivia makes complete common sense.  If you
made such contacts to the mgr. or even feel cheated for not being privy to
this news, you really should be ashamed.  It makes me wonder if what B-man
said about the post is true at times.

Subject: Ok

Ok, I have to do another post here:
 Listen, people. We all need to appreciate the music that the collective 
genius known as RUSH has brought us. They are human beings like the rest 
of us (sometimes we lose sight of this). Reality check: This live album 
could possibly be their last album, EVER!. I know my life will go on 
after that. I will continue to cherish the music of RUSH until the day I 
die (and possibly beyond that), after that my albums, cds, tapes, tour 
books, posters, stereo, and musical instruments will go to my children. 
Hopefully they will apprieciate the same things I have in my life.    
Rush has influenced all of us in some way, and we all ramble on and on 
every week on here about them. I think the least we could do is give 
them one thing: RESPECT. They deserve it.

'Nuff said

Subject: Neil Forker's note about Remasters

Just wanted to add a bit more to Mr. Forker's note. I am a musician, recording
engineer and video editor in Milwaukee. I work for Taylor studios. 
Humans hear in analog. An analog sound wave looks something like this ~.
It is smooth. You often hear people saying that a high quality vinyl pressing
of an album sounds better than a CD. Of course with each play of a record
there is wear and tear and so the record sounds worse with age. CD's
represented a way to have a passable sound forever. There is no wear to the CD
when it's played. In other words as a medium of storage, CDs were far superior
to a record but to the human ear a piece of virgin vinyl sounded better but
only once. Analog tape suffers wear and tear as well. Digital tape doesn't
sound bad after many plays( it does other wierd stuff !)
Well when digital recording, mastering and CDs came about, the standard rate
of converting an analog wave to digital format was 16 bit. What that means is
that smooth wave above is being represented by 16 pulses or 01010101 etc...per
wave. Draw the wave but now draw it with 16 little steps on each side ~
It does not look smooth anymore. To our ears it sounds a bit harsh. Cymbals
don't decay smoothly , bass guitars loose a bit of warmth.
Like all things technical this got better. Remastered CDs are now being
mastered at 20, 22, and 24 bit which goes a long way to smoothing out that
wave. Digital recording itself is up to 24 bit now. I've done recording at 24
bit and it sounds every bit( no pun intended ) as warm and smooth as analog.
The next issue with remastered CDs is the source tape itself. Many albums (the
Rush catalog inclded) were mastered from copies of the master tape! Not THE
master tape but a copy of it. Make a copy of a tape somtime and you will hear
a noticeable loss of sound quality. This of course because with every play of
an analog tape you put wear on it. So wear out copies of the master, not the
master itself.
Now with the higher bit rates companies are going to the ORIGINAL master tapes
to do the mastering.
So this combined with Mr. Forker's explination should help anyone make sense
of this.
By the way, The Rush Remasters are awesome and well worth the money.

Also, thank you Neil Peart for all you have given me. I can't in any way say
anything that could convey what I want to. Your work has been an inspiration
and I wish there was some way that all of this suffering could somehow be
eased. 
Thank you Neil, Alex , and Geddy.

Subject: "sandpaper" cymbal

Hello everybody!
It's Cristiano, from Italy. Men, a year has passed since my last posting...
I'm a little bit nervous ;-)
I'd like to share my knowledge with Christopher Lindsay, who asked an
explanation about the sound of a cymbal he hears in Rush records...
Well, Christopher, I hope I've understood your question...
If you're referring to that cymbal that sounds also like two crashing
shopping carts, it's called china cymbal. It's basically a "reversed"
cymbal, with a cylindrical bell and a bent rim (I hope those words can help
you, In fact it's hard to find the right words to describe such an exotic
cymbal).
The basic difference between a regular crash cymbal and a china it's the
profile:

______/--\______        ______________
                       /     \__/     \
     crash                   china

Okay, I'm not Picasso, but I hope this can help you!
It produces a "smash", quite like the one produced by a shopping cart that
crashes somewhere. It has a quick attack and, depending on the weight and
the thickness of the cymbal and its miking it has different flavors
(long/short sustain, pronounced/absent overtones). Generally it has a
rhythmic sound and,thanks to his short sound, drummers tend to use it more
as a rhythmical device than as a "coloristic" one. You can hear two REALLY
nice china cymbals in the intro to "Mystic rhythms". They're the one that
end the first measure, after the first two percussion hits. (now I can't
recall if one of those two cymbals is a "pang", but I'ts basically the same
thing as a china)

Hope this will help.
If you haven't understood (not for your fault but for my linguistic
limitations) I invite you to visit any cymbalmaker's web site for a clear
view of the cymbal.
Try www.zildjian.com (it's the company that makes Neil's cymbals)

Subject: Different definitions of "skippable"

Someone posted about skippable tracks and I was just taken aback by 
what they considered "skippable."  My comments below:

>SKIPPABLE TRACKS
>1)  The Albums (RUSH and COS--I listen to them once in blue moon)

    I don't own RUSH (yes, that's disgraceful, I know) but I did 
recently get Caress of Steel, and I think it's pretty cool.  It hasn't 
"hooked me" yet, but it may in time.

>2)  The Albums (FBN and 2112--I listen to them twice in blue moon)

    JESUS CHRIST, MAN!  2112 is SKIPPABLE?!?!?!?!!?!!!?!?!  You'd 
better start trying to remember where you were today, because somewhere 
in your travels your BRAIN fell out, and you need to go find it!!!
    And Fly By Night, too?!  The title track is amazing, for one thing, 
but Beneath, Between and Behind is the "deep cut" of the album, and 
Anthem is an amazing song, too.  What is UP with you?

>*When I listen to 2112, I listen to an import "LaVilla Strangiato"
>3)Cygnus X-1  (I know it must've great when it came out, but really 
>gets long

    Cygnus X-1 is also an amazing song.  Not only can't I imagine it 
being skippable, I can't imagine listening to it only once at a sitting 
(so long as we're talking about the Cygnus book II on Hemispheres).

>4)The Analog Kid, Chemistry, and Digital Man (let's face it 
>"Subdivsions"
>makes the album)

    Yeah, if you like the over-hyped, under-interesting teeny-bopper 
songs...  The Analog Kid has *everything* over Subdivisions, and so 
does Digital Man.  Subdivisions, in my opinion, is one of the most 
particularly overrated Rush songs, even though I still like it 
somewhat.

>5)The Body Electric, Red Lenses (Bet. Wheels use to be skipped, but I
>love the synth chorus)

    I don't have Grace Under Pressure (yet) so I can't rate these 
songs.

>6)Open Secrets (cool beginning, then loses appeal, but HYF is a great
>album)

    Hold Your Fire is indeed a great album, and Open Secrets is a 
fantastic song.  Second Nature tops it, though, as of course does 
Mission and perhaps Lock and Key.  Force Ten, Time Stand Still and 
Prime Mover are probably the three best on the album.

>7)Show Don't Tell, Scars, Hand Over Fist (only because rest of album 
>is
>great too)

    Scars and Hand Over Fist are my two most skippable on that album.  
I prefer Roll the Bones, Show Don't Tell, You Bet Your Life, Neurotica, 
and Ghost of a Chance.  None of those are skippable.

                                                    --Jeffrey

Howdy y'all! I'm a new member to the list & glad to be here. I've been a fan 
for about 15 years.
 First I want to offer my condolences to the Peart family. That is definitely 
tragic news.
 Secondly, I want to say that I skip no songs on any album, unless I happen 
to want to listen to just one or two particular songs. I like them all, 
including "I Think I'm Going Bald" which apparently some others dislike.
 My other favorite groups are Kansas, Yes & Styx. 95% of the time, I listen 
to one of those four bands. Only rarely do I listen to anyone else.
 Am I correct in getting the impression that the guys are retiring? Is that 
just from touring or altogether?

Subject: Neil and the future of Rush

I would like to send my condolences to Neil during this tragic time. The
sense of double loss is inconceivable. Although I am just one of
thousands of hands he has shaken over the years, it was a moment I will
never forget.

I wonder. Having lost his daughter and now his wife - and knowing Neil's
reputation of being a very private man, I wonder if this would be his
opportunity to quietly bow out of the limelight, effectively ending the
band. A final live album imminent and a reluctance to tour ... it would
make sense. Alex? ... well I'm sure he could follow up Victor quite
easily and Geddy? ... he could start his own solo career or just stay at
home and watch baseball. Either way I wish them all well - whatever they
decide to do. After over 20 years of pleasure, I can't ask for more.

Subject: Support Among Flames

Meg,

After reading your "Admin" section of the NMS this morning on the subject of
"Why Didn't You <insert slanderous noun of choice here> Post The Info Of
Neil's Wife On The Site?" - I am quite inclined to agree with you.  The
where's, how's and when's of the situation is QUITE immaterial.  The fact
that we have this information now should be enough to satisfy even the MOST
flesh-hungry fans.  I actually kind of feel that the fact that we do know
about Mrs. Taylor-Peart before Neil/Band Mgmt./Anthem releases a statement
to be kind of a violation of Neil's space and privacy.  I mean, my GOD, this
is a REAL LIFE PERSON here, not just some icon that we as fans have a right
to squeeze everything out of that we possibly can.

I wonder if this will be treated on the web as it was with Neil's daughter,
Selena.  All the fans sending things to Neil along the lines of, "I know how
you feel" and "Just know that your fans care", when what they REALLY mean
is, "I'm a fan and I want recognition from my idol."  Kind of blasphemous,
methinks.  It's really disgusting when something like this happens and the
first thing out of the mouths of fans is, "How long will this delay the new
album?"  Or, "Does this mean that Rush is over?"

I guess the bottom line that I'm trying to get to is that Neil, his family,
and his friends are human beings like the rest of us.  There are certain
inalienable rights and courtesy and respect due each individual that I don't
see being extended to Neil and his loved ones yet again.  Leave him alone.
We are not his personal friends.  We cannot help Neil by sending him our
empty words.  By all means, pray for him.  Pray for the man who's lost his
family, his entire world.

I apologize for being long-winded.

     Knowing that he won't probably see this but I truly feel sympathy over

Hello all!
	It was a tradegy to hear of the passing of Neil's wife. It is
almost even more of a tradegy that some would get upset at the Rush-mgr
for not putting on the site. I commend the rush-mgr for not wanting to
put something of that nature up because Neil does deserve his privacy,
as does anyone else in that situation.
	Secondly, I find it kind of hard to understand how anyone could
skip a Rush song. Maybe you might not be in the mood to listen to a
particular song, but Rush is not a mood band.
	Finally, I liked the thread on the best song endings. Here a few
of my favorite song endings:

The Big Money
Countdown
Analog Kid
Xanadu
Camera Eye
La Villa Strangiato

	I can't really think of any more right now. Have to get back to
work.

I also live in the Detroit area and can attest that Ted is one of the most
arrogant, obnoxious people that has ever graced the airwaves. I work with
two of his cousins and they are pretty much in agreement. But, he is also
an activist in the community, he provides help at the homeless shelters by
providing venison during the winter, he runs his "Camp for kids" to help
inner city kids see that there is something other than gangs and welfare
to do with their lives. He is very pro-gun, but so are a lot of other
people who just aren't in a forum to reach millions of people. He is very
family oriented, his on Roco is on the radio all the time and he sounds
like a great dad. He has had all sorts of death threats by the PETA
(People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) people (so he says). If I
had people threatening me, i would definitly be pro-gun ownership too, you
never know if the threats are real or not.

Ted has had several musical guests on his show, and rarely do they talk
about guns and militant action, it's mostly about the musical industry.
These are just the guests that I have heard:  Don Dokken, Tommy Shaw, Jack
Blades, Gary Hoey, Steve Vai, Queensryche, Kenny Wayne Sheppard, Alice
Cooper, Grand Funk, Eddie Money, Rick Medlocke (Lynyrd Skynyrd), Johnny
Lange, Aerosmith, Metallica, and our very own Alex. Alex called in from
somwhere on the road during the TFE tour (Chicago, maybe). They talked
about Alex's piloting experiences and the legal aspects of the recording
industry. He has guests on all the time, but I don't listen too much
nowadays, his show got real old, real quick. I only listne if I know he's
got someone on that I want ot hear. One good thing about his show though,
it has to be th easiest show to call in to. I have spoken to Dokken, Gary
Hoey and Queensryche when they were on.

The station doesn't have a Real Audio feed, they don't even have a website
anymore (at least as far as I can tell). I have received several emails
from Ted, even though i don't agree with his views, but it takes a while,
even then you don't know if it's actually him or not.

Subject: RE: Ted Nugent review

Sorry for the (largely) non-Rush content, but I had to clear up some
misunderstandings that S. Stewart wrote about Ted Nugent.

I AM NOT TRYING TO START A FLAME WAR. Nor do I want to launch a debate that
rivals the Alex Van Halen thread. Everyone is entitled to his opinion --
even S. Stewart. So am I.

I'll respond to a few of S. Stewart's points below. I must preface my
comments first by explaining that I am not a big fan of Ted's music,
although I do respect his musicianship very much. I did, however,
"guest-produce" his radio show last October for two mornings when he was
here in D.C. to tape his appearance on ABC's "Politically Incorrect."

I volunteered for this duty (it required getting to the office at 5 a.m.,
which is a lot earlier than usual) largely because my brother is a big fan
of Ted's and I wanted to get his autograph. But I came away from the
experience with the knowledge that (1) Ted loves his fans dearly and feels a
huge obligation toward them (Rush fans should appreciate this -- it flies in
the face of so many other rock groups today); and (2) you can dispute his
message but you have to give him credit for urging EVERYONE to get involved
in the political process instead of just sitting there and allowing his life
to be manipulated by the forces that be.

Incidentally, I'd just returned from a fishing trip to Canada (Manitoulin
Island) but Ted was urging American sportsmen to boycott Canada because of a
recently enacted law to register guns at the Canadian border. (Actually, he
says that Canadian hunting guides and owners of hunting resorts were urging
the boycott, too, in order to put pressure on parliament to rescind the
law.) I told Ted that that I wouldn't return 'til this law was repealed --
but that I would continue to purchase my favorite Canadian export, Rush
(actually, my TWO favorite Canadian exports -- Rush and Molson beer). It
turns out that Ted loves Rush, too!

>>[Ted] has 3 agendas. Guns, Guns and Guns. As long as you're a 'card
carrying member of the NRA'  I'm sure you'd like his show.

Not true! His stress is on constitutional rights, one of which (the second)
is the right to carry firearms. Ted thinks that if you don't observe your
constitutional rights, you deserve to lose them.

>>As well as the above 3 topics he is VERY critical of the US goverment I
have heard him say the IRS is illegal, and asked what 'we' should do with
illegal organizations (blow up gov't buildings maybe?)

Ted criticizes the U.S. government because he thinks it tramples our
constitutional rights -- and will continue to do so if we allow it. And the
IRS DOES engage in illegal and unconstitutional activities -- the latest
round of congressional hearings on this subject bears this out. Ted
certainly does not advocate blowing up government buildings; in fact, he has
honorary badges from a number of law enforcement organizations. This is not
something policemen would give a terrorist. S. Stewart was having a
knee-jerk reaction here. 

>>Unfortunately Ted doesn't call any other musicians and talk about life on
the road 'yada, yada, yada.'

Not true! I know for a fact when I guest-produced his show that he talked
with Tommy Shaw. And I also know that he recently had Steve Tyler and Joe
Perry of Aerosmith on his show, too.

>>He has a political mindset on arming the whole country and actively
encourages everyone to "lock and load."

Again, that's just one way in which Ted urges everyone to practice his
constitutional rights.

>>I have e-mailed him expressing my views with no response.

Do you have any idea how much e-mail Ted gets per day?

 ---------

Ted doesn't think everyone should love him. But you have to appreciate the
fact that he urges people to stay off drugs and alcohol (he personally
sponsors a Kamp for Kids program that takes inner-city kids into the
wilderness for a couple weeks so they can learn about nature) and to be
active in the political process -- and he emphasizes that everyone by and
large is responsible for his own life.

     I was moving last night and found my copy of
     The Masked Rider.  In the liner notes, NP dedicates
     the book to Jackie and Selena....his family.  Wow.  How
     totally depressing.

     I always thought that when Rush calls it quits, even
     if they were 75 years old, I would be pissy and feel
     cheated.  I don't feel that way anymore.  Now is the
     time.

     Thanks for the memories.  And thanks for the
     going away present (Dimlit Stages).

     Forever Enlightened by Rush,
     Mike

     p.s.  That's not to say that another Victor album
           wouldn't be a welcome event! :-)
