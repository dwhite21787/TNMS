Well, we managed to do it - mostly me - zip right past our second anniv-
ersary date with nary a whimper, let alone a bang!  *sigh*  Oh, well, let
it be known that last Saturday, 11/9/91 marked the two-year anniversary of
the thing that has come to be known as "The National Midnight Star".  It
rose from a humble .mailrc file through a simple mail reflector and home-
grown scripts for digestification to the glorious mass that confronts you
today.  :-)  To celebrate it's passing (the anniversary, not the NMS!) we
have put together a special edition to follow this NMS.  It will come about
two hours after this, and has some ramblings from it's co-founders.  I hope
it doesn't bore you too much!  :-)  (That's a joke, son!)

I can't think of much more to say - it's Friday, and I'm brain-fried (not to
be confused with pan-fried, which is tastier by far).  Toodle-oo, have a good
one (or another good one, if you're young enough to stand it), and I'll be
throwing more stuff at ya next week.

From: mjt1@mtuxo.att.com!

Hi folks!

Given the fact that RUSH has once again hit the road, it might be
interesting to share some personal favorite moments from past live shows.
Some topics could be:

	Best live show/tour
	Best live tune
	Best opening tune
	Best special effect
	Favorite unexpected moment
	etc.

Being fortunate enough to have seen every tour since AFTK
(inclusive), I have one or two.

Best live show/tour:  Has to be Hemispheres.  Saw the show in a
3,000 seat "theatre".  Very intimate.  They opened with Anthem,
played By-Tor, closed with La Villa.  All on my 18th birthday!!

Best live tune:  Xanadu with 2112 and Cygnus a CLOSE 2nd.

Best opening tune:  Bastille Day was cool on AFTK tour but 2112
takes it by far.

Best special effect:  Something not too fancy here.  The yellow
flood lights set up behind Ged and Alex that came on whenever the
"priests" would talk in 2112.  All you saw were 2 black sillouettes (sp?)
in a sea of yellow.  Pretty neat.

Favorite unexpected moment:  Hearing Tom Sawyer and Limelight on the
PeW tour.  The place went nuts over both tunes.

Think about it.  I'm sure some of us would love to hear other NMS'ers
live favorites.  Puts us all in the "spirit of the season" so to speak.

Enjoy the show!!

From: dws@soc7.acpub.duke.edu

	While reading through one of the Midnight Stars, I noticed that
the "Closer to the Heart" video on the Chronicles video collection was
listed as "live".   I have this video collection and, though Rush is
performing "Closer to the Heart" on stage, the music we hear is
definitely the same as the that on _A_Farwell_to _Kings_.  They do a
good job, though, playing along.  (Go figure?  It's only their song!?!)
 Their only flaw in taping is at the very end.  As Geddy begins his
final scream of WhooooaAaaahhhOooohhhAaahOhhhhhh! (you know what I
mean), he is seen moving backwards, away from the microphone, but the
volume of his scream stays the same.  And what's more, the scream is
identicle to that on the album.
	Now take the video for "The Trees"; that is definitely live.

	Well, that was just an observation of mine. No big deal.

Aron,

There was quite a discussion a long time ago about the
meaning, if any, of the binary in `The Body Electric.' Rather
than see the debate (which was quite extensive) boil over again,
I'll just refer you to TNMS #18 (John Fourkas' posting),
#20 (subject headings ``$ and The Pass'' and ``The Pass''),
#21(subject ``The Body Electric and The Pass''), and #194
(``Re: Regretful Satanism Comment''). These were the first
postings on the subject and contain the essential info. Debates
have flamed up on and off since...

About a former post:  I think RUSH did use a harmonizer on the Presto tour.
But just for an octave higher than Ged's voice, no 3rd's, 4th's, or 5th's!

Did the guy aver write back with his address on where to send tapes to get
copies of the first couple of shows?

Just watched the RTB video, again.  If you have to see it, before you go to 
bed,
that is if you have a VCR, set the speed to SLP and you can record 6 hours of
eMpTyV with a T-120 tape.  Then just scan through it the next day and hope for
the best.  My VCR actually got about 6 1/2 hours of stuff on it and it only
took about 20 minutes to scan through it all.  The first time, no dice; the
second, well, it was only the 5th video into the recording.  That means they
played it about 12 or 12:30am.  Sound quality on SLP isn't as good as SP, but
you can only get 2 hours worth of stuff doing it that way.  It also does
the video justice if you record it with a Hi-Fi stereo VCR!

Subject: Reaction/Random interaction

First of all, a message to Phil, who insists that Rush is not like
Depeche Mode. In songwriting, No. In musicianship, No. In vocal matters,
No. Overall image, No. No. No.!
	But when you speak of sequencing, I'm gonna have to say, "yes." Geddy
writes a version of the songs with all of the parts- even vocals,
guitar, drums and keyboards with Passport software. Usually done on an
Atari ST (Great for MIDI applications) or a MAC. The song is sequenced,
designed to be played at a certain tempo. When you use samples, they are
at a certain rate. You can't crank the whole sequence into double time
(let's say if the band wanted to sound as cool as they used to) The
samples will be played, but you will only hear parts of them as the
computer hits each note more briefly as tempo increases. The band is
just as constrained by these matters as Depeche Mode is. Luckily, we
don's have to put up with that European mondo-cool leather image that
Depeche mode sports.
	Sequencing has its benefits. But the drawbacks divert RUSH from the
rawness that I prefer. That's my personal opinion. I have used the
Passport sequencing system. You have to give geddy credit for learning
how to use the thing. My bottom line here, is that there is a computer
running a sequencer through the whole song. from HYF on... When we
listen to Depeche Mode's Violator CD, we are actually listening to a
sequencer with average male vocals.
	Luckily, the band played some great older numbers that really didn't
use too many rack synths or effects. Freewill and Limelight were
probably the best songs of the show. Rush can be enjoyed by many. The
synth-lovers, the metalheads, the artistic odd-time lovers (musicians).
I am probably a nice mix of those people, whatever that means I'm really
not sure.
	Also, I just bought a copy of Guitar Magazine w/ geddy on the cover.
Also on the cover were that Metallica guy, and some dude who wrote, "go
to hell" can't remember their names. Geddy looked so funny juxtaposed
against those guys. You know you have the metal mean-faced kick your ass
guys on the same cover with Geddy, who bears a friendly smile. He's like
saying this is what I am - I am my music -that's cool.  Also, I think
Metallica sucks. I'll probably get flamed for this- but on the MTV
awards Enter Sandman sounded like shit. As a musician, I am open minded
about all music, but they sounded like the first band that I was in that
night - and that's not giving me any credit. They were thrashing along -
that's not musicianship - thats glam-rock showy, "I got the stage look
how I can dress, swear, prance, jump, in a wall of distortion" rock.
	Later,
		Matt

Howdy, Rush fans (insert crowd going nuts here).

In response to a few things that have been said:
I saw Rush in Normal (Redbird Arena) and it was the most
wonderful experience of my life (okay... so it's right up
there 8).  They opened with "Force Ten".  I was also
disappointed (sp) that they did not play more stuff from the
new album.  Song selections that made me happy: Bravado
and THE PASS!!!  That one really surprised me.  I was also
impressed with the band's sense of humor.  The giant rabbits
dancing (so I didn't see the Presto tour, okay?) and the
video of that skeleton singing the Roll the Bones rap had
me rolling on the floor!  The lights, stage, etc. were all
incredible!  And to the person who complained about the
boyz playing for only two hours: pthbp!!  They're human. Deal
with it.  Oh... and Neil's drum solo is probably the best he's
ever done... and it's the best I've ever heard!  8)

Aside note on Eric Johnson:  lots of fancy guitar work.
A lot of it sounded the same. Seemed pointless to me.

As for the 'mystery rapper' it's definitely Geddy. When
he sang it live, I didn't see any electronic things on
the stage, and he sounded just like it did on the record.
Unless the sound was coming from somewhere else, and I couldn't
tell (we didn't have GREAT seats 8(...).

On the 'typical' Rush fan... I like Star Trek (TNG), I'm
nearsighted, I want a denim jacket (if it came with the 2112
art on it, i probably wouldn't make a fuss!), and I know
diddly about computers (really).

Regarding that horrible rumor about Neil's health... Anyone know
an address or phone number for eMpTyV news? Sounds like a real
news item they could check into.

Lastly, anyone have any info on dates in Phoenix and/or Peoria,
and where Rockline can be heard in Peoria?

Sorry this was so long. Bye, all!

In response to James Moseley's question about MuchMusic:

I was in Toronto about a month ago and remember watching MuchMusic on TV.
Basically, it seemed like the equivalent of MTV with hour after hour of
music videos. I believe that it can only be picked up within Canada.

A question for fellow RUSH fans -- Does anyone know if they air RUSH videos?

Just wondering.

I read Dan's post about the barely intelligible words/sound in
'Camera Eye', and boy, was I ever intrigued to get to the bottom
of the mystery.

Until now I always accepted that it was someone speaking, but I
think the belch theory holds some truth to it.

My girlfriend even thinks so! (She's got better hearing than me.)

Also, as far as the "Scrooge's Rock 'n Roll" Christmas video, I have
seen it in the same guide the other person mentioned.  I don't know
anything about it, but I'm looking for it!  I'll post more info when
I get it.....

Subject: The Camera Eye

Okay, okay.  I've figured it out.  The voices in the Camera Eye say the
following: "Art!!" "Wot, Dad?".  That is all.  I've heard it over and over
(I love that song) and this is what I hear every time.  I don't know the
significance- if any.  They do have a sense of humor, y'know.

And one more thing: responding to the person who said that maybe the focus
isn't on intellectual lyrics, that Geddy and Alex don't care: if that was
the case, they could've lost Neil long ago for a drummer who would fit with
their musical style.  Geddy and Alex can write, we've seen it.  Neil is
an integral part of the band, and I think that all three of them agree
that lyrics with meaning are as important as music with talent.  So there.

Stephen Lovatt writes:

&gt;         I was listening to BBC radio a couple of nights back when I heard
&gt;a trailer for a programme about an Aboriginy claim for compensation against
&gt;the UK government regarding radioactive fall-out from early Atom-bomb tests
&gt;that were conducted in Australia.  In passing, the presenter mentioned that
&gt;many "Dreamlines" crossed the geographical area in question and explained
&gt;that these were mystical path-ways followed by Aboriginies in their wanderings
&gt;through the outback....a bit like ley-lines follwed by New-Agers and Hippies
&gt;in Britain in search of personal fulfillment and spiritual power.
&gt;
&gt;        So now we know where NP got the title DREAMLINE from!

Actually, you're incorrect.  What you stated makes alot of sense, but it's
not quite right.  The title DREAMLINE came from a book written by a friend of
mine named Kevin Anderson, and Kevin happens to be good friends with Neil.
Kevin had written a book(I'm not sure on the title, but I think it is.....)
called "DREAMTIME".  After Neil read the book, he wrote the lyrics for
DREAMLINE.

Subject: Concert Thoughts (SPOILERS, man!)

Well, I'm here to ramble on some personal sights at the two shows I saw
last week.  Thge first was in St. Louis on 11/7 and Normal on 11/9.

Seeing Rush twice in three days in two different cities gave me an insight
as to how Rush makes each show different..  Or how strict they are to their
planned set.

Musically, they were exactly the same.  Except for the technical screw-ups,
each song was played the same as the other night.  The only different
thing about the songs were a resurface of the Earache My Eye riff.   On the
HYF and Presto tour the riff was played twice, once at the end of The Big
Money and again at the very end of the set.  In St. Louis, the riff was
absent.  I was sad since my favorite comics are Cheech & Chong.  Well, two
nights later at the end of The Big Money, everyone stopped playing and Neil
played the riff on his wood blocks.  I was happy.

Thoughts about St. Louis:

   Geddy's hair was down.  Alex danced about like a crazed lunatic.  Played
a few chords by hitting the guitar with a closed fist right above the
strings on the body.

   During Geddy's bass solo on Closer to the Heart, Alex ran off stage and
came back with a vacuum.  He bagan to vacuum the stage around Geddy and the
drum kit.  It was quite funny.

   The crowd was a mix of every type of person I've ever seen.  Most knew
what was going on.  Good reaction to Xanadu and the encore.  I stood most
of the concert though I wasn't on the floor.  Most of the crowd sat after
hearing Bravado.  Crowd rose again after Xanadu started.  Then again after
Tom Sawyer.  Great show.

Normal, IL:

  Geddy had his hair pulled back like on Presto.  Alex seemed more alive
than St. Louis.

  During the solo in Closer to the Heart, Alex didn't get the vacuum but
gave Geddy strange looks from across the stage.  As in Milwaukee, Alex
played his single note part in Superconductor(right song anyone else who
went) with his nose.

  TOTAL college crowd.  Since there is a huge University right there,
that's expected.  It seemed as the crowd didn't really know what was going
on as a whole during the tunes that were never played on the radio very
much.  Big reaction to FreeWill, Tom Sawyer, etc.  From my vantage point,
there was little to no reaction to Xanadu.  Everyone sat down and looked at
the lasers.  Very few people going nuts that they were playing one of their
classic songs.  Not too much response to Finding My Way and Anthem but more
for Spirit of Radio and La Villa.  But for people who haven't had much Rush
experience, that's expected.

I LOVED the use of the lasers during the opening of Xanadu.  All until they
went off I loved them.  My question is, right at the end, the lasers seemed
to change color several times quickly.  If so, why didn't they use anything
other than green for the rest of the show?

A comment on the rap in Roll the Bones.  As someone pointed out, the lights
go dark on Neil and such.  The rap they played was from tape but I thought
the 'Get Busy!' part was done live.  Oh well.  Enough rambling.

A must see show, but who doesn't say that?

Subject: CFV: rec.music.rush (forwarded from news.groups)

Here's the CFV for the creation of the USENET newsgroup rec.music.rush,
as it appeared in news.groups.  Happy voting (if you want to, of course)!

========= begin of forwarded message ==============
CALL FOR VOTES: rec.music.rush, unmoderated

Charter: For discussions about the musical group Rush, its works, and its
fans.

Rationale: To provide a place for fans (and detractors) to discuss Rush and
its works, as well as the people involved. Rush discussions tend to overflow
rec.music.misc, increasing its already tremendous volume. This group would
help alleviate that.

Mechanics: The official discussion began on October 12, and has run the
required 30 days. There was some opposition to the group as a whole, but no
substantive comments one way or the other were posted or emailed to me about
changes in the intent or name of the group. The proposal, as it stands, thus
reflects a consensus among the proponents of the group, as required by the
Guidelines for Newsgroup Creation.
Voting will commence upon posting of this message to news.announce.newgroups.
The rest of the dates in this posting assume that that will occur during the
day on Wednesday, 13 November.

You may vote by sending me email at jmaynard@oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu; replying by
using the rn command R or r, or its equivalent in other newsreaders, will work
as well. Your message must be an unambiguous statement of whether or not you
vote for the group's creation. Ambiguous votes will be bounced back to the
sender with a request for clarification. Votes will be acknowledged by mass
posting on Monday, 2 December, and a repeat call for votes will be posted at
that time. The vote will close on Friday, 13 December, and results will be
posted at that time. As with all standard Usenet votes, passage will require
at least 100 more YES votes than NO votes, and YES votes must be at least 2/3
of the overall total - or, put another way, there must be at least twice as
many YES votes as NO votes. If the vote passes, then the group will be created
Wednesday, 18 December.

It's in Toronto.  In fact, in "Strange Brew" you'll hear Bob and Doug

Subject: Neil's single bass

hinano@ahi.pbrc.Hawaii.Edu (Hinano Akaka) wrote the following:

&gt; 1)  I bow my head in memorium -- Neil with only one bass drum.  IS
&gt; THIS THE END OF AN ERA?  WILL THIS CREATE A PERMANENT WAVE OF
&gt; SINGLE BASS DRUM TECHNIQUES?

Don't confuse having a single bass drum with single bass technique.  Neil's
technique is still the same using a double pedal, which, in case you didn't
know, has two mallets on one drum with one pedal directly in front of the
drum and the other in a remote position linked via a shaft with universal
joints at each end, one connected to the mallet, the other to the pedal.
These pedals provide the same action and feel, as well as the same sound, as
a double bass, but at a fraction of the cost and taking up virtually no space.
Apparently, Neil found it neccessary to switch to this system to provide more
space for the alterations to his set (which I have yet to go through and
discern).  But rest assured that this change in no wavirtuosity in any way.

Subject: sorry...

	To Nick and all those who were pi*&^ed off:
	Sorry about the spoiled post. I put spoiled in BIG letters so those
who read the subject headings to avoid the spoilers wouldn't read my
question, but obviously it didn't work well enough. Again, my apologies.
	Thanx to Doug for answering my question:
	I thought playing the first song from the previous album was some
kind of tradition based on the songs on the live albums and when I saw them
play on the Presto tour. Oh well...

Subject: Real Fans?

Yeah...who the hell is the Craig B. person anyway?
He posts about Rush playing to the whims of the
"pseudo-fans", as he calls them.  So, by his skewed
logic, "real" Rush fans can't like : Finding my Way, 2112,
Closer to the Heart, Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, DEW,
Subdivisions, Freewill, Limelight, Superconductor,
Big Money and so on.

His definition of the Real Rush Fan is one that hates
everything on Chronicles.  And I thought I was elitist
about Rush.....

Subject: More on Camera Eye voices

bankok@darkside.com (Jade) said in response to Balaji's query about the voices
in The Camera Eye (which on CD come at 8:54) that they were the following:
1st voice: "'hello!"
2nd voice: "Morning Gov."
Well, Jade, you'll be happy to know that there's at least one person here who
agrees with you.  I sat and fiddled with my parametric EQ for about two hours
a couple days ago trying to isolate those voices, and that's the exact same
thing I came up with.  Funny.  I didn't post it because I thought people would
think I was nuts!  Thanks for helping me keep my ego inact.  I think those
words fit, not only because they sound like it, but also because they are
spoken with a strong English accent in a section of the song where they are
speaking of Britain (London, especially).  But again, I could probably be
very easily proven wrong.
