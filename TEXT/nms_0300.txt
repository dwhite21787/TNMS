Subject: Mail Address...

G'day fellow Rushans!

        After reading the frequently asked questions list, I was
wondering if anyone knows an up-to-date address where I can write
to the band. There is an address in the list, but there is also a
comment that the address may not be correct/current.

        My reason for asking this, is I would like to write to the
boys and ask them if they have ever considered touring Australia.
&gt;From the interviews with the band, they apparently read at least
some of their fan mail (Alex always gets asked where a Hentor
guitar can be obtained), so this strikes me as the best way to try
to get them to consider an Aussie tour.

        So all you other Aussie Rush fans - get your pens moving!
The more mail they get about this idea the better - that way they
will know they have a following in Australia. Does anyone else have
any other suggestions on this subject? Say pestering your local
radio station, the local branches of the record company/distributor
etc?

Yo, later dudes!

Kevin.

YOU KNOW YOU'RE A RUSH FAN WHEN.... You buy "Mission" speakers just
                                    because of the name. (Does any
                                    other audio equiment brands fit
                                    this?)

P.S.  most listened to albums... anything by Stevie Ray Vaughan
                                 anything by J.J. Cale
                                 Led Zeppelin III, Physical Grafitti
                                 Thunder Seven (Triumph)
                                 Short Fuse Blues (Dave Hole) - a
  truly awesome album if you like the blues - reminds me of early
George Thorogood style, but with SRV's intensity. Distributed by
Shock Records in Perth, Australia cat. no. DHCD2.

This time I'm really going.....going.....gone.

Yes, we know.  The last two Queenryche albums were produced by Peter
Collins and engineered by Jim Barton, as were PoW and HYF.  I thought
this was common knowledge to most Rush fans.

Hey there all. Actually this is not that rare at all. Its been available for
some years now. Unfortunately, the Big Money Vid on it is the short version,
the version on the Chronicles vid. The only way to get the ENTIRE Big Money
vid is at the end of P/g tour vid. Its on the NTSC format as well.
Hope this helps.

KLOS FM in Los Angeles played Closer to the Heart, and after it, the
DJ came on and mentioned some things about Roll the Bones...what caught
my attention though was when she said that Rush had postponed their
tour until after the World Series, because Geddy is a big fan of the Toronto
team, and they have a good chance of being in the series.

Subject: Yes, eco-paks, and record clubs (oh, my!)

Don't know what happened to my last post--maybe i missed it...

if any of you are still wondering about missing puzzle clues, well,
i *burned* it because i couldn't believe one simple puzzle could have
so many mistakes!  seriously, you could write if you have any questions,
and i'll sift through the ashes...

just thought i'd clzrify my last post and the comments i gave about yes...
i don't want anyone to think i'm stupid enough to harbor the opinion that
yes isn't one of rock's greatest bands of all time.  I just think yes was
much *better* before _90125_, but i know many would disagree...i liked the
"classification" of alex between rabin and howe, stylistically, of course,
but i know who's my favorite....

eco-packs...well, i've heard enough about them...are any of you *not*
going to by RTB if it comes in an eco pak?  if you're so concerned
about it you have very right to write atlantic and tell them, but i don't
think it's that big a deal...i mean if you going to treat any container
roughly then maybe you need a carrying case or something--i have one, and
my sting soul cages cd fits in it just fine...and i do have several rush
albums on vinyl (COS, 2112, PoW, ASOH, MP) but i (sadly) never listen to
them now that i have them on cd, but they do look good on a record rack....

I've never seen anything other than Presto at Columbia house, but those
bastards wouldn't dare sell anything people might like!  (i just dropped
out of the club, and i would say to anyone who is thinking of joining any
kind of record club--DON'T!  they'll take your money!)

this deal about the label being flipped...this also appeared on another
album of mine, _Fun and Games_ by the Connells, and it's really annoying
since they don't teach us to read upside down anymore...at least the
music isn't so vilely tampered with...

ah, well, sorry to waste so much space complaining, but it's hard to
come up with interesting lyrical analyses when you're not an
objectivist..

&gt;From: Mark "Crimson" Friedman &lt;friedman@cis.ohio-state.edu&gt;
&gt;Subject: The Straw That Broke The (Proverbial) Camel's Back

&gt;But I'm sorry: it has *all* become *entirely*  too inane for me.  It's
&gt;incredible: some   of  you  have no idea  what a  metaphor  is!  And I
&gt;*still* can't believe how many took the "part four of a trilogy" thing
&gt;SERIOUSLY!  On top of that are the constant deluge of half-thought out
&gt;lyric analyses and baseless rumours that I hold *so* dear (please note
&gt;that this is sarcasm: I'm sure many of you  would  miss it otherwise).
&gt;Add to that the "Rush fans = better that  the average mortal" attitude
&gt;and it becomes all too overbearing (I think my favourite quote in this
&gt;department was something like: "Lynch that bastard Randall Stark!").

Yeah, I get the same feeling about many groups I read.  It comes with the
territory (oooh..._Territories_).  Folks have different ideas about what's
important, some wanting to analyse lyrics until their (and other's) eyes bleed,
others wanting tell tell us how they 'jerk their head around' when they heard
rush on the tv (I heard them playing something during a hockey game, kinda
cute, also heard something from FTK on a local show about scotland, also kinda
cute), and some just wanting info about new albums and maybe tour dates (like
me).  I didn't jerk my head around, I didn't get a goofy smile on my face.  I
just realized that rush is like most other popular bands, and their music gets
used elsewhere sometimes.

The point being that different folks have different attitudes about rush, so
you just gotta learn to wade through the stuff you don't care for.  I must say
that this list has a lot of good info, but also has a lot of ramblings I dont
care to read.  Someone says, "Rush is the best, ever."  I say, "Okay."  Someone
says, "Rush sucks with knobs on it." I say, "Okay".  Someone says, "Neil meant
this and that about this."  I say, "Okay, where's the next article?" :-)

Actually wading through the uninteresting stuff is a technique helpful in
reading other lists, and just going through life.  Geez, I'm preaching
tolerance. :-/  I guess I should quote some rush lyric here that would 'prove'
my point, but maybe I'll just get some work done.

Hey, rush-mugger (rush-mgr) keep up the good work.  I know list management is a

Subject: Archives, CoS, LPs

The frequent mentions of Archives and CoS on LP (with words) have got my
curiosity working. I'll 'fess up - a long while back, I bought Archives
cause I thought it was a good deal (3 LPs for $10). This was a while back,
back before CDs. I now have FBN & CoS on CD, with no lyrics, no cover art
to speak of.
So - how were FBN & CoS originally released in LP form? Were there lyric
sheets or fold-outs or what?

[ Oh, you poor person!  The lyrics to COS are in script on the inner cover
  (gatefold) of the original album.  The lyrics to FBN (which I'm now in the
  process of copying for someone on the list) are really neat; hand-written
  on the inner sleeve with cute drawings to go along with them.  The other
  side of the inner sleeve is a close-up of what looks like an editing
  console or maybe a concert soundboard, with insets of some of their road
  crew at the time (Herns, Skip, Ian, Liam, if I'm not mistaken).  Truely
  a must for the avid Rush collector!!  One last note:  how many of you
  knew the original release of Hemispheres had a poster of the three guys
  in with it?                                                    :rush-mgr ]

I've managed to suck the lyrics of FBN, CoS & 2112 down off syrinx, and
build postscript lyric sheets that slide into the CD jewel box lids, so
I've at least _got_ the lyrics wwith the CDs. When I saw that 2112 wasn't
complete with story, etc. in CD form, I _had_ to keep the LP. By a number
of flukes, I seem to have every album on LP except FBN,R,CoS & P , and
every CD except ATWAS,R,ESL & ASOH. (no boots...yet :)
Just for the halibut - fave five albums (no order)
	1) Presto
	2) Quadrophenia, The Who (studio version, not soundtrack)
	3) Best of Gerschwin
	4) Look Sharp!, Joe Jackson
	5) Revolver, Beatles  (really, it's better than Sgt. Pepper's)

anyone know the regular list price in BMG for ASOH? I know hag2 got it for

Subject: Member bashing and why I love Rush

Subject: RE: The Straw That Broke The (Proverbial) Camel's Back

I am probably going to shoot myself in the proverbial foot here, but
oh well here goes.

   We had a simillar problem in the rec.arts.drwho newsgroup about 7
months ago when all kinds of people were flaming the guy to hell
because he posted a rumor.  There were a few who sided with him and
helped put out the fire.

   So what if someone posts a "RUMOR", some of us are not as well
informed about RUSH as others seem to be.  The NMS is my major source
of RUSH news for me, because there is no other place that I can get it at
the price that the NMS is offered...(goose egg, nada, nyet).  What a
great deal.

   Dealing with Dr. Who for the 2 years that it has been on hiatus has
taught me to take any rumor with a very large grain of salt.  I think
some of the more informed people should stop flaming the less informed
for asking a question about something that they have heard.  I also
found it somewhat upsetting that because of this Mark has chosen to
unsubscribe from TNMS.

   After reading Mark Friedman's post in the last NMS, I thought about
why I love RUSH and what turned me on to them in the first place.

   I am probably in the vast minority of the NMS readers in why I love
RUSH and their music.  I don't read any of Ayn Rand's books, I don't
theorize about any of the songs, and however I was appalled at Neil's
reaction to the NMS.

   I simply love rush for the two things that attracted me to them.
	1.  Their music -- It is always changing.  It is always fresh
and different.  Not stale and flat like most stuff today.  Owning the
the thirteen studio releases is like owning thirteen different albums
by thirteen different bands.  There is always something new to be
heard each time I listen to every one.  The NMS subscribers have
opened my eyes to things on Rush albums that I had never knew were
there to hear.  I tried to make a tape of my favorite Rush tunes, and
I wound up with about 3.5 90 min tapes full of material.  I was pissed
because I could not knock it down.

	2. Geddster's voice -- He always says that if had a nickel for
everyone who hated his voice, he would be RICH.  I LOVE GEDDY'S
VOICE!!!!  I know a lot of people who love rush but can not stand
Geddy's voice.  I first heard Geddy when I was about 12 (nine years
ago).  Tom Sawyer was on the radio, and I was completely blown away by
the song.  Geddy's voice took me by storm.

   Flame me if you want, but I must warn you, I have a sprinkler
installed in my mailbox.

   IMHO you shouldn't flame a guy for being honest...or curious.

   Can't wait for the new album....

P.S.  I have sent a copy of this to Mark, and I appologise to anyone
that I have offended.

godsend).

The song is called "Radio Song" and works quite well; it laments about
the current state of radio where every song you hear is rap and
baby-baby-baby I want your body.  It talks about two people wanting
a meaningful relationship and every time they turn on the radio to find some
good music they hear a song they can't sing along to (rap).  This was REM's
statement about rap, and they did it quite well, a string-filled smooth
dreamy REM verse which segued into a jarring rap chorus.  The slapping bass
and cool guitar riffs just show off REM's versatility.  Don't you think Geddy
and Alex can jam in that way?  Wouldn't it be interesting, at least?

Don't judge the Rush and rap song until you hear it.  "Radio Song" works
quite well.  Only thing I worry about is the smugness of REM fans saying
"REM did it first."  I subscribe to both groups and am fans of both but...

Subject: Rush/Yes, Fripp review, _Guitar Player_ Apr. 86

Good day, eh?

	Hey Sean,  about Squire handling those slap parts on "dangerous"--
he can't!  (sorry to dissappoint you).  Let's try:

	Geddy  vs.  Tony Levin

Close.  But I'd say Tony is quite a bit more versatile.  He and Geddy both
kick butt, though.  (Tony is a bald god--Squire can't hold a candle to him
live!  Bring back Tony to ABWH!!!!!)

[ YES!! Tony L. is a bass guru extraordinare!  I love seeing him live!
                                                              :rush-mgr ]

	I just read through about 30 NMS's so I don't remember who asked,
but I have the _Guitar Player_ Apr. 86 magazine with Geddy on the cover
AND the Kazumi Watanabe soundpage (which made me a loyal fan).  The sound-
page is a re-recorded version of "Unicorn" from his _To Chi Ka_ album
(which BTW, Tony Levin plays on--Cool!).  If you're interested in KW
get _Mobo Club_,  _Mobo Splash_,  or _The Spice of Life_.  All EXCELLENT
albums.  Actually I like the soundpage arr. of "Unicorn" better than the
original.  Hmmmmnnn...

	For those of you who requested that Fripp review and didn't get
it... sorry I was out of town for a month.  If you'll mail me (with your
address in the body of the message) I'll get one out to you right away.

	And on a more righteous note,  with the departure of Crimson
in yesterday's NMS I couldn't help hearing the National Anthem chime
in and build to a deafening roar with our mgr.'s "liberal" response.
Give the holier-than-thou attitude a break rush-mgr.  He had some
good points.  We don't need the gospel according to rush-mgr.

				Have a nice day! :-)

Subject: cold comfort to the ones without it

Hi Everyone,

I liked aspects of Amy's posting last issue interpreting 'Mission,'
especially that she pointed out that there is more than one group of
people being discussed in the song, but there are a couple of things
I'd dispute:

Amy wrote:

&gt;The whole song is about the pros/cons of achieving your "mission."  The
&gt;previous lyric [see her post for the specific lines] is about those
&gt;who achieved fame but found that it snow-balled out of their control
&gt;and now they wish they could just go to the mall and not have tremendous
&gt;touring/recording commitments (plain and
&gt;sane respectively).

I don't think the whole song is about the pro's and con's of
achieving your mission. I think that it is in honor of those
who have achieved or will achieve their missions, with a tiny
bit tacked on the end to address those who didn't or won't
achieve their missions. I don't see the snowballing out of
control part here at all (though maybe later in `a little more
sane') -- I think that Neil definitely would not wish that he
and Ged and Alex could just go back to the mall, that would be
returning to the past with a vengence!

&gt; "If their lives were exotic and strange, they would likely have
&gt;gladly exchanged them for something a little more plain, maybe
&gt;something a little more sane."

This applies to only those who have not made it (those in need of
'comfort'). The underlying idea, it seems to me, is that those
who didn't make it most likely wouldn't be happy if they _did_
because it's just not in their nature to do so; they wouldn't
be sufficiently proud and aggressive to handle the insanity of parts of
the succesful life. The drift I get is that Neil sees them as
somewhat timid souls. Neil made Gauguin a subject (cf. ``Middletown
Dreams'') of some his lyrics, and Gauguin blew off his hum-drum life
and headed off for Paris at a late age and _still_ made it, because he
wouldn't (couldn't) give up. When I first got interested in this point
I figured Neil would would think that there are people who just had
bad luck, but detailed interview evidence (to appear soon as
a special edition, 'The Songwriting Interview') seems to suggest
that he sees it more as a matter of _natures_ (see 'The Trees' for
an expression of the belief that there are definite natures which
people possess which differentiates them). The more positive flipside
of this view is that those with sufficient talent _and_ drive will
make it! Look at the history of Rush for reasons to believe this.

In regard to

&gt;It's cold comfort
&gt;For the ones without it
&gt;[To know] How they struggled   (the ones who made it!)
&gt;How they suffered about it  (the ones who made it!)
&gt;
&gt;Well this is saying the people who didn't make it can take some cold
&gt;comfort in the fact that the people who made it had to suffer greatly,
&gt;i. e. abandon families, tour the US for months, etc.  All they see is
&gt;the big houses and nice cars.  This goes into the "exotic and strange"
&gt;verse, and is trying to say that the normal people who want exotic
&gt;and strange lives have to understand that those who HAVE exotic and
&gt;strange lives often wish to escape them.

It may be that those who have exotic lives often wish to escape them
and this should be understood (a la ``Limelight'' for the fans) but I
think that these last two lines _don't_ refer to those who made it but
to those who struggled to make it but didn't. It's cold comfort for
themselves that only _they_ know how _they_ struggled and suffered.
That really makes it _cold_ comfort!

Seeing as the first two lines refer to those 'without it,' and
it is a rule of grammar that pronouns refer to the most closely
placed previous noun consistent with the context, it seems
clear that these last two lines refer to 'those without it.'

But as Winnie-the-Pooh once said: ''I could be wrong, I often don't
know what I'm talking about.''

Subject: few misc. things

	Just a few things I thought I'd throw in.
First of all, the interpretations going around lately about 1001001 are
kinda amusing but I think this is stretching it a bit.  Now it is quite
possible that Neil had this in mind when writing the song but up til now
most of his lyrical tricks have seemed more apparent and definate once they
were ponted out.  You (or at least I) have to talk yourself into believing
this one.

	About Columbia House's selection of Rush. I wrote them a letter a
while back asking if they had any other stuff besides Presto and they wrote
back to me (in an impressively short period of time) saying that to offer
any groups' albums they have to make a deal with the record company first.
Now this would make sence since Presto is the only album from Atlantic
and all the others are on Mercury but I also asked if they had any Pink Floyd
stuff (many of which are on Columbia) and they gave me the same answer. Is the
Columbia record label the same as Columbia House? I don't know, whatever. I
gotta split, see ya later.
