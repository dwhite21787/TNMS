As some of you may have noticed, the "secondary postings" (catch-up postings)
the last two days were repeated articles from previous digests.  Somehow, even
though I move (not copy) the mail file to another name to work on it, the mail
items remained in the original file.  This shouldn't happen, but did somehow.
I cleaned up the file containing the rest of the old posts, and now have a
file noone but me has seen.  This will be coming out in two parts, half today
as the second NMS, and half tomorrow as the second NMS.  Sorry 'bout that,
folks.  *sigh*

I've updated the "song.parodies" file at the ftp site - it now contains the
parody "Geographa".  If someone notices any other parodies missing, please
drop me a line at the admin address.  Thanks!

I'm from Austin, Texas, and don't know what the hell MuchMusic is.  We only
get Psuedo-Music Television, which as we all know basically sucks!  Anyway,
is it only aired in the northeast or something?  Maybe in the west?  Please
let me know, I'm curious as to where I could see it.  BTW, we also get VH1,
not much comfort either.

Well, that Gonzalo guy from Dartmouth may have been blotto, but his
assessment of the band was by no means inaccurate.
	Perhaps his buzz allowed him to speak freely about the band rather than
speak with pent up frustration like those who insist that the band is a
Trinity of Gods!
	Yeah, buddy. Signals Was guitar driven. Bass powered. Permanent Waves
was the same story. Grace Under pressure has some nice arrangements, but
when you get down to it, the guitar is "airy filler" repeated melodic
patterns that do just that.... repeat and go nowhere. That pretentious
PPGwave synth that pervades the album makes me want to gag... Ear Candy.
 I've done the piano/synth/sampler thing for quite sometime now,
however, I like the fact that everyone has reduced the keyboards in RTB.
	I am about as good at guitar as you, Gonzalo. I can play, but I am,
well, average. I picked up the guitar on my own with my piano knowledge.
Never had lessons.
	Maybe I should get drunk out of my mind and write to the NMS\
		Well....

Hotel California's "Steely" reference is not* a drug addiction reference.
Y'see, there was a Steely Dan album called "The Royal Scam" where therein
resides a song that, during a couples' heated argument they say "Turn up the
Eagles, the neighbors are listening".  The Steely reference in "Hotel
California" was returning the favor.  This was even in a Henley interview.
Anyway, it's not necessarily a rush-topic, but thought I should bring it up.

  At any rate, as per the concert in Minneapolis - I knew we weren't gonna get
CD quality sound, but the new Timberwolves (read:  "The Target Center") really
sucks for live sound.

 I don't know who said Eric Johnson was just a speed merchant, but you're so
wrong.  His albums are steeped with feeling.  Alex's solos during the concert
that night were very good, and his tone was much better than the awfullly cold
techno tone he used on the "bones" album.

 I won't say any more, since I don't want to spoil peoples' good times.

 p.s.  SPOILER.  They played XANADU.

  Does anyone know how to play the guitar lick at the end of Part I

ABWH did something similar in one of their songs (I forget which, I don't
have the CD with me), where they mention things like "the roundabout".  I
thought "Presto" was a little better, though.
------Dan says----------------------------------------------------------
The song is track 6. Also can't remember the name. I want to say
"The Meeting" That may be it. It pulls a lot of old Yes songs into the
lyrics...personally, while it may be more obvious, I think it was
better...opinions, opinions...

 I have noticed that several people have mentioned that Rush Fans
 usually like Star Trek. I will attempt to submit a list that will
 describe the "typical" Rush Fan:

 1). Likes Star Trek, Star Wars.
 2). Reads Science Fiction.
 3). Is near-sighted.
 4). Is into computers. (Duh!-Stating the obvious :))
 5). Is a loner but not really lonely.
 6). Has at least a beginners knowledge of some musical instrument.
 7). Has, or wishes they had, a denim jacket with the 2112 artwork on   the
     back of it.
 8). Likes their catalog of albums, but thinks the older stuff is a li  ttle
     better.
 9). Wonders if all the books, songs, movies, and national radio hosts
     that have the word "Rush" in their names/titles is a good or a ba  d
     omen. (Since we have been seeing this happen quite often, recentl  y).
------Dan Says----------------------------------------------------------
1) Yup...and Dr. Who
2) Yup...and espionage
3) an astignatism in my left eye...doesn't impair my functioning
4) my major is computer science
5) hate people, have lots of friends and a fiancee
6) play guitar, bass, keyboard, and trombone
7) Have a denim jaket with Irom Maiden's "Somewhere in Time"
8) Old Rush is definalty better   (CD's)
9) Could care less
     Well, if you take statistics and sample spaces...this is a
     SMALL percent. :)

exact time....i own a battered walkman....no hi-fi set :-(   )

  Are we oblivious to the quality
  This quality of ....???...in every city street.
After the above lines, listen closely.  Somebody talks...
-----Dan says-----------------------------------------------------------
I think this has been brought up before...  Anyway...it is at
8 minutes, 30 seconds into the song (if I have the right song
in mind)  To me, and what I heard was:
  Alex Burped and the voice is someone(geddy?) saying "Good Lord Alex"
I can definalty hear the burp.

well my good friends in the big world around me, tonight was heaven seeing 
who else?? ****Rush**....  Words can't describe the atmosphere with their 
perfectionate sound,playing and energy that 3 men produce with the love of 
music!!

tomorrow 11/14/1991, i'll be seeing the guys again at  aulburn hills at the 
palace on main floor, 18th row, with a little alchol in veins, and with 
good friends...what more can someone ask for? i think seeing them tonight 
was the peek
of my life, but tomorrow will capture the memory again of the excitement 
i've just explained to *you*.......

each year their music gets  tighter, absoulute no mistakes, no strain or 
worry on their faces, just 3 guys having a good time as entertainers!!!!....

there is just no other band that can touch their glory of musicc, and what 
they've accomplished thru the yrs....

everyone probally already knows whats songs their playing, every single 
move and whats next with a trick up their sleeve ((from previous postings 
on tnms)), but all i can  say is....

*****experience the concert, don't miss out on it..... there will be a never 
in my life that i'll ever miss a **rush** concert again!!!*****

you just have to be there to appriciate what these 3 musicians can do on 
stage to peform for their audience.... like i said, there is no words that 
can touch meaning.......................

*** well, i think my words from my mind has givin the opinnion of the 
concert that i've just witnessed!!!!!!!!!!!  ******

&gt; The Roll the Bones video was on eMpTyV??  I was at someone's

&gt; those incredible girls in the videos...) I was there for several
&gt; hours, so they definately aren't giving it the priority that
&gt; they give to MC Hammer or Paula Abdul (surprise!!!)

I don't get to watch MTV too much, but when I do, I think they are
hyping MC Hammer far too much... this 2 legit thing is stupid... I
mean, even on his new Adam's Family song, there is a chorus with 2
legit in it! arrgghhh

Anyway, they can play Paula all they want! ;-)
I'm going to see her tonight... Got my ticket last night, when I
ordered tix for Rush at the Worcestor centrum!!!!!!!!!!

My Rush tickets don't appear to be very good, seating wise... Does
anyone know how Lower Side is? The drone at Ticket Bastard couldn't
tell me... Oh well, I never stay in my seat at the Centrum anyway,
which is how I ended up in the third row for the HYF tour...

Hi there,

&gt;From the tour dates I've seen on this list, I more or less assume the
boyz will be heading for Europe in april next year (aaarrrgghh, that's
a long time to wait). I called the agency which organises concerts here
in Holland, but they told me they didn't know anything ("but they have
a new album out", heck, I knew that) and they weren't even negotiating
about a concert. So the question is, if anyone knows something more
than just "they will do Europe this year", please post. Maybe
someone in some other European country could try and call the
organising agency. If I know a date and place, I could arrange for a trip.
Anyway, I'm dying for some more specific information...

check out this situation, folks:

I walk in from class, begin rewinding the 6 hour recording of empty v
from the previous night(as suggested by the last guy who saw it) and while
im rewinding, i change from CNN to MTV. All i see is a storewindow with
RTB posters on it.

The VCR started recording....YEA!

Without going on at length I'll say that anyone who liked Lock and Key
will love RTB. The 'terminator eyes' skeleton is cool, and neil's set
looked like one of those teal Lexus' with the gold lettering(good)

YEA!YEA!YEA!

      First I'd like to say I will be seeing the Boyz in a matter of days

This in decimal is 73. So does this mean anything?? Am I just looking too
deeply?? (well probably)  I've been thinking about this for a bit and 
haven't been able to come up with anything.
