First, on the upcoming live album: The release date has been pushed forward
a week, it is now due for release on the 10th of November. "Animate" is
still set to be the first single, but won't be out until mid-October.

Second, thanks to EVERYONE who has filled out the on-line petition, and who
has posted something on the RNR HOF message board! The petition now has 
nearly 800 names, and the message board went from 70 posts to 564 in a 
matter of *6* days! I would say it is the MOST active board they have, and
a *HUGE* thanks to those of you who posted thoughtful, intelligent words
rather than reply to someone's idiocy :-)  As one person pointed out, 99.25%
of the posts under our thread are positive! Keep it up, we only have until
October!

And I wanted to say a big, huge, enormous thanks to Donna Halper, who started
the ball rolling on the Hall of Fame campaign!

     Ryan,
     
     While I have not been a subscriber to TNMS for as long as you, I find 
     that it doesn't take long to get a sense of the same frustrations that 
     you wrote about.  We are all "here" because of our common devotion and 
     admiration for Rush.  So, as you say, let's have a little FUN!!  Rush 
     are renowned for having fun, both on stage and in the studio.  Let us 
     carry on this tradition, in the name of Geddy, Alex and Neil, and have 
     FUN on TNMS!!
     
     Peace, brother.

Is it more than likely that RUSH will do a new tour to promote the new
upcoming album and if so, would Nashville, TN be a possible tour date?
I hope that I am not asking this question too early. I think I am just
excited.

btw, I do believe there's a ghost of a chance will find someone to love
and make it last.    

Long live RUSH!!!

Subject: Live Albums thread

Paul Smith wanted to start a thread about live albums.

Paul, I thought your selection was admirable - here's my take:

1. Live and Dangerous - Thin Lizzy: duelling guitars par excellence!
Emerald and Boys Are Back In Town spring immediately to mind.

2. Strangers in the night - UFO: I never got to see UFO live, but what a
rock-out show it must've been!

3. Seconds Out - Genesis: I agree with you entirely on this one!

4. Frampton Comes Alive - Peter Frampton: Energy, great songs, and
superb guitar work - what more could you possibly want??

5. Live Tapes - Barclay James Harvest: Atmospheric and very moody, this
one brings back lots of fond memories...

6. Under A Blood Red Sky - U2: Raw energy combined with meaningful,
heartfelt lyrics...what went wrong??

7. Made In Japan - Deep Purple: In their heyday Purple were possible one
of the most aggressive progressive rock bands. Space Trucking and Child
in Time just out and out rock. First album I really learned to
air-guitar to (is that a good thing??).

These are the ones I thought of after your post - I'm sure there are
others that warrant a mention from that era. And let's not forget ATWAS
  as some people have pointed out recently it is possibly the one live
Rush album which has captured the guys as they should be heard. Officially.

Live Cream (I think) - Cream: Clapton was God for a month or two.

think of them right now. Soily? Let Me Roll It? Maybe I'm Amazed? Maybe.
Well produced though.

Has anyone else here bought To Hear Amazing Things from Scarred Records?
It's pretty cool - great packaging, and a complete TFE show, with some
extras. Good recording quality (far better than the Virtual Songs MP3s
I've heard). BTW, I'm still waiting for VS from Prism - what's the

hey this is my first time posting to this list  even though i've been 
subscribing for a fucking year (can i cuss on here? ;) just thought i'd 
start dropping my own opinions in since issue #2112 is coming up and i 
just think that's cool. well, i like to think i'm a big RUSH fan but i 
only skim this list whenever i read it so... probably not as big as you 
guys. but i fucking love them... well, i know you've heard it all 
everytime someone new starts posting stuff so i'll stop now. 

i was skimming issue 2097 when i saw someone complaining about waiting 
two and a half months for the live album. fuck, i dind't even know one 
was coming out. and i call myself a fan... well, the only reason i 
brought it up is to say this... i noticed it cause he typed it as 
2 1/2 and those numbers caught my attention. 212... coincidence? my 
locker in school was number 212 too. i was just wondering if anyone is 
as lame as me and uses numbers like 2112 and 212 for stuff. hell 2112 is 
my pin number for my bank card and 21312 is my voicemail access code 
(the 3 is my own business- don't ask :p)...

yeah so RUSH isn't my favorite band... pantera is.... does anyone else 
here listen to all metal and RUSH is your exception? RUSH is definetly 
like my 2nd or 3rd fav though... depends on my mood. but pantera is 
always on top...

everytime i've ever subscribed to a list there's people who hate each 
other, always agree with each other, etc. i'm too lazy to read a bunch 
of back issues and work it out (told ya i never really read them 
carefully)... so fill me in.... what cliques have been formed in this 
digest? hehe...

ok, not much more to say- someone write back to me so next time i 
actually have something that isn't pointless to talk about...

Was at the Tennessee Civil War Museum in Chattanooga a few 
weeks ago.  They have a display on the flag signals used in the 
civil war.  

Holding the flag to the right was position 1.  To the left position 2.  
Straight in front was 3.

Then they had predefined combinations that meant different things.  
And sure enough, on the list was 2112 (left, right, right, left).  The 
meaning: Move or Proceed. 

In war time, Moving and Proceeding could be called Rushing. :)

Subject: Issue # 2112

I believe that Indy (SPEAKENDER@aol.com) had a great idea for what to do
for issue # 2112.  Only, with a bit of an improvement.  I think that on
the day that issue # 2112 hits our mailboxes, we should all go out and
buy a copy of our favorite Rush album, and give it to someone we know who
isn't a Rush fan.  But (and here's my improvement), I think we should all
try and get all the *other* Rush mailing lists out there involved in this
celebration, too.  Surely they'd understand a celebration of issue 2112.

I think we should.  (But I'll leave it for someone else to organize...I
just come up with the ideas.  ;) )

<<10) 2112 Overture - Paul Roraback (from HM Records - The Mother Of All
Tributes) Paul is the drummer from the band Grammatrain who plays all the
instruments on this song.This is a great version.I almost couldn't
distinguish between this and the original it's that good!
Rating:*****>>

Also, you all might want to check out 'TEN: The Birthday Album' on
ForeFront Records.  It has a cover of Grammatrain playing the song "God",
by Rebecca St. James.  (I know, it has nothing to do with Rush, BUT --- 
) You can *really* hear the influence Neil has had on Paul, especially in
this song.  He's playing all sorts of rides that Neil plays, and some
great rhythms....it just all around kicks butt!!

Chris,
I don't see it as a contradiction at all because Neil is addressing two very
different situations.  IMO, just because we choose to exercise freewill does
not in any way mean that we're always free.  In Freewill, I think Neil is
simply saying he will choose freewill (and the unspoken lyric could continue
"if actually given a choice").

In Entre Nous, Neil is talking about different people as "islands to each
other" and how we try to make connections by "building hopeful bridges on a
troubled sea."  But at the same time Neil stresses that some people burn
bridges, and because freewill cannot determine what *other* people do, and
the bridges *other* people try to build, Neil just points out that we would
not choose some bridges.  

IMO, the summation of the distinction between the two songs is this: we all
need to exercise freewill in as great a capacity as we are capable, in the
realm of things that are under our control.  Unfortunately, some things out
of our control, and we can't have an impact on them.

Humble and dumb,

Jason

I would have to completely disagree with this last statement.  Some of my
favorite bands I got into by first buying their live albums.  If having to
decide between a greatest hits album and a live album, I ALWAYS choose the
live album, because you can feel the energy better.

One point I agree with is that I also do not want to see CTTH and TS on the
live album.  Been there, done that.  But based on my purchase history, I
can see why a record company would want a few big hits on this album to
attract a buying audience.  I think it is a good business decision.

Let's also not forget that previous Rush live albums are all on Mercury
while DS will be on Atlantic.  Atlantic wants to give that first time buyer
an incentive to buy DS instead of ESL, ATWAS, or ASOH.  If a first-time
buyer is trying to find a live recording of some of Rush's earlier hits
because he/she really liked that "Tom Sawyer" or "The Spirit of Radio" song
he/she heard on the radio, DS will be a great buy for the buyer because of
its length and song selection.  It will be a great buy for Rush because it
will give the most diverse collection to date from the Rush catalog, which
could lead the buyer to purchasing more Rush albums in the future.  It will
be a great buy for Atlantic because the consumer chose Atlantic over
Mercury.  Without some of these older songs, that first time buyer probably
would have bought ESL from Mercury.  For better or worse, that's business!

By the way, when I was just a casual fan of Rush, I owned two albums: ESL
and ATWAS.  Casual fans DO buy live albums.

Anything can happen!

Hey, I LOVE the Beastie Boys.... They're the only "rap" group that has ever

Well, I got a lot of good responses, however I had hoped that they would
be put on the post because it would be a nice change of pace.  I had my
own interpretation, but some of the responses made me think about it a
little differently.  Well, too bad. 

Here's another question:  please post your answer in the post, or me,
whatever.  If it's good, I'll post it, anonymously!

In "Totem", Neil says that his "unspoken holy vows" are "thoughts to keep
well hidden."  Yet, if his religious ideology is so personal, why has he
expressed his beliefs in numerous songs (Ghost of a Chance, Freewill,
Totem, etc.) and his book "The Masked Rider?"

I have my own answer, but let's here yours!

Subject: Responses to a bunch of stuff

Hi all,
Okay, first off the discussion about Entre Nous and the ability to choose.
We may not always want to make a choice, but are forced to do so. This is
the story behind "Sophie's Choice". If you don't know, a young mother
(Sophie) and her little son and daughter are captured (By Nazi's if I'm not
mistaken) and held at gunpoint. Sophie must choose one of the children to
be executed, or all three will be killed. So she didn't want to make a
choice between her precious children, but she was forced to. (Don't ask
which she chose or if she didn't choose, I don't remember.)
	Next up for my opinion is the tape that is being made for Hanstones'
wife's cousin. Why did you delete Manhattan Project? That is my favorite
song on PoW. It flows so well, and the message in the song is a good one.
Man, I really need to get my own copy of PoW so I can listen to it.
	Okay, and now for my High School Rush experience. Our Marching Band (Go
Warriors!!) went on a trip, and I was sitting in the back with the cool
people in the drumline. We had a boombox, and Ric was playing 2112 and RTB.
That was the first I had heard a lot of Rush, and I loved it! After the
band trip, I had to go out and buy my own copy of 2112. That was my first
Rush album, to be followed a few years later with T4E, Chronicles (which I
lost), HYF (Thanks, Dave), Rush, and Retrospective II (which I love). I
guess you could say I am a casual fan, but all my friends think I'm a freak
for knowing so much about the band (Due to TNMS and talking to fans). And,
speaking as a "casual fan", I will buy the live album, mostly because it
contains a lot of songs on it that I do not have the studio version of. I
love the songs on DS (Looking forward to having YYZ finally) and I find
that the listening to the compilation albums/Live albums help me decide
which Rush CD to buy next.
	I am currently working on getting my boyfriend to listen to Rush.
Hopefully spending my vacation with him will turn him into a Rushian too.
Thank you, Dave for turning me into a fan, and thank you Ric for
introducing me to their music.
	Okay, that's enough for now. Sorry it's so long.
Love,
Erica

 Hey!

For those who have never read Donna Halper's story regarding 
the "discovery" of Rush, follow the link below. For those who
have heard the story, go read it again! Maybe after you help to
nominate Rush to the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame. Remember if
you post a message and a non-rush fan flames you, that "flamer"
looks like an idiot. BUT, if you respond to said "flamers" message,
it makes *all* Rush fans look like idiots. Let the non-fans flame
all they want. Responding to them does not help this cause.

Dear Fellow Rush Fans,

	Hey hows it goin?  I thought I would share this little Rush related 
thing.  I was watching MTV today, and the show was "Sifl and Olly".  
They have all these different things they do as jokes.  They were doin a 
news thing, and the weather came on.  The name of the weather board was 
called Weather Meter 2112.  I am pretty sure this was meant towards Rush 
because they really like rush.  If ya wanna catch this show, it is on 
MTV at 12:30 EST.  See ya!

from the home office in Willowdale, Ontario:

>Top Ten Silliest Things About Being a Rush Fan

10.  Explaining "I Think I'm Going Bald" to the initiate.

 9.  Upon learning that a remixed "Tom Sawyer" has suddenly been released on a
sound track for a film you would not have TAKEN money to see, you start
thinking, "'Small Soldiers', huh?  Might be worth a look."

 8.  Picturing Ayn Rand and Aimee Mann beneath the sheets, going at it hot and
heavy.*

 7.  How your ears prick up when someone says, "Hey look, Stephen!  Red
Barchetta collector china plates!"

 6.  Praying, "Please, god, let this post be in Issue #2112."  [I already have
the frame picked out, so it can hang on my wall.  yeah, right.  has anyone EVER
printed out an ENTIRE frickin' NMS?  I did.  The average was twenty-three
pages!]

 5.  Bill Banasiewicz.  [what ever happened to Steve Getz or Brian Harrigan?]

 4.  Deciding which ball shirt to wear on Office Casual Day...hmm, the g/p is
symbolic but bland, the Moving Pictures with the witch burning sends TOO MUCH of
a message, the wolf howling at the moon is cool...sigh, so many choices, so few
fridays...

 3.  Catching an MST3K Rush allusion during the show and jumping up to point at
the tv and explain it to everyone while they're shouting, "Just shut up about
it!"

 2.  Discovering Rush fans who have named their pets after band members. 
[alright.  when i was thirteen i had a cat named, "cygnus".  i was thirteen,
okay !?!]

 1.  Trying to decide whether to paint a five-pointed star OR a pentagram on the
floor while listing to The Trees.

Subject: Hemispheres is related to The Fountain of Lamneth?

Hi fellow Rushian,
	I think I just made an amazing and strange discovery. We all know that
Cygnus X-1 and Hemispheres has to do with Greek Gods and stuff. Well I'm
an expert on Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology. I heard of Apollo but
I never heard of Dionysus until I heard Hemispheres. Well anyway, I
thought that somewhere I might have had a chart that can translate the
name of Greek Gods to Roman (Latin) Gods and vice-versa. I found the
chart. Anyway, I saw that Apollo is the same in both Greek and Latin,
but I already knew that. Then I found Dionysus on the chart and Dionysus
in Latin is Bacchus. As in "Bacchus Plateau" from The Fountain of
Lamneth. Wow that's strange. Both songs must be connected in some way.
Has anyone made this didscovery before I did?

   And now for a humorous interlude (to tone down all this crappy 
negative mish-mash that has plagued these postings for a while):

     A friend a mine, who lives here in Florida, used to vacation in 
Northern Michigan with his folks. After he went off to college, he and 
his friends found themselves bored out of thier minds one summer. He and 
his friends decided to tag along on one of his family's vacations to 
Michigan. Of course, at that point in thier lives, he and his friends 
main highpoints of thier day was --- getting drunk. Well, the family 
went out one day to play volleyball. Of course, my friend and his 
buddies were drunk, in the a.m. hours. They went along to join in the 
volleyball game, but my friend was too drunk to play (GEEZE-- too drunk 
to play volleyball !!??)Anyways, he decided to sit in a lawn-chair and 
watch the game. After a while a lady came up and spoke to him for a bit, 
she then went over to say hi to his mom. After a few minutes of 
conversation, the lady said to my friend's mother "That's quite a nice 
boy over there, is he your son?" "Why, yes he is" she replied. The lady 
stood there for a moment, and then said "It must take a lot a patience 
to bring him on family vacations and stuff". My friends mother got a 
puzzled look on her face and said "Whatever do you mean?" The lady then 
asked, "Well, what is his exact mental-handicap?" My friend's mother 
laughed and said "Oh, he's just drunk!!"

(How is this Rush-Related, you ask? Well, in the front of a certain tour 
book, Neil relates a story of many nights drinking and playing 
volleyball, and how he always found himself going into the "Dark and 
scary woods" to retrieve the ball after it was knocked out of the 
light.)

Newbie alert!  Hit the dirt!  Grab some real estate!  :-)

I was glad to hear Pat Metheny mentioned.  A friend of mine gave me some of 
his songs, most of which I was impressed by.  I appreciate the album 
suggestions and will have to check them out.  I borrowed "We Live Here" from 
my local library, but was not too impressed.  I'll pursue Metheny further.

In the jazz realm, I've been getting into the Rippingtons.  I wonder if Neil 
would be envious of Steve Reid's percussion kit!  If it makes a noise when 
struck, pulled, or rattled, Steve Reid has it.  Imagine those two doing a 
drum/percussion duet....

ObIntro: Rush fan since hearing "Cygnus X-1" and "Hemispheres" played and 
anlayzed in my freshman English class in high school, 1979.  Only been to 
one concert (USAir Arena, Largo, MD, April 1994).  Favorite song: "Xanadu." 
Favorite album: hard to say today; there are so many that I like for various 
reasons.  I didn't like Presto very much, so it surprised me to see how many 
folks on here really like it.  *Chacun ses gouts*, eh?

ObRushSighting: regularly see on the way to or from work the MD license 
plate "BY-TOR".  It's not on the NMS license plate page, though.

Finally, any fans of the late Michael Hedges on here?  Hedges doing a cover 
of, say, "Closer to the Heart" might not have been out of the question, 
given other covers he'd done.

Good to be here!

>>Does anyone remember Kerry Von Erich, the "Modern Day Warrior"? He was
billed that, from the line in "Tom Sawyer", in fact TS was his entrance
music for years & years. 

Yes, as an individual who once was quite a student of pro-wrestling (hey, I
was young, and I had time on my hands!)  I remember Kerry Von Erich gracing
the fabled Dallas Sportatorium many a time to sounds of "Tom Sawyer."  He,
sadly was yet another example of what fans have termed "The Von Erich
Curse"--all but one of the sons of wrestling legend Fritz Von Erich, that
being Kevin, have committed suicide over the course of the years.  Kerry's
greatest achievement was beating all-time great Ric Flair for the NWA World
title at the David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions in Dallas, back in
the mid-'80s.  He also came aboard the WWF in the early nineties as "The Texas
Tornado" and surprisingly beat "Mr. Perfect" Curt Henning for the Inter-
Continental title in '90 (his subsequent reign was NOT very remarkeable,
however).  In subsequent years he developed health and legal problems
involving an addiction to pain-killers (apparently he had been struggling with
it since an early eighties motorcycle crash that left one leg permanently
damaged), and then...quite suprisingly killed himself.  This was only a couple
of years following his youngest brother's suicide by gun-shot.  NO ONE
understands what troubles seem to fester in the Von Erich family psyche, which
has repeatedly claimed the lives of the young men, and everyone kind of
creepily waits to see if  Kevin--the last in line, and an individual whose
career has been dead for nearly ten years now--will morbidly follow suit (for
one I hope not...he always seemed to be the best charactered and best adjusted
of the brothers...as far as one who's only a fan can tell).

restaurant is apparently owned by an Irish company of the same name, no
idea if they are Rush fans. And rush-mgr, you were wondering if the Show Of
Hands shirts were bootlegs?  They ain't.  I bought one at the Presto show

Subject: rush sighting, sort of.... more of a rush moment

Today I was at a local large hardware/home warehouse type store, to buy
some casters (wheels) for one of my bass cabinets (topic of another
discussion of course). In that large store which shall remain nameless
cuz I am not in the mood for free advertising, is a major fast food
chain's express restaurant.  Well I thought I would have lunch...  my
order came to $6.12, and I dont like to carry alot of change, so I
figured I would get rid of some smaller bills and coins to get my change
in nice $5 increments. I looked in my wallet and had a 20, and a single,
and some change, so I figured I would go for $15 change, then I realized
I was handing the person $21.12, it was more of a rush moment than a rush
sighting, but it was not planned, and I thought it was cool!  I asked for
a receipt, but to my dismay, the receipt did not show the amount paid,
what a bummer! It would have been a cool souvenier!

But my stomach was full, and my amp rolls easier now that I have casters
instead of a dolly, come see the beat up cabinet that sounds great cuz I
play a jazz bass and use an SWR head, at tustin lanes, in TUSTIN CA on
Sunday Sept. 13th at 9 pm, see the kontrol-freq website for more info

Yeah, I bought it in the arena (Fiddler's Green), and payed the usual OBSCENE
amount for it.  I wasn't too keen on the Presto cover at the time.

Subject: Bowling

Why all this anomosity towards bowling? Did you know that in the mid to late
70's, while on tour, Rush would have "All night bowling parties!"  Yes this is
true as Geddy mentioned it in one of his interviews in Circus magazine a long
time ago.  Any questions?

Subject: Idea for #2112, Rush in Hall of Fame

Hey there everybody...
	I have an idea for issue #2112.  This might sound cheesy, but I
think it shoule be left blank.  That way we can all make it whatever we
want it to be.  It would be an excellent opportunity for all of us to
reflect on the music of Rush in our own way.  then regular postings would
resume in issue #2113.
	Also, I went onto the syrinx.yyz.com website and put my name on
the petition and made a post on the Inductees forum.  I URGE EVERYONE to
do the same!  There are 400 some posts on the forum, but there need to be
more!  Also, I was only #500-something on the petition.  More need to
sign up on there too!  
	Thanks for listening,
	Jon G.
