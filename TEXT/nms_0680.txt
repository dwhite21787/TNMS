I have to agree with Alan Ristow's comment on not liking Peter Collins as
a producer for Rush albums.  PoW is not all that great musically, and it
seemed as if the guys changed too much on PoW, most likely dur to the fact
that Peter was the producer.  Also, HYF was not all that great musically,
neither.  NOW before ya all flame me for saying those nasty things, I DO
belive that those two albums were some of the best lyrical work that Neil has
done.  I happen to really like those two albums for what was said and tend
to ignore the music in the background of the words.
Also, not to say that   &lt; OOPS!! &gt;
Rush shouldn't progress, I happen to like them alot for that fact.  The fact
that they are willing to try something different and not get locked-up in a
sound that happened to be popular for them.  I don't know if anyone else
noticed this but when a band has a really popular tune, that band makes their
next album sound just like that popular song.  This I feel tends to ruin a band
and the band tends to lose fans.  Thank whoever you belive to be the prime
mover (i.e, God, Allah, etc.) that Rush has not done this, though I do wish
they would make another long and interesting story in music form like they
did in the 70's; just think if Critical Mass were to have a continuation of
2112!

Next I have to agree with Alan again about School of Fish.  If you have not
heard their debut album School of Fish DO SO you will not regret it.

If you have the chance to see a band called Animation DO SO!  Animation does
covers of Rush songs and very well too.  They have played around my area for
many years and have now decided to go beyond the Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiania,
and Iowa locals.  The dummer of this band is really good and can do many of the
things that Neil had done so well.

Last thing, I am glad that black holes and wal basses discussion are over
with!!!!!!

Hmm... I never seemed to have that 'problem.' I'd heard "Tom Sawyer"
on the radio, and loved it, but I always seemed to miss the name of
the band. Then a friend told me it was Rush, and gave me an old copy
of ASOH. As soon as I heard it, I was hooked. Geddy's bass, Neil's
drums, Alex's guitars-- it was magic! I couldn't resist, and went
immediately out and bought _2112_, and MP. As a bass aficionado (my
main instrument is keyboards), Geddy just sent me into a coma. Sorry,
but I have no sympathy for the "can't we just like them without
worshipping their every doing?" crowd. 'course I had to make room for
my Tori Amos shrine in the corner last year, but on the whole, my Rush
temple is sanctified! :)

Subject: RushFan(Tm) Defined
Date: Tue, 11 May 93 23:31:59 EDT

Hy,
  Greetings Fellow RushFans(Tm) and Neil Nuts,

  Let's get this over with as soon as possible.  This article has been
created from suggestions on the matter, Email Messages I've recieved, and
personal oservations over my years as a RushFan(Tm).  This article is ment
to be funny and entertaining, I intend no offence to anyone, All FLAMES
will be ignored!!! 'Nuff Said!!!
On wit' da Show.

Today a special feature:
                       THE RUSHFAN(Tm) DEFINED

  REPORT TO Alexander Snowdog--Head Librarian Temples of Syrinx-Megadon City

  Sir after extensive research into the subject I have prepared this report
on exactly what the make-up and traits of the speices Rushious Fana are, and
who to spot them.

  To begin with the speices Rushious Fana(here after to be called RushFan(Tm)
Seems to be a mutant strain of our own.  It seems that through exposure to
Music that is Amthema in our teachings, that there minds have been altered
in many subtle ways.
  1.  The first of these is that they seem to have a definite need to search
      for the meaning in everything that they come upon, esspecially in the
      lyrics of the Music of Rush.  They contend that Rush has the most
      meaningful lyrics of all bands ever assembled.
  2.  RushFans(Tm) also seem to a need to investigate musical insturments,
      each RushFan(Tm) seems to play(or at least contends that they play)
      at least one if not more insturment.  These instuments in all cases
      are those that we have marked a frivolus, silly, or destructive to
      society in general.  They even go so far so to play two stringed
      instruments, which we know lead to the destruction of the elder race.
  3.  The RushFan(Tm) holds The Band Rush in the highest esteem, and follows
      them as religiously , if not more than they should follow we of the
      temples.
  4.  The RushFan(Tm) has a definite feeling that life is an adventure of
      freewill, not the detiremined and properly placed path that we so
      valiantly try to set for them.
  5.  They recognize, and worship the Band as Gods at doing what they do.
  6.  They feel that the answers to all of lifes questions can be found
      in the lyrics to the songs of this group.

   In addition to the mind changes that have taken place the RushFan(Tm) has
many interesting Habits that they have developed.  These habits are at least
in my opinion dangerous to our society.
   1.  The RushFan(Tm) is almost invariably a Fan of the Television series
       Star Trek, Star Trek Next Generation, And Deep Space Nine.  They will
       go out of there way to attempt to see these programs.  These
       programs are of course marked as subversive by Temple Vision.
   2.  They can also be found to always include a quote or saying that has
       something to do with Rush at the end of TemplEMail messages.
   3.  It is has been found that the RushFan(Tm) is constantly in search
       of new recordings of Rush Music, wether these be original recordings
       or illegal copies of concerts(Then they are all illegal in the
       Temple's eyes)
   4.  They have started their own Paper the "National Midnight Star" feeling
       that the Temple Paper does not properly represent their feelings,
       interests, or opinions.
   5.  They spend a great deal of time getting opinions from other
       RushFans(Tm), all in an attempt to fully understand this group's
       Music. They refuse to accept our carefully formed Opinions on
       the effects of Music Such as this.
   6.  They spend a great deal of time trying to convert( addict, Deprogram)
       Fans of other Bands to become RushFans(Tm).  Several of them  have
       written extensive works on the subject.
   7.  The constantly discuss the reasons that the (M)usic of (T)emple
       (V)ision is so non-Rush related.
   8.  They have a great interest in where they can find Rush being played.

   There are several things that can be used to identify a RushFan(Tm)
   1.  All of them seem to be, or least attempt to appear to be of
       intelligent stock.
   2.  They all seem to be Computer users of some sort with at least a
       mild fanaticism for the machines.  Instead of the cautious and
       wary, and begruding use that should be made.
   3.  Electronics and technical, scientific things seem to hold a certain
       awe for RushFans(Tm).
   4.  The RushFan(Tm) tends to find the way in every situation that things
       relate to Rush, or work Rush into something.  A good example is one
       that I heard brought up that our society is Just like a Rush Song
       and that we should expect the elder race back anyday now.  Rediculous
       I say they went away in 2012, 99 years ago they are not coming back.
   5.  When ever Music of any sort is brought up they related it to and
       turn the conversation to Rush.

   We hope that this report has given you a better understanding of
RushFans(Tm) so that you may eliminate them properly from our society.
Please use this report to help you and the other priests to form a plan
of attack.

Subject: Choosy Rush Lyrics Part II

After reading over the FAQ and the obscure Rush trivia files, I think
the lyrics to Freewill is a very deliberate attempt to **** with our
minds!

"How many lights do you see?"
"Four lights"
"No, there are FIVE lights"
&gt;...
"I actually saw five lights..."

(paraphrase from Star Trek the Next Generation's mind games episode,
which was in turn lifted from Orwell's 1984)

While Rush *swear* that what they're singing is in fact exactly what's
listed in the lyrics.

2112.  Lucky number?  Two days ago, I opened my bank statement and the
amount in my savings account was $2112.  Hmmmmm.   That same day, I got a
summer internship which will help me build up my bank account again.  Pretty
cool if I do say so myself.  Coincidence?????  I think not!  There is no
such thing when talking about Rush!

From: BEEZUS@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu
Subject: Scott McMahan vs. the RUSH CASSETTE BUREAU

It looks like another classic case of that dreaded foot-in-mouth
disease, folks.  Scott McMahan (proud manager of the Genesis mailing
list) felt compelled to enlighten all of us NMS readers to the 'sham'
that is the RUSH CASSETTE BUREAU.  I'd like to thank him personally
for his unsolicited opinon.

The NMS is not a soapbox--its subscribers needn't every tiny nuance
and ambiguity spelled out for them.  The RUSH CASSETTE BUREAU is a
service that allows its RCBureaucrats to acquire AS MANY boots, radio shows, 
and audio interviews as they'd like to WITH ONLY HAVING TO
PROVIDE ONE (1) RECORDING OF THEIR OWN.  That's it.  And, as if this
fact wasn't made clear enough, the ONLY things a RCBureaucrat sends
the RCB is 1) return postage, 2) a reusable mailing package, and
3) their own cassettes to have material copied onto.  Unfortunately,
Scott wasn't able to grasp this notion after having read it four times
in the RCB Salutation post in Tuesday's NMS (well, that is assuming he
truly read the post in its entirity).

Mr. McMahan also persists "Why don't you just swap tapes with someone?
I did it last week and it worked!  Voila!"  That's fine and good, Scott,
but what if you live in Idaho, and you know that the recording you want
is in New Jersey?  Whaddaya do?  Why, send 'em a tape!  (This is also
considering the person in New Jersey doesn't charge you $20 to do it.
You see, Scott, we don't.  Reread the damn post.)

The RUSH CASSETTE BUREAU does not run on the "What's in it for me?"
ethic.  This is a co-operative by Rush fans for Rush fans.  And, contrary
to what Scott claims, there isn't a "middle man" involved here.  The RCB
has the recordings, you tell us which ones you want (one at a time), and
you get them taped onto your own blank cassettes (the quality is your 
preogative considering you're sending 'em).

A careful re-reading of the RCB Salutation post immediately refutes
ALL of Mr. McMahan's pretentions.  Personally, I think he's pissed because
he didn't think of the idea first.  Oh, well...

I am sorry to have wasted everyone's time basically telling a confused
young man to remove his head from his anal cavity.  Again, I am sorry.

   [ This is *very* close to a personal flame. Please, if you wish to discuss
     this further take it to e-mail. Personal flames are NOT tolerated on the 
     Rush digest.						: rush-mgr ]

Subject: A memo to a lower office

Hy Fellow e(M)pty(TV) Haters, and RushFans(Tm),

Today the long awaited Sample Letter to MTV/VH-1&lt;&lt;Take your pick they
Both Suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a basic letter to MTV and VH-1 concerning their abject lack of
musical taste and need to get a clue about what music is all about.

Dear [MTV/VH-1] program Director,

     I[We], the undersigned would like to make a comment on the programming
that is shown on MTV[VH-1].  We represent the fans of a Musical Group that
you seem to have forgotten exists, RUSH!!!!.  In our opinion it seems that
you have in recent years had something against airing videos, by this group,
or actually by any group that falls into the same sort of Music categories
(although we all know that RUSH!! is in a category all by itself) that Rush
fits into.  We can find no reason other than abject prejudice against this
oh so worthy band, that their music is not aired in the volume and with
the respect that they so richly deserve.
        We ask that you please take note that this group released the CD
Roll the Bones Back in 1991, and to the best of my[our] knowledge the videos
from this album got minimal air play at best and never in prime viewing
hours, for critical exposure.  The One time I the writer of this letter
can ever remember having seen the Roll The Bones Video was at 3am in the
mourning.  You have in fact in all of the history of your channel not played
Rush at all well in your rotation.
        The usual comeback that I[We] would expect to hear is that you play
what is popular.  You and I[We] know a little better than that, you also
control what becomes popular by what you play.  It is my[our] contention
that if you bothered to play videos by Rush, you would see that many people
would watch and make requests to you that they keep playing strongly in
your rotation.
        The greatest threat that I[we] have seen is how fragmented your
programming has become recently.  There is a time for that sort of music,
and a time for this and that, unfortunately that tends to leave some music
with no place to go.  A second threat is that the music you play recently
is for the most part by bands that have sold out to commercialism, and basic
public ass licking.  Bands that are rated more on looks and ability to
achieve the "right" sound than to make good music.  Some of the music is not
even played by the people performing, rather there is a group of men/women,
who stand in front, sing, dance and look good while some nameless band in
the background does all the work.  You are promoting the idea(and making it
seem to work) that anyone can get into music.  Instead the Idea that it takes
hard work, talent, and perseverance should be what is promoted.
      The point has to be raised that there are a great many bands that
would have never made it had MTV not been there to make their career ,in
music painless and easy.

This section specific to MTV:
       The slogan that you use of late is "The Music Revolution of the 90's
will be televised".  The question is the revolution of who's choosing,
who is to be the guidance of the direction this revolution will take.
I personally think it should be the listeners and watchers, of the music.
Evermore I find that it is instead MTV, and the Record Companies money
that will be the guidance of this revolution.  To put it bluntly, anyone
willing to kiss enough ass and pass out enough green, can make it in music
today.
      This is wrong, we the audience should decide what we want to see, or
listen too.  We do not need to be told what to like and have it forced down
our throats.  It seems actually that you as a station have given up on Rock,
it is not often that I flip by MTV and see a Video that is not Rap, Hip Hop,
Dance or some of that sort of Garbage.  I'm sorry, but when one sees the same
video on for the 8th time in as many hours, one get disappointed.

This Section for VH-1:
        A prime example of your passing over of Rush is the A-Z music
marathons, or what ever you call them.  Rush is not included in these
ever!!  There are plenty of Rush Videos that would fit rather well in the
context of this program and you throughout the program more or less say
that I includes just about every band that ever bothered to make a video,
you include Queen, why not Rush?

Back to the letter in general:
        I the writer of this letter, listen to a station in Boston WAAF
107.3Fm, as I listen to the station it occurs to me how few of the songs
I have ever seen videos for on your channel.  I know videos exist for
a great deal of these songs, a trip to the store proves that.  Where are they?
Why do I never see them on your channel?  Oh, I know, no $$$$ from the
record companies.
        Alright to make a point in here somewhere, Rush will be releasing a
new CD in the coming months, as I'm sure you know, but are ignoring.  It would
be nice to see some video footage come out of you channel when the videos
for these new songs are made.

Thank you,

The undersigned Rush Fans.

   My idea on how to use this letter,
Print it out customize as you see fit for either MTV or VH-1,
Sign it(on a separate page),and get as many other people to sign it as you can.
Signatures should include as much of the following info as the signer is
willing to give.
Name    Address     Internet Mail Address  Phone #

Then send it back to me,
I will edit all of the changes, and additional ideas together into a new
letter , put it together with the signature pages and mail them off to MTV
and VH-1 shortly before Critical Mass is to be released.
Please remember to maintain separate signature lists for VH-1 and MTV as photo
copies usually don't count very well.
I figure if the signature arrive in one envelope, at the same time it will

have more force.

Please send submissions to:

Subject: why the concvention was a failure

I think the convention was a failure due to the fact that about 98% of all
the TNMS reader could never hope to make such a gathering due to lack
of money.  I told mr. Santore to have someone advertize this thing locally
in Toronto, which in my opinion would have been a great sucess, and we
the NMS's could have leech off the local....I suggested this twice, but
he ignored me!  I would have gone, but didn't sent the money since I knew
that it took about 10% of all the TNMS to make this a reality, and
knowing that the main audience are poor starving students..I knew
this had to be done with the help of outsiders.....I also suggested
NY as the place to have it....easily a 100 people would have made it there..
I'm sure there are at least 150 NMS'ers from that area alone...Again
my idea was defeated.....If he would only have listen to my many warnings
that this would never fly,.....oh welll...back to the Rush content..

About 4 years ago I meet a guy that told me that he had a tape from the
2112 era that contained many unrelease songs with Alex singing...
I don't usually buy this shit (and having been an avid collector of Rush
stuff for 8 years).....he was very sincere though....has anyone heard
about this tape before?????

Rush-mgr?  How about you Jimmy???? whats the deal with this strange rumor?

I don't think it's necessary to say people who are talking about this beep
(which is certainly not caused by movement of hands across strings) ought to be
classed under "get a life" banner.  It maybe that they're just trying to
determine whether they have a faulty CD.

It appears that certain copies of the CD are faulty in this respect.  My copy
of the CD is faulty, but I don't believe the vinyl version is (yes you can get
it the UK).  I have spoken to other people whose CDs don't have this beep.  And
one thing I'll tell you for free, if it was there you wouldn't need to examine
the song in detail to hear it.  Once you listened to it about 4 times you'll
hear it.

As an aside, I heard a similar report about Steve Rothery (of Marillion)
cocking up in a track on Misplaced Childhood.  My copy doesn't have, yet the
people I spoke, and who listened to my version said it was really clear on
their versions.

I'm sure the beep is introduced by the mastering process when different masters
are sent to different factories to produce the CD.  I don't believe Rush would
ever let such a mishap out, and it doesn't appear on some copies.

Subject: Marathon Intro

Hey,

I've been reading TNMS for a few weeks now, and finally felt I found a
post that I could provide a comment on when I saw the post on "Marathon intro".
What a surprise to see my friend L.S. Jr. (aka "Q") answer to the same post!  I
can't resist.

One particular technique Ged displays here is a neat "trick" I got the
hang of a few years back (I'm a bass player).  I was told this is a "triplet",
three equal notes played in the space usually reserved for two (please forgive
-- I've only had 1 music theory course).  Ged has used this a lot thru the
years (notably on Freewill, YYZ, and almost every song on PoW).  With
the Wal, he was able to add a funky, almost percussive tone to this trick.
I've noticed that, for Ged, the first two notes are usually on a higher pitched
string (in the case of "Marathon", the "G"), and the last note are on the next
lower pitched string (in this case "D").

Geddy is a great bassist, worthy of respect and admiration.  But as
Q attests, this is not an impossible feat.  What I've found difficult
is copying that percussive tone without investing in a Wal.  I've had
limited success (with a Rick, in fact).  The rest is a matter of
deterity, practice and *perhaps* talent.  RE singing while playing:
that's just plain coordination.  It too can be mastered with practice,
provided you're not a schlep.

	Hey ya'll!
I just wanted to take a moment to say.... What's wrong with country music?
There are those that are into Rush mostly because of the lyrical content, no?
Those of you who are " Englsh " majors and 'appreciate' the word play that
Mr Peart incorporates into his thoughts should listen to a few country artist,
and you will see he is not the only clever song writter. Oh I know I know...
But you don't like that twangie shit...I aggree, and  I don't either.... but
before we can have the additude that others listen to mostly *not so talented*
music..... try not to forget what they think of Rush..... You can't expect
Respect without giving it. And besides there is a lot of non-Twangie shit
country music out there!

Hi fellow folk of Rush!
I am looking to get a friend for his graduation present some sort of
boot video of Rush.  My friend is a total fanatic, alas, he doesn't have
net access.
I remember seeing a list a while back of material, and I have mailed meg jahnke,
with no reply.  End of term thang can be really taxing, I know.

Does anybody out there have any videos that are out of the mainstream of
commercially available outlets?  I am willing to discuss compensation and
or trade of other boots via email.

Please, I need to get this stuff together by May 29'th.

CAN THE FAIR PEOPLE OF THE NMS COME TO THE RESCUE!
stay tuned....

Cheers,

Subject: Peculiar "Pass"-ing sounds

As a first time responder to TNMS, I offer (what I believe to be) the
answer to Jamie W. Sandford's query about the awkward sound that
occurs in "The Pass" on PRESTO.

I too noticed this faint foible upon my third listening of the disc.
After I pointed it out to friends, they seemed amused but not
intrigued.  As a bass player (and worshipper of the bass god called
Geddy), I was surprised to hear this sound.  I believe the sound(s)
you are hearing are due to individual string harmonics on Geddy's
Wal.  If you listen carefully, the sound(s) seem to change pitch and
achieve that characteristic tonal quality of fingers sliding across
strings; a sound that I have heard many times before.  When I first
attempted to play this song on my own, I encountered similar sounds
and concluded that they were bass related.

I discussed my "Theory of the Sounds" with a musician friend, and we
agreed that the sounds you are hearing are discreet harmonics of the
D and G strings brought forth by the movement of a two-fingered chord
along these strings.

Note, however, that this is only my opinion and may be incorrect; but
I have yet to hear of any other plausible explanation for this
"noise".  I am curious to hear other explanations for this sonic
event.

Again, I point out that I have only recently discovered this
wonderful source of RUSH information and discussion.  I am forever
grateful to my fellow classmate who pointed me in the direction of
The Midnight Star.

Subject: Science Fiction

	Howdy all!  Maybe you can help me with this one.  In a Modern
Drummer interview Neil was talking about influences for songs and he is
quoted as saying "The song 'Science Fiction' happened to be set in the
future."  I've been listeneing to RUSH since 1978 and have never heard of
this song, any clues (I don't think that he meant 'Natural Science').
	A quick note - several people have questioned the printed lyrics
to Free Will.  I checked my vinyl copy and the lyrics there are "If you
choose not to decide you STILL have made a choice"  Maybe the cd is a
typo?

With regard to all the Prime Mover questions - all the religion talk

P.S. I know for a fact that Neil was MAJORLY influenced bt this book.

 I'd have to say "yes". It might indeed have sounded better without the rap.
Then again, it doesn't really misfit, and it broadens your musical horizons.
After all, "Signals" had quite a bit of reggea as well...

mention in his post a few issues past.  I was beginning to think that I was the
only one that appreciated that song.  The simplicity, the beauty of the word
play, the beat.  I just get the feeling from this song that they sat back and
simply jammed the tune, very relaxed feel.  I only get that feeling from a few
of their songs, i.e. Different Strings, Lakeside Park, a few of the movements
from Fountain of Lamneth, In The End, and Losing It to name a few.  Anyway, I
am rambling so I'll stop now.

Subject: a fanatic of COS

Hi Rushheads:

        I'm the computer sciences studient from near Barcelona that, when I
read the Digest 678, I found a big coincidence with the Derek Magill FAVES.
        I think that COS is a incredible record to listen alone. It has a
misterious atmosphere ( in themes like "No one at the bridge" "The Necromancer")
,very sensitive songs ("Lakeside Park","Panacea") and incredible and wonderful
songs. Sometimes I listen this LP at home alone and without light. Is the better
 way to enjoy with the eight wonder.
        In the Digest, is very common to find people that are very fans of the
last Rush stuff, but my Rush Period is the first. About my favorite Rush song
live performance is "The Red Barchetta" from the ESL. Is a wonderful story
with a lovely music.

        Has anyone another peculiar way to listen some songs of Rush?
        Is there anybody in TNMS that is a fanatic of COS?

        My apologizes for the mistakes of my english. If anybody have a little
time to correct me, please, send me an e-mail.
