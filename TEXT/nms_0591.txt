Subject: Re: Rush as a unit
Date: Mon, 4 Jan 93 19:13:34 PST
From: Will Hartung - Master Rallyeist &lt;villy@uunet.uu.net&gt;

&gt; I am beginning to wonder whether Rush is considered by the listening public as
&gt; an individual group of musicians, or a working unit.

Well, I've personally always considered Rush as One. The fact that
the members were notable in their own right is, maybe, a bonus.

On the other side of the coin, I've enjoyed the lack of notoriety
that the members have, at least in the press. I don't read any of the
assorted Music Magazines (whether it be Modern Drummer or something
like Rip...), but as I glance by them on the magazine racks, Rush and
it's members are almost never mentioned. I hear almost zero about them
on the radio (save their music), and their personal lives are a
complete blank to me. And that's GREAT! I would hope that they
appreciate that as well.

I recently had to drive 8 hours in a car with no music whatsoever, so
I picked up Chronicles on tape to listen to. I've never really
listened to the 'Rush' album, I don't own it. Of course, there are two
songs on Chronicles, and as you can imagine I listened to these tapes
probably over ten times. The songs are OK, but it's not Rush. I don't
think that Geddy says 'Baby! Oh Oh Oh!' in anything after 'Rush'.

So it got me thinking about what the band might be like without
Neil. I know I wouldn't be listening to them like I do today. And for
me, that's an interesting statement. Neil is the lyricist and
'percussion'. What really grabs me about Rush is the music. Rushes
music can consistently get my adrenalin pumping and blood rushing.
Their music has a lot of power, and for me it has a notably emotional
response. But I don't think the music would have this power or
strength if it didn't have to keep up with what Neil wants to say.

I know that Geddy and Alex work on the music in one room, while Neil
writes in another...and then they magically shuffle the two together
to get, well, Rush. But one side has to mold the other, and somehow I
don't see the music changing the lyrics as much as the other way
around.

So, if Neil never showed up, would Red Barchetta be about something
less? Same music, different lyrics? Would it exist at all? I would
think not. In fact, I imagine that if they didn't happen to come
together, Rush would not have lasted at all. Another band with some
party tunes knocking themselves out playing formulas.

Geddy and Alex found someone that could take their music and give it a
reason and a path, Neil found somebody that could bring the thoughts
in his head to life....Apart they're not much, but together they shine.

From: kadath!krothman@hico2.att.com!

The way the error is on my copy, which also creates a sensible explanation
for the others is that the if you use music search to go forward to the
track, the very beginning is cut off, however if you play it through from
YYZ, it is fine.  Apparently the first second (half second - whatever) is in
negative time, like an intro, but it shouldn't be an intro.

Strangely enough, Sony's Mastersound of Born to Run does that on every song,
I think they're all getting a bit sloppy.  Too bad.

Subject: YYZ Credits and "Tough Break"

 Hi all,

   Well, I'm back for Winter Session at the ol' U of D.  But the good news
is that I have a class entitled "Philosophical Ideas in Rock Lyrics" and
the professor loves Neil Peart.  BONUS!!

   Back to business.  I wa flipping through the booklet to my Moving
Pictures CD when I noticed that the song writing credits fro "YYZ" said
"Music by Lee and Peart".  This hit me strange.  Is this a misprint, was
Alex asleep, what's going on?  I assume it's a faux pas by the printer
because Geddy and Alex have written the music together since the beginning
of time.  Let me know, eh?

   Something I forgot about.  Remember back in the days of Signals when
Rush recorded a song called "Tough Break" with Jack Secret?  Well, did
anything ever come of that?  In other words, does anyone in the vast reach
of us Rush fans happen to have a copy of this tune?  I am seriously
doubting that anyone does, but I'm just curious.

   Does anyone have a copy of "You Can't Fight It"?  I have "Not Fade
Away" on tape, but I don't have and have never heard the B-side.  If
someone has it, let me know, I'd really like a copy.  Thanks.

   Some Terry Brown news for you.  I recently picked up the new Triumph
album (sans Rik Emmett) and Terry Brown produced the second track entitled
"Troublemaker".  Good fast tune, definitely for driving.

   For those of you who have mentioned Dream Theater, thanks again.  I saw
them live two weeks ago and they were amazing!  If anyone has any
questions or comments concerning Triumph or Dream Theater, please contact
me personally.     (06819@brahms.udel.edu)

What is the latest word on the release of the next Rush album? Does anyone
have a clue as to the title? Also, can any of the drummers out there play
the rythum method?

Subject: Power Windows lyrics and Richard Feynman

In-Reply-To: &lt;9301042330.AA13781@syrinx.umd.edu&gt;
&gt; I can't say that I think that Neil quoted or paraphrased Feynman (or his
&gt; biographer), but if _Genius_ is anywhere near as good as _Surely You're
&gt; Joking, Mr. Feynman_ (may have that title a bit off) or _What Do You Care
&gt; What Other People Think?_, I would recommend it highly.  I would dare to

I think there may have been a small misunderstanding. The
"quotes" in GD are not from Genius, but were around already.
NP must have just done some research and found them in some
other book.

The other books you mention are also very good, and make a
good introduction. Genius adds background and detail. There
are a lot of things RF obviously didn't feel needed saying,
or never revealed to anyone, but which have their place in
a bio. The letter to his dead wife on p221 for example.

It's certainly given me a new perspective on a Rush song, and
that is a good enough reason, but the books are of interest to
me anyway.

&gt; say that Feynman and Peart are kindred souls in that they are intense,
&gt; curious, and disciplined without taking themselves seriously.  The two

I fully agree with this. Their views on religion coincide. While
RF was oblivious to "culture" and music, he had an obsession
with rhythum and drumming.

The army medical examination that RF tells in SYJMF appears in
Genius, but with more detail and perspective. RF was also highly
sceptical about psychiatrists! "And *this* is medicine?"

I wonder if NP was ever drafted? (Does/did Canada have/had a
draft?) Maybe he would have enountered the same stupid
questions. In either case, it would have been a great loss
to have lost such talent to the army, who wouldn't know how
to use it anyway.

&gt; Well worth the $10 for the pair.

Go for it! You'll ROFL 'til your sides hurt, I promise. Then
you can decide whether to spend $27.50 on the bio. I can also
recommend watching the BBC Horizon programmes about RF, one
of which is an interview.

Well, that's enough about one song!

Subject: rush boots/prices/locations

   I have been reading about all the boots that are out, I decided that I must 
go in search of them.  Lucklly, I had little trouble finding them.  A small 
shop here in Charlotte carries them.  In fact, the fellow I talked to was a 
BIG Rush fan, and was able to tell me which ones he thought were the best.  At 
the time only three were in stock:

  The Fly  -  $25.00
  Mardi Gras -  $38.00  &lt;== much less than $59, Ian  :(
  New Rhythms(?)  -  $25.00  &lt;== Toronto, May '92, I believe

   &gt;From what I have seen, these are good prices.  The guy also said they should
be getting RFtF in sometime this month.  What I would do for $100 right
now...:)

   Another thing.  What would everyone think of creating a list of places they 
have found Rush boots (or other bands).  It can sometimes be hard to find a 
good music store when you have to move; it could also give a list of places to 
go on vacation.

   Fav bands--
    1.  RUSH
    2.  Queensryche, (old) Metallica, (old) Ozzy
    Others - Tyketto, Wagner (yes, the composer), Nirvana, Pink Floyd
