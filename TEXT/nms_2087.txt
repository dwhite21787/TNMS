The track listing may not be as fixed as we first thought. Someone
mailed me saying they have the promo sampler, and it contains
"The Analog Kid" from the Montreal Counterparts show, and "The Pass" from 
the Seattle RTB show. Perhaps they're still adding and dropping songs, or
perhaps they *were* intended for the live album, enough to make the promo,
but dropped at the last minute. Only time will tell...

Subject: anyone hear this

I was listening to a Buffalo radio station today and after Tom Sawyer the DJ
said that there is a cd coming out of all Rush tunes played on classical
instruments. He did not say if Rush was doing it or some other group but he
said sometime this year. Anyone else hear this rumor?
Also, I was disappointed with the exclusion of some songs especially since Tom
Sawyer and Spirit are included again. It is a shame that nothing from Presto
will be included, I was hoping for a couple of songs atleast. I was thinking
that maybe the record company "encouraged"  the boys to put more of the more
popular songs on the cd.
I don't know if this bothers anyone else but I hate when I put in a cd and
find out it's less then an hour in length. You can get 75 minutes on a cd and
I hate it when bands don't use all the available space. Rush is notorious for
this and it seems to me there would be room on the live package to add one or
two more songs just because they haven't used up the whole cd. If it's a
studio release and a band does not have enough material they should through on
some live cuts or interviews, something.
Also, if you get a chance listen to the Matthew Good band, the Watchmen, Big
Wreck, Moist, the Hip. they are all canadian bands and they all kick butt.   
Well those are my thoughts for the day.

I just checked out the Set list for the new live almbum and can't believe 
they did not include Cold Fire. I thought that was one of the better 
songs from CP. I can see why they almost have to put Tom Sawyer on but 
some of the other songs that are repeats from previous live albums didn't 
need to be there. And people wonder why we collect bootlegs! Just my $.02

well craig, i must agree that rush should put more of the excellent, but
lesser known songs on the new live album.  personally, i probably
wouldn't buy it if i couldn't get it for so cheap from BMG.  but you
never know, there might be remixes, variations, etc. of some of the
songs.  and i'm glad ...the heart hasn't stopped beating yet (hee hee,
little play on words), it's a classic song that may never become
unpopular, look at take another little piece (of my heart),  stairway...
and purple haze.  those songs have been around longer than a lot of us
and are still quite popular.

i don't know about rush becoming trendy, but it would be neat to see. 
granted, they would eventually go out of style, but think of it this way.
 picture rush as a big wheel (as in someone important), and every time
they're brought to people's attention by the media, they're just rolling
through the peoples minds.  what wheel rolls through something and
doesn't get covered with whatever it rolls through?  (i.e. mud, water),
they're bound to expand their fan base, even if they don't last that
long.  even though bell-bottoms went out of style, people still wore
them.  and look what's happened, they're back!!  they may be called
flares, but a rose by any other name...

(completely off the subject, but acknowledge this part anyway) what is
that excerpt from the the breadman that fits perfectly with the sound of
a line from bravado?

i hope, elise, that i'm not "the other guy," but to get on with this.  it
depends on what you are associating the pentagram with.  as everyone
should know, depending on the subject, a symbol can have as different
meanings as bear and bare.  think of it as a "homovision" if you will. 
the symbols look alike, but mean different things.  

example:  associating with - music, symbol - AC/DC, what it means
(basically) - a band
	associating with - electricity, symbol - AC/DC , what it means -
alternating current or direct current

	associating with - music, symbol - amp, what it means - power
unit for elec. instrument (i.e. guitar)
	associating with - electricity, symbol - amp, what it means -
unit of current

i'm sure i just talked myself into a corner so i'll curl up into a ball
and try to avoid any flames flying my way

feel free to mock (or debate with) my poorly written rebuttal(?)

Heard a few of you mention "headbanging" to Rush songs lately.

Maybe it's just me, but I can't listen to "Virtuality" without throwing
my head up and down during the verses (listen to it and you'll see what
I mean). The perfect Rush headbanging song, wouldn't you agree?

I was hooked ever since Tom Sawyer! Now almost 18 years this band still
satisfies all my musical desires.  I love all sorts of music but no
other band even comes close! Someone once told me that if RUSH put out a
Disco or Country album I'd like it......I agreed! (Country music is like
kissing my sister or drinking sour milk)
 I've always felt that RUSH was "My" band...goofy...yes but I'll bet
most  of you feel the same way!
I'm thrilled to hear that a new live CD and CD ROM will be released
soon, however in some ways I have mixed feelings. The gap between CDs is
becoming longer and longer which is understandable given their age and
priorities.  With the tragic deaths in Neil's family I can't help but
feel the end of RUSH is near. I'm afraid that the new releases are a bit
of a cash grab.....I'll still be the first in line to buy them
though!!!!!!!!!! Ever hear RUSH do "Not Fade Away"?............they've
come a long way!!!!

Elise made some very good points in response to one of Ryan's many
recent posts.  Her statement that Neil is very perceptive got me
thinking.

The fact that Hugh Syme is mentioned as saying that Neil came up with
the star (and probably knowing all about the "Royal Ushers of Satan's
House" thing), could be that Neil was clearly thinking ahead...

*Neil, smoking and pondering*  "You know, we're rumoured to be a Satanic
band...why not throw a pentacle into the mix?  They'll be arguing about
it for twenty years."  

If this was the case, he probably giggles his ass off every time he
thinks about it. :)

Don't ask me, I'm just improvising.

Sorry to disagree with you BobbyV, but, I too was at one of those shows
(Friday September 23).  The band was previewing songs from Grace Under
Pressure, not Signals, and the songs they previewed were Distant Early
Warning, The Body Electric and Red Sector A, which Geddy announced would be
the title of the new album.  

Other than that, you are basically correct.  

It was also my first Rush Concert, I've seen them at least once on every
tour since then.

Subject: About the live album

Hello to all Rush fans out there!

I should say that, I'm not very happy with the forthcoming live album. I
really hate the idea of not including songs that every Rush fan would like
to hear on a live record just to put new versions of song like Tom Sawyer,
The Trees, The Spirit Of The Radio, Closer To the Heart, YYZ or Freewill,
that I doubt will be better than the ones in the Exit...Stage Left album.
Maybe in a concert video they could be in place and I would jump out of my
seat, but not in another live record. 

Lets see, not a single song from Presto? I don't like that, Show Don't Tell
and The Pass are terrific tracks and deserve to be there, just like Cold
Fire (in my opinion one of the best songs of CP), Vital Signs, Ghost Of a
Change, Half The World, at least the Prelude to Hemispheres and Analog Kid
(one of my all time favorites). 

At least Limelight and Natural Science made it's way this time, and so did
other songs I love like Dreamline, Animate, Stick It Out, Leave That Thing
Alone or Test For Echo among others, but I'm still quite disappointed with
the fact that we, the Rush fans, are going to get half of what we expected.

When ESL was released I was expecting a live version of Limelign, but it
wasn't there. By the time ASOH came out I expected the Fear Trilogy to be
there, but they dropped The Weapon and it was a shame (and I felt also
dissapointed with the version of Closer To The Heart). But this time
there's way too many reasons to feel bad about and even though I'm gonna
get a copy (did I mention that Rush is my favorite band?) righ now I'm not
really excited about the live album.

I'm sure, most of the fans, right now think (and feel) just like me.

Bye

Subject: Red Star and Satanism

Clearly the intent of the Red Star on the 2112 was meant to symbolize
evil and repression.  However, looking solely at the star and drawing
the conclusion Rush supports evil and satanism is silly.  One can not
look at the Red Star without also looking at the image of the naked
man.  The naked man symbolizes freedom and innocence.  The image of the
naked man and the Red Star together conveys the true message of the
album - that we must protect freedom and individuality FROM evil and
corruption.

Ahoy fellow Rushians...

I saw TOOL perform last night, August 13, at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Denver.
And I must say that I believe that TOOL is one of the bands taking progressive
rock into the next century.

Fear not, my fellows, PROGRESSIVE ROCK IS NOT DEAD!!!

Touching on the Dream Theater thread-- I don't like Dream Theater that much, I
respect them all very greatly as musicians but I don't think they have the
magic that Rush does..... but TOOL has that unique creativity that makes them
so much more enjoyable to me... Can't really describe it without blabbing a
lot so I wont.

Danny Carey:   DAMN!!!!!!!!!!  I find his playing 100% more tasteful and solid
than Mike Portnoy's... and I really like Portnoy's drumming.  As far as a
drummer on the scene today that would be Neil Peart's "heir"  I would say
Danny Carey would be.

So, if TOOL is coming to your neck of the woods soon, I recommend you get
tickets and check them out.  Sure, they're wierd, but they simply ROCK.
That's all

Hey!

I realize that there is quite a bit of disappointment
regarding some repeats listed for the live set. Here
is my opinion. Songs like closer to the heart have
evolved so much over the years, I feel like they
*need* to be there. Personally I'm looking for a
counterparts tour version of ctth to be on DS, if
only for the introductions by al. As the band has
gone through different stages (pun intended),
many of these song some fans are calling trite
have evolved also. Personally, it wouldn't be a
true rush live album without ts, ctth and tsor.

Well, anyway, you wont hear any pissy gripes

Meant to say this also. The album is titled
*Different Stages*. How can you have and
display different stages by only playing songs

Hey!

Personally I think Neil put the red star on the
front cover for two reasons:

1. To display the red star of the solar federation

and

2. To help sell albums with the confusion of the
demonic symbol. The boys knew if this album did
not sell, then they were toast. There would be
no other albums. Instead of changing their style
for radio airplay, they sold their book for the
cover. How much demonic content is there
actually on 2112? None. I think the band paid
for it later for having to defend their religous
stance later, but it sold albums at the time, and
they got to keep their musical integrity!

Just my random thinks...

This is a hot issue for the music retailing industry, just like most
others. I work for one of the largest music distributors in the US and
we have gone through significant efforts to achieve y2k compliance.

For those who don't know what this is about, it's that in many systems,
dates are stored like yymmdd, where yy is the last two characters of the
year, mm is the month, and dd is the day. For example, as I type this,
it is August 14, 1998. Systems at risk would store this as 980814. The
problem comes up Jan.1, 2000 when the date would read 000101. Many
computer systems interpret that as Jan. 1, 1900, causing automated
programs using dates to have all sorts of problems.

It's still somewhat early, but it's looking pretty good for major
retailers/suppliers. A bigger issue may be with financial institutions:
you may not be able to use your credit/debit card to buy the cd.

A bigger issue may be the distribution mechanisms to get the album to
stores on 1/1/2000. Besides being a holiday, Jan. 1, 2000 will be a
Sunday. Traditionally in the US, new releases come out on Tuesdays, to
allow for all music retailers a level playing field in selling the key
new releases. Having a significant new release (the last several Rush

Aloha fellow Rushians!
     Just thought I would disengage lurker mode before it got permanently
stuck and figured that my birthday (Aug 10) was as good a time as any to post
something.
     Like most fans, Im eagerly anticipating the new live set and to answer
the question as to which disc hits the CD player first? AFTK tour, without a
doubt...but more on that later.
     I listen to a wide variety of music (it helps that I'm a DJ), but time
and time again I find myself coming back to RUSH because of two simple
reasons. First and foremost is the pure emotional response that it illicits in
me, not to mention the images from my past that it seems to conjure up
whenever a specific song comes on.
     Let me give you an example of mood enhancement. Sunday I was driving back
from my mother's in Conroe back to my home in Houston, about an hour away. I
popped in my cassette of Chronicles that was cued up at "A Farewell to Kings".
During the acoustic guitar intro, I was driving out of the subdivision (no pun
intended), filled with lush green trees along a golf course. Just as the tempo
kicked in, I pulled out onto the feeder road and accellerated to get on the
interstate. When the next song ("The Trees") came on, I was crusing thru the
final thick patch of trees before hitting the urban sprawl of Houston. Of
course, driving to "The Spirit of Radio" (IMHO the best concert opening song)
"Red Barchetta" and "Limelight" was enjoyable as well, each causing the foot
to get a little heavy on the gas pedal. Ultimately, what was an hour drive
seemed like a mere 10 minutes! 
     As for certain songs bringing back memories, at least half the RUSH
library will take me back to a specific moment in time or a special place and
most likely cause me to smile. Of course, a song like "Subdivisions" always
makes me think of the dreaded HS experience, but others are not so obvious.
     When I listen to "Cygnus X-1", the ending where Geddy strains to sing
"Every nerve is torn apaaaaaaaart!" ALWAYS reminds me of the time that my
buddy Derek was giving me an atomic wedgie as I was going back upstairs to
stop the tape (I was recording it at the time) just as Geddy was wailing and
the song was almost over. I have to sit back and laugh that at the time I
could have easily hit that high note right along with him....hehehe

**POSSIBLE THREAD IDEA!**

     OK, so what RUSH song takes you back to a time or place that has
absolutely no relation to the song whatsoever? I can't think of a weirder one
for me, although "The Fountain of Lamneth" always conjures up images of a
memorable mushroom trip, but we wont go there....

Hey Rushians,

Fade Away for my site's lyric section. I also found the lyrics for Bad
Boy. And I remember somebody once saying that it was a cover song of the
Beatles but the Beatles used it as a cover song from somebody else. I
found out who that somebody else was. It was Larry Williams.
	Anyway, I still need some help. I still need lyrics for You Can't Fight
It (from the first single) and Fancy Dancer (from Electric Ladyland
Studios.) I found out that the lyrics  and music for You Can't Fight It
were written by Geddy Lee and John Rutsey but I don't knwo what the
lyrics are. I odn't know who wrote Fancy Dancer and I don't knwo the
lyrics very much. I have the song on my By-Tor '74 cd and I can probably
try to listen for the lyrics but I have trouble understanding what Geddy
is saying. Can you guys help me out?

Subject: (1) Live CD set list; (2) fade-out songs

(1) LIVE SET LIST

A lot of people are complaining about the live album set list, pointing
to redundancy (TS, CTTH, Trees) at the expense of newer material (Ghost
of a Chance, Double Agent), in particular the apparent omission of the
ENTIRE Presto album.

I tend to agree, especially regarding Presto.  That was the first of the
4-album series following their last live release.  It would have been
highly appropriate to include material such as Show Don't Tell (a
relatively major radio hit for Rush), The Pass, Superconductor, etc.  I
am also of the faction that considers Presto to be perhaps Rush's best
modern studio release to date.

However, I doubt the record company had anything to do with this, as
some have suggested.  Atlantic may be in charge of which cut is released
as the lead-off single (as has been the case historically).  They are in
no such position to advise the members of Rush, their producer, or their
recording team which material should be included on a live record. 
Rush's own preferences and the practical issue of which songs were
captured best during performance are the principal factors governing
which songs go all the way.

Rush were probably not sufficiently satisfied with any of the live
recordings of Double Agent or Show Don't Tell.  This may well have been
a joint decision with Paul Northfield, who is co-producer (with Geddy)
and chief engineer.  Would Geddy Lee default to Atlantic regarding the
list of songs?  I don't think so.  He's probably not pleased with the
fact that Presto is not represented at all on the live CD (very strange,
indeed).  He may also have particular reasons for including Tom Sawyer
again. (Incidentally, Tom Sawyer has previously appeared on only ONE
live album.)  Perhaps he is retrospectively dissatisfied with that
version, and/or the band felt they had simply captured a much better
version of it at some point during the last two shows.

The fact that the live CD is derived from only the last two tours
(unfortunately; RTB was by far the best tour of the decade) is yet
another limiting factor.  By the time of the TFE tour, clearly they were
in a retro frame of mind.  They might still be.

I must say that I do agree with the general disappointment expressed
regarding the selected material.  No, we don't want a third live
rendition of CCTH.  I am also mystified by their bland reliance on
"Dreamline" as the first song to play live and sure enough the first
song on the live CD.  They are not very adventurous in this respect. 
However, I think this stems largely from the recording quality of the
material they had to work with, not their record company's preferences.

(2) FADE-OUT SONGS
"While I realize the boyz fade some songs and abruptly end others for
reasons unknown to us, but does anyone else believe "Available Light"
should have ended with Geddy only with the final "In the Available
Light......."  The music should have stopped with Ged singing that last
line.  Talk about shivers!"

I think that Rush makes excellent use of fade-outs, and this particular
song is a great example. It gives one the sense that the song never
really ends, and could perhaps be sustained indefinitely, providing a
subtle vehicle for some great instrumental (and vocal) virtuosity.

In fact, I am somewhat disappointed that Rush has moved considerably
away from outros, particularly on Test For Echo (note that Rush's most
celebrated songs nearly all feature fade-outs).

Sincerely,

Sam Scott

I'm so excited about all the new Rush stuff coming out. Do we know if the CD
ROM might be included with the live album, or will it be a separate product?
Just curious... 

All I can say is PLEASE let it be Mac compatible. (Someone said a while back
that Geddy likes Macs) Also...does anyone have any Rush Macintosh desktop
icons, patterns or screensavers available? Mail me if you do.

About the live album...will anyone be a little disappointed if some of the
tracks are from the same concert as a popular boot (Animated for example). I
think it's kind of like finding your Christmas presents hidden in your
parent's closet.

Oh yeah: My most embarrassing album is an LP of Buckner and Garcia's

Subject: CD Thoughts -  (one reason that bootlegs are so popular)

Well, I'm not surprised by many of the postings of disappointment over the
song selections for the upcoming CD.  It will be very frustrating to lose
out on The Analog Kid (maybe) / Cold Fire / Double Agent / Show Don't Tell
/ The Pass /  Vital Signs (from Rtb tour I assume) / Virtuality / Half The
World / Time and Motion / Superconductor / Ghost of a Chance / Where's My
Thing?......and all at the expense of another Tom Sawyer / Closer to the
Heart / YYZ / The Trees, etc.  The only way that I can see them justifying
this, is that the sound of these tracks is so far superior to the sound on 
ESL.....which is quite plausible.  Don't get me wrong;  I loved ESL from
the time it came out.  But from a sound standpoint, it can't even compare
to more recent recordings.

Of course, in the past there have always been some disappointments in
tracks that got lost somewhere.  For ASOH - Middletown Dreams / Grand
Designs / Afterimage / The Enemy Within / The Body Electric / Kid Gloves /
Red Lenses / Between the Wheels / and almost all of SIGNALS.  For ESL - The
Camera Eye / Natural Science (we will finally get it) / Vital Signs /
HEMISPHERES / Circumstances / A Farewell to Kings / Cygnus X-1 (Yeah! for
the Hammersmith Odeon show!)  Really, you have to go to bootlegs if you
want live versions of many of these. 

Yes, it is difficult to please everybody - Rush would have to release a
live album after every tour to really please us all.  This is not to say
that what they do release is not quality.  Certainly all of their live
albums kick ass in some aspect.  For this reason, I am awaiting the new
with anticipation.

Now that the songlist for Disk 3 of "Different Stages" is known, I thought it
was interesting noting which tunes they dropped from the actual show of
February 19 or 20, 1978.  After checking back to Erik Depoy's post in issue
2069, I found these songs were dropped from the show:  Lakeside Park, Closer
to the Heart, 2112 and the Drum Solo.  The remaining disk order follows that
of the show.

	About a month ago, I was looking for suggestions to help me ease my new

very impressed by the song - especially Geddy's bass and the morse-code
theme worked at either end of the tune. :]

Turns out *she* is getting her little sister into Rush.  Lil sis wants to
use the morse-code "cool idea" in her original composition assignment (yes,
she's also a music student).
Huzzah!!  And thanks to those who sent me replies! :D

Subject: CD-ROM vs Box Set

I don't like the idea of a box set with the 'missing' live tracks,
unless it is a box set of live tracks that haven't been released before.
They have always stated that there are no unreleased tracks stored away,
so it would only be repetition.  I wouldn't mind a CD-ROM or CD-ROM set
that covers their career, and that also has unreleased live versions of
tracks such as Hemisphere's, Circumstances, The Camera Eye, Vital Signs,
Analog Kid, Grand Designs....  FM (Toronto based band that opened for
Rush in Toronto a couple of times) released an enhanced live album a
couple of years ago that was mostly music, with video clips and band
info.  Better to do something like that than to milk long-time fans with
a box set of mostly repetition.

Subject: Clearing a few things up...

Okay, just a few things that come to mind as I was scrolling through recent
issues of NMS...

First the Signals album...Yes, most people regard it as a weak album,
generally because of the dissatisfying production, and the overall regard that
the record had too much of a "keyboard" slant in the writing and production.
However, I think songwise, and especially lyric-wise, it's a very well written
album, overall.  In short, the songs themselves were quite good (I happen to
feel "Losing It" it one of their most poetic pieces to date), but their
treatment of the songs during recording lacked some luster...

Second....oy, the problems we have with understanding this whole "Pentagram"
thing and the 2112 Red Star...Ryan Waggoner's post overall had the message
pretty close to right...(it's a symbol...and those who obsess with symbols are
symbol-minded!)...however, like many X-tians, he once again made the mistake
of claiming all Pentagrams evil, and I quote:

Thirdly, it makes absolutely *no* difference which way the star is
pointing...if it's made of 5 unbroken lines, and it's completely within a
circle, it's "evil"...it it's pointing one way, it's considered satanic,
and if it's pointing the other way, it's considered witchery (or whatever
the word is I'm lookin' for...something to do with witches and witchcraft
and Wicca and that crap...).

I understand that many people tie Wiccan faith with witchcraft, but sorry to
say, that's not entirely accurate...the word "witchcraft" is indeed very
likely a bastardization of the word Wicca (meaning Wise one). However, Wicca
promotes no evil whatsoever, unless you're the type of x-tian who's afraid of
anyone else's beliefs beside your own.  The upward facing Pentagram of Wiccan
beliefs is a symbol that denotes no satanism OR evil intent
whatsoever...moreso, it has to do with nature and the universe, etc. etc.  ( I
don't want to get into details here, for a Wiccan believer---which I am
not---may have a better explanation for the "White Magic" Pentagram.  

Now, on the other hand, it IS generally regarded that the upside-down
Pentagram is a symbol of satanic worship, or at the very least, what we regard
as "Black Magic,"  But again, the "upside-down" one is actually just a
perversion of the true Pentagram, which bears no evil symbolism.  Basically,
angry people who like to do nasty things use this little star as a symbolic
explanation for why they do nasty things...which is essentially what most
"adolescent" forms of "satanism" are really about.  

What does it have to do with the Red Star of 2112?  Very little!  Because of
that (and before I go and prove that I too am too obsessed with "symbol-
minded" behavior) I will shut up now!

Subject: signals et al

In response to Mark's comments about Signals:

Signals is without a doubt one of my favourite albums by Rush.  I am 
interested that you [Mark] seem to consider the composition and 
playing to be excellent, as I feel that some of the work is, as you 
say, "second to none".  For example, I would have to say Analog Kid 
and Digital Man.  Anyway, this email is not supposed to be a list of 
what I like.

Again, I would pose a question.  Is the reason that many of us feel a 
great affinity with Signals due solely to it's musical content, or, is 
it tied up inexorably with the stage of life that many of us seem to 
have been at in 1983?  It seems to me that the people who most like 
Signals were young teenagers when it was released, or when they first 
heard it.  This reminds me of Neil's comments about Rush albums 
"being the sound track for peoples' lives". Is Signals so great to 
us, because it was the right record at the right time, if you were 
say, 15 years old?

This interests me because we all know that music is subjective, but I 
find that I keep asking myself: is it the music, was it the time, or 
is it the interaction? 

The live CD.  First, I thought Dimlit.....was a far better title, not 
least of which because it was witty.  Secondly, I must support the 
views that I have been reading in the NMS, concerning the set 
listing.  It seems sad that we are given CTTH, Xanadu etc AGAIN, at 
the expense of a wealth of material that many of us [especially in 
Europe?] have never had the chance to hear.  I especially think that 
it is a great shame that Presto is conspicuous by its absence.

Presumably, the listing is because Rush want the CD to represent a 
typical set, rather than acting as a "definitive" collection of live 
works?

Ok, that's my view from the shed.
