There are even more new images in the anonymous ftp directory "rush/images"
on Syrinx, if you're interested.

Oh, by the way, we're now over 600 readers.  There are approximately 605
individual members that I know of, plus two or three known re-distribution
points.  We're still growing!!

Subject: More stuff.

   Derek Lichter made some nice predictions in yesterday's NMS.  It would be
great to have an all instrumental track... which hasn't occured for awhile
(unless you count "The Rhythm Method" on ASOH).  Does anybody who has heard
about the new album know anything about what will be on it? (besides our
predictions, of course)

   Also, does anybody have any more info on the Rush laser shows?  Are they made"available" to any place which shows laser stuff?  I am from Pittsburgh and one
of my friends asked about a laser show for Presto, but that there was no demand
for it.  He also mentioned something about a Grace (?) laser show.  Just how
many laser shows have there been?

   Feedback would be appreciated...

Subject: Re: this-n-that

&gt;Now, the Rush art image that someone made available is neat.

Thanks, Keith.  That someone is me.  Since it's basically an original
work, I'd like to keep my name with it, if possible.  That's the
dilemma of sharing art and poetry over the net, I guess.  Hmmm, now, is
there a good Rush quote to go with this?  About the problems of trying
to publicize a piece of art (well, an artistic endeavour, at least)
yet keep some control over it?  Sigh...probably not, unless you count
the copyright notices on the albums.

Subject: New album

Okay, this isn't much, but it will hopefully get our minds off the war.

How about the new album? (I need my dose of Rush!) I imagine it will
have a more direct and even harder sound to it i.e. Show Don't Tell. An
instrumental or long involved song wouldn't be bad either! Has anyone
heard, or just thinks that they will play By-Tor and the Snow Dog on the
next tour...or ever again?

Subject: Rush video censored--Why?

	Please could someone help me out with this one.  The other
day I rented one of the latest Rush videos (sorry I don't remember
which one) and was very upset to see that during one of the songs
(I believe it was La Villa Strangiato) Alex was saying something
and a message was posted on the screen that said that unfortunately
the producer or some upper echelon guy deemed it appropriate to
censor this vocal part out of the video.  Alex looked spaced out
as usual during the concert footage and all I could think about was
"Oh boy, this isn't gonna help rid themselves of thier Satanic image,
'Ruling Under Satan's Hand' and all..."  I'm brand new to this group
so indulge me if this has been discussed before.

Hello everyone --

	Though I've been on this list since its inception, I very rarely post
to it, preferring to silently enjoy the discussions presented here.  Tonight,
however, I am moved to post a public "Thanks" to the people who thought up
this list, and one to the list itself.

[ You're welcome.  :-)                                           :rush-mgr ]

	I have just spent the last hour or so reading rec.music.misc (okay,
it's been a long time since I've read news), and am *so* fed up with reading
flames in general, and Rush flames in particular, that I think I'm going to
unsubscribe to the darned newsgroup.

	So, thanks to everyone who has made this digest a forum for
*discussion* and not another place for flame-wars.  I've enjoyed almost every
single issue in its entirety, and hope the good track record continues.

	By the way, any news on when the next album may be released?

Matthew Deter writes:
&gt;.... Lastly, I complete the syllogism by noting that Ayn Rand and
&gt;her philosophy would be/is disgusted by the United States' actions.

I'm not sure I buy that, but irregardless you might keep in mind that
Ayn Rand would have been disgusted by 2112 too, though, as well as by
a lot of what Peart has written in recent times.

&gt;Secondly, keep in mind that it was the Americans who shot first "in the
&gt;name of a piece of dirt."

Two words: August 2.  How quickly they forget.  And as to whether the
UN coalition is fighting for "a piece of dirt"... ugh, I'd better bite
my tongue rather than respond to that.

Then, Randall Stark writes:
&gt;Congratulations to David Gordon, who managed, in a single post,
&gt;to make feel ashamed.... to be an American (in completely missing
&gt;the point of Territories).

This is what really forced me to reply.  I really get angry with people
who assume that their interpretation of a song is the One True Way to
interpret it.  Smacks of Bible-thumping.  Besides... it's just a song,
guys, not a credo.  Just because someone writes an anti-war song does
not mean they are against any war under any circumstances.

Now for a plea.  I could go on and on in support of my position on
this subject, but I'd really rather see this mailing list spared the
unrelated thread.  Yes, the Persian Gulf events are important, but
there are appropriate places readily available for their discussion.
But, IMHO, this is not one of them.  So please, please, can we lay
off of this topic in this particular forum?

[ E-mail is a great alternative!                               :rush-mgr ]

I hope the post about the new Rush album nearing completion is
accurate, because we need something to distract us from political
arguments.  I also need a good way to blow twelve dollars.  B-)

&gt;Speaking of which... what do you all think this next album will be like?
&gt;If we look for an "evolution" from Presto, will this be "harder"?  "Jazzier"?
&gt;More or less "smooth"?  Here's a prediction I hope will come true:  this
&gt;album will have at least one instrumental or extra-long track on it.  And,
&gt;I think there will be more vocals from persons other than Geddy.  I have
&gt;nothing to back these predictions up, they're just feelings.

Ahh, speculation time!  :-)

Well, first of all, I'm more partial to the older, harder, guitar/bass/drums
style of their music.  I'd *love* to see something that's just those three
instruments, no synths or keys at all!  Since I don't think it'll happen,
I'll settle for another instrumental.  We've seen what Neil can do (The
Rhythm Method from ASOH); maybe Geddy will do a little funnin' with the
keyboards.  I don't think we'll see anything longer than 6 1/2 minutes,
but that's just a guess.  What's the longest song they've done since MP?

If _Presto_ --&gt; &lt;next album&gt; is a similar situation to _Signals_ --&gt; _GUP_,
then the next album could be quite different.  On the other hand, they
spoke of taking time off after _HYF_ (the breakup rumours, etc), and came
back with a bunch of stuff.  If they had many left-overs from those sessions,
it could sound much like _Presto_.  That I wouldn't mind too much.

Here's hoping for no production snags!!
