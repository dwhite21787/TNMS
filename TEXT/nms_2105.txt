Hey Hanstones, even though we're home, you may have to lay some points on me

also don't know where to purchase them.  And I live in new york city, ha ha.
But I'm afraid I might not even be able to get something that you don't
already have.  I am looking forward to a wager, though.

We're gonna pound Terrell and Shannon into the cold Giant Stadium turf!  I
know I shouldn't be doing much talking because we couldn't even beat the

Sorry for the lack of Rush content, but Hanstones threw down the gauntlet

FlatYer5s last post reminded me of my old Rush Chicago sightings.

I think about the band every time I have to take the Chicago Ave bus to
work and go past this street.  

As for 2112, I know there is such an address on Belmont.  I have always
wondered if Geddy lived there during the short stops the band would make on
tour.

Actually I used to love Rush street for the now closed restaurant of Chez
Paul (the restaurant the Blues Brothers terrorize in their 198? movie).  It
was my favorite restaurant on a street named after my favorite band.

BTW, if anyone cares,  I saw Jackie Chan during a book signing here in
Chicago this past Saturday, and later saw him at a Celebrity Softball game.
 It was a good Jackie Chan Saturday.  And soon Rush's name will make
another apperance in his next movie, but only for an hour.

 Does it take you a while to get used to their
studio stuff again. After hearing the raw power of their concerts, the
studio albums seem almost too squeeky clean. What do you think?
<snip>

I find that all their albums sound really weak after a concert.  I won't
listen to them for a few days or a week following a live show.  I've
never understood all the people who go out to their cars and crank up a
studio album 20 minutes after leaving a concert.  I say savor the moment
and keep the live sound in your heads as long as you can.

On a similar topic.  A good friend of mine who I usually attend Rush
concerts with will not listen to them the day of the show.  He says it's
bad luck.  As part of the ritual I don't listen to them before a concert
either.  There are practical limits to this though since it's virtually
impossible to park your car and walk to the venue without hearing at
least half their albums.

Subject: Non-Rush Live Albums, overdub question

I'd have to say my favorites are:

1. Marillion:  The Thieving Magpie (La Gazza Ladra)
Many of these performances seem so much more powerful and magical than 
the studio counterparts ("He Knows You Know", "Chelsea Monday", 
"Incommunicado", "Waterhole").  The powerful Taurus undercurrents, the 
colorful keyboards and guitars, the flowing-yet-driving rhythm section, 
and Fish's dramatic vocals.  Gotta dig that "HEEEE-YAH!" as they get 
into "White Feather".

2. Anglagard:  Buried Alive
Their last concert, from ProgFest 1995 (I think).  These guys make the 
most powerful music I've ever heard, and to hear them pull it off almost 
perfectly live, is incredible.  Their music grabs me, shakes me up until 
I get dizzy with adrenaline with driving off-meter rhythms and deafening 
Mellotron, then sets me down gently and carries me around quietly while 
the flute and guitars float around, sometimes comfortingly, sometimes 
whimsically.

I can't wait for the new Rush one though.  I think this one will 
definately be up there on my list.  I hope they haven't done anything 
too bad to the recordings.  By the way, can anybody here provide some 
insight into exactly where they have used studio overdubs on the live 
albums?  They all sound pretty clean to my ears (except the rhythm 
guitar underneath the solo in "A Passage to Bangkok").  I am a little 
disappointed about them choosing AFTK over Hemispheres, but hey.  Who am 
I, anyway....

I was at home today with my sick son and while he was asleep I was flipping

I was just watching Showbiz Today on CNN and they were talking about a
website where you can customize a playlist based on ranking artists from a
certain musical genre ( http://www.imagineradio.com if anyone's
interested).  At the end of the story the guy doing the story said
something like:  and while this site will certainly never replace the car
stereo, it proves that the spirit of radio is alive and well.  When he said
"the spirit of radio" the music in the background changed to the last
couple seconds of TSOR, and then the piece ended.  TSOR is a perfect song
when talking about radio, and it's good to know that there are people out
there in the media that use it.

Subject: Not Trevor Horn

Fellow Rush Fans,
	First I want to say, I don't want to flame.  Everyone is entitled to
their own opinion.  But I have to disagree with the choice of Trevor
Horn.  He just comes across as too poppy.  Don't get me wrong, I love
90125.  Yes sounded so incredibly fresh.  But Mr. Horn is not the right
guy for the boys.  I would except the other Trevor form 90125 (Trevor
Rabin) before Mr. Video Killed the Radio Star.
	But, I also must compliment the person with this suggestion, because
they also came up with Robert Fripp.  Imagine him and his partner, Brian
Eno, working with Ged, Al, and Neil.  It probably sounds ridiculous to
most, but it would be very interesting to hear what would come of it.
	Someone also pointed out how they thought it was interesting how Victor
Wooten and Rush seem to keep coming together.  I, too am a fan of
Wooten.  I don't like Bela Fleck and the Flecktones.  Mr. Wooten has two
solo albums out, that if you can handle jazz/r&b overtones, and love the
bass guitar (of course you do, you love Geddy, right?) you will really
admire them and his talent.  By the way, his first album is called (drum
roll please!!!) "A Show of Hands".  Coincidence?  Maybe.

Take care all.

This is a beautiful thing!
The NMS that is...
Ever since I discovered music at the rebellious 
age of 15 yrs. I heard RUSH for the first time
while watching tv with my father. This was most 
memorable for me. A Moving Pictures concert was on
and I was an instant fan! My father who had no 
musical interest to speak of commented on how
good the drummer was. Even he recognized the
driving force behind this new found interest.

I ask people that I meet if they are RUSH fans.
This can actually influence my impression
of them. Am I cooked? Does anyone else do this?

Peart has the most creative way of exploring 
the most current issues and thought provoking
topics that I have ever heard put to music.
The sound, style and progressiveness of RUSH
are "elevated from the norm"

Rush helped shape my life!

Hell of a point made, dude.
I was just reading this and I just have to say you made a hell of a
point.
I myself am a fan of the older, hard sound. And if you listen real well,
Geddy has a hell of a voice. Think about Xanadu or No One At The Bidge.
They were hard rockin' songs but Geddy sang them, not screamed. Think
about 2112 (only 8 issues left), hard rockin' and Geddy singing. Sorry,
don't mean to babble.

As for a lame Rush sighting, I was in NYC last year and saw a sign on the
side of a building that said "RUSH". I almost dropped a load. "I didn't
think Rush was playing at the Garden this time." With eager ambition we,
the group I was with, hurried our pace to see the rest of the sign. First
an ear appeared on the billboard, then some hair. And as we got to the
corner, our jaws hit the sidewalk. Good ole' fat boy's face staring down
at ya. Limbaugh. Damn!

Subject: Sabbath and Rush

G'day all,

Speaking of Sabbath and Rush...

I saw at least 2 blokes wearing Rush T-shirts at the Ozzfest in Milton
Keynes in June this year.  One was a T4E and the other was a RTB.  I was
surprised to see 2 on the day, but then I thought that most NMSers would at
least have heard the classic Sabbath albums even if they did not like them
(if not just for their influence on heavy rock/metal), so maybe it isn't
that strange....??? Would love to hear Rush do a cover of Supernaut...

Anybody know if Ozzfest is to be released on cd and/or video soon? - it was
a monster of a day.  "Erway erway erway erway....Sabbath, Sabbath...We love
you ALL....God bless you!" (Ozzy)

Also, one of the main reasons John left Rush, all "creative" differences
aside, was his health. He felt he COULDN'T tour. Also he was depressed. And
finally, he didn't SUCK, he was just no Neil Peart. How many people can say
they are? In any case, I'm glad he left, not because we got rid of him, but
because we acquired Neil in the process.

My wonderful mis-heard lyrics:

     When I was a young lad discovering RUSH, I heard the beginning of 
"2112" I seriously thought I heard "WE ARE THE PRIESTS AND THE DEVILS OF 
SYRINX", of course I bought the album and read the real lyrics later on. 
DUH.

     As far as a producer for a RUSH album? I think they will produce 
the next album themselves. Or else -- get me to do it.... he he

     My favorite author (to answer someone else's thread) is Terry 
Brooks. He also happens to be penning the novelization for the STAR WARS 
Episode one movie due out in May (The Star Wars movies are my 
favorites). Geeze, now if RUSH could be on the soundtrack for the next 
STAR WARS movie and Terry Brooks writes the novelization, the stars will 
be truly aligned. But of course, the Gods are malign, so this would 
never happen. :-)~

Subject: New Rush Studio album..and sorry....:(

First I wanted to say, sorry about not getting the Larry Gowan and
Platinum Blonde tunes Alex played on up to my web site. See...I run an
ANCIENT P90 pc, and encoding MP3's was way more difficult and time
consuming then I EVER thought. Anyways, I have a friend who said he will
put them on his ZIP disk drive with his P400. So, I will try and keep
you guys updated as usual, and upload them.

Second off...no, there are no plans YET for a Rush studio album, so
please don't go having mental breakdowns...heh. BUT, I have three
sources, one of whom is Ray Danniels secretary, who have stated the band
HAVE NOT even considered "breaking up". Now, you can take this how you
feel it means, but basically all's the band wants is time. And, on the
"Rush Anthem/SRO Fanline", they have added the category of "Tour Dates",
but stating Rush is not touring this year. This may be just for
clarification....but the thing is, this spot on the fanline REPLACED the
Selina Memorial information. Maybe speculation on my part....but I am
sure we will hear MUCH more (call your radio stations!!!) about the
future of Rush when Different Stages is released. I know I am going to
interrogate our radio station (HTZ-FM)here in St. Catherine's about it,
because 1) They play Rush quite often per day 2) HTZ-FM and SRO have
close connections, as they even had an interview with Alex when Victor
came out, and he was talking about them when they where recording TEE,
and I peeing my pants:-)

3rdly....(yes..no such word exists..heh)...Toronto Radio Station 102.1
the Edge stated on the weekend the Edwin IS working with Alex on the
next Victor project. We keep hearing about this, but the damn deejay
said "..no word on a release date.." AHHHHH. Last I heard was when Alex
and Edwin where on that station, and said they hoped to have the album
out by early next year. This sorta makes sense...they certainly don't
want it to interfere with the Rush fans buying of Different Stages. I
WILL make it my personal agenda to phone Anthem and ask them about the
next Victor, even if I am just "joe blow" off the street. Heh.

My sermon ends with this note....there is POWER in numbers....and
NUMBERS of RUSH fans is IMMENSE....LETS use that power!! And a nod to
rush-mgr (no..I will not call you the holly bitch...I have to much
respect for you;-) for the hall of fame induction thingee, and to all
you Rush fans pounding away at your keyboard to get Rush there. This may
be the end of the begining...but NOW comes the REALLY good part..:-)

Oh ya....for issue 2112, which I know is probably too close....if we

existence, as many as possible, and send it off to Anthem as a "Thank

Subject: Sighting

I know that a lot of Neil's lyrics are assembled phrases that many
people are familiar with.  Example:  "The meek shall...".  Is "Radiate
more heat than light" from Presto one of these?  If the answer is no
then Tom Brokaw the NBC news anchor may be a Rush fan.  At the Emmy's
this week he gave a speech about the news media and in it he said that
sometimes the news media provides "more heat than light".  Needless to
say, that phrase really jumped out at me because 1.  I always thought it
was brilliant and  2.  I always thought it was a Neil original.  Seems I
may have been incorrect in that belief.

Subject: Alan Parsons & Rush

Hey,
I'd second David Ayers' opinion that Alan Parsons would be a great =
producer to work with Rush.  I have no doubt that he would produce the =
"best sounding" Rush disc to date.  By that I mean clear and clean, the =
way it sounds in the studio, rather than muddy, bright, whatever.  If I =
may be so bold I would suggest that if you haven't listened seriously to =
Alan Parsons/Project you might want to give him/them a try.  Any of the =
first five Project CDs would be a good choice:  1)  Tales of Mystery and =
Imagination (the remixed version.  Orson Welles' narration in the Fall =
of the House of Usher is scary kids!); 2) I Robot; 3) Pyramid (you may =
have heard bits of some of the instrumentals on here and not realized =
it); 4) Eve; 5) Turn of a Friendly Card.  After that the rest of the =
Project discs have some good tunes but they also have their share of =
clinkers (eg. Time...keeps flowing like a river, yadda yadda yadda).  =
Both of the Alan Parsons discs (no longer the AP Project) are pretty =
good too, Try Anything Once and On Air.  If you're like me and sometimes =
you get in the mood to buy some CDs but nothing appeals, give them a =
try.  Oh, and by the way, Michael Z. Williamson, that "an orbital mind =
control laser" bit cracks me up everytime I read it.  Take care.

Subject: New vs. Old vs. Middle

Jason writes in issue 2104 that he doesn't care for the direction Rush
has taken with recent albums and asks if anyone shares this view.
(pause while I put on my flame retardant suit)

I do share this view!  (There, I said it)

I've been a huge Rush fan for 18 years.  They are by far my favorite
group.  I've seen them close to 20 times in concert.  I will buy
anything they put out as long as I live.  I respect everything they have
done, but I don't love every note they've recorded.  I don't love every
song they've recorded.  I don't love every album they've recorded.  I
think my long standing relationship gives me the right to voice this
without criticism.  (We'll see how many disagree).

I discovered Rush at Moving Pictures and I was a hormone saturated
teenager at the time so that's my favorite album and era.  PW to HYF.  I
really liked their earlier material when I was younger but I don't
listen to it very often now.  

Ever since Signals I've heard quotes from Geddy and Alex that they were
trying to get back to more of a guitar based sound, more stripped down.
I think Presto does have a  stripped down sound but to me it sounds like
Rush in a club with all their stuff, which is still a pretty fat sound.

When Counterparts was coming out I was real excited.  One Saturday I
heard that their new single was going to be previewed on the radio.  I
went over to a good friends house to share the big moment.  Then "Stick
It Out" came on.  This angry sounding, de-tuned three piece song that
really sounded bad to me.  I was totally disappointed.  It sounded like
a joke to me but they still play it so I know it was real.  I was simply
expecting something different.  Then the album came out.  It was better
than SIO and has some great songs but it didn't have that lasting power
to me that many of their albums still have.  I still can't identify it
for myself but something was missing either sonically or emotionally or
something.  But I didn't dislike it and I had great optimism for the
next album because it was 4th in the series and those are always great.
2112, MP, HYF.

When T4E came out I was really bummed.  Straight three piece rock and
roll with a fat, loud guitar.  Geddy and Alex had finally put together
what they had been trying to accomplish since Signals...a true guitar
based rock album.  I know a lot of people really like it.  I don't
happen to be one of them.  I don't want to criticize the album, because
even to me it is good.  The first 5 tracks are really good, and I really
like Resist (which is the black sheep of the album), especially the
lyrics.  However, I miss the intricate layered approach from their past.

Rumors that I have heard circulating in my head:

The next album, will be released Jan 1, 2000.
The producer will be Ric Ocasek (Weezer, the Cars)
The tour will be held in Brazil and the other countries where album sales
have reached the milestone of 3.
The album's name: 
It will three songs released as singles:  
	a)2121(26 minutes long),
	b)Omnipotent Influence (part four of the Fear Trilogy) this deals
with the fear 	        of a god-like vengeance,
	c)That Thing You Play With (instrumental)  it's released because
of Geddy's 
	       Gregorian chant and Alex's imitations of his favorite
classic movie

 I was at the first show in Toronto, and they had cameras on booms, and all

 present at either show.

 I'm not sure of a boot called "to see amazing things", but I have video
 boots from both Toronto shows. Both are the complete shows from the intro
 to the very last note.

harder edge.It's also being compared to Radiohead.I don't know if that's

To convince your friends that Neil *IS NOT* "the greatest drummer in the

To show 'em that Neil *IS* "one of the most creative and inspiring drummers

Subject: RUSH & Producers

Greatings from Canada,

I was lucky enough to attend RUSH's last concert on the TFE tour in 
Ottawa, Ontario.  The big rumour at the venue (COREL Centre) was that 
this was RUSH's last concert.  I had excellent seats, my firm has season 
tickets for the Ottawa Senators.  

Nevertheless, Alex Lifeson's second cousin was siting next to my 
girlfriend and I.  I could tell that they were VIP: they had TFE 
backstage passes, a copy of 2112 authographed, et cetera.

I asked the Alex's cousin if he had any insider information with regards 
to the future of the band?  He did not think this was their last show.  
I was told that: «they have plans to work on a live album».  As far as 
the future holds, we can only pray for a new studio album.  Someone also 
mentioned that the band does not have a long term contract with Atlantic 
Records, that they were taking it album by album.  Is this correct?

Regarding possible a new producer and engineer, my vote would go to 
Trevor Rabin.  Trevor produced one of Yes' most under rated CDs: TALK.  
This album was recorded direct to hard disk, it is one of the best 
sounding albums of my record/cd collection.  Furthermore, the idea of 
Trevor Horn is also excellent.

Regards,

Frank

Hey all, 
    I was recently going to do my Rush duty and post a message to the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame Board and I wanted to come up with some bands around
today that were influenced by Rush.  I have a few floating around in my
head but I was wondering if anybody has a list of the majority of the
bands influenced by Rush?  I know there are quite a few but I couldn't
come up with enough that I know with any certainty.  I figured mentioning
a few prominant bands with Rush roots would make an impression with the
