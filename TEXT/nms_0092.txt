Hi all, or should I say "1001001 SOS!"

    I feel like a real schmoe for having done this, but I managed to trash
my copy of the names list.  Urgh!  Unfortunately, my backup copy is hope-
lessly out of date.  :-(

    There is hope, however; I've recently (within the past week or so) sent
out the file to several list members.  Could one of you PLEASE send me back
a copy, preferably with the date you received it?  This is pretty important,
as this is the only way I have of keeping track of the real list population.

    Since I keep around subscription mail for a month or so, I should be
able to reconstruct any holes left.

    Thanks a LOT, and this teaches me the wisdom of regular archiving!

&gt;                  Well, since everybody else has been posting about the bunnies
&gt;I figured I might as well stick my two cents in.  I saw the boyz in Rochester,
&gt;and there were no bunnies.   About two months later I went to the Toronto show,
&gt;and the bunny incident occurred.  BTW, does anybody have any idea as to how a
&gt;band as pathetic as Voivod managed to open for a band as awesome as Rush?!??

Were we at the same show?  I was at the 4/19/90 show in Rochester and the
 5/15?/90 show in Toronto.  They had exactly the same content, songwise and
 stagewise, but there was a lot more energy at the Toronto show (they were a
 little more formal, and they were more into the show).

I didn't really care for Voivod a lot, but their light show in 'Astronomy
 Domine' was excellent.

On the subject of the band's humourous (yes, that's the British spelling!)
encores, on the last night in London on the "Hold Your Fire" tour the band
were playing In The Mood when, erm, a bunch of people dressed as arab oil
sheiks came on with guitars and started playing along too.  If I remember
right they even had the dark glasses to match their white robes and head
scarves!  I assume that they were the road crew - but did they do this
anywhere else on the HYF tour?

Subject: Surfing and stuff...

  Greetings -- to try and answer some questions posed in yesterday's
TNMS: when I saw the boyz in Philly last April, they did the surfing
bit with Alex...kinda funny!
  I have a poster of the Presto album cover that was distributed to
record stores...you know, the promo ones! BTW, I was in Boston this
weekend, and if anyone there wants Presto on LP, Strawberries in town
has overstocks for $2.99!
  The pin that Geddy is wearing in ASOH video is (I think!) Jack Nance
as Eraserhead (the 1977 David Lynch movie.)  I've read that the boyz
are big fans of the director and of that movie! (Wonder if they're
into Twin Peaks?)
  In this week's Billboard mag, there's a whole insert on this fall's
special interest videos to be released (including music videos) and
unfortunately, Chronicles was not on the list..Allright, I wanna
know, who started this rumor??? :^)
  If anyone taped the Rush MuchMusic special this weekend referred to
herein yesterday, please send me mail, as I would like to get a hold
of that!
  Anyone going or know more about the Canadian artist of the Decade
ceremony in Toronto?
  Finally, in the New York Times today (11/5/90) Entertainment Weekly
mag took out a full-page ad to promote its 35 greatest rock-n-roll
acts of all time issue this week, and Rush is listed in the background
of the ad (among hundreds of other acts) as meriting consideration
of this honor (of course, there are those who feel Madonna is one
of those 35...according to the magazine, she is!)

  That's all for now...

Subject: Opening band/surfing

Mike (V06856JK) asked how a band as pathetic as Voivod opened for RUSH.
Probably the same way a band as lousy as Mr. Big opened for RUSH in the
shows that I saw.  Blech.  The guitarist played part of his solo with a
power drill or something....oooooh, what talent (not).

Stew Fyfe asked about whether or not the Boyz did a "surfing song" near
the end of the show in their _Presto_ tour.
Well, they did both times I saw them.  The first time was better, 'cus I
thought it was kind of an improv thing.  Then when I saw it again the second
time, it just wasn't as funny.

As an aside:  To anyone out there who has been reading Mr. Samos' messages
about Animator, a band he manages who play a LOT of RUSH (and are very good
at it), you guys and girls out there may want to ask him about the mailing
list for Animator--I've heard them live many times, and they are damned good.

&gt; Paul Reed Smith is something of a local legend in my hometown (Annapolis,
&gt; Maryland) ... he started making guitars about ten years ago, I think.
&gt; (someone correct me on this if I'm wrong) and they've become quite popular
&gt; in recent years. I recall that Eddie Van Halen was seen around town a couple
&gt; of years ago, picking up a PRS guitar handmade by Paul. I think he was buying
&gt; it as an investment of sorts, rather than as a guitar to use every day. I'm
&gt; sure Paul's original handmade guitars are very valuable by now.

Do you know when he stopped making them?  Does Alex play a handmade PRS
guitar or a later version?

&gt; * About Rush and religion
&gt;   I don't think it's any of our darn business what their beliefs are.  But I

Well, to a point.  It may help to understand their lyrics when you understand
their religious beliefs.  For instance, a song appearing to support Hinduism
or Christianity may require a second look.  You can usually deduce, within a
certain tolerance range, some philosophies a person might believe, based
on their religious preferences.  This could help to understand a song,
especially if it has any roots in their religious beliefs.  But, I don't
believe we need to beat this topic to death either.

&gt; there some period not so long ago when the States became obsessed with closet
&gt; communists and famous people were brought before a committee and made to swear
&gt; they weren't communist.  I think the committee was instigated by a guy called
&gt; McCarthy.  Sounded like some kind of Witch Hunty.

McCarthyism was started by a Wisconsin senator, Joe McCarthy.  Basically,
he went around accusing people of being communist if they didn't agree
with him.  Anyone who said he was going on a witch hunt was automatically
labelled a communist because they were against him.  Convenient, huh?
Anyway, he finally accused someone pretty high up, forget who, and people
said, "Wait a minute, this guy's nuts" and that was the end of McCarthyism.

Subject: Chronicles Video, Metallica, Bass Sounds

Well, I went to the local video store at the mall here in
Charlottesville VA and asked them about Chronicles.  They
told me "We do not have it yet, but &lt;emphasis mine&gt; *it
is coming*.  The gentleman offered to special order it
for me if I wanted it before their scheduled receive date
which he said was this Thursday 8 November.  So, the upshot
is:  as far as I can tell, the vid HAS been released and will
soon be available at least here in C'ville.  I don't remember
the name of the store, although I do believe they are a
member of a chain of video stores.  So, don't give up hope,
you can find Chronicles on video if you look hard enough...

RE:  Metallica & Rush

   I've read several articles in which Metallica have made it
clear that they consider Rush to be a big influence in their
own music.  By the same token, I've also read a couple of
interviews with the Gedster in which he has gone out of his
way to mention Metallica as one of the better "metal" bands.
Also, I think one of the Boyz (I think Geddy) actually assisted
with some production work on Master of Puppets, although I don't
think he has a credit in the liner notes (source for this is
an interview I saw waaay back when M-of-P was released, and I
don't remember many particulars -- sorry!).  It is safe to say,
however, that both groups have a definite feeling of respect
and admiration for the other.

Rush Song I'd Most Like To Be Able To Play on Kazoo:  YYZ

Also -- which Bass sound do you RUSHians like the best -- Geddy's
Wal, the Steinberger, or the old reliable Rickenbacker?  My ordering
of those has to be Wal, Rick, Steinberger.  I just never thought the
Steinberger's sound did as much for the sound of the band as a whole,
and I think that the Wal has a really great funky tone to it, especially
in the hands of someone who plays as Geddy does.  However, I don't
really think it's the best bass for songs like Anagram or Red Tide,
whose bass lines (IMHO) aren't very varied and consequently don't
bring out the best of the Wal's sound.  I remember distinctly listening
to the very end of Red Barchetta at the Rush show in Richmond VA last
May and thinking "Wow, the Wal really sounds *thin* on that part
compared to the Rick.." and I wasn't really sure if I liked it or not.
Still am not sure, as a matter of fact.  However, I still like what
Geddy can do with the Wal on most of the songs (Show Don't Tell, High
Water, Open Secrets, Territories, Chain Lightning - love that sound!)

Anyway, enough rambling for now.  Turn it up and tear off the knob,

Re: surf music

 Someone mentioned that they played a surf song during the encore... and in
fact several of my friends who saw them play on the Presto tour echoed this:
Geddy would play a surf riff and Alex would pretend he was surfing.

  ..one possible reason: about a month before my friends saw them play, I
read an interview with Alex in .. um... I think Guitar World or Guitar School.
In addition to TAB notation for Show Don't Tell and Freewill, the interview
asked Alex what his influences were when he started playing. Among the list
was "the Beach Boys." The interviewer asked then if Rush had ever played
any surf songs. Alex said something like "I don't think so, but you never
know."
  Perhaps he thought about it after the interview and thought it'd be funny
(it's so un-Rush-like.)

Subject: Laserium returns!!!

Hi folks, I just got this info and had to post it ASAP!  The Rush Laserium
show has returned!  It went around the country about 7 years ago briefly but
they just started a new Rush show.  It's called "Laser Rush: 15 years of
Rush hits".

  For those folks in the Bay area, it's showing at the Morrison Planetarium.
Fri/Sat at 7:30 and 9:00 and Sun at around 9:00.  Tickets are $6, I think.
For more info, call (415) 750-7138.  Also, there's another new show called
"Rock it" which features mostly 70's Rock classics incl. Rush, ZZ-Top, Boston,
Foreigner, Led Zep, etc.  The recording mentioned that the Rush show includes
Show Don't Tell, Between The Wheels, YYZ, 2112, Tom Sawyer, plus others.

  These shows are not to be missed!  It's totally mindblowing.  Best of all,
it's cheap and you can afford to go again and again.  The shows are live, too,
so you never know what they might do.  By the way, the Dark Side of the Moon
show is still playing at Morrison, (they do the entire album!).

  My advice is to call your local planitarium.  I know Laserium shows can be
found in LA, and probably most other major cities.  Good luck and take care,

G'day, eh!
Has Rush totally finished their Presto tour?  Will they ever play Buffalo?
I was really ticked because I have been waiting for years to see Rush, and when
Presto came out, I was determined to catch the show.  I kept calling the rock
stations here in Buffalo for info, but they never had any.  I heard about the
Rochester and Toronto shows the day after they sold out.  I can't believe  they
passed by Buffalo, especially with Mr. Big opening!  Buffalo is becoming
Blown-off-by-big-bands Central.  Sucks to be in Buffalo!

Subject: Live mixing crew

G'day, eh?

 Having seen ZZ Top live last week (horrendous show) with the worst sound mix of
any large concert I've been to reminded me somewhat of how I felt attending the
Presto tour this past summer; namely, that no large touring act I've ever seen
could really get a good sound mix live. The most common problem seems to be an
overdose of midrange/brightness, so all you hear is guitar and other bright
instruments. It's often times like listening to the band through a single horn
speaker.
 I asked a friend about this, and he gave me an answer that has since sparked
my interest, and I would like to post it for anyone who has worked at the
soundboard or knows someone who has. He basically said that since the sound
mixer is required to listen to every show and mix it constantly based upon
changing conditions, and since most shows are deafingly loud, especially those
in arenas, the hearing of the mixer will necessarily get worse with every show,
and therefore he/she will add more midrange to counter that which can't be
heard.
 The reason I post this to the Rush list is that we fans of the band generally
hold better sonic tastes, and I'm curious as to whether a) anyone thinks this
theory has any validity, and b) can anything be done about it. When I saw
Presto, what really stood out in my mind was Alex's guitar was loud enough to
make my ears distort what I heard, and Ged's bass was barely discernible.

 I'd be very interested to hear comment on this, particularly from those with
any inside information about the sound reproduction at large shows.

    For those who may be intersted in the trivia of numbers.
My copy of this LP has a few numbers on it for the Anthem Catalog...
  The album graphics (ie: original artwork) say the above, anr-1-1027
  also the inner paper sleeve with lyrics & drawings agrees with anr-1-1027
  and adds:  also available in Musicassette 4an-1-1027 and, get this :-),
  8Track Tape 8an-1-1027!
  Back on the external cover, there is a white gum label wrapped over the
  spine, it sez:  anr 1627 an anthem reissue       [yes sixteen, not ten-27]
                  previously resleased at full price

  Cheez, Mike, why do you think that Voivod is pathetic?  Nothing could
be further from the truth.  Admittedly, Voivod is a hell of a lot harder
than Rush has ever been, and maybe you don't like metal, but Voivod is
an excellent band!  I have the "Nothingface" CD (DDD!), and it's great.
These are excellent, creative musicians.

Subject: Top 3 songs

Hi -
     I have always had a hard time coming up with my favorite Rush song.
I usually rattle off a list of 10 or 20 that come to mind. They are all
so good! I am curious as to what you all think about this. If you want,
mail me your three favorite Rush songs. To do this please do the following:

1) mail to ppierald@polyslo.calpoly.edu
2) make the Subject: line to read "Top 3 songs"
   (For sorting purposes)
3) make the body look like the following:

Fly By Night
La Villa Strangiato
YYZ

(your mailing address)

Please do not include any extra carriage returns, etc.
Please type the titles of the songs as they appear of the album (no abbrs.)

I will take entries until 11/20/90 and I will post the results then.
Thanks for you effort in this grand undertaking :-&gt;

Subject: Some thoughts

I've been wondering this for some time now...
Is it "Free Will" or "Freewill"?
On the album I belive it's spelled as one word, but the titles being
in all caps it's hard to tell. I just got finished typing in something
written by Neil Peart, though, and he writes it as two words. So which is
it?

Also why is the song called "Jacob's Ladder"? I have no clue on this
one...

I still need those song lists from bootlegs or if you wrote them
down from concerts!! C'mon guys, we've got 500+ people on the list
now, and yet I've only gotten 2 responses!! I REALLY need those
songlists... anything will help!

&gt;           I work for Transworld Music.  They are one of the biggest music
&gt;and video distributers in the country.  They own every Record Town and Tape
&gt;World in the nation.  So they are big.  They also don't have the Chronicles
&gt;Video, nor have they any record of ordering it.  I don't know what this means
&gt;but I felt it should be made public.

Then Carl Samos said:
&gt;                      ...                                          True,
&gt;there has been talk on the digest about the video being available, but
&gt;has anybody actually seen it?

Since I haven't seen anyone else post this, I'll do it.  I've got my copy
of the Chronicles Video.   I bought it Saturday (11/3/90) at Camelot Music
in Columbus, Ohio for $17.95.   They had 3 copies; I bought one so there are
2 left (hurry on down :) )   If anything, it's interesting to watch the
evolution of the Boyz hair-styles.  I was disappointed that it's only
63 minutes long.  It does exist so keep looking.
