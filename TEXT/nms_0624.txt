&gt;Neil does use what might be called a drum machine.  It is a KAT drum machine
&gt;which is simply a supplement to all of his electronic equipment which
&gt;helps keep things in order and features programmable pads.

   The term "drum machine" has come to mean "any piece of equipment that
can play rhythms by hitting the Start button." I'm 99% sure that KAT makes
no such device, only triggers and MIDI interfaces. While Geddy has enjoyed
the convenience of "keyboard machines" over the last decade, I really
doubt Neil would use one for playing live or for recording.

	Hello Rush-heads!

	If you are interested in only the warm and fuzzy postings, you may
want to skip this one! (it's long, too)

	Please, please no more of this useless debate over a fourth Rush
member!!   This is just a rumor that has gone too far.  Rush has been
contemplating a fourth for a long time, and i'm sure that they will
make the decision based on the best interests of the band, regardless
of anyone's opinion.  If you are so against a fourth member that you
plan to stop listening to the band because of it, well, have a nice
life.   we'll miss you.  Change is not necessarily evil.

	In response to the folks that feel that the music is 'stale' and no
one else is as brave to admit it,  or that the band should quietly
retire because their newer material is not the same as their old
material,  you really should look into starting a nice hobby, like
basket-weaving, to fill your extra time because you have been thinking
about this far  too much.  It is the height of arrogance to say "if
they don't write music the way i think they should, they should just
quit".   That comes across as if it was from a spoiled child.

	Finally,  on the behaviour of Mr. Peart (and rock stars in general),
i'm sorry if he seemed callous during that interview.  i heard him on
"Rockline" some months ago (right after Roll the Bones came out) and he
seemed very polite and accomodating.  However, i dont feel that he owes
any of us (his fans) anything, much less "in-depth" explanations of
lyrics he wrote years ago.  No one forces you to like a band.  The
relationship between band and fan is very casual, based on mutual
enjoyment of the music.  There are no hostages in this relationship, no
debts to be paid.  Just as you do not owe Rush loyalty by buying ALL
their albums, they do not owe you loyalty of explaining them to you.
Besides, i doubt very much that  they ever intended  folks to base
their lives on Rush lyrics, no matter how poetic they are.  Can you
imagine what the world would be like if everyone based their lives and
decisions on  the music of The Osmonds?  Think about it.....

	thanks for your patience!

Ok, I have received about 35 votes so far.
I will post the results in tomorrow's digest, so the deadline is 5pm
Wednesday to get your votes in.

Again, here is the ballot:

1. I think a 4th permanent member of Rush is a good idea.

2. I think a 4th member to play keyboards IN CONCERT is a good idea.

3. I think Rush should remain a trio, even live.

Send votes to: nam2@po.cwru.edu

I also want to thank John "Slythex" Santore for hosting a GREAT time in
Pittsburgh this weekend. Had a lot of fun and met a few more NMSers, which
is always cool. (You know you're Rush fans when you rewind Strange Brew 5
times so you can see the Rush sticker on the back of the van.) :-)

Subject: Rush at Homecoming...

Hello NMSers...

Just an answer to Thomas Beaudoin's questiona bout Rush at high
school. Well, yes last fall I returned home for "my" homecoming.  The
theme of homecoming was "A Night of Magic" or something. The theme
song was, lo and behold, Presto.

Let Me tell you how silly that was.  Presto is just about one of the
worst song to have as a theme for a dance...no way to dance...no one
knows it...It's gotta be one of the worst choices for a theme song
(well, except maybe In the Mood...:)).

Now, I'd like to fend off any flames.  I AM NOT BAGGING ON PRESTO!!!!
Presto is, infact, my favorite Rush song.  It is the song that got me
to give Rush a second listen.  (Then a third, fourth...etc..)

Well, Just posting my $0.02.

No Flames (unless they are good!)!

Greets:
     I haven't been on TNMS for well over a year now, so at the risk
of backtracking, I'll keep this short and sweet.

1.  Fourth member?!?  Rush is a marriage and it is unlikely that they
would open-up to a fourth member.  It's unthinkable.  I am reminded of
Mr. Syme's contributions, particularly on 'Losing It', but his playing
is poetic justice that accentuates the emotive power of the songs.
Beyond that, it's unthinkable.
Must have been running out of topics here at TNMS!  :)

2.  I was flipping channels on my cable (in awe, having just returned
from 4 years in Germany) and I guess I came across some bible-toting,
God channel as they were taking Rock tracks, digitizing and enhancing
them and playing them reverse.  Entranced, I watched 'em damn Def Leppard,
Quiet Riot, Sabbath (of course), Judas Priest (of course) and Slayer
(of course), amongst others.  Then the Three Great Ones flashed across
the screen (vintage 1975ish) in concert playing, 'Anthem'.  I was
incensed!  I mean, a group really hasn't made-it until the Bible
people play their stuff backwards and blame the ills of society on them!
This was the live version (on ATWAS, I presume), mind you.  The piece
this nut had chosen was the "owe it all to me" part at the beginning of the
song.  Risking my health, I drew close to my set and listened to 'em play
the song forward.  Alright.  Then he played it backwards and sure enough,
yddeG says, "Come to the side of Satan!"  Amazing!  It really sounded like
he said that!  Isn't technology amazing?  After all the Rush I've listened
to in my years, I should be an axe-murdering, devil-worshipping, Pinto-
driving fool by now!

   A footnote to this is the fact that I have a very good digitizer for my
Amiga computer.  I tried the same trick with 'Anthem Live' and all I got
after multiple different techniques was, "IUYOIJSJBUYGWHW".  Garbage.

If you have the LP version (LPs - remember those?  ;) ) you can hear
most of what's said at the end of the concert.  I think they put it in
(left it in?) on purpose as something for a little humor.  It goes
something to the effect they come off stage saying, "Wow!  What a show!
 Yeah!  Well, see ya!  Yep!"  then you hear the door slam.  I suppose
it was supposed to be them leaving the stage and then leaving the arena
to go home.

On a different note - I've never seen this posted/asked anywhere, so
I'll ask it.  The very very beginning of Show Don't Tell, before the
heavy guitar riff - what is it?  I mean, it doesn't seem to have
anything to do with the rest of the song.  Is is intended to set some
mood or texture, or is it just there to sound cool or what?  Or, am I
missing something here?

Subject: Backwards spine insert in _Presto_ CD

Ahh..  Here's a new thread (I hope):

Ever since I got my _Presto_ CD, something has bothered me.  If you look
at the "spine" (long, narrow end) of the jewel box on the hinged side, the
paper insert is upside-down.

This means that when I put the disc back on the rack with the others, I have
to turn the whole thing around to get the printing to go the same way as all
the other CD's.  I only have one other disc like this, but the name escapes me
at the moment.  Are all _Presto_ CD's like this?

I've heard this one before...it's often used by -that- kind of Rush fan in
reference to why every album after Album X (typically MP or Signals) sucks.
The implication seems to be that the Gedmeister has total control over the
band and can force Alex and Neil to 'go pop' if he wants to, which is total BS.

	Howdee folks

	Well, I got my NMS T-shirt today and needless to say I was very pleased.
I am just wondering though, why the Mars quote?  I am not sure what the
connection is(I know it's a lyric, I was just wondering how it fits in with
the NMS shirt idea).  Anyway, great job & thanks, Meg!

     [ "We've got Mars on the horizon..." is the quote in question here (from
       "Red Lenses" for those of you who can't think that fast. :) Who does 
       the song immediately attribute the quote to? The National Midnight Star 
       of course! And since we *are* the NMS, I found that quote highly 
       appropriate.						   : rush-mgr ]

	To Mike, EMail me and we'll start a Silvermans For Dream Theater list.
I will email you and let you know some stuff about them that I know.  If anyone
else is interested, email me and we'll talk.
	About that D.T. ad that mentioned Geddy Lee & the Police, I think that
was a mistake!  The first time I heard of them was a review in one of the
guitar magazines(I think GFTPM, but I'm not quite certain), and one line in the
review was something like "People who were devastated when Geddy Lee discovered
the Police will worship this group."  Anyway, that's not exact, but the gist of
it was that people who enjoy the heavier Rush style of olden days will also
get into DT.  So I bought it, and they were sure right!  (Hopefully, I'll see
them for a 3rd time next week, so anyone in the Ft. Lauderdale or Miami area
who wants to go please email me!)  Interestingly, the same mag also mentioned
Rush in reviews of a few other groups, including Thought Industry and T-Ride.
I bought those too and they're all really cool, although they are all three
completely different from each other and from Rush.  Then again, Rush has gone
through so many stylistic changes over the years that they have probably
influenced bands in more genres than anyone else!  That keeps 'em fresh, don't
ya know.  Not to get farther off the beaten track, but while I'm on the
subject, if you like Rush and thrash or industrial/grindcore, get Thought
Industry, and if you like Rush and rythmic hard rock/vocal harmonies get 
T-Ride. You won't be disappointed.  Both are very progressive within their 
respective genres(although T-Ride is pretty tough to categorize!).
	As you can probably guess, I don't mind posts that talk about Rush-
related stuff rather than specific Rushness.  After all, you can only read so
many posts about what squiggles & squeaks are going on at 3:27 of some song!
I just think a little variety keeps the NMS fresh, so to speak.

Subject: Elavate/Evalate from the norm

All this talk about glitches on "The Camera Eye" got me thinking
about something that has always stuck out for me on "Vital Signs".
At the very end of the song, Geddy repeats, "Everybody's got to elavate
from the norm."  On one of these, it sounds like he screws up and
says, "Everybody's got to EVALATE from the norm."

Has anyone else ever noticed this "evalate" not "elavate"?
Like the man said, this is pretty trivial stuff, but I figure if
anyone who notice, it would be NMSers ;-)

Subject: Neil and lyrics.

I realize that Neil has no obligation to explain his lyrics to his fans. I
was suggesting that he modify his responses to include atleast hints or
allusions to certain works so we would not be left in the dark about songs
like the Fountain of Lamneth. (To which, a person in a agreement with me
pointed out that he usually responds with a court "Get a Life") Neil is
free to do whatever he wants to. If he wants to clam up about the
origins of his ideas, he has every right. But if he is aware of the impact
that his words have had on our outlooks, perhaps he would concern himself
with clarifying his sometimes nebulous lyrics. It would be a great service
to the diehard fans that respect him and revere him. Answers like "Get a
Life!!" and "That's ancient history!" are belittling for they dash our
hopes of further interpretation and appreciation of his prose.

	[ Perhaps it's not answering a question that is a concern of
	  Neil's, but answering a "rehashed" questioned from years and
	  years ago, over and over again.		:rush-mgr ]

I was intrigued by the kneejerk reaction that i recieved from "The
Convention Organizer" or whatever his official title is. I would expect a
more well- thought out answer that understood my view but refuted with more
than exclamatory statements like "that's ridiculous!!"

	I have always thought the end of ATWAS is keen, because you
can hear the Boyz as they exit (stage left) after the show.  It goes
something like this:

	Geddy: OOOOh!
		Wow!
		Whoah!
		Man-oh-man,
		what a show!

	If anyone is listening to it and has a better transcription,
I'd like to see it -- mine is from memory, since I wore out my ATWAS

Howdy
I'd just like to respond to the post yesterday about my comments towards
Presto and RTB. Hey I know what you're saying. I DO like some songs on
those albums, like I said, just not the albums as a whole. I myself got
into HYF as an intro album. So I understand where you're coming from. I
myself think that album is a religious experience. That's why I was so
disappointed with Presto. I had a chance to collect almost all the other
CD's before Presto came out, and was really just expecting more I guess.
Then RTB came out, and I couldn't believe it. I was so upset. I wondered
what had happened. I don't really crave the *old* stuff (2112, AFTK, etc)
and more concepts (although they're cool), I'd be real happy with some of
the type of stuff on GUP, PoW, and HYF. It just seems that they have begun
to turn more towards the type of music they were turning me away from
years ago. I mean, a rap on RTB. Has anyone really thought about this. I
had a small stroke when I heard this for the first time. At first I
thought they were poking fun at that particular style of music, but now I
don't think so. I think they were including modern music into their style.
That's fine if you like today's music. But if you listen to rush to get
away from modern music and you find it in rush's music, then it can be
rather frustrating. Oh well, talk is cheap. BTW, how come no one has
responded to my 2/15 request on info about posters and picture albums??

Subject: "glitch" in Camera Eye

Howdy,

The "glitch" in Camera Eye at 8:53 is not a belch.  After listening closely
I am 99.9% sure that it says:

"ello" - short for hello
"morning gov." - short for good-morning governor (an English greeting)

This fits in perfectly with the London theme.

As for a fourth member, maybe John Rutsey has been taking piano lessens,
anyways, I'm sure the boys know what they're doing and will make the
right choice.

Subject: Neil Peart IS GOOD &...

Ok so Neil might not be the best drummer out there, but he is certainly
the most liked and popular drummer that has ever existed (at least among
drummers) No one can argue with that.  Just take alook at the back
issues of Modern Drummer between 198-87, the magazine should have been
renamed Neil Peart Fan Club.  Plus he has won more awards than anyone I
can think of (as a matter a fact I pretty sure non one has even come close)

Steve Porcaro was a great drummer, but he never made me feel like playing
the drums..on the other hand, Neil did!

SO there...(and I'm well aware of other great drummers, including the Fusion
drummer.....) Neil made me want to listen to these guys, not the other
way around!  (I meant "fusion drummers")

This is a (late) follow-up to the guy that asked about when Geddy
stopped using the Rickenbacker 4001, etc...

If my memory serves me correctly, he used the Rick 4001 from RUSH to
Perm. Waves.  Then, for Moving Pix, he switched to a Fender Jazz.  Then
he got a Steinberger for GuP.  Finally, he moved to a Wal on Power Windows,
and has had one ever since.

Does this sound about right to all you Rush fans?

In response to the inquiry about Geddy's discovery of The Police:

	The ad you refer to is quoting a review of D***m Theater's IMAGES AND
WORDS in the August, 1992 issue of Guitar World which states that DT is "the
band longed for by die-hard Rush fans who were appalled (not "awestruck") by
Geddy Lee's discovery of The Police."  That is to say, at a point suspiciously
close to the time when The Police were real popular, Rush started to become
less progressive and adopted a more Police-esque "singles" mentality.  The new
DT album is reminiscent of the older (better, IMHO) Rush.

Hey there,

About all this rumouring about a fourth member, who knows that the new member
(assume for a minute that there will be a new member) is going to be a
keyboardist...?  Hasn't Geddy (I'm talking around the HYF era) been trying to
improve his keyboard playing, and that the return of Peter Collins might
(hopefully, IMO) return Ged to behind the ivory more often?  In other words,
why couldn't the hypothetical new member be a bassist???

I know of several bassists who would LOVE to join Rush, namely: Myself!!! :)

Well, actually, I'm glad Peter Collins is back.  As for HYF being stale and
overproduced, I disagree.  I find lots of energy in HYF, and IMO, over-
production robs music of its energy.  I think that the reason for the stale-
ness of Presto and RtB is Rupert Hine, and I'm glad he's gone.  I mean, how
could you make things simple (by getting rid of excess keyboards) and come
up with stale music- something went wrong in the production.
As for the 4th member, I think the rumour originally was a post last week
or 2 weeks ago about a VJ on MTV talking about RUSH, and mentioning the new
album, and a possible 4th member, but then again, what do those guys know.
But, why is everyone taking it for granted that a 4th member would be a
keyboardist, why not an extra bass (e.g. Ned's atomic dustbin), maybe a
backup guitar to Alex, who knows, we've already mentioned a collaboration
with Primus, myabe Les Claypool will show up.
As for RUSH collectibles, I have a cool one, Its Hemispheres on red vinyl,
in great shape, but that's not all, its autographed!  Actually, although

Subject: RUSH's music in decline???...
From: jturi@ctp.com!

Another NMS virgin here, this is my first post.

Just couldn't hold back any longer on all the crap about the later albums.
People change, people age, and people progress,   and RUSH is made up ot
three PEOPLE.  They aren't the band they were in the 70's and 80's and
they never will be again, AND THEY NEVER SHOULD BE OR TRY TO BE.
One must be able to conceive of the time has elapsed over the band's
career.  It is easy to sit at home with your CD player and plop two
pieces of plastic in and listen to two albums 5 minutes apart, but to
compare them the way people do here is ludicrous at best.
Rather selfish of people to be saying that RUSH should be making the
music that WE want to hear, huh?  For those who want RUSH to be more like
they were earlier on, GO HOME AND LISTEN TO 2112, CoS, etc... because those
albums are what you want.  If RUSH didn't progress like they've been doing,
they'd have been long gone from the music scene.

Personally, I think each and every album is fantastic on its own, and even
more so when it is scene as a part of such an incredible spectrum of
music that they have done.

okay, I feel better now...

From: Matthew Joseph Desantis &lt;md4l+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;
Subject: Rush/Police/Various

	First of all, let's get some things straight. Rush has no fourth member
playing keyboards or bass lines (While Geddy Plays kbds). The rig of
sequencers, samplers and the effects alone are over three cabinets full.
	Some people rail against the practice of even triggering samples and
sequences in the middle of the songs. There's one school that insists,
"if they wrote it, sequenced it, and triggered it, it's OK" and then
there is this other group that insists,"I want them to be playing every
note I hear" And I am somewhere in the middle. I mean in the beginning
they did not have the cash to rig even a 1970s synth setup (They might
have been against it) Their albums have sold consistently enough to
allow them to expand their range, so if they choose to trigger samples,
or sequences, or if neil wants to play Simmons electric drums, they have
that right ... they have earned it through tough gigging in the early
1970s.

	The only problem I have with the overabundance of keyboards (and I play
'em) is that a rush show becomes "clogged" with digital whine sometimes
- there are so many patterns playing that to an "untrained" Rush ear, it
sounds cacophonous - but to a Rush fan is pure order and synchronicity.

	The best rush-synth years in my opinion are the years from hemispheres
up until ESL. You see, Geddy might not have had the chord voicing
knowledge at this point, but they used them sparingly, and it never
really overshadowed the guitar and bass playing. Geddy used a
memory-moog, taurus pedals, and later the Oberheim analog series. These
synths had depth, warm analog atmosphere. I'm impressed with the new
machinery- what it can do, but you can't get certain sounds out of them-
even a sample is not the same.

	As for the Police influencing Rush, I think he mentioned it in a Radio
interview (In the Studio w/ Moving Pictures) w/ redbeard. Listen to The
Police in the Singles collection. The calculated (though minimalistic)
drumming (Even the sound on Sting's bass)

	I'm not even going to make much comment on the Fourth member issue,
What do you people want, like Rutsey to play congas or something?

	And not only does Neil shy away from a pop following- he shies away
from ANY following. I always say this, and I will say it again. Neil is
not God. He knows a limited number of licks - and there are many jazz
players that can dog him - in terms of instinct and tastefulness. Maybe
Neil should lighten up. It may open him to new forms of expression. I
mean seriously, I'm not doubting his talent - he can play quite well -
very calculated. I've gone through all of the subtleties of his playing
before. And as far as the writing. Often people here quote him as a
playwright - Like Shakespeare (or even Shelley or Byron) What gives.
There are many writers who write on a lower level (Springsteen)
resulting in the same, or even more insight. Instrospection can be
accomplished through simple writing - look at dylan. I tend to criticize
Neil....

Subject: Rush Philosophy

Hello,

I would like to reply to Mark Miesch's comments about Neil Peart's philosophy.
I agree with the comments that Rush hasn't discarded their old philosophy
but rather it has gone through some modifications. But it seems to be
basically the same at the core.

I see Ayn Rand's philosophy in such recent works as Prime Mover and Mission.
The basic philosophy laid out in songs from Roll The Bones is also similiar.
Read "Atlas Shrugged" (A book about prime movers) and see what you think.
If you disagree you would have at least read a good book.

I will agree with those who say that Neil has become more reflective. He also
seems to be saying "This is my philosophy-take it or leave it." and in the
earlier works it had more of a black and white (Right or Wrong) sound.

He has his own philosophy. He is Neil Peart not Ayn Rand, John Dos Passos, or
anyone else. He agrees with part of their philosphy but he decides what he
likes. Don't peg him into a corner.

That's my 2 cents. I like all Rush. From Rush to Roll the Bones.

P.S. A perfect album? How about side one: Prime Mover, Bravado, Marathon,
Freewill, Limelight, and Xanadu. Side two: 2112, Something for Nothing, Anthem,
and In the End.
