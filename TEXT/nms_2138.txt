Subject: Geddy's Voice at Hammermsith/AFWTK - 1978

Hey Rushians,

I've noticed something about Geddy's voice on the Hammersmith Set
of DS and the "A Farwell To Kings" album.  It seems to my ears that Geddy
was really using his voice in an odd way, maybe even forcing it to go
in this "odd way."  His voice sounds very "razory" and screechy but not
the way his voice sounded high-pitched/screechy on 2112 ot ATWAS.

Has anyone else noticed how Geddy's voice is so different and much
more screech (and almost kid-sounding) on AFTK and the Hammersmith set?

I mean, I knew that Geddy had to tone down a little bit from the 
crazy screaming he did on 2112.  However, just listen to how Geddy
says "by" or "sky" during "Xanadu."  He sounds VERY strange.  His voice
has always puzzled me anyway I guess.  To expand on this, listen to his
phrasing of some of the older stuff like 2112 or "The Spirit of Radio" on
Different
Stages.  He also sings "be unfurled" during the "Temple of Syrinx" part of
2112.  His phrasing on this line "be unfurled" is STRAIGHT FROM a song
off Power Windows (though I can't quite place the song right - mayeb someone
could help me????)  I think it might be Territories or some other song.  His
phrasing
on Limelight is strange also..."in _ the _ Limelight."  He actually uses two
different
phrasings in Limelight.  By the way, when I say phrasing I mean, basically,
how
he annunciates some of the lyrics.  I don't  know if "phrasing" is the
proper term or not.

If anyone has an opinion about Geddy's voice on DS set 1,2,3 or the
1977-1979 period,
please email me.  Thanks.

Chris

WARNING:
    BORING TECHNICAL STUFF ABOUT GEDDY'S PLAYING

Good description.  I belive another Ged-head on the list called it a
"pick-finger" technique (sorry can't remember the name).  He strikes the
strings on the down and up stroke ala using a pick and an alternating
picking style.  The debate is ongoing, does he hit with one finger or a
combo.  I was lucky enough to be 2nd row right in front of him at Jones
Beach last tour, and can vividly remember Ged using the technique with
one finger alone ( Animate, bridge like section - "My counterpart, my
foolish heart ...").  Other times (CTTH jam) he had his whole hand
clawed and was furiously wailing. Obviously, it sounds great a generates
a "new" sound for the master.  I think it became prominent on
Counterparts, in fact isn't that when he switched back to the Jazz
Bass?  Hmm... So I tried the technique (I think I've got it pretty good
now after like three months of refining my aim to only pick one string)
on a Jazz, Wal, Steinberger, Rick and Modulus (for fun).  I found it
sounded best on the Jazz, a good rattle and strong tone and worst on the
Wal.  In my opinion, he may have switched basses as he developed the
technique.

    Which brings me to DS.  Fantastic, the best live Rush recording. I
think Ged's Fenders and Alex's axe lineup (PRS and a Les Paul I believe)
made a huge impact along with superior recording equipment.  Yes they're
great performances, but I think the instruments do make a difference.
Worth the wait.

I was in row 2 the night before right in front of Alex at the Marcus
Amphitheatre in Milwaukee and he did have major problems.  Actually it
started with Stick It Out, just before Driven.  Right when SIO began, at the
opening sequence there was no guitar sound.  It's funny to watch him
immediately look to the right at Jimmy Johnson who's in total panic mode,
and both Ged and Neil are looking over like "oh boy this sounds bad."  Alex
fiddles with a few nobs and 8 beats later... no guitar, only bass and hi-hat
clicking along.  Alex is mouthing words off stage like, "it ain't working!"
Frenzied fix it things going on at stage right, another 8-beats.... nothing.
Finally Jimmy runs out with another guitar and they pull a super-fast guitar
switch, plug him in and finally... guitar!  The crowd offered an applause of
appreciation and it was obvious that Alex was a bit miffed.  This was right
before Ged came in to sing "Trust to your instinct."  Anyway, that song
ended and Ged introduced 'Driven' to which Alex rips into the opening guitar
riff only to be stunned once again by complete silence.  He just stopped and
kind of slouched in disgust and disbelief.  His worst nightmare.  JJ does
something else and Alex tries it again but it's still broken.  At this point
he just stopped and JJ comes out on stage and it's clear there's something
major wrong.  Geddy starts talking about how Alex spent all day golfing and
forgot how to play with his 'thing'.  "His thing is broken."  We all got a
kick out of that.  Then Geddy starts playing a little "country and western
music" improv' and Neil joined in to stall for a minute.  JJ and Alex
finally realize that there's nothing wrong with the guitar, it's the
transmitter thingy the guitar plugs into on his back.  So they undo it all
and hook up a new one and plug it in and Alex finally strums a loud open
chord to which there is... sound!  The crowd cheered and Alex raised his
arms in triumph.  Way cool.  They went on with Driven and there were no
other problems all night.

Subject: Am I missing something from DS?

Did I get a bad copy of DS?  The label on the outside says one of the CDs is
enhanced with a note "See details inside" - I opened up the package, and
it's a tri-fold cardboard CD holder, with one loose CD holder for the 3rd
disc - I did not find any information about the enhanced CD, and there was
no booklet - did a booklet of some sort come with the disc?

Also, the DS commercial was on the Howard Stern show a couple of days ago,
but I missed it!  I went to the bathroom, and when I came back in the room I
got a half a second glimpse of the tinkertoys on the screen!  Damn!

It's great being at a concert that many of the songs on DS were recorded
from, specifically Great Woods Amphitheater for 2112 and LTTA!

Please let me know if I am missing something from my CD package via email,
and I'll rip CD Universe a new asshole :-)

Subject: the crazy enhanced CD

Hi, folks: long time no post for me, though i've been hanging around on 
this list for about 7 years and my Rush parodies from several years back 
can be found on the NMS website.  My question: is the clusterworks 
"laser show" supposed to go along with the audio from the first CD?  i 
have a Dell pentium 200 (not a Mac), and i can only get the "light show" 
to play along with new-agey clusterworks music.  Is there some secret 
trick to getting the special effects to respond to the Rush music?? 
Otherwise, it seems like a great waste to me.

I was intrigued by the recent suggestion in TNMS that Geddy sneezes 
around 4:22-4:23 on AFTK on the 3rd disk of DS.  I don't think it is a 
sneeze, though: it sounds like a fuzzy cymbal hit.  I'm curious as to 
what others think.  And why would Geddy sneeze into the microphone?

Hey -- speaking of Cinderella Man on the 3rd disk, what does Geddy (or 
someone) say right before the bass solo (at 2:19) ?? Something like "me

Subject: Geddy's technique

As a bassist, I use whatever technique it takes to get the sound I'm
looking for...Closer to the Heart kindof jams at the end, and Ged wants
that rather heavy sound, so that technique is used...someone mentioned
"Driven" earlier, and that is played completely different than almost
anything else we know Geddy for as well.

I like to play with sound on my bass, so that means that for a more
"bassy" sound I move up towards the neck. for a little more trebele I move
down towards the bridge...I use the strings to "bounce" my hands off of
while slapping and popping, and even hammer on the higher octave when
slap/popping in octaves to give it a 32nd note feel, its whatever
goes...whatever sounds cool, even effects come into it at times, I always
loved how cool Chris Squire's bass work sounded on "Tormato", and alot of
that was done with alot of flange on the bass....

I understand exactly what you are talking about, and yes, I'm sure many
bassists do that to get that specific feeling and effect ;)

(ps, the only thing I *won't* do is play with a pick...or a drill like
Billy Sheehan (who is awesome on the Explorer's Club album))

The new CD rocks!   2112!  Natural Science!  Cygnus!  Analog Kid!
I saw the "big" show twice.....both were great.  Once was in Dallas and the
second was Great Woods, Mansfield Ma.  That is where they recorded 2112!
PSYCHED!

The enhanced CD program runs great at my house.....a piddley P166, 64 megs,
and win98.  At work I have an HP Kayak XW, the machine kicks butt with duel
400s and 512 of memory, and NT 4.0......the program doesn't run.  Go figure.
I'm not sure what the source of the trouble is, I have not had time to look
into it.

I will say this though, the program is damn cool, even though I thought the

Hello All!!!

I bought "Different Stages" the day it came out sometime around 4:00pm at
our local Walmart!
$23.45....(should have gone to Best Buy)...
I bought the LAST ONE they had.....funny that they did'nt put it the new
release section.
I asked the lady working the register in the music department if they had
sold many and she said
they had put 10 out that morning ((I HAD TO ASK))!!!
I wonder how well this fantastic live compilation will do as far as
sales????
I guess no matter how well it does.......it wont get what it truly
deserves...

I have put all my other CDs away and are comfortably resting in their

Subject: DS: Sound & Packaging

I listened to DS at work on tuesday. I think it sounds awesome! Just one
thing...I don't know if it is my crappy work headphones or not but it
seemed that the guitar was coming mainly from the left channel and the bass
from the right. But I could hear the drums in boths ears. Did anyone else
notice this or do I need to make an ear appointment?

The other thing I found moderately annoying is the third disc being in that
slim, loose package. I'm afraid of it falling out everytime I open the
case. So what I did was take the booklet out and put the third CD in a
seperate jewel case with it. I am going to scan in the picture of the
Hammersmith Odeon and use that for the back of the jewel case (instead of
cutting up the original to make it fit). For now I'm using the RUSH concert
pic-on that piece of paper explaing the picture maker-in the back of the
jewel case.

A lot of people are complaining about Closer To The Heart (CTTH) being on
yet another RUSH live album but I have to say that it sounds awesome and is
one of the highlights of the album for me. What a great jam! Discovery (in
2112) is another highlight. I could have lived w/o Tom Sawyer again but
otherwise I'm very, very satisfied.

I played it for my lady on Tues over the phone line but, for some reason I
just couldn't understand, she wasn't all that excited. Women...hmmph!*

Hey Rush freaks,

I cant' say much more than what has already been said of DS, except that 
I have been totally blown away.  I played it for a couple people who 
*doubt* that Geddy is  one of the best bass players in the world.  I 
think that "Driven" and CTTH maybe alter ed their opinions slightly.  
Great live compilation, I'm very happy.

AS for  the fold out, I was curious as to why no memorabilia from FBN or 
CoS were present.  I personally like both albums and  I wondered why 
they weren't represented.

   [ It's quite possible they couldn't find anything, or don't have anything
     left... :-)                                                 : rush-mgr ]

And as  for you whiners about songs that didn't fit your "standards,"  
everything Rush does will have its critics.  There's no pleasing 
everyone, so quit bitching  because you thought the liner notes weren't 
up to par, or "animate" was played too slow.  If you're that 
disappointed, why not give your set to some Rush fan who hasn't gotten 
it yet, for free!  That charitab le act would make up well for your 
complaints!

For Anthem on Disc 3, I keep hearing Geddy say "know your crazy life is 
where you want to be."  Am I hearing this right, or is his inflection 
just off?

Rush on! 

Chris

Hey Rush heads,

In reply to Fred Pinto's raving lunacy the other day:

Fred urged us all to buy all Rush CD's.  I already own them all.  I must
agree with you, Fred, that Caress of Steel totally kicks ass.  Even the
title of this third album is awesome.  Think about it "Caress of Steel."

I think every song on this album is spectacular.  Like most Rush fans, I
could do without "I think I'm going bald," but otherwise, it is by far my
favorite album to listen too even after 24 years!

The very first time I played it and heard the awesome beginning licks of
"Bastille Day," I was hooked.

"Lakeside Park" is a very good song, IMHO.  I think the guitar playing is
excellent, but of course this is no expert's opinion.  Just a fan.

I have said in this forum many times that one of my favorite Rush tunes is
"The Necromancer."  I think it is still one of Rush's most raw sounding and
kick ass tunes in their entire repertoire.  The middle part where Lerxst and
Ged pound on their guitars is sooooo classic and hard sounding.  In the last
part when Ged starts singing and then fades out into Alex's solo is so
awesome, it still brings goose bumps to my skin every time I hear it.  (Too
bad my wife doesn't feel the same way!)

Finally, "The Fountain of Lamneth," IMHO is the best concept side Rush has
ever done.  (bring on the flames!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  Not to take away anything
from 2112, which of course, I think is awesome too.  I totally love The
Fountain.

For anyone who is a relatively new Rush Fan or just a casual one, go out and
Purchase Caress of Steel.  I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.  Do
not buy it on tape because they mix up the songs and Fountain isn't in it's
entirety on the b side.  Buy the CD, open a bottle of wine, or whatever your
pleasure, set the volume to your threshold of pain (or your neighbors), lay
back, and enjoy.

Peace,
Max

PS - love different stages, just love COS more.

Subject: You know...Another Review

Greetings Rushians!!

By the themes of the last couple digests, it looks as if everyone is either 
deaf or hoarse after the long awaited release from the greatest band in the 
world.

Haven't posted in a while... blah... blah... blah.

Some deep Rush thoughts on the new CD that perhaps may not come to bear. 
 Many listeners and subscribers over the next several weeks will no doubt 
completely dissect the playing abilities of our three heroes.  E-mail's 
will be sent back and forth by skilled and not so skilled musicians 
wondering, "How'd they do that?"  Rather than giving a play by play review 
of the entire CD, I would like to offer a thought on one aspect of the CD 
that, to me, is a wonderful testament to Rush's longevity and perseverance.

Geddy's voice.

A couple years ago, some guy named "Snowdog" wrote in this digest that 
Geddy should be replaced by another singer, that his voice just didn't hold 
up to the days of 2112 and Permanent Waves.  This, due to a somewhat 
different vocal performance on TFE.

I responded in kind, declaring that such an assertion was patently 
ridiculous and Ged's voice was as good as it ever was, and perhaps even 
better.  I detailed his use of different vocal styles over the last three 
albums and concluded that if any rock vocalist's v-cords had stood the test 
of time, it was Geddy's.  Maybe some of you remember this discussion.

Ah, yes... the redemption comes and reality is revealed.  Different Stages 
is a rousing, unbelievable accomplishment in the vocal development of Geddy 
Lee.  It is no wonder that he produced the album himself?  Could the 
deciding factor for selecting specific tracks coincide with his excellent 
vocal performance?  Chicago! Chicago! That happenin' town!

On 2112, Geddy really pulls out the stops and hits many of the high points 
that many thought he would never sing again.  Yes, he doesn't screech like 
the 70's (as evidenced in the Hammersmith Odeon performance) but he hasn't 
since Permanent Waves anyway.  His vocalization changed with Moving 
Pictures and has remained rather constant (except for an amazing 
performance on Power Windows).  After all, he's in his forties.  Every rock 
singer alive has had to change styles somewhat in order to meet the tests 
of age and vocal longevity (Bono and Robert Plant come to mind).  Usually, 
there is an album or albums that highlight a vocal shift or comfort with a 
different style (for Bono, "The Unforgettable Fire" for Plant, maybe 
"Houses of the Holy" but I'm open to suggestions).

On DS as a whole, Geddy's vocal performance is bar none - especially on the 
older tunes.  You would never know that much has changed since the days of 
old.  Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, the Trees - Geddy attacks each song 
where the listener has feelings of 1982 again.  Having been a fan first of 
Ged's singing before I recognized or understood Rush's musical athleticism 
(I was only ten, after all), DS is a rare treat.

So go back under that rock Mr. Snowdog.  DS has what Rush fans have been 
waiting for : Redemption, exultation, jubilation and Animation.

Take a bow, Mr. Lee.  You deserve it.

Clem

When the dust has cleared
And victory denied
A summit to lofty
River a little too wide
If we keep our pride
Though paradise is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost

Hey all,

GUESS WHAT.  I HAVEN't BOUGHT DS YET!  Yeah, doesn't it suck?  No, i'm not a 
wierdo or someone who listens to just TS and RTB.  Actually, I placed an 
order through amazon, then ersases it because I thought i would go to Best 
Debt later on that night.  Didn't happen.  But after reading NMS 2136 and 
just revelling in the good cheer, I'm zipping off to the nearest music store 
(a half hour away) and buying the album.  

With all due respect to the jazz giants I worship, I simply love this band and 
all that they've done.  I also agree with the person who said that Rush fans 
have to be the most dedicated (besides Dead fans) and persistent out there.  
maybe because we know we're supporting an underdog.

I'm speeding, not driving, to the music store NOW!!

ObDuh:  This album rocks.  The cd-damaging packaging sucks.
I too am having trouble with the ClusterWorks thingie, but
I attribute this to the lack of a sound card in the machine
I'm currently using at work.  ClusterWorks' website sucks.
They're not worthy of the hard work and dedication that Rush
puts into their own product, IMNSHFO.

I like all the Geddy Rickenbacker jamming in London a lot.

$18.88 at Fry's Electronics in Wilsonville Oregon wasn't a
bad deal at all, though I'm loathe to patronize such a
civil-rights abusing corporation.  Anyone that's been there 
knows what I mean:  their workers who want to search your
receipt and merchandise as you leave the store.  Under the
Uniform Commercial Code of the USA, merchandise becomes the
personal property of the customer at the moment of sale, not
upon leaving the store's property.  Fry's has *no* right to
inspect your personal property, and their tactic of asking
to do so when you leave their store amounts to a violation 
of your right to a protection from unreasonable search. 
Next time you're at Fry's you can refuse to show them your
receipt and merchandise.  You can sue them for false arrest
if they detain you without reasonable cause.

If you've never been to a Fry's, well, good for you.

Subject: 2112 - a full step lower

Probably not too surprising given the lower range in recent years that Geddy
has sung but did anyone notice that 2112 on DS has been dropped by a full
step? Instead of the first two notes being E to A, it's now D to G. I thought
something sounded odd when i first heard it so I grabbed my bass and sure
enough it had been dropped a full step. He does sound stronger on the high
parts but this appeared to be a first, at least on recorded material.

Cheers,

Hello fellow NMS'ers!

I purchased my copy of DS on Tuesday at Best Buy for the incredible price of
$16.99 plus the freakin' 8.5 % sales tax to the state of California.  GREATEST
CD purchase I have ever made in my life.  I loved the great sounding quality
of the live recordings.  I sure wish they had decided to take pieces of other
shows than mainly focusing in on Chicago.  Don't get me wrong, you guys
rocked!  I was moved to tears knowing that the album was dedicated to Neil's
late wife and daughter.  Very classy, sincere, and heartwarming.

Quit the damn bitching about the packaging.  Just do what I did.  Get some
old jewel cases, or buy some new empty ones from your favorite record

can encase your Paper cover in lucite, and put it on a shelf next to your
bowling trophies and pictures of your Grandmother.  If you people would put

I will probably receive major flames for writing this, but I for one really
don't like live albums at all, and will not purchase Different Stages.  I
really only own two live albums...KISS Alive II and Exit Stage Left.  I like
watching live videos of concerts, and also like attending shows, but I can't
seem to get into just listening to live recordings of songs that I already
have and that, in my opinion, sound better in the studio than live in
concert.

In fact, many live albums are put out by record companies just for something
they can make money from while their bands are taking a long break between
records.  Judas Priest just released a new live album, for example, one
album after replacing Rob Halford with Ripper Owens.  I mean, who needs
this?  I am a huge Priest fan, but I see no need for this.

So cheers to everyone who enjoys this new live album from Rush.  But I won't
be this excited until a new studio album comes out.

and YES- Relayer were his favorite albums! I always thought Relayer was one of
the best YES albums out there! As far as The WHO,  W O W !!! The WHO is tied
with our boys as my favorite bands!!! How cool is that! I also like PRIMUS a
lot too!
     Once again our faithful RUSH-MGR keeps us informed on this breaking story
that is  R U S H.
        For now,
          Keith
PS
  Natural Science is my fave song on DS, with Driven a close second
(SO FAR)

Hello all,

I was among the thousands of fans who saw Rush play at Great Woods
(Massachusetts) on June 23, 1997, and I'm quite pleased that at least a
portion of that show made it onto Different Stages.

I was glad that Geddy's comment after 2112, "We'll be back in twenty minutes
after some brain surgery" made it onto the album... I got a good laugh when
first heard it at the concert, and now I can listen to it over and over and
over...

rlambert@foliage.com asked:
>>>>Some early reports claimed that The Rhythm Method had been recorded at
Great Woods (Mansfield, MA). But, according to the album insert, it was
recorded in
Chicago.  I'm inclined to believe the album insert but, can anyone confirm
this??
<<<<

Ray, I believe the jacket comments. The Rhythm Method at Great Woods got
people clapping along in time to parts of it, but I don't hear that on the DS
take.  (I wonder why they decided to use the Chicago version of the Rhythm
Method, when the Great Woods version had more audience involvement...)

Of the 3 shows I saw from TFE, my favorite was the one I saw in Hartford, CT
on November 10, 1996.  That didn't make it onto the album.  But these things
are pretty subjective.

Anyways, it's a really great 3 and a half hours of music that'll give us years
of listening enjoyment.

I agree 100% with "Middletown Dreams".  Al's guitar work is amazing
especially through headphones on this track.  "Mystic Rhythms" is also
kind neat as there is a lot going that is much easier to hear with
headphones.

Later.
