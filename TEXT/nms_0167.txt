Hi all,

    Just a quick note; a chance to complain.  When you send mail to 
Syrinx, please send it to the correct address.  I've gotten several
items lately here that should have been sent to the administrative
address.  Luckily, I've set it up so mail to "rush_mailing_list@syrinx"
will bounce (it's not a real address), so the list isn't getting these
items directly.  It just takes me longer to get the issues out if things
need to be transferred back and forth.

    Also, the list is still blossoming; were up to about 650 individuals
out there!  Keep spreading the word!

Hey folks -

In 02/04/91 TNMS #165, a couple of folks (PDK and CFYNX)
mentioned Aimee Mann's singing on "Time Stand Still" and perhaps
more.

First of all, I'm enlightened, having not known the source of that
voice.  Second, can anyone shed additional light on the
Aimee/Rush collaboration.  What does "Visions" say about the
relationship?

An important side note for this out-of-touch European: when
is 'Til Tuesday coming out with new music, or have they already?

This might be covered in the FAQ, it might not. Don't have it handy.
Has anybody but me noticed that the album covers coincide from one
album to the next? For instance, Exit .. Stage Left has symbols
scattered around the cover from all the previous albums. Also
compare Power Windows with Hold Your Fire -- there's a glow from
the window in PW, and the room in PW can be seen through the window
on HYF. How many other matches have I missed? (perhaps from the
gaps in my collection!)

Hi all,
	I remember that M80 going off in the crowd there.  I also remember
rumors flying around the place afterwards that somebody had died and that
Rush had said they were never coming back.  Luckily - that wasn't the
case.
	That same "killer show" almost killed me, too.  I was on the floor
up near the front somewhere, and the crowd was crazy.  There were times
that my feet were off the floor for several minutes while I just kind of
got swept along in a sea of sweating people.  Somehow - I ended up next
to some guy that was a cross between Hulk Hogan and Freddy Krueger.  He was
obviously on some kind of really powerful stuff, 'cause when things got
too tight, he would just spread his arms and move the ENTIRE crowd.  I
remember seeing people about 50 feet away getting bowled over in this
incredible domino effect.  And I had the pleasure of being stuck next to
this man.
	Any other band in the world I would have either gone home, or
at least given way to a few people.  I'm just bummed that I didn't have
the whole thing on tape.  Would've been nice, eh?

thought #1.

my experience with rush's opening bands has been thus:

helix      - grace under pressure; capital centre, largo, md
             (they apparently were supposed to have
              a band called zebra open but they canceled
              at the last minute)

[ Hey, I was there!  Gee, I didn't see you...  :-)              :rush-mgr ]

tommy shaw - hold your fire; spectrum, philadelphia, pa

mr. big    - presto; spectrum, philadelphia, pa

---
thought #2.

here's an idea to keep in the back of your heads: seeing as how we
have quite a big following on this list and that a rush tour this
fall seems likely, it might be fun to get groups of 'tnms' readers
together for some of the concerts.  in know that here around dc
at least, we have quite a few members (including our venerable
rush-mgr) in the immediate area.  granted there are considerable
logistical problems to this proposition but i think it would be
worth a try.

[ We did this with some success for the Presto show (hi people!).  It's
  tough trying to find a place to meet, unless you meet at a local's house
  before-hand.  This won't work for some, as they get to the show just 
  before it starts.  We managed it by saying "meet at entrance &lt;xxx&gt; at
  &lt;designated time&gt;".  If it works out, I think it's a neat idea.  I'm
  flexible; I'll meet anywhere!  :-)                           :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Unreleased songs and production numbers.

Charles Grogan said:

"Another favorite device is to get a riff going in a certain time
signature and to stick in others in between as transitions. This happens
in Hyperspace: Natural Science where the guitar and bass are playing a
scale pattern in 7/8 and switching to 4/8 simply to support the melodic
line. They've been doing for a while, the earliest example that I can
think of is By Pass and the Road Hog."

Could you tell me what these last two songs are?  On which boots can
one find them?  From what era?  Are they more pre-first album stuff,
or are they actually good?  I assume they aren't too bad, since they
change time signatures!

[ Tee hee, I missed this the first time around.  I think he's referring to
  "By Tor and the Snow Dog", from _Fly By Night_.  If I'm wrong, I'll let
  Charles slap me down himself...                                :rush-mgr ]

Also, there was some discussion about production numbers: tracks that
RUSH records without intending to do them live.  The first time I
heard Neil mention this was when I was reading my Moving Pictures
program, waiting for the show to start back in '81.  He mentioned
"Witch Hunt" as a production number, since much of the song couldn't
be played live without using tapes and overdubs.  On that reading,
songs like Available Light and Losing It are production numbers, but I
can't think of too many more.

It was either the "A Farewell To Kings" or the "Hemispheres" tour
when I saw Rush for the first time, playing the Civic Center in
St. Paul, MN.  The opening band that night was Golden Earring.

From: larrys@dbase.A-T.COM (Larry Stein)
Subject: Superconductor

There seems to be a lot of confusion as to the time signatures in
Superconductor.  Hopefully, this will clear things up.

It's hard to figure out the signatures in this song for two reasons.
Obviously the song switches between even and odd signatures, but
worse than that is the fact the Neil plays an even signature "on top
of" the underlying odd one.  Secondly, during the end of the song,
Geddy doesn't come in on beat one with his vocals, he alternates from
comming in on beat two and comming in on the upbeat of one.

So, here goes nothing.

The song starts in 7/4.
It switches to 4/4 for the "Hits you in a soft place.." part and stays
there until the measure in which Geddy sings "That's entertainment."
That one measure is in 6/4.  It then switches immediately into 7/4 for
the second verse (it is here that Neil plays in 4).  Again, it switches
to 4/4 at the point where Geddy sings "Hits you in a soft place..."
Now, it stays in 4/4 for the rest of the song with the exception of
two measures.  The two measures immediately before the last time Geddy
sings "Hits you in a soft place, a melody so sweet" are in 6/4 and 7/4.
From, then on, the song is in 4/4.  As mentioned above, the reason
why the end of the song appears to have some time changes is due
to Geddy.  The line "Watch her every move" begins on beat 2 while the
first time Geddy sings "Watch his every move" begins on the upbeat
of one.  Keep your attention on Neil during this part and the 4/4
time becomes clear.

Subject: tennis and Rush

I think _Hold Your Fire_ was mixed at Guillame Tell, a very well-known
studio in Paris [Sting's new album was partially recorded there, as
well as a lot of Bryan Ferry's stuff]. Anyways, Rush were there in the
summer I believe, and since the French Open is held at Stade Roland
Garros during the summer, I assume that they probably saw some matches
there. Geddy and Alex are big tennis fans, so maybe they had a very good
experience at the French Open. I can't remember the year, but was that
the year that Michael Chang beat Lendl, then Edberg in 5 sets after
being down by 2? If they saw that, they probably wouldn't forget it!

Subject: Warren Cromartie Park

In TNMS #164 Cheryl talked about the Signals blueprint and its various
puns.  One of these puns I noticed several years ago was "Warren Cromartie
Park"  Is this park named after the same Warren Cromartie who played for the
Expos several years ago?  Since Geddy is a avid baseball fan, it seems natural
to name a park after a famous baseball player.

Does anybody know if Rupert Hine is producing Rush's latest album?  I liked
his production values on Presto and hope he continues working with the band.

&gt;Subject: The letter D&gt;Superconductor
&gt;
&gt;I always assumed it was quite obvious that "Brought to you by the
&gt;letter D" had to do with the fact that the CD is DDD - as in digital
&gt;recording, mixing, and mastering. Maybe I was wrong to assume this but
&gt;I think this is a good explaination.

well, good assumption, but you forget the fact that
"Brought to you by the letter D", etc, was on the _ALBUMS_ long before
CDs were around.... I think the Sesame Street explanation is the correct
one... plus, to my knowledge, Rush CDs prior to Power Windows were in
AAD; HYF, Power Windows, and Presto are in DDD, while ASOH is in ADD...
