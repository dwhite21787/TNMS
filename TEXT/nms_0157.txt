Hi all,

    Just a quick note to let you know that there are several new images
available in the anonymous ftp images subdirectory.  They are both GIF
and Sun raster images.  See the CONTENTS file for comments.

    Those of you who indicated an interest in helping (thanks!) with the
awk problem should have gotten mail.  If you haven't, and sent mail to me
offering help, drop me another line & we'll see what's up.  For those that
did get it, I'll expect results soon!  :-) :-)

    Lastly, on a serious note, I'd like to try to keep comments on the
war situation to a minimum, if possible.  While I understand that it is
on many peoples' minds, I'm not sure it exactly belongs in the context of
a Rush discussion group.  I won't censor you for writing, but let's try 
not to lose sight of the reason this group exists.  I'll leave it to you;
I think this is a sensible enough group...  

   Feel free to take discussions to e-mail; in fact, I encourage it to
promote intelligent discussions on non-music matters.  I just don't think
it belongs here.

Thanks,
rush-mgr

Subject: Depeche Mode and other music...

   In NMS #156, Supriya Goyal submitted a defense for Depeche Mode.  Personally,
I don't care for DM too much, but I resepct them for what they do.  I am not
trying to say that we should love every rap, pop, or country group around, but
we should at least give them some credit for what they do.  I know how much I   HATE it when one of my friends or a "critic" (i.e. Rolling Stone) cuts down on
Rush - so I try not to do the same to others.  I have to admit that sometimes
it is hard to do so, but that is no reason not to try.

   Pray for peace but support our troops.

                                      -Dave

Matthew Deter said in #156:
&gt; Secondly, keep in mind that it was the Americans who shot first
&gt; "in the name of a piece of dirt."
&gt;

I was afraid this would happen.  Let us not forget that the war
started in August.  In January 91, the allied coalliton decided
to help Kuwait free itself.  A piece of dirt is different from
freedom, IMHO.

Now, the Rush art image that someone made available is neat.
I was going to make it into a GIF for the email server, but
"rasttoppm: old rasterfile type is not supported."  So, it
will have to remain a raster image for now.

I would just like to thank everyone for using the rush email
archive server.  I'm glad I could put something back into the
group, after all that I have received.

Please, people, please... keep your personal political agendas off the list.
Like everyone, I have my own _very_strong_ opinions on the middle east
situation and the U.S. involvement there, but there are many other outlets
for discussion and argument about it, and this is NOT one of them.  Giving
your opinions here, masked by a Rush quote to back them up, will only provoke
conflicts more suited to talk.politics.mideast or the Larry King show.

And besides don't we see enough about the war everywhere else?  How about
an island of discussion devoted to more rewarding topics-- like Rush!

Speaking of which... what do you all think this next album will be like?
If we look for an "evolution" from Presto, will this be "harder"?  "Jazzier"?
More or less "smooth"?  Here's a prediction I hope will come true:  this
album will have at least one instrumental or extra-long track on it.  And,
I think there will be more vocals from persons other than Geddy.  I have
nothing to back these predictions up, they're just feelings.

                                later, eh,

                                                Derek L.

Ahhhh, I like that signature (even though it is rather large :-).

[ I liked it too, just thought it was a bit much for the NMS - have to 
  think of sheer size at times...                                 :rush-mgr ]

I beg to differ.  Was it not the Iraqis who fired the first shot back in
Aug 1990 against Kuwait?  I would consider this to be the retaliation for
those actions.

In TNMS #156, Doug Grumann &lt;dougg@hpptc16.rose.hp.com&gt; relates the
story about a military type discussing anti-war demonstrators.

First, a minor nit-pick: "a former green beret marine commander" is
a non-sequitur.  Green Berets are members of the US Army's Special
Forces; no Marine (at least, none of my acquiaintance) would ever
admit to being in the Army, even as Greenie Beanie.

Second:
&gt;After the green beret expressed his disgust for anybody who'd even
&gt;consider demonstrating against our great country's policies the
&gt;commentator said something like "..but aren't they just practicing
&gt;their right to free speech and freedom of expression which is one
&gt;of the things that the US is supposed to be fighting for?"  The
&gt;green beret shot back "that's just a bunch of intellectual
&gt;masturbation!"

Not that I necessarily support his viewpoint, but I think in the
light of open-mindedness most Rush fans could see what he means.
It's one thing to exercise a freedom granted you under your
society's laws; it's another to do so just so that you can parade
around in the streets and act obnoxiously.  *That's* intellectual
masturbation.

Running around and screaming "NO BLOOD FOR OIL!" and waving flags
hung upside down is not my idea of a useful, well-thought-out
position; it's attempting to cover up a lack of a reasonable
position by sheer volume and shock effect.  That's not to say that
the people who are on the other side of the street parading around
chanting "GO USA!" are in a more defensible position; we can see
that they are acting in the same spirit as the anti-war protestors.
But it's rather obvious to me that the military types don't think
that the anti-war protestors have well-considered opinions.

If there is anything that Rush promotes in its lyrics, it has to be
that Reason and Rationality will be what saves Mankind from itself.
If you don't support the official position, have a good, solid
reason for saying so; go back and look through the history of the
region, examine the US national energy policy (or lack thereof, if
you're so inclined), THEN speak your mind in a rational and sensible
manner.

That is the proper exercise of the Right of Free Speech; not the
right to speak your mind, but the right to speak the Truth.
