I am going through the process of transfering to the University of North
Texas music school, but I have looked into some other schools.  One is the
Musicians Institute, which features the Percussion Institute of Technology
in Los Angeles.  The school sent me a large, full colo brochure and, as I
was reading it, I noticed Alex Lifeson in a picture.  Further examination
revealed that the picture was of all three members of Rush, along with
several people from the Musicians Institute.  The text stated that Rush
had been the first-ever recipients of the Musicians Institute Outstanding
Lifetime Achievement in Music Award, given in 1992.  According to the book,
"this award is presented to musicians who, over a substantial length of
time, have made a lasting impression on the music world.  Their longevity
has been proven through their continued performances and recordings which
carry a message of hope for a better world.  They have also demonstrated a
genuine interest in music education and have become role models to which

I have to agree with Will Hartung on this issue, I really enjoy going back to
some album I haven't listened to for ages and really freaking out at the
marvels that it contains.  Indeed I didn't particular care for Jacob's Ladder
for about 7 years; now it's one of my favourite songs.  That I believe is the
nature of Rush's music.

&gt; Next in the ever more obscure trivia - As Rush has "matured" (?), Geddy
&gt; has displayed an aversion to the "hey babys" of In The Mood, that eternal
&gt; staple of the concert-ending medleys.  What might be some of the words
&gt; he's replaced "baby" with?  How about a hint - in listening to my newly
&gt; aquired Spirit of St. Louis CD boot, he says something, but I can't figure
&gt; out what the hell it is.

I think that on one of the videos Geddy sings "Hey Ally" and Alex sings "Hey
Geddy" - well that's what it sounds like.

Subject: RTB rap, etc.

Sorry for the double post.  The last was in response to an email reply
to my concern over the imaginary lack of rap lyrics in my CD booklet.
I subsequently went on to read todays NMS, where several people were good
enough to point out the error of my ways.  However there still seems to be
some confusion on the "homeboy" thing.  Some people (I assume reciting from
memory) inform that it says "home boy" and is a nice play on words.  I agree
that it would have been a nice play on words, but now that I've actually found
the lyrics in my CD booklet, staring me right in the face, it does in fact
just say "homeboy".  Too bad.
I don't dislike the rap because I don't think it fits the song (either
musically or lyrically).  Fact is, it fits the song pretty good, and the
actual lyrics in the rap are fantastic.  I just don't like rap "music", period.
Especially from a band I have grown so attached to.  Overall I love the song
and the way it really defines the theme for the whole album (sorry I still
call them albums).
BTW, has anyone ever read the story by Fritz Leiber, which I believe is
called "Roll the Bones", or "Rolling the Bones" or something like that.
I picked it up and read it a while back because someone mentioned it as
a possible influence.  Great story!  Actually I have taken to reading many
of Neil's influences.  I read Rand's Anthem.  Couldn't put it down.  Wanted
to read Atlas Shrugged and/or The Fountainhead next, but summer months are not
the time to read such longer works.  Anybody else read these?

One other picky point, since so many people kindly informed me of my
error (thank you all), but this is to Tim Rouse, who says

&gt; Also, what particular song took the longest to get used to?  Mine is probably
&gt; "Vital Signs" from Signals.

But isn't "Vital Signs" from MP?  I hope this doesn't come across as a snide
comment, because it's not.  It's too bad you can't hear a "tone of voice"
in email.  Oh well, just wanted to point it out.  OK, I'm rambling now, so
I'll leave.

Maybe you had a hard time getting used to it because somebody played a small
joke on you and put the song on the wrong album.  :-)  Just kidding!  Vital
Signs was the last song on Moving Pictures, and along with Red Lenses it is one
of my favorite short, and simple but very complex songs to listen to.  It also,
happens to be the very first video that I saw of our favorite trio on the much
maligned (and rightly so!!!) eMpTyV (with aknowledgements to whoever came up
with that saying.  I love that.  It fits so perfectly for that commercialized
crappy station that plays nothing but RAP and crunge rock now.)   Anyway, not a

Subject: **NUEVO ALBUM TITLE**
Date: Fri, 28 May 1993 10:57:10 -0500 (EDT)

Someone had mentioned something about the album title not being
"Critical Mass". I believe the message said that they had "dumped"
that title.
To tell you the truth, I had heard a different title
name..."Crystal Maze". I heard it first quite some time back on the
radio. Before I could write it in, someone said the title was
"Critical Mass" and so I figured that I just misheard what was said
on the radio. Then, a few weeks back, I heard it being said again
on the same radio station. They were playing Roll the Bones. After
the song was over, the DJ said something like "Rush...rolling the
bones...new album should be out sometime in the fall...tentatively
titled Crystal Maze...look forward to that one" (or maybe it was
"The Crystal Maze"...I don't think so). This time I was almost
positive that was what I heard, but then the NEW ALBUM releases
list put down Critical Mass (and someone told me that they are very
rarely wrong) so I just let it be. But when I heard that they may
have dumped "Critical Mass", I thought I should just let you fans
know what I had heard earlier.
The radio station was ZRock (I think it's available throughout the
nation on different frequencies). I heard the NY server...1480AM
(which, as I learned today, became a country station....can someone
please explain to me why this happened?). Anyway, check your local
ZRock.

   [ This reminds me of when RTB was in the works... there were two titles
     thrown around: "Throwing the Stones" and "Rolling The Bones"; we know 
     which one won out, don't we? :)				: rush-mgr ]

Greets, one and all.

Just got OTE.  It's brilliant!  The quality is the best I have heard on a boot.
It's nice and long aswell.  Just what I needed.  RECOMMENDED!!!!!
Anyway, a few points from it...

1) What is said in Big Money (about 6:13).  I think it's Geddy, but can't make
   it out.
2) On Where's My Thing, I think Ged says 'Nobody expects the Spanish
   Inquisition; (beginning at 5:25).  Is this right?
3) What is it that goes on in CTTH starting at 2:46?  The only word I can make
   out is 'autograph'.
4) At the start of Tom Sawyer, a voice says 'Moving Pictures take 28' amongst
   other things.  What is the significance, if any, of the fact that it's take
   28?

If anybody out there can help, I would be grateful.

P.S. - Thanks to Rus for correcting my post about the change of name for the
new album.  The quote about the album PW referred to PoW, not PeW.  (Some
friend that would want to hang me!).

In reply to the royal beating that Steve Howe took in #688:

	Let's try to remember that Steve Howe left Yes in the late '70's
and was trying to construct a sound that was totally aside from that of
the one that he had created in Yes.  ASIA was the first supergroup of the
'80's and possibly the only one.  Howe, in an interview in Guitar Player
commented on the fact that he felt great joy in being able to play
power chords for the first time, and his bandmates would let him get away
withit. (Ever heard a power chord in a Yes recording from the 70's?).  Lifeson
changes his guitar style constantly, why not accept steve howe for doing the
same?
	When it comes right down to it, Howe's a damn fine player and so is 
Lifeson.  Just let'em do what they want.  Heat of the Moment isn't that bad!  
For bad, listen to some of this 'Alternative" stuff.  Now that's sloppy.!!!!

Subject: Rap: I think differently

In this whole discussion it seems everyone has a base assumption that the genre
of rap is inherently bad.  "Maybe they were making fun" etc.  I would suggest
that if Rush, whom we all like for one reason or another, have respect for
something then it would follow that we, as Rush fans, might appreciate it.  Give
it a chance.  Pick up, borrow, or go to your local college radio station and
listen to Public Enemy.  There are serious themes involved, put forth in a very
creative manner.  In addition, they have the comic releif of Flavor Flav,
similar to Rush's comic relief of the huge, inflatable bunny rabbits.  Sure
there are stupid Rap bands, but there are stupid bands of any style, or
non-style of music.  I cringe when I see people condemning anything as having no
inherent value to anyone.  Perhaps it's not valid to you, but that is quite
different than saying "it" is invalid.

Great to hear that.

&gt;I personally don't like the shirt that much, but it was a magnet.

Hmm.. so in other words, you didn't really like the shirt but you decided
to wear it and while you're at it, if it got you the unbelievable attention
of people approaching you, you didn't mind?  So basically as long as the
shirt was a magnet you didn't care how it looked.  You're really in it
for the attention getter aspect of it then I take it?  This sounds like what
you are trying to relay.  Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but why wear
something you don't like and then turn around and say "oh yeah, I couldn't
believe the number of people who approached me, PS. the shirt was a magnet."
Like the rush-mgr said, you can always ask for a refund.

This is similar if you ask me to your opinion of the convention.  If I
recall, you liked the idea of the convention but naturally you could have
done much better.  A snippet of your opinion (not unlike that of the shirt)
can be found in Digest 680 I believe it was, the response below is from
Digest 681.  Judging from all your great suggestions on how to do the
convention the right way, and the many reasons why it failed, I'm sure you
could come up with a suggestion on doing a shirt the right way.  Why not
just volunteer?   I'm sure there are some people who help do the shirt and
help do the convention would like to see other volunteers like yourself come
forth and contribute to a worthwhile project.  What do you say?

I supposed if your post about the shirt is any indication, had the
convention went off really grand, we might get a nice post something to
the effect:  "Yes all, I didn't really like the convention but it served
its purpose, a lot of people approached me I was in the Limelight."

PS.  Yeah in a way this is a semi-flame but like I said, I don't understand
your comments about the convention and now your comment about the shirt is
just as bad in my opinion.

  [ This has been waiting for a while on the rush-mgr account.. enjoy!
							: rush-mgr ]

Muchmusic interview with Neil Peart

aired: various times in Spring, 1991.
comment: This is a short video excerpt of a larger interview with NP, that was
aired by Muchmusic.  The questions asked of NP were edited out, and the video
was presented as a monologue, with Neil discussing literature and its impact on
his lyrics and songwriting.  I attempted to be as accurate as possible, but 
this is my first attempt at transcribing, so please excuse any mistakes.

Neil Peart:
    "Reading is a funny vice, and I think one of the most important aspects for
anyone is probably escape, and I grew up in a very suburban environment, uh,
very conformist, and [it] consequently seemed very bland to me.  And very 
difficult to break out of.  Reading was the exit, definitely, for me -the
escape.  It started very young with mystery stories, the romance of all that,
umm, or even Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books and Agatha Christie.  I've read
every Agatha Christie mystery, I think, ever." [laughs]

		[graphic put over excerpt from Big Money video...]
		  In under 10 minutes, Neil Peart
		  mentioned over 30 authors
                  including Isaac Asimov, John
 		  Wyndham, and Thomas Hardy.

    
    "Dos Passos was very fertile because he was such a, uh, imagery-laden 
writer, so he always sparked my interest and my imagination in different ways,
so a song like the Big Money, or a song like Grand Designs, the titles relate
to him but the songs don't.  The imagery caught my imagination, his way of
looking at something caught my imagination, so that became my starting-off
point.  Umm, other writers specifically...sometimes a song, like Losing It,
was written about a writer.  I was thinking of the tragedy of Ernest Hemingway,
when he got toward the end of his life and he just simply couldn't write
anymore.  It had been his life, and he'd be standing there, uh, he was invited
I remember to President Kennedy's inauguration, and there was a story that he
stood there for two hours trying to write an answer to this invitation, and
couldn't compose an answer to the invitation, and was weeping with the 
frustration of it all.  So I got into the tragedy of that, and thinking about
him as an individual, but then taking it as a symbol and thinking of any artist
or any person who does something they really love to do."
