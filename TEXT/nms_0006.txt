About bad RUSH shows:
&gt;was the best show I've seen by them, and 2) NEVER!! Every show has been great!
&gt;This kind of consistency is most impressive.

Ooops! When I was talking about the RUSH concerts here in Honolulu, I
failed to mention that they were VERY professional about the whole
event--they didn't bat an eye at all the IDIOCY that was going on.
They just went on, performed at 100% energy level and WAS LOOKING
GOOD!  As mentioned before, despite all the problems they were having,
the concert was still spectacular and, for me, it was the best concert
I've ever seen. As far as I'm concerned, they could be having the
worst concert in their lives and it would still be the best.  However,
I enjoy it even more when they have fun while they perform...

HYF SYMBOLISM:  I _knew_ there was a reason for the "T" not being
lighted!!  And I knew I'd forgotten to mention the 15 on the building.
I figured the balls were to be, in one aspect, the Boyz, but they can
represent other things (according to Geddy, anyway).  As for the rest,
well, I'm now more educated!

COUNTDOWN: I'd forgotten to post this before; Bob Joslin, have you
figured out that line from "Countdown" yet?  The one that sounded like
"she had it on us"?  If not, I _might_ be able to find it out for you.
The place I work at is the Planetary Geosciences Division.  The section
I work in is the Planetary Data Center, which has all kinds of info.
from the Apollo missions to the latest shuttle flights.  There may be a
transcript of the Columbia's flight somewhere.  I'll look around for
it, but don't hold your breath.  "What a view! What a view!"

Hi-

Here's my two cents-

Favorite songs in no particular order-

The Spirit of Radio: made me want to play giutar
Xanadu: a multitude of mood swings
Time Stand Still: there was alot going right and wrong in my life when
                  HYF came out, this one still chokes me up
The Enemy Within: I just think it's nifty

I could go on for hours, but these just come to mind.

Opening acts-

I thought MR. BIG was run-of-the-mill L.A. Metal. The drill was really annoying.In summary, they weren't as bad as I thought they would be, but not as good as Ihad hoped.
When I saw RUSH on the PoW tour, Marillion was the opening act. They didn't go
over well, at least for the first show (they played two that weekend).
When I saw YES on the Big Generator tour, they opened with a Popeye cartoon-
the one where he, Olive, and Wimpy land on a desert isle, and Popeye gets
flown to a distant island by Bluto's giant vulture only to return with the bird
on a platter. That was a pretty cool opening act also.

Other people's albums-

The only one I know for sure (that I don't remember seeing on the list) is that
Alex played on a Platinum Blond(e?) album.
