OK OK....unfortunately I have to dissagree.  There was a time many years
ago (right around when presto came out), when I was a lowly High School
Student, I had been learning to play bass and jammed with few friends of
mine.  I was into the typical pop/glam metal at the time (warrant,
poison.etc...i dont need to humiliate myself more now...of course i was
young and stupid so forgive me :).
Anyway there was a department store close to my house and one day waling
home from school I stopped and was looking through the CD section.  Now
remember I was a musically nieve youngster, I think i still have that
Tiffany tape somewhere.  I came across A Show of Hands, I looked at it for
a bit thinking, whats the name of that song they do that i've heard and
think is kinda cool (Tom Sawyer), but I didn't know the name, so I said
what the hell, It is a LIVE album, their most famous song would HAVE to be
on it.
But I lost out...i went  home and listened to it once and didnt find it and
put the CD away for a while.  Then i bought a Guitar for the Practicing
Musician magazine, and it had Distant Early Warning in it, I pulled out the
bass and played through it thinking this is kinda cool, hey i wonder if its
on that CD i have...and low and behold it was....it was just kind of a
snowball effect from there...all the CD's, a stack of boots, and 10 shows
down..
But anyway I do remember being kinda ticked when TS wasnt on it, at the
time it was the ONLY reason I had bought it.

Sorry for rambling but I think some of the younger fans might want it all
on there....

      Just a referential question: are there any Rush fans out there
that like Pat                                         .     Metheny
Group... or am I some sort of anomaly? His stuff might not be for      .
most Rushians, but in a jazz context he is unique, progressive, and very

Definitely agree.  PM's guitar work, and really his song composition and
craftsmanship and song structure is probably like nothing most of you
have ever
heard.  Soaring guitar whipped up with some jumping bass lines, triple
rhythmic drumming and the occasion Brazillian or African vocal
contribution in an experimental jazz context make for an intense,
endlessly fascinating listen.  I  dare anyone to check out 'Secret
Story' and not be amazed at all the stuff going on and how teriffic it
sounds.  

A few rush words from a lurker:   I'm new to the list, but not new to
Rush appreciation.  My favorite is still 'Signals' (especially
'Countdown'), but also love 'Counterparts' and 'Hemispheres'.   And I
agree with the positive feelings for 'Available Light' as an overlooked
classic - few other songs include the nearly isolated bassline, some
nice piano, and Geddy hitting those (really) high notes - alright!

Robert J. Murphy asked if there were any Pat Metheny/Rush fans here.  = YES!!
I've been a loyal fan of the amazing Metheny since the early '80's.  I =
like his style for the very reasons that you cited.  Like Rush, he is =
always keeping me on my toes, never knowing where he'll go next.  Also =
like Rush, he always delivers.  I too agree for everyone to stay away =
from the records "Zero Tolerance For Silence" and "Song X" (he was just =
rearranging his genius).  If you are not a "jazz" fan you may not =
appreciate his style, but if you are a guitar fan you can't deny his =
amazing talent.  Please please please though, no one try to compare Pat =
and Alex.  Let's just say that they are the best of their respective =
styles.  Mmmkay?
Anyway, nice to know you are out there Robert and I hope others will =
follow.

Subject: Rush Mix (for Mongo)

My wife has a 16 year old (male) cousin who has never heard of Rush (not even
Tom Sawyer!).  He's musically inclined (both instrumentally and vocally), so I
think he may to have a chance to become "one of the chosen" (aha, a fresh mind
to mold!).

I'm making a tape for him, and chose the below tracklist to fit on a 100min
Maxell.  What I did was take Chronicles, cut off everything before Permanent
Waves and deleted Manhattan Project; then I could add tunes in the
"Chronicles" style of 2 songs per album from each album including Presto
through Test for Echo.  He may find this material closer to his current tastes
vs. '70's Rush.  I found myself torn between what songs to put on but think
that I'll let him discover the older material himself.

Side A, 51'01": Spirit of Radio, Freewill, Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta,
Limelight, Subdivisions, New World Man, Distant Early Warning, The Big Money,
Mystic Rythyms

Side B, 51'02": Force Ten, Time Stand Still, Show Don't Tell, Presto,
Dreamline, Roll the Bones, Animate, Double Agent, Test for Echo, Half the
World

Any comments?

Has anyone else been to this restaurant?  Does anyone know who created
the restaurant and is there any way to find out if they are a Rush fan?
I find it hard to believe that they would name the restaurant simply by
chance.

I heard that the restaurant cost $20 Million to build.  It was really
quite an undertaking.  Just watch out for the aliens.. they are kind of
freaky

Subject: Fear, DS, & Yearbook

Hi All,
     The "Fear" trilogy was conceived around a literary term (for the life of
me, I can't remember the term). It's about man's main conflicts.....
1. Enemy Within - Man Vs. Himself
2. The Weapon - Man Vs. Man
3. Witch Hunt - Man Vs. Society
     I'm quite happy with the songs on DS. I remember seeing Analog Kid on the
second leg of the RTB tour (15th row MSG!) and was in Heaven, so I'm VERY glad
it is now included! As far as The Pass not being included, that's OK. I'll
just have to hunt down the promo sampler, or just list to the Oakland '92 boot
(perfect stereo soundboard!)
     Here is what I think is the perfect yearbook passage...
"It's understood
By every single person
Who'd be elsewhere if they could
So far so good
And life's not unpleasant
In their little neighborhood"
   They dream in Middletown...
     This is what I used for mine WAY back in '87. Man, I'm gettin' old!
       Till we meet again,
          Keith

Subject: Misheard lyrics

I can't say that I myself have instigated any warped Rush lyrics, but my sister
has come up with a few.  A while back, I was randomly shuffling songs in my CD
player.  Presto was up.  First we get "Superconductor" which my sister bops and
sings along to in her 13 year-old teenage-bopping way.  Then we get "Show Don't
Tell."  Suddenly the song is about an "undulate."  She wasn't quite clearly
hearing "until later" properly.  I have never been able to decide whether her
other mistake is real or not.  She was again bopping and singing along to a CD I
was playing, this time Grace Under Pressure, "The Enemy Within," and I think
that enemy has a greater foe to deal with in my sister's mind, she came out
with, "Every monkey tends to fence the enemy within."  Sisters.

Subject: Drummers

Neil, Carter, Terry, Bill...

All great drummers.  

I got to see Terry Bozzio Playing from about 10 feet away at the Chicago
House of Blues last week.  Terry is playing with The Knack and he put on a
hell of a show.  I've never seen a kit that size at a power pop show but
Terry ripped it up and never sounded overbearing or distracting.  His drum
solo was unbelievable, too awesome to describe.  I was standing literally
10 feet away and I can't describe it.

Likewise, I watched a work in progress the other day and was equally awe
struck at Neil's musical and philisopical ideas about drums. 

The point is that all this compairing while fun, is like comparing apples
to oranges.  They are all different drummers who have different styles and
have arrived at those styles through different routes.  It's pretty futile
to say who is better than who at that level of drumming.

Just thoughts..

Nope.  And he didn't flunk school, either.  That's an urban legend.  He
scored VERY highly in mathematics in school, but the grading scale was
numerical 1-5, and somehow got reversed on his record.

I saw it on Saturday as part of the Week In Rock news wrap-up. It was
about 5 minutes of discussion with Mixmaster Mike (the guy doing the
turntables for the Beastie Boys and mentioned previously on NMS),
showing his art. He spent the most time showing how he does Tom
Sawyer and was pretty entertaining. He put his own stamp to the music
without making me reach immediately for my copy of the original, like
most covers do. 

I thought what he did next with a Jimi Hendrix song was even better.

I wish I had gone to Beastie Boys after seeing this....

Subject: Rush covers (part II)

Hey what's up it's Al again,

    I posted a while back a listing of other groups covering Rush
songs.Here's the update.

First let me recap:
1) What You're Doing - Skid Row (from B-side Ourselves)
Pretty good version and an appropriate choice for them (Imagine them
trying to cover Hemipheres or something along those lines - I DON"T
THINK SO!!!) not to put down their style but this song suits them
better.
My Rating:***1/2 stars out of 5

2) Closer To The Heart - Fates Warning (from Working Man tribute)
I included this because it's the only cover done by an actual band on
the tribute.An excellent version done by an excellent band.One of the
best versions on the album.I actually would have prefered them covering
a more complex song but a good choice none the less.
Rating:*****

3) Closer To The Heart - Jaymz Bee And The Royal Jelly Orchestra (from
Cocktail:Shaken' and Stirred)
The weirdest and most twisted cover I have ever heard.It is done in a
jazz lounge type of way and sounds nothing like the original.Cool if you
like weird quirky stuff.
Rating:***

4) Anthem - Yngwie Malmsteen (from Inspiration)
Although Yngwie is a great guitar player he kind of butchers the song
with unnecesary soloing in the begining.But to be fair I like this
version better than the one on the tribute album which I think is
horrible(and I like George Lynch)
Rating:**1/2

5) Tears - Dream Theater (from Christmas fan club cd)
Another excellent cover done by an excellent band.Very faithful to the
original.Again I wish they would have done something more complex but I
still love the song.
Rating:*****

6) The Spirit Of Radio - Catherine Wheel (from Like Cats And Dogs -
hidden track not listed on cd)
Great version!They tune down to fit Rob Dickinson's vocal range and do
it in a grunge type of way which fits their style.Slightly rearranged
and kick ass!
Rating:*****

7) The Spirit Of Radio - Rachel Barton (from Stringendo:Storming The
Citadel)
Rachel is a classical violinist and does a great version.Other notable
covers on cd by Metallica,Megadeth,Pantera,Led Zep etc.
Rating:****

8) Xanadu - Silver Sun (from Too Much,Too Little,Too Late single)
This is an excellent cover done in a garage punk-power pop style.Totally
different from original and cut down to about 4 minutes.Check it out it
is great!
Rating:*****

Now The Update:
9) Tom Sawyer - deathORGAN (from Universal Stripsearch)
A Swedish band that only uses keyboards,bass and drums.Imagine a cross
between Emerson Lake and Palmer with Faith No More and that's what this
sounds like.
Rating:***

10) 2112 Overture - Paul Roraback (from HM Records - The Mother Of All
Tributes)
Paul is the drummer from the band Grammatrain who plays all the
instruments on this song.This is a great version.I almost couldn't
distinguish between this and the original it's that good!
Rating:*****

11) Subdivisions - Groove Daddys (from Sunburn)
A lot slower than the original and done without keyboards.Groove Daddys
are an indie alternative band from Canada.Pretty decent cover and
different.
Rating:***1/2

12) La Villa Strangiato - Greg Howe (from Ascend)
I just ordered this cd and will comment on it when I recieve it.Greg
Howe is a guitarist who used to be on Schrapnel records which was like a
shredder label.Very technical guitarist.

13) Working Man - The Liquid Gang (from Fantastic Pirate Satellite)
Will comment when I recieve it.

That's all I know for now.If anybody knows of any others please let me
know.
If anybody needs any info of how to get some of these cd's e-mail me
privately.Some of them are really hard to find.

Later,
Al

I don't necessarily think this is a contradiction, at least
metaphorically... I mean, we all have freewill, but there are things that
we have to do, whether it's by law, involuntary bodily function... (no need

There are just some things that by human nature, we have to put up with or

hey all

well the other week i went to a minor leage base ball game AAA, the
portland rockies, well besides playing Queen for 2 innings (we will rock
you, as you all know, and crazy little thing called love) i was suprised
to hear the start of Spirit of Radio in the 5th inning, and then again
to hear Working Man at the start of the 6th it turned out to be a nice
day to watch a ball game for me

take it easy

Howdy all.

I didn't write any Rush stuff in the yearbook, but I do have a short
reference to tell about my good ol' high school days.

I was hopelessy lost in my expository writing class when I was a Sophomore
back in '86. We were taking a pop quiz "poetry test" that I was completely
unprepared for. My mind was drawing a blank for any kind of poetry to write
on the spot. Since I was listening to Manhattan Project over lunch,
naturally, I quoted one verse and chorus from that song and turned it in.
(Can you say plagiarism?) Anyways, I got a decent grade on it. No biggie.
Lo and behold, the 1986 BHS writing review came out near the end of the
year and guess what! My teacher had submitted that piece to the review team
and they printed it! argh!

The following year I asked the teacher about why she didn't ask me for
permission to print that article. She simply said "My daughter is a big
Rush fan."  =)

Subject: Freewill/Entre Nous Question

In the last issue Christopher W Lindsay wondered if the "you can choose" and
"sometimes we are not always free" lines on PeW were a contradiction.

I raised this exact issue about 6-8 months ago.  Regrettably there was the
expected amount "why did you have to bring this up...now the digest will be
clogged with annoying opinionating" negativism that always exists in varying
degrees.  But at the kernel of it all there were some good thoughts.

1.  No one song/album entirely encapsulates Neil's/Rush's opinions on
anything.  Especially knowing how people's opinions change over time.

2.  More germane....the quasi-philosophical consensus was that while we may
have pure metaphysical freedom to choose, this crazy thing called emotions
do impact the normal mortal's ability to pursue those freedoms objectively.
Classic example, you may objectively know that the desired use of your
income tax refund is to invest it in an IRA or other retirement vehicle.
However, your compassion for your fellow man/woman might lead you to use
that money to help a troubled family member pay medical bills.  Our
emotional attachments and commitments create links between us that result in
compassionate responses rather than objective, freewill responses.

I think Neil is a passionate man who struggles, like the rest of us, to
understand the interrelationship between his philosophy and reality.  Both
are constantly evolving.  I believe Entre Nous and Freewill appear on PeW
purposefully.  Neil is presenting the conflict...not as an answer but as a
question and a reality.  Sometimes, most times, the song does not hold the
"answer", but rather only the "question"...each of us are a cell of
awareness, imperfect and incomplete....we need to search these things out
ourselves.  How many times have you tried not to feel emotional loss at a
break up, the end of a relationship, whatever, yet no matter how hard you
try those feelings creep in?  That's what Entre Nous is getting at.

Neil never has put himself in the position of the all knowing (fans have),
but rather, the all wondering.

Oh, and to all the Randites that will post saying "there are no
contradictions, check your premises, one of them is wrong"...bah.  While
factually that is true, emotionally it is not that simple.  While Ayn Rand
may have "never had an emotion [she] couldn't explain," that's not most of
us ..and that is Neil's point, IMO.

For what it's worth.

To think of just one line of a Rush song that sums up the band is not an
easy task to do.  To me, I think, at least for today, it would be
(forgive me if it isn't exactly right.  I don't have the lyrics in front
of me):  "Different eyes see different things.  Different hearts beat on
different strings."

By the way, it is also nice to see another female Rush freak that I saw
in the last newsletter.  There are not too many of us out there!

If the voices of the fans really helped shape the upcoming live CD

would LOVE a new official video offering.  VHS or DVD--I might even buy
both if they were released.  Please make it as long as possible and DON'T

I would add the earlier albums on ECM, especially Pat Metheny Group and
As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls. Great quartet playing.

For trio, try Question and Answer (with Dave Holland and Roy Haynes).

All three of these suggestions have great drumming along with Pat's
excellent guitarwork.

To second what the rush-mgr has said in the previous TNMS, please take some
time to write a letter to the folks at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
exhorting them to nominate Rush for induction. It is easy to do, and will
only cost you a stamp (if you use snail mail). If I have read correctly,
the minimum amount needed is 250,000, which may seem like a lot, but it
really isn't compared to the actual number of fans out there. Let's all
take advantage of the democratic process, and get them inducted, where they
belong!

Good Evening Everyone-

Hard to say how many casual fans will pick up this here "Different Stages" 
thing-my guess is not many, what with all the retrospectives coming out. You 
never know though, look at "Frampton Comes Alive" (what a comparison). I 
imagine most people who could get into Rush would be into them by now. You 
can only escape greatness for so long.

What's this I hear, rush-mgr? A live video? I LOVE all of Rush's live videos! 
I will be looking forward to this with hot balm alacrity!

Regarding King Crimson-Discipline rules but I think Fripp's kind of a jerk. 
Ten years I waited for new Crimson product, finally they get back together 
and I ended up paying $18 for a 30-minute rehearsal (Vrooom) for the actual 
real new CD (Thrak). Thanks Bob, just for that I still haven't bought Thrak 
and I won't until it's cheap. 

Bruford kicks ass though-almost as good as Neil. I like Tony Levin too.

Anyway, if a live video comes out we can all relive a great tour.

Hello... again,

If I'm not mistaken, amongst the favorite authors common to Rush fans
besides writers like Rand, Tolkien is quite common (I believe Tolkien was
one of the authors Neil mentioned he and Geddy both liked in common when
they first met). So in case ya' ain't already heard, The Lord of the Rings
is going to be adapted (or
interpreted,if you like) for the big screen. There will be three films made
by New Zealand film director Peter Jackson (The Freighteners, Heavenly

Subject: Y2K/Rush

I was just watching TBN [Trinity Broadcasting Network], and I got to
thinking about the possible new studio album release on 1-1-2000.  Well,
I just thought you might all like to know that, according to TBN, the Y2K
bug will knock out all major utilities (such as power, gas, water
companies...) for 3 to 6 months.  

Also, according to TBN, there will be several effects of the Y2K bug
which don't occur on 1-1-2000.  For example, April 1, 1999 is the start
of the fiscal year for countries like Great Britian, Canada, and Japan,
and the Y2K bug could wipe out those countries financial institution's
computers.  Also, February 29, 2000 will make a lot of computers off date
by one day, because they won't recognize it as a leap year.  Also,
somehow (I missed the full explaination), in 2038, all UNIX systems will
think the date is in the year 1902.  All this, mind you, has been
reported by TBN, and is being stated as absolute fact, so we must treat
this as an apocyliptic disaster.  (That, too, was stated by TBN.  We must
have 3-6 months of dried and freeze dried food, a 3-6 month supply of
fresh water, and 3 months worth of fire wood.  All according to TBN.)

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot.  TBN also reported that no one knows exactly
what the Y2K bug will do.  (They said that right between giving the list
of preparations for all utilites being knocked out and telling exactly
which computer systems will be rendered useless by this thing.)

So, you may want to start planning to order the CD now...who knows if
we'll be able to leave the safeguard of our homes to run out and buy it,
what with all the dust from the comets and nuclear fallout and god knows
what else...  ;)

Subject: 2112 Issue

Here's my idea for the 2112 issue of NMS.
I too think issue 2112 should stand for something special.  In all the
subsequent issues we have expressed what our favorite songs, albums and band
members are.  We have debated set lists, interpreted lyrical meanings and
recalled favorite moments at concerts.  Lets face it, we all have a fond
place in our hearts for RUSH.

How about in issue 2112 we include NONE of this, and instead express what
RUSH truly means to us.

Has RUSH changed your life somehow?  Are they your source of inspiration or
motivation?  Maybe learning to play RUSH songs has heightened your
appreciation for music or taken your musical skills to the next level.   Did
listening to your first RUSH album make you turn the crap on the radio off
for good? Do you ever wait in your car until a RUSH song is over before
getting out?  Is The Pass about you?  Does your love affair with RUSH make
you the geek you are today in the eyes of your friends and family?  Are you
in your late thirties now and have yet to take down the Rush posters from
your bedroom wall?  (Hey, leave them up.  I'm just trying to throw some
ideas out).  Does your journal of motivation intermingle quotations from
Stephen Covey, Tony Robbins and Neil Peart?  Have you ever said, "Well it
just goes to show your that ignorance and prejudice and fear walk hand in
hand" during a 'heated' conversation?

We've already thanked the band infinitely and given our condolences to Neil.
I think the greatest gift we can give now are our own experiences. I suggest
that we each write a paragraph or three about how listening to /
experiencing RUSH has impacted or even changed or our lives.  If you've
already done this, maybe you'd like to resubmit it for this issue.  Just a
suggestion:  perhaps we could all send in our submissions anytime before
issue 2105(?),  with a title such as "NMS #2112: then your title here".
That way the noble Rush Manager can easily hold these submissions for the
big issue.

Whatever we do, let's decide soon so we all have plenty of time to submit
something appropriate.

Subject: opinions anyone? (who has time, and desire to hear new stuff)

I have a website up for my new band, trying to break into the modern
music genre...

there are sound files from clips to 3 new songs on the site.

These songs were recorded b4 ever being played live, so bear in mind that
not all the bugs were worked out by then, and it was recorded on some old
analog 8track gear.

If you could take the time to listen to them and look at the site, it
would be pretty cool of you =)  and post and/or email your thoughts.

This doesent sound like rush, but I like rush, and I play bass.
