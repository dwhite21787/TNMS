That's Right, folks, the movie that was the inspiration behind "Cinderella
Man" was playing as part of a Frank Capra film festival at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse (Capra, who died recently, also directed It's a Wonderful Life
and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington).  Last night I saw "Mr Deeds Goes To
Town" and I loved it.  A quick synopis:  Longfellow Deeds from
Mandrake Falls (Neil of course deleted the Fallsin the song
), Vermont inherits 20
million dollars from an uncle who died in a car crash in Italy.  Lawyers
from NY give Deeds the good news and persuade him to come with them and
receive the dough.  So "Mr Deeds goes to Town" and receive his 20 mil, only
to have people bother him about what he can do with the money.  The rest
of the film centers on his adventures in NY.  If you know the song you can
guess what happens next, however, I suggest you see it.  Capra did a
great job with it (as well as Wonderful Life).  Gary Cooper is "super
duper" as Deeds (Cinderella Man was the term used by the NY newspapers be
cause of his innocence and his intentions with his "newly found wealth").

Happy ThanksGiving (Don't forget to mail me your lists for the poll)

Subject: Opening acts, and a short interview with Geddy

Earlier this evening on CHOM-FM (Montreal's excuse for an AOR station), I
managed to catch a short phone interview with Geddy, and yes folks I *did*
tape it.  (Fit nicely after the Genesis *In the Studio* that I taped a few
weeks ago, but I suppose this is the wrong list to be bragging about that.)

Anyways, it was only about 8 minutes long, but there were a few interesting
tidbits.  Surprise!  The mystery rapper is STILL a mystery, although the DJ
doing the interview said that he had heard a rumour that none other than
Frank Zappa did the rap!  Geddy's *still* not telling, though.

Also, towards the end the DJ said the name of the opening act here in Montreal.
I didn't quite catch it, but I have it on tape.  Let's see if we can activate
that magic "rewind" button.. sounds like "Andy Curran."  It's definitely
NOT Eric Johnson though (mega :-( ).  I was looking forward to seeing him
*almost* as much as I was to Rush!

BTW, if I do transcribe that interview, should it be posted to the list or
just dumped to the FTP site?  It's not too long, but I dunno what Our Beloved
rush-mgr's feelings on posting interview transcripts are, especially when
there's not a WHOLE heckuva lot of exciting new info.

Subject: Re: 11/26/91 - The National Midnight Star #387

&gt;&gt;Remember back in the old days when Rush was deep in the concept
&gt;&gt;albums?  They changed presentation, but still stuck with
&gt;&gt;concepts.  There is a central theme to all rush albums, save
&gt;&gt;perhaps, Hold Your Fire, a pop album.  I will elaborate more
&gt;&gt;on this in a future posting.

What??? No theme to HYF?!?!  You have to be kidding!
HYF is one of my four favorite albums because of it's VERY meaningful
lyrics. Deep album, indeed.

&gt;Is there anybody else out there who has seen the RTB tour who is
&gt;disappointed by the fact that Geddy Lee can no longer hit the high notes
&gt;in alot of their older stuff?  They played Anthem at the Redbird Arena in
&gt;Bloomington, and while is was well played, it just didn't sound right.  I
&gt;have also been told that they do not play anything except the overture from
&gt;2112.
&gt;(Given Geddy's vocals on Anthem, I don't blame them)

Yes, I was a little disappointed in this. Instead of hitting those
ozone notes where he sings, "..wonders in the world they wonders
in the world they wonders in the world they wrought.", he just
sung the line in his "normal" singing voice. The song was a nice
surprize, though. Yeah, I hate to think of how it would have sounded
if he'd have sung "Temples" that low!!!!

&gt;During "Most Wanted" whenever they went to commercial they were playing the
&gt;beginning of xxx
&gt;	Show Don't Tell!!!!!
&gt;No kidding . I just thoght I'd let you all know that!

Actually, I've heard them do that quite often when they go to
commercials on "The Day in Rock." Funny. Only about a
fraction of that show is on rock. The rest it seems is pop/rap shit.

&gt;Just received the lastest installment of the Rush Backstage Club
&gt;Newsletter. I had not received one since Presto came out in 1989.

Could somebody out there send me info on how to join TRBC?
Send it to the above email address. I need some posters. (-:

Oh..I'll be in Florida for Spring break. Does anybody know the
tour dates for Florida?? I noticed from my tour shirt that they have
5 stops in Fl. and would love to catch them again this spring.
Maybe I'll get lucky and be there when they are!!!

Someone asked if Vinnie Colauita had performed in any other bands besides
Frank Zappa's band and Stings ensemble.  Vinnie played drums on the Allan
Holdsworth album _SECRETS_ (great stuff), and also on Frank Gambale's _THUNDER
FROM DOWN UNDER_ album.  He also did some work with Gino Vanelli.

Oh, my.

All my life I've been wishing there were something like the National
Midnight Star ... and it's true!

Well, before I go too nuts (hey, I have to wait for the latest FAQL),
I'll just ask one question: Does anyone know the date of the Indianapolis
concert? (I'm assuming the T-shirt accurately portrays that as the last
stop on the RTB tour.) I saw 'em in Cincinnati Oct. 29, and really need
to do it again. If anyone wants a set list and/or commentary, just say so

Oh, and yeah, I have to agree about Geddy's voice vis-a-vis the Old
Stuff. Sometimes I wish they'd do more of the early songs, but then when
I hear what's happened to Ged's tonsils, I can see why they don't. It was
thrilling to hear (part of) *Anthem*, f'rinstance, but no, it's just not
the same. (Guess you can never really go back again, as they say.) Also,
: I really have to object to the fact that they do only pieces of some songs
at the end of the show - not only is a Rush medley a virtual insult just
to think of, but not doing 2112 all the way through is about as silly as
playing only part of Beethoven's Fifth.

Looking forward to interfacing with youse folks - I can't tell you how
delighted I am to discover you. Hold your heads above the crowd ...

Hello, it's been a while...

First and foremost, I am interested in getting a list of all of the NMS
subscribers who reside/work in ARIZONA.  Unfortunately, the names list
only allows speculation for universities, but not outside (i.e. corporations)
people...  SO, if you live in ARIZONA, please drop me a line...

Next, does anyone out there have ticket info for Phoenix  18-JAN-1992 ?
I have been looking, and thinking that LA already sold, and its date is
20-JAN-1992.  Help?

Thanks in advance...

Subject: Pre-show parties? (Philly/DC)
Date: Wed, 27 Nov 91 08:57:18 -0500
From: David Arnold &lt;davida&gt;

Hi all,

    Well, the time is approaching for shows I'll finally be able to
make it to, and I was wondering what the situation is for pre-show
parties?  In the past (from my experience) these can take (at least)
two different forms.  The first is a full-blown party hosted by someone
local to the show site, where people can get together, shmooze, and
arrange transportation to the show.  The other is a more impromptu get-
together at the venue of the show, for those who didn't make any more
formal parties.

    For the Largo, MD show, Neal D. has already offered to host a party
at his place.  Refer to the Administrivia from NMS #385 on 11/25 and send
mail to "comehome@wam.umd.edu" for more details.  Nobody's mentioned it
yet (that I've seen), but would anyone be interested in an informal group
meeting at the Cap. Ctr. itself?  We could meet outside one of the portals,
say "Stars & Stripes" at oh, say 7:00?  If this sounds like something you
might be interested in, drop me a line.  It's one way to get to meet some
of the people you have seen posting in the NMS.  Last show (Presto tour)
we had 10-15 people there, if I'm not mistaken.

    Also, I'll be going to the 12/3 show in Philly, and was wondering if
there were any party and/or meeting plans for that locale?  I'll be up
there by mid-afternoon, and other than getting my tickets and picking up
a friend, I'm footloose, so to speak.  As I don't know Philly I can't
plan any of those, but I'm interested if someone else is (Donna? Mike?
Eric?)  Send any info to me here at "davida@syrinx.umd.edu".

Saw the dudes last night at the Ottawa Civic Centre, 'twas mega, as
expected.  A few minor disappointments, howeer.  I was supposed to be
in the first row (I think), but chaos ruled, so ended up about a dozen
rows back, still not bad I guess.  For 2 or 3 songs near the start,
Alex was haing significant technical difficulties.   Portions of "Time
Stand Still" and "Subdivisions" were guitarless, or the guitar was way
undermixed.  Alex was visibly pissed.  Soon enough, though, everything
was in order, and he was back into the show full-force.  As for the
song selection, not too many surprises.  They only played 4 songs from
RTB (RTB, Where's my thing, Bravado, Dreamline); I would've loved to
hear "Ghost of a Chance", one of their best post-Moving Pictures
songs.  Another sad omission was "Red Sector A".  Many songs were
shortened, several halfways even.  This didn't really bother me, since
it allowed for several surprises (esp. Anthem, which I'd never heard
in concert before, and I've seen them every tour since Signals).
However, they played only 2 minutes worth of Red Barchetta, a song
which can NOT be cut off.  It was unacceptable.

Here's the complete song list (in reverse chronology of release date):
Roll the bones, dreamline, bravado, where's my thing, pass, show dont
tell, superconductor, force 10, time stand still, big $$, distant
early warning, subdivisions, tom sawyer, limelight, red barchetta,
spirit of radio, freewill, la villa, xanadu (yes!), closer to the
heart, 2112 overture, anthem, finding my way.

Geddy hardly spoke to the audience, a little uncool I guess; 2 recent
concerts I'd been to (Queensryche and Van Haguer) had very talkative
lead singers.  Geoff Tate was probably more talkative than he wanted
to be, since he had to kill time while the techies cleared up a major
drum difficulty.

I can't remember who the opening act was (I skipped it), but it
definitely was not Vinnie Moore or Eric Johnson.  It was some Canadian
band.

Hey, does anybody have the song lists from any previous tours?  I've
been to the last several, but my memory sux.

Hi everyone,

After listening closely to RTB, I am relatively confident that whoever
did the rap section in RTB was the same person that did the voice
for Cygnus X-1.  A friend of mine thinks it is also the same person that
did the voice for Subdivisions, which I don't know about for sure.
I am only sure about Cygnus.  Who did that voice?  They sound identical,
at least to me.

Date: Wed, 27 Nov 91 11:32:55 EST

Dear Rush Fans,

I am a Rush Fanatic and I love their concerts, but do you really think we NEED
 the music they put out today? Face it, Rush is NOT what it used to be.
Remember when Geddy used to scream at the top of his lungs during such songs
as "Anthem"?. I saw them in Toledo, Oh and I noticed he avoids screaming
at all costs. Geddy, Neil and Alex just do enough to get by -that's why the
last four studio albums have been "ho-hum". The guys are in it for the money,
and the last two albums have been the same song with new cheesy words. Just
check out "Where's My Thing?" from the latest album, "Roll The Bones" -tell
me that certain bars of the song sound like the title track from "Presto".
Over the years, Neil has become an egotistical asshole -just read some of
his interviews sometime. Notice when he used to smile on the older
Rush albums, that smile is replaced by the bitterness and lonliness who
cares of noone but himself. It's sad to see a band turn into this state,
but it's even more depressing when they produce shit and endorse it like
it is the next "Moving Pictures" album -learn from The Who and other
great groups such as Led Zeppelin who got out when they knew they couldn't
satisfy their known musical status..RETIRE!!

						Sincerely,

Subject: Twirling bones imagery; Freddie Mercury

After watching the RTB video a few times, I realized that the image of the
bones twirling through the air in slow motion reminded me of a similar
image in the movie "2001", at the end of the first section where the
primitive man suddenly realizes that a discarded bone can be used as a
club. I wonder if anyone else made that connection?

Regarding the sad death of Freddy Mercury, there is an obvious bit of irony
in the title of the Queen song "And Another One Bites The Dust".

There was a short review in the paper last week of an album by a new
Canadian group said to be influenced by Rush among others. The album was
produced by Terry Brown. I forget the name of the group, but if I can find
the article, I'll post it next week.

Lots of questions have been asked about what time Rockline is on. It's a
live show, so it has to be on at the same time everywhere, right? Pretty
hard to call in to a taped show! Next Monday, December 2nd, 11:30 PM EST.
I'm sure everyone can figure out what time that is in their time zone. :-)

Someone mentioned an ad for RTB in Time a few weeks back. I haven't been
able to find it. Can anyone tell me which issue it was in? Atlantic seems
to be running an ad for one of their albums in just about every issue. With
the increased level of promotion that Atlantic seems to be
providing the group, I wonder what the chances are that they might do a
guest appearance on some TV show? I've never heard of them doing one
before, but depending on their schedule maybe this could be a possibility.
I'm thinking of SNL or David Letterman when they're in NYC, or Arsenio Hall
when they're in LA. Wouldn't that be a kick?

Yo people,
Well, please don't think me an inexperienced ticket-sleeper-outer
(whatever that is) just because I'm surprised at the early arrival
of people at ticket lines!  I've slept out whenever I could, but I
guess that I'm just so busy lately that I couldn't even DREAM of
going to get tix before 11 or 12 the night before they go on sale!
And I thought that WE were determined fans!
(Dave R., you're not getting any funny ideas about sleeping out any
earlier for future concerts from all this, are you?)

Anyway, it's time for break here at SJU - only 4 dayz left untill the
Boyz ROCK Philly!  I will of course be commenting on both Philly shows
after the fact.

Enjoy your turkey,
The Fuzzy Navel

Subject:      Rush in Brazil !!? I don't believe that !!!!!!

          Hello all !!!!!
          For those of you, who is always talking about tour dates, I'd
like to know if there's some possibilities of Rush come to Brazil.
          Well, what's happening is that I have a friend who has a holy
mouth. Last year he said that Deep Purple would come to Brazil, but of
course, almost nobody believed in him. But they came !!!!!!!! And they
decided to do extra concerts because the audiences, and as they said,
" It was one of the best that we have had !!!"
          For you, in the north america, who are used to going to great
shows, it's nothing. But for us, who only see Rush in videos, beleive me,
it would be something umbelivable !!!!!!!  Really great !!!!!!!!
          Some great group have already been in Brazil, like Metallica,
Faith no More, Jethro Tull, Marillion, Genesis, Ian Gillan Band, Black
Sabath, but RUSH, no way !!!!!!!
          If some of you have access to this kind of information, please
could cofirm or destroy this rumour ???!!!
          I hope it's real, and I'm sure that RUSH would have really great
audiences in Brazil. Me and my friends have this hope for more than ten
years !!!!! It's time to become a reality !!!!!!!!!
          Your distant (early warning !!) friend.

Does anyone know the lyrics to the second verse of Beneath, Between and
Behind?
(The first verse follows: Ten score years ago/Defeat the kingly foe/A
wonderous dream came into being/Tame the trackless waste/No virgin land left
chaste/All shining eyes, but never seeing...)  As for the second verse, who
knows?  If you do, please let me!

Thank you!  Thank you very much!!

Subject: SOME NEWS

   Hey Gang,

    I just recieved my recent newsletter from the Rush Backstage Club.
Included was a note that I thought I should share with yous,
   it states:

                NEIL PEART FEATURED AT
       THE BUDDY RICH MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP CONCERT

  Neil Peart was one of five drummers featured at a sold out concert at The
Ritz Theater in New York City on April 8, 1991.  Neil performed with the 16
piece Buddy Rich big band.

  The event was viedotaped by DCI Music Video and has just been released on
two 65 min. tapes.  Neil performs on both tapes.

  The concert was produced by Buddy's daughter, Cathy Rich, and is an annual
event in which a young drummer is awarded a full scholarship to a music school
of his choice.  This year's winner is Larry Wright, a young drummer who began
playing a bucket on the streets of NYC.

  Neil performed along with Steve Smith - seven year veteran drummer with
Journey, Omar Hakim - drummer with Sting and Weather Report, Marvin "Smitty"
Smith - drummer from NYC that brought the house down and Wil Calhoun -
drummer with Living Colour.

  The viedo by DCI is more than just a tape of the show.  It contains backstage
shots, pieces of the rehearsal for the show and a lot of interviews.  There
are some great interview segments with Neil.

  For more info contact:
   DCI Music Viedo                         Or call  212-691-1884
   541 Avenue of the Americans                      800-628-1528
   New York, NY 10011

 DCI can tell you if a music store in your area has the tapes, or you
can order it directly from them with a credit card.

  Also in the news letter that was an interesting question that Neil answered.
 Someone asked "On my HYF cassette, towards the end of "Tai Shan" I hear a
 female singing (Aimee Mann?)  What is she singing?  It is very har to hear?"

  Neil replys :
    "It is indeed Aimee Mann in there, only she's not exactly "singing"
anything - we took her voice from one of the other songs and played it
backwards, just as a nice texture which gave an errie, pseudo-Chinese sound.
And no, this is not backward-masking, or whatever those lunatics call it -
there is nothing about the devil in there!"
                           ~~~~~
 -----Please forgive me if this is old trivia to some of yous, but I had to
check it out...sure enough around the  3.35 time on "Tai Shan" you can hear
her voice if you listen real carefully (it is after the last verse in the
song..."When China sang to me." for those with the cassette).

      Let us know if anyone checks into those viedos, sounds to be real
interesting.
      Later y'all and HAPPY TURKEY DAY!!!!!!

Subject: Rush taken too seriously
Date: Wed, 27 Nov 91 17:33:06 EST
From: siegal@husc.harvard.edu!

I just read NMS #387, in which Greg Ward suggests that not everything by
Rush must have a hidden meaning.  I must say I heartily agree.  I have been
a fan for about 8 years, and I have all of their albums, including several
boots; I would definitely consider myself a true fan.  However, I am content
to listen to and appreciate the excellent caliber of their music and lyrics
without having to come up with a hundred different possible meanings for
things like "1001001" in "The Body Electric", etc.  Ok, so maybe it DOES have
significance of some sort, but my guess is that it's just something that
sounds "computerish", like a binary number or a machine language op code, and
was used to heighten the general hi-tech mood of the song.  The point is,
Rush's music and lyrics SOUND GREAT!  Just sit back and enjoy it, and
loosen up a bit!

&gt;Hello all:
&gt;        Well, I would just like to say that there is an incredible amount of
&gt;luck involved in getting tickets.  Here, in the LA area, you are not allowed
&gt;to campout; instead, it is done on the random number/wristband system.  Well,
&gt;on Sat. I arrived to buy tickets at about 7:45 (wristbands at eight).
&gt;Anyways, my number was 29 and they started from 29.  Well, needless to say
&gt;my seat is Sec. 1 Row 1 Seat 1 at the LA Forum for Wed. Jan. 22, 1991. I
&gt;was ecstatic to say the least, but it was luck. (not that I am complaining.)

&gt;....yea, sure you got the first section, first seat! -I thought radio
stations buy these seats first.:|

Subject: ya know...stuff

Hello All,

After being a silent partner on this alias for quite sometime,
I've finally gotten around to adding my 2 cents.

(whatever that's worth!!??!!)

1)    The National Midnight Star is a kick!!!  I really enjoy
      hearing everyone's input and much of the info is really
      quite interesting.  I thought that I was a bigtime Rush
      fan since I listen to their music A LOT;  have most of
      theirs CD's;  know most of the words to most of the songs;
      set my system prompt to be `Analog Kid'; named the printer
      here at work `Presto' which runs off the server named
      `roll the bones'; and have practically learned how to play
      the bass (my Rickenbacker 4001) from listening to the Gedster.

      But you guys know this stuff inside out.  Tip my hat to y'all.

2)    Mr. Rush-Mgr Sir - you've done an EXCELLENT job in keeping
      track of all this madness and I just wanted you to know it
      hasn't gone unnoticed.  Keep it up man!!!  If only the boys
      in the band knew what we were up to...

3)    Oakland, CA  -  January 28th.  let the count down begin...
      (for those of you who are keeping score at home...)

4)    ...What???  No Eric Johnson for the Left Coast???  Is this
      some kind of cruel hoax??...and no, Primus doesn't EVEN come
      close to making up for it!

5)    So, has Mr. Peart ever published that book of his writings,
      lyrics, poems, etc, that I heard about so long ago??  Sorry
      if I'm a bit behind on this one, but I have been kept out of
      the proverbial loop.

6)    Question:  How can time be a spiral AND a gypsy caravan????

7)    ...and what's so bad about being pseudo-intellectual???  I've
      been that way once or twice myself, although I wasn't smart
      enough to realize it at the time.

ok, 'nuff ramblement for one issue...sorry about that gang, but I've
had all this building up inside and I just needed someone to talk to.
Thank you for being there for me.  This has all been very cathartic.

er........therapeutic for us pseudos.

Later,

Ron
