Well, just a couple of topics here.  First, there was no NMS sent out for
Monday, 5/20/91 due to work & other constraints.  Seeing how there's only
fourteen articles today after three days, it probably wasn't a great loss.

Second, the second Official Rush Get-Together in Philadelphia was a great
success, apparently.  Little did I know when I left at 7:00 PM that it would
last another *eight* hours!  Next time, I'll bring my sleeping bag!  Thanks
and kudos to Donna for hosting it!  Alas, no band formed, but I hear there
was some bass funnin' around by Rose.  It was a good time in general, and
a great way to get to know others in your geographical area.  I would 
suggest it's a good excuse for a party, if nothing else.  Now we're looking
for a sucker ... errr host for this summer's Washington DC area Rush party.
I hosted it last year, but (as you attendees know) have almost no yard space
for outdoor fun.  Any chance of getting a volunteer for this summer?  How
about the other areas of the country - don't tell me the mid-Atlantic area
has the best partiers??  ;-)  Even if you're poor - just make your party a
BYOE(verything), and you'll probably have left-overs for a week.  Give it
a thought!  We're harmless ... mostly.

Subject: The New Music (TV show)

        In TNMS 240, someone from the UK asked about a Canadian
show called "The New Music".  He saw Geddy in an episode talking
about books.  TNM (hey -- almost TNMS!  hmmm) is produced by
CITY-TV in Toronto.  It's a weekly show about the music biz.
The episode you saw sounds like one they did during National
Literacy Week or something like that, a few months ago.
It was titled "Rock'n'Reading" and featured various literary
rockers talking about why books and literacy are important to them.
Aside from Geddy, and Neil, there was Sting, the singer from
Judas Priest (?) who writes short stories or something, and many others.

Geddy wrote Entre Nous?  That's 'nous' to me - I thought Neil wrote it.

I beg to differ with Jason about it not being a love song.  IMHO, it's
clearly about being in love and dealing with the realistic limitations of
intimacy.  The song seems to say that although it's natural to feel compelled
to get as close as possible, it's really better and more realistic to accept
that people can only be so close to each other.  Also that getting too close
can have a growth-stifling effect on a relationship.

Random idea of the week:  Could Open Secrets be a confession of sorts about
the effects of avoiding complete intimacy (like Entre Nous advocates)?

Anyway, it seems natural to me that Rush wouldn't write many love songs.
Neil's lyrics are really designed to provoke thought and rational reflection.
Most love songs provoke feelings instead.  But that brings us back to those
darned Hemispheres, doesn't it?  (^8

	Let us not forget that RUSH did have a self-titled album - if anything
they have ever made is a love song, it would have to be "Need Some Love"
and "In The Mood."
	Kind of rough, but a good album. Oft forgot.
	Aloha, bigtuna!

Subject: Re: Red star or Pentagram?

Back a while ago I had pulled out one of my AD&D books and looked up all
those symbols.  A pentagram has to have the star drawn with the lines
crisscrosing forming a pentagram inside the star!  Remember a pentagram
is a five equal sided figure.

Unless I remember incorrectly the 'Red Star' is drawn with only the outline
of the star.  The meaning of these symbols is absolute contrast to any
Satanistic qualitites.  Besides where in the 2112 is there really any
references that evil is the right way.

Lets end this flame of Satanism and Rush....

Subject: Howie and the red star

Early morning greetings to all,

     This may seem non-Rush-related, but stay tuned. I caught Queensryche in
concert last week in Madison, Wisconsin. As they are another personal favorite
of mine, I also splurged and got myself their tour book. Paging through, I read
the tour credits and noticed:

     Tour manager and lighting director: Howard Ungerleider

     Sooooo! He's moonlighting on the side, eh? This would explain why a few of
the lighting schemes seemed familiar, especially the ceiling of green lasers
that Rush used during that really awesome atmospheric-middle-guitar-solo-thang
in La Villa Strangiato.

     Also, just as an informative note, at the end of the 2112 section of the
_Exit, Stage Left_ videotape, ie, the end of the performance, they flash on
screen the red star as presumably seen on the back screens in concert. It looks
like it's a water reflection, and it is different from every other picture in
that it is a pentagram with all lines intact. It's not upside down, but if you
take and turn your TV set on its top, you will plainly see the abhorrent, vile,
hell-spawn symbol that all sane men fear. :)

     Oh, and one last thing. To all those reading this, PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE ADDRESS AND REMEMBER IT WHEN YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS LIST! Seeing
two or three people every issue who are trying to leave is getting annoying. I
realize people make mistakes, but this many?

Subject: Red stars and pentagrams

Greg C Best observed that the Red Star of the Solar Federation isn't a
pentagram because the points break the circumscribing circle.  (Sure,
it's upside down too, but one could always flip the album over :-))
There's a better reason why the Red Star isn't a pentagram, one I've used
against fundies with great success:   The Star's interior lines do
NOT connect across the center, and thus it can't be a pentagram.  (Note
that some apparently-official 2112 graphics, posters or whatnot, show
a crossed Red Star:  this is incorrect, since the original art has an
uncrossed Star on the 2112 album cover.  Weird, those differences;
one may speculate as to why.......)

Greetings.  Long time no post. . .  (I think last time was the original
_Trees_ debate!)

_Countdown_ is "dedicated with thanks to astronauts Young & Crippen and
all the people of NASA for their inspiration and cooperation."

I checked the FAQL (such a responsible Digest poster!) and found no
mention of Young or Crippen.  I think this has been answered before, but
again for those with short memories:  Why was the song dedicated to these
two?  Why not all the astronauts?  Who are Young and Crippen, specifically?

Thanks.

Subject: new album title: another rumour

A friend of mine told me yesterday that he read (in a
magazine I've never even heard of) an announcement that
the new album will be called "Roll The Bones".

The only meaning I can attatch to this phrase is that
it was an old gamblers phrase for throwing dice, when
dice used to made of ivory.

Anyone else?

1) Every time a plane flies overhead, you immediately add the snare drum fill

2) Every time a helicopter flies overhead, you play an imaginary synth from

3) You can tap out the fade out to 'Grand Designs' perfectly on your dashboard
   or steering wheel.

4) You know the lyrics to Rivendell.

	One song no one has mentioned that could be considered a "love" song
is In The Mood :-).

	One more thing.  Does anyone else find the ending to Red Barchetta
kinda anti-climatic?  I always find myself wishing the song was a little
longer.  His "desperate plan" just doesn't seem too desperate to me.

Subject: Re: NMS 241: same old song topics...

To whoever it was who said that a lot of today's songs are about the same 
thing, you're right.  But some bands have done a good job of being creative
as well as adressing important topics.  One band (I think this has been said
before, but I'll say it again!) that does this *quite* well is
Queesryche.  Now, I like Rush from the hard-rock point of view, so alot of
people may not like queensryche, but their last 2 albums (Empire and
Operation: Mindcrime) are both full of songs pertaining to society today
and common social problems we have.  They are great!!  If you haven't heard eit
either album, I highly recommend checking them out.  If you're scared of
hard rock, don't worry; Queensryche is good at rockin' without geting ugly
about it.

oh well, that's just my 2 cents... (I'm trying to think of other bands who
write songs on different topics, and none come to mind as quickly as
Queensryche does...)
