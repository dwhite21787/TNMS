ANNOUNCEMENT:  Source code for the programs 'compress' and 'uncompress' is
available via anonymous ftp at Syrinx.  The source is provided in Unix shar
file format and is uncompressed.  It's in the main 'rush' directory via ftp.
There is also an updated README file which gives some information about the
new script.  Enclosed in the shar file are other informational files which
pertain directly to the code.

This should help out some of you who would like to access the ftp files,
but don't have 'uncompress' on your system.  It seems to be fairly portable.

Note:  This is version 3.0 of comress/uncompress.  It will accept input
created by v. 2.0, but output from v. 3.0 is NOT compatable with v 2.0.
If you need the interaction, there is a compiler option you can use; consult
the README files in the shar file.

Subject: Rush and ... Star Trek?

Greetings and Falicitations --

Well, I just got back from L.A. a couple of days ago after attending
the 25th Anniversary Star Trek Convention.  (Sorry I didn't get a
chance to get in touch with any of you Rushans up in California-land
whilst I was there...).  BTW, if anyone wants to know how the Conn was
or anything, drop me a line and I'll try to give ya as much detail as I
remember (I'm writing a diary of it, so hopefully  my memory will
remain in tact).
If anyone does decide to drop me a line, beware because they're going
to be changing the address over here in the next couple of weeks (I
will be informing rush-mgr about the change) so there may be a few
bounces or whatever.  But I will be happy to relay the events to
anyone interested (unless the majority of the Digest wants it posted
to the Digest... only a small suggestion, rush-mgr, I know how adamant
you are about keeping this thing strictly about Rush...).

Anyway, my whole point for writing this was to say that, of all places
in the world, I ended up finding some pretty good pictures of our
favourite trio from one of the dealers.  I was happy.  Two of my
favourite things in one place -- Rush pictures at a Star Trek
Convention... (then again...).  In actuality, they were pictures from
magazines that were laminated.  But they looked kind-of rare.  There
were two pictues from a Japanese drumming mag (or it was a Western mag
translated into Japanese) of Neil from last year.  One picture in
particular was great -- I'm going to have it framed -- Neil is holding
this huge volume of Edgar Allen Poe (a leather-bound volume with gold
lining on the pages) and he's looking off-camera with this great smile
on his face, his eyes all crinkled.  It's absolutely one of the best
pictures I've seen of him; it's just adorable.  There must've been
about 20 pictures of Rush (alas I only got 5) and the dealers I got it
from have a whole selection of pictures from a hundred different
groups.  I'll post the address next week if anyone is interested in
obtaining pics of Rush or whomever.

Another neat thing, too was, while I was waiting with my friend in line
for her to get George Takei's autograph (Mr. Sulu) in the dealer's
room, the dealer next to us was playing Tom Sawyer.  Sigh.

And that's a wrap!  Ho-hoo!

Hi Everyone,

In reading through past issues of the digest I noticed another
interesting little debate (around the 190's) about Neil's abilities
as a lyricist. Many of those who wrote in actually seemed to believe
that Neil is not a great lyricist. Those who were pro-Neil said only
that they loved his lyrics, while those who were critical claimed that,
from a `literary' point of view, they often leave much to be desired.
These criticism seemed to evolve out of simple request by someone
for `least-favorite lines.' This request was great -- I was glad
to hear what people didn't like (e.g. ``excitement so thick -- you
could cut it with a knife'' -- not a fave of mine either!) but
the Neil-bashing sucked. `Why bring this up?' you might ask. Well,
I think Neil deserves a better defense.

First, one of those who looks down on Neil's lyrics legitimized
his own views by letting us know that he was a communications major.
BFD, I say to that. I took a graduate seminar from Saul Bellow
(Nobel Prize in Literature, BFD). The `high art'/`low art' debate
is hardball and it is not uncommonly heard therein that Hemingway
was a literary cretin, not least of all because he was a journalist!
I submit that a journalist's training does little to prepare him or
her for the task of producing `true literature' or recognizing
literary genius (beyond the basics of grammar and rhetoric).
Hemingway's journalistic experience was valuable in that it helped
him develop _his particular style_ (which I love, BTW!), that is all.
Anyway, what seemed to be overlooked by most (though not by Neil
himself) is that lyrics are not poetry, and should not be criticized
as such. They have aspects in common with poems, but they purpose
is quite different. People come down hard on the lyrics to `Anthem,'
for example. Comparing them to the words of another famous anthem,
(DAU) `The Star-spangled Banner,' shows that they are of the same rank.
(I personally find the words to `Anthem' more inspirational. ``A
closet objectivist! Protect our children!'').

Neil has his own manner of lyric writing over which he has labored
through the years. One can discern two obvious styles -- correlated
with the major musical stages of the band -- pre-1980 and post-1980
(though there are, no doubt, styles within styles). The former
culminated in the words of _Hemispheres_. I myself prefer the latter
style by far. Perhaps it is the anachronicity of `Countdown'
which makes it jarring to the post-Hemispheres ear?

There were complaints about cliches. Well, it is in fact part
of Neil's later style to give new life to cliches. Think of the
following well-worn phrases: ``show and tell,'' ``movers and
shakers,'' ``the Reds,'' ``the truth is often better left
unsaid,'' and on and on. Neil's ability to transform and
revitalize such phrases through recontextualization, his
magnificent ear for puns, and his mastery of the essentials of
traditional lyric-writing (the basics of old-time poetry: rhyme,
alliteration, etc.) combine in a masterful and mature style.
I think that there is little doubt that Neil is a virtuoso
lyricist. Just check out `Red Lenses''!!

IMHTTO Paul Simon, to whom one of the critics referred as an
example of a superior lyricist, does far better as a comedian
(I love his work in ``Annie Hall,'' and Saturday Night Live
as Billy Paul (pseudo-Billy-Jack): ``I want a triple scoop cone,
chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla. That's black, red, and white,
together.'') than a lyricist. Remember ``Fifty Ways to Leave Your
Lover''? (ISTBO: if you're too young for that one, praise be to
God!).

[ Oh, geez, make some of us feel old, why don't you??  :-)      :rush-mgr ]

Yours Truly,

Gregg

&gt; I went out to look for Leiber's "Gonna Roll the Bones", but couldn't
&gt; find it anywhere.	I checked the biggest bookstore (Borders) in the
&gt; D.C. area, but no luck.	They looked up Leiber on the computer, and
&gt; quite a few titles came up, but all since 1976.	"Bones" is dated
&gt; 1967, and apparently is (long) out of print.	I havn't yet tried a
&gt; library- heck the Library of Congress should have it!
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else been able to find this book?

It is not a book, it is a short story. It can be found in the a book by
Harlan Ellerson, "Dangerous Visions." Or I read it in "The Hugo Winners
v2" edited by Issac Asimov. This is probably why they were not able to
find it in their computers. BTW the book is copyright 71 and has the Hugo
winners from 62 to 69, lots of SF history in it's darkest period (my
opinion).

	first of all i don't usually post such long messages but i haven't
	posted in such a long time that i have soo much to say....&lt;grin&gt;

			Experiencing Rush to Extremes

	i just spent the past weekend at a local hot spot, wildwood new jersey,
	with my girlfriend and other cronies (BTW none of them love Rush).
	i graciously offered to bring my cd player down...well everyone must
	have forgotten to bring thier cds so all we had for a two hour ride
	was...RUSH! &lt;gleam&gt; as the week progressed everyone was growing weary
	of the boyz so i eased up a little; until i found a p/g poster in a
	local shirt shop! well this got me going again...less then 3 minutes
	after i brought the p/g poster i heard 'witch hunt' playing on the
	p.a. of a ice cream shop &lt;silent rejoice&gt;.  less then 3 minutes after
	that experience i went into another shop only to be aproached by a
	beautiful slim blonde who said,(with much excitment) "is that a RUSH
	poster?!?"  well the conversation imediatly took off (slight friction
	with my girlfriend at this juncter) i found out that she goes to
	the university of delaware so i asked her if she was on TNMS *(she's
 	not)* but i explained the net and the list and gave her the address so
	maybe we will be hearing from her soon.

			Books Neil should read.

	well i think this is a great topic, but i'm sorry that i don't have
	a long list to contribute, so the only book i can say Neil should
	read would be:

		Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco.
	it's a very good book but difficult to explain.

			FTP Sound files

	i know dwhite@dsys.nesl.nist.gov was looking for a place to upload
	the sound files. if he could give me an idea of how much space
	they take i'll see if widener could hold them till syrinx can
	accomidate them.

	You know your a rush fan when...
		your caught in a thunder storm and you start reciting
		jacob's ladder like your narrating a story...

Subject: What the FAQ?

Hey, guys, I don't mind _constructive_ criticism of the FAQL file, like the
recent postings about the "Barchetta" entry, but this week I've received
quite a few letters from people who seem to feel that they could do a better
job than me at running the FAQL file.

Let me point out at this time that I volunteered to keep the FAQL file,
and I spend a few hours every week answering mail about it - some people
send suggestions, and others ask for the current version.  I don't mind
that.  That's why I keep the file.  But this week, people have just been
sending criticism, which I don't think I deserve.  (I won't name names -
they're not important.)

But if any of you feel that you could do a better job, just post, and the
job is yours.  Maybe I'm overreacting because I just finished finals, but
there are ~15-20 people who sent private email with no constructive
content - surely people who know that much wouldn't have any problem
keeping the FAQL file accurate and up to date.

[ I'm a bit upset to hear Dan saying this - he's been supporting the FAQL for
  over a year now, and has done a great job, IMHO.  If you have suggestions
  about any aspect of this mailing list, post your Constructive Criticisms
  here and let the whole list think about it.  Remember, there are over 750
  of us out there, and most of them live in countries with democratic process.
  Also, if you've got a gripe about something, try offering a solution along
  with the perceived problem.  Warning: you may get chosen to implement it!
                                                                  :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Even when I am gray...

	Derek brought up an interesting topic.  One that I have thought about,
and I'm sure most of the rest of you have as well.  How much longer...?
Well my personal feeling is that they will keep going strong, and I'm
looking forward to what their future holds.  Did I read before that they
have a 5 album contract right now? ( Someone?  Verify?)  If they keep
going at around the same rate that would put them damn near 50 by the
time their current contract expires.   My opinion?  They'll finish it.
I would guess 3 more studio albums after RTB and then the farewell live
set.

	Sting made an interesting comment (he is also around the same age).  He
was talking about his new album and specifically  the video for one of
the singles.  "I really didn't want to make one of those videos where
some middle aged man is dancing around with these 20 year old, half
dressed babes who wouldn't look twice at him on the street."    I think
the boyz are in teh same vein.  The music is starting to mello, and it
should.  You can see signs of the age (Geddys voice doesn't have the
same blood curdling squeal, they are turning to stage effect rather that
running around as much) but they still have the same vision.

I think the two scenarios we must fear most as Rush fans are these:

    1) The boyz can't cope with their age and make a blunder like trying to
record another MP.  "Sadder still to watch it die than never to have
known it".  I really doubt that will happen.  One of the things I admire
most about the band is their level heads.  Rush will never be blind.

    2) The record companies and such can't handle the thought of an
untapped resource and start pumping out random marketing trash.  Let's
face it-- Chronicles could have been a disaster.  It just goes to show
that the band doesn't have complete control of their material.  Imagine:
 Rush action figures, Rush trading cards, Rush breakfast cereal (sugar
coated red stars).  (I see a topic to keep the NMS busy during the
summer lull). "So much style without substance- So much stuff without
style". I really don't think we need to worry about Rush turning into
another new kids (twitch, twitch).

	Alright, I've rambled enough.  I just wanted to impart a positive
outlook on the coming years.  As far as sound:  I'd like to hear less
synth and more focus on the groove.  More rhythm based, more minimal.
Jazz?  Funk?  Hell, it could be polkas and still sound good coming from
Rush.

Well, I remember a poem about Death from a 20th century dude named
Dylan Thomas that had a line that read "Do not go gentle into that

I believe Rodney Dangerfield read that poem in Back To School.

Subject: Literary references in Neil's lyrics

About the "Let us not go gently to the endless winter night" thread...

I think that no one's put this whole thing in perspective...  One great
element of Neil's lyrics  is that he is a master at taking a well-known
phrase and turning it to his own particular intention.  You really can't
ask a question like "Is he quoting Dylan Thomas or is he talking about
nuclear winter?"  because the answer is simply "Yes."  He's doing
both.  I could list hundreds of examples where a particular phrase
is definitely drawn from some other literary work ("plus c,a change, plus
ce la meme chose" comes to mind) but what makes Neil a great lyricist
is the way he can give homage to his influences while providing us with
old words that take on new meaning.

That's all.  Rock out, roll on.  Oops, different Canadian band...

Subject: How to find "Gonna Roll the Bones"

If you're looking for _Gonna Roll the Bones_, by Fritz Leiber, the only place
I know where it exists is in the anthology _Dangerous Visions_, edited by
Harlan Ellison. This is a landmark of speculative fiction, containing stories
that were a) written specifically for that volume, having never been published
anywhere else; and b) considered "taboo" subjects at the time the book was
published (mid-to-late 60's). Although the Leiber story is really not that
controversial, and doesn't seem to break any current "taboos", it probably was
considered controversial in the 60's, as it raises questions about God, the
Devil, and just what is good and bad. A helluva read, it was one of the most
widely praised stories in the book. That story, and "Riders of the Purple
Wage", by Philip Jose Farmer, are worth the cost of the book. It's out of
print, so scrounge any used book stores in your local city (look in the yellow
pages, give them a call, you'd be surprised how many of them could tell you if
they have this book.).

The story *may* be in a "best of" anthology of Fritz Leiber's work, but I
couldn't testify to that, ossifer!

Hi,

Sorry to add to the plethora of postings about Satanism -- I wholeheartedly
agree with Neil on the subject -- but there is in fact back-masking on
``Stairway to Heaven''. Underneath ``There's still time to change the
road you're on'' you can very distinctly hear the words ``My sweet Satan''
when you play Zep IV backwords. I really really like Led Zeppelin but
this freaked me out when I found it. I ran the entire record backwards
and heard nothing but garbage before and after this ``message'' or
whatever the hell it is supposed to be. I think it's one of Jimmy Page's
weird ideas, like violating girls with fishes (``The Hammer of the Gods'').
I don't appreciate this little trick because it can be used to support
all sorts garbage from the `far right'. Sad but true...

[ You have better ears than I do, then.  I've heard that passage a few times
  over the years, and haven't heard anything yet.  Same goes for "Another One
  Bites the Dust", but I digress...                               :rush-mgr ]

I believe the poem that has "Rage, rage against the dying of the

is indeed by Dylan Thomas;  I think its title is "Crossing The Bar".

The three travelers from Willowdale are Geddy, Alex, and Neil, of
course!

Or perhaps, since Neil didn't grow up with Geddy and Alex, the three
are Geddy, Alex, and John Rutsey, with Neil being Prince By-tor (or
the Necromancer, depending on your taste)!

I was reading the past digests and thought I'd put in my two cents worth:

1)  The movie "DUNE" is a terrific (imho), but the book (and subsequent series
    are MUCH better.  I think that God Emperor would be the best book for Neil
    to expound on.  I couldn't put that book down; just think what Neil could
    do with that!! :)

2)  I feel stupid, but the only time that I've heard of that Dylan Thomas poem
    is in the Rodney Dangerfield movie "Back to School" (maybe I should go back
    to school); but hey, I'm a CS major, not a lit major! :)

C)  I have been reading a book by Dr. Wali called "Chandra".  It is about a
    world renowned astrophysicist and how much of a true genius he is.  I have
    always been in awe of the great scientists (Glashow, Hawking, Wheeler...)
    and this book is probably the best I've ever read about the "fraternity"
    of the great men like them.  Anyway, my point (if I remember correctly), is
    that I was listening to the Manhattan Project and I realized that Neil must
    also understand the TRUE meaning of celebrity, not the patronizing meaning
    that you find in, say, the celebrity of Madonna.  Neil must realize that
    there men like Chandra are THE true celebrities.

I know that this makes no sense, but heh, what do you expect for $0.02! :)

See you!
