Hello all,

    I don't want to sound like a nudge, but please try to keep submissions
to within 75 characters or so per line.  If you go over 80 characters, many
systems force the reader to go over to the end of the line to see what was
out there.  Also, please put manual carraige returns in your postings; while
your system may (apparently) break lines for you, on this end it sometimes 
looks like one looooong line, which I feel compelled to break up for read-
ability, and also to prevent incredibly long record lengths of the Digest.

Hopefully, you know who you are.

Thank you for your support...

Manager,
RUSH Fans Mailing List

     Well, I just have to throw in my $.02 on this request for the perfect
band, the "ultimate" band.  I used to think in terms like that, always thinking
that if so and so got together with so and so, it would be the greatest
band/basketball team/football team/etc.  It took me a while to realize that
it is not the just a combination of the best people that make a band, etc., it
is the chemistry.  That chemistry only comes about through familiarity, and
shared history.  On the other hand, I find no qualms with giving out lists of
'favorite' performers, it is just the idea of creating an ultimate band,
actually saying "gee wouldn't it be great if Geddy Lee, teamed up with Joe
Satriani", that makes me uneasy.
     As far as my favorites go, it is too difficult to say.
I like Chris Squire on Bass, David Gilmour or Mark Knopfler on Guitar, and
oh, Richard Wright on Keyboard.  Drums, I might have to go with someone like
Reni, from the Stone Roses. Never heard of them? Well, I don't blame you.

     And on to other things.  "Show Don't Tell" is a popular phrase used by
fiction writers.  It means to always show the action rather than telling about
it in writing fiction.  I'm sure some of you know what I mean, and the others
of you can figure out the difference with a little thought.  I never thought
that the song Show Don't Tell, was anything to do with religion, but then I
never dissected the lyrics either.  I'll check them out tonight.  I always
thought that the song was about being a good writer or something.  I *really*
need to listen to it again.

Adios amigos. . .

Subject: Dos Passos book

In response to Kerry's request for a Dos Passos book to read, the
obvious choice is The Big Money.  I finally worked my way through it a
few weeks ago - pretty dull, (intentionally) disjointed book about how
money corrupts the values of people.  It does paint a good picture of
America's prosperity in the 20's.  In addition, every once in awhile,
there is a 2-3 page section entitled "The Camera Eye", from which the
Rush song's lyrical mechanism is based.

All in all, I would recommend saving your time and reading something
else.  Dos Passos also has a book The Grand Design, but I stayed away.

Subject: Listen!

OK, here's a bunch of replies and answers from the past 2 digests since I
have been out of touch for a while

&gt;nyx.UUCP!fpeabody%nyx.uucp@nike.cair.du.edu (Fred Peabody)

&gt;   Could someone please post the correct order of all the songs on the
&gt;Caress of Steel album? I'm afraid my tape has them all scrambled up.
&gt;Thank you very much.

Sure: Bastille Day, I Think I'm Going Bald, Lakeside Park, The Necromancer,
and the Fountain of Lamneth, the parts of which were named in order 2 digests
ago (sorry I don't remember them offhand)

&gt;   Someone said that they thought A Passage to Bangkok was about drugs.
&gt;Can you explain? I didn't think Rush would be the kind of band to be into
&gt;drugs...

In "Visions", it is said that Neil used to be quite an aficionado of
Marijuana. I forget the exact quote....

&gt;From: Ron Chrisley &lt;chrisley@parc.xerox.com&gt;

&gt;PS:  Oh yeah, somebody a while back suggested that we don't know what Peart
&gt;has read besides Rand.  But we do:  Hemmingway, Marquez, "A Confederacy of
&gt;Dunces", and another hispanic-named author whose name escapes me at the
&gt;moment (two of his books: "Grand Designs" and another Rush song title;
&gt;someone help me out here).

John Dos Passos. He wrote that along with "The Big Money". Also, he has a gimmick
where he writes a few chapters in a book and then has a section called "The Camera
Eye" (!) between sets of them. As far as the reading goes, I've heard it's really
dry stuff but not anything about the actual content.

&gt;From: "Brad_Armstrong.WBST129"@Xerox.COM

&gt;Just a quick note on a comment Derek made yesterday.  The only Rush videos
&gt;I can recall seeing on MTV more than once were Distant Early Warning and
&gt;The Body Electric..

I seem to remember "Show Don't Tell" being in their top 10 requested videos
for a while, so it was shown every day practically when it first came out.
They played "The Pass" fairly often as well.

&gt;From: Donald Cross &lt;CROSS@ucf1vm.cc.ucf.edu&gt;

&gt;"That's nice!"  -  ?Alex?

Yep. The story on this was posted a few weeks ago, but I don't remember the tech's
name. He had a habit of sampling things Alex would say and then playing them back
with effects on them for laughs. I guess the guys liked this one.

Also, I asked a question a while ago but never got a reply. I was wondering
if Digital Man was based on a story or something. The lyrics "He's got a force
field and a flexible plan/He's got a date with fate in a black sedan" seem pretty
specific to be just imagery to conjure a feeling or impression.

Subject: The ultimate band?

Mark S. opens up a can of worms yesterday by asking what musicians we'd like
to see as part of an "ultimate" band.  I have a feeling any responses are
gonna be very biased towards Rush... :-)  Anyway, some of my choices would
overlap:
        Drums --        Peart, Bruford
        Bass --         Lee, Stanley Clarke
        Keys/synths --  Thomas Dolby, Rick Wakeman
guitars, lead and etc-- Satriani, Adrian Belew, Robert Fripp, Ed Van Halen
                        Robert Cray (rhythm)
        vocalists --    (hoo boy) Freddie Mercury, David Bowie, Amy Ray/Emily
                        Saliers, Deborah Holland (heck, even Billy Joel)
        songwriters --  Peart, Peter Gabriel

I seriously doubt this band could play together or even fit all their egos in
the same room!  :-)

                Ahh, to dream...

                                                Derek L.

Subject: Thanks

Thanks to one and all for the interpretations of A Passage to Bangkok. To be 
quite honest, as kid who has spent most of his life in the 80's, I never 
heard of the drug references before, so when I heard the song, I figured it 
must've been about world travel or something like that. I guess I took it too 
literally.

Plus, when Frank from Holland first brought it up, I just couldn't picture
the boyz using drugs. Then again, when I look at the 2112 group photo, maybe I
can. Thanks again for the help!

   Also, a thank-you to those who helped out w/ the "lovers pause to find an
open store" line.

My Ideal Band:

Guitar: Kirk Hammet and Alex Lifeson
Drums: Neil Peart and Lars Ulrich
Bass: Geddy Lee and Jeff Berlin
Vocals: Robert Plant
