   All right. I am posing a challenge to all you Rush obsessed crazy lunatics
like myself. But first, a little brief background.

   I play in a band where we cover Rush. I am a keyboard player, and
sometimes a vocalist. All the members of my band are very capable of playing
Rush. We already cover Spirit, Sawyer, Closer to the Heart, Subdivisions, and
we used to do Where's My Thing. We're working on La Villa, Dreamline, and
YYZ. We've jammed with Mystic Rhythms, Marathon, Bytor, and Beneath Between
and Behind. Basically, we could probably play anything. My drummer and me
have even jammed out 2112, and Xanadu.

   My question is: I want to cover more Rush. I need some suggestions.
Preferrably something from Rush's keyboard era, from AFK on so that I
actually have something to do. The song probably should be known, as we play
in bars where Rush fans may or may not exist. Maybe danceable? But then
again, if anyone can find a Rush song you can dance to, then there's another
challenge. So, guys, tell me what you think. Or is this too hard?

Turn around and walk the razor's edge.
Don't turn your back and slam the door on me.

Hello All,
	I must have had my head in the clouds, but I remember voting in
the semi-finals of the Rush album wars, but I can't remember what those
last four albums were. I would guess the playoffs are over, can anyone
fill me in on what the final four were and who won?
	I'm sure there will be numerous flames abou this anyway, but the
symbol for Iron on the periodic chart is Fe not I, thus LiFeSON is
spelled properly. The lesson is much like the equity principle, don't
flame unless you yourself are error-free.

Subject: a passage to bangkok

this may be old news, but believe it or not, I just noticed it the other
day...

I was listening to "A Passage to Bangkok" on 2112, thinking about the
recent slew of posts on the digest about what the song was about with
respect to different kinds of drugs or just marijuana etc etc blah blah
blah.

Well, when the song gets to the part where Alex is just about to cut into
his guitar solo, there is this  kind of  "sucking noise", which really
sounds like someone inhaling a joint very deeply!

I thought that was hilarious. Please tell me there's someone else out
there that hadn't noticed this before... I truly am an avid rush fan...
really....

	In describing Alex's last name, I believe the original person was
using those elements symbols:
Lithium + Iron + Sulfur + Oxygen + Nitrogen
   Li	   Fe      S        O         N
so why don't you think a little more before you go off criticizing someone...

Does anybody know the extent of music training the members of Rush
have had.  Given the complexity (rhytmic and harmonic) of the music,
I have to assume these guys know how to read music and know a fair
amount of music theory.  Anyone know for sure?

From: Steven Horwitz <SHOR@MUSIC.STLAWU.EDU>
Subject: first post / ykyarfw

This my first post, blah, blah, blah...

As seems to be customary, let me give some personal background.
My name is Steve Horwitz and I'm a 31 year old economics
professor at St. Lawrence University in the wildnerness of
upstate New York.  I started listen to the Boyz at the time PeW
came out.  My brother Mike (who posts to this board from time to
time) had bought the album and I had heard TSOR on the radio and
loved it.  Freewill clinched the deal.

As my brother may attest to, the best concert I've seen them give
was in Toledo on the GUP tour.  The Toledo Sports Arena holds no
more than about 5000 people and it was festival seating.  We were
there early enough to sit just a few rows up on Geddy's side.
With such a small venue, they could keep the amps down a bit and
the sound and show were excellent (with the exception of the
frequently and justifiably trashed opening act Fastway).

One of my interests in joining this board is any discussion of
the political and economic implications of Neil's lyrics.  My
area of expertise in economics is the Austrian school, which has
long defended the kind of libertarian/individualist political
stance one sees in Neil's (early?) lyrics and influences on him
(like Ayn Rand).  I'm particularly interested in any college
students (and there appear to be many on this board) who might be
looking for books on politics and economics that they can read to
follow up on those ideas.  If you're interested, please either
post to the board or post me privately at shor@music.stlawu.edu.

Just a few other thoughts on recent topics of discussion:  One
band I haven't seen recommended for Rush fans is Live.  I think
they have the musicianship and interesting (if a bit morose)
lyrics that Rush fans might like.

Bravo to the folks defending The Camera Eye as the best song on
MP.  It's hard to believe any song anywhere is better than the
first three cuts, but TCE is one of their very best songs.  Also
as to Neil's lyrics:  they have indeed evolved in the last decade
or so, but there are still strong traces of the individualism of
the early albums.  Listen carefully to Bravado, Stick it Out, and
Alien Shore, for example.

PIN numbers.  {We all trust each other, right? :) }

well, as i recall, from an issue of Stereo Review, from sometime this

the artical was devoted mainly to the *awesome* stereo he has in his car..
one thing in particular i remember is that there is a plexiglass barier
behind his back seat to protect the 6 cd changer from the vibrations of
the speakers.. incidentally, one of the cd's he routinely listens to in
his car is Alice in Chains--Dirt... a buddy of mine may still have the
magazine.. or maybe i could go to the library and dig it up, it was a
pretty interesting article..

for anyone who's interested, i'm a 'southern' rush fan too... g'ville,
florida.. home of the fightin' gators.. woo-hoo...

btw: just got a copy of RUSH'N'ROULETTE '92... mighty impressed... but
the sound quality isn't what i've heard professed here on the list...
maybe its just a bad copy, eh? i'd like to get some info on the boot from
the pensacola show of the Counterparts tour, anyone?
anyone's help appreciated...

Hello all!

(Apologies in advance to all (11) of you female Rush fans out there for the
male-centric nature of this first piece.)

Given the source, I doubt that the following has been posted before.  I was
flipping through the pages of some women's fashion magazine (don't ask!) and
I happen to see this little quip on "The Perfect Date," in which various
celebrities were asked to provide their idea of the perfect date.  Imagine
my surprise when I read this from model Niki Taylor:  "My boyfriend and I
would get dressed up and cruise over to a restaurant near Miami called the
Melting Pot, where we'd have a romantic, candlelit dinner of cheese fondue
with veggies and breads, chicken and filet-mignon fondue with assorted
sauces, and milk-chocolate fondue with fruit and cake chunks.  Yum...good.
 After that, we'd go to a concert by our favorite group, Rush, at the Miami
Arena.  Then we'd go for a snack before heading home.  This would be an
awesome night out."

An "awesome night out"?  Umm, yes, I'd have to agree.  BTW, Niki, if you're
reading this, can I be your boyfriend?  Your idea of the perfect date just
happens to coincide exactly with mine....

On to a few other things:
1)  I agree with Tony Dormio that we do need to conscientiously remember
that many of our brothers and sisters aren't fortunate enough to have access
to TNMS.  Speaking as one who was painfully aware of TNMS's existence for
years but only recently got a job where he could receive it, I will offer
that there is still no substitute for warm handshakes and a good verbal
exchange among Rush fans.  Rush's banishment from the mainstream is great,
IMHO, because it DOES make it all the more exciting and communal when we
(the fans) find one another.
2)  What's become of the "Rush is a band" bumper stickers?  Is anyone having
them made up?  Please sign me up for at least ten.
3)  One more call for transcribed correspondence from the Boys.  If you've
gotten post cards, letters, copies of Neil's journals (yeah, right!), or
whatever from any of the members of that band we know and love, please send
them to me via e-mail.  I'll be happy to consolidate them and post them to
TNMS and Syrinx.  So far I've gotten grand-spanking total of one (that's 1;
5 - 4 = __; the other binary digit besides 0; the number of persons,
including myself, on my typical dates; etc.).  Please make me happy and send
any stuff you have.

For those who pay by the byte, sorry this was so long.  Until later....

And about those Grammies.  When my friend -- a big Pink fan -- called

Grammies are crap, too, so we both had a good laugh over it.

Oh!  Oh!  This is weird.  I was watching "Entertainment Tonight" the
other day, and they have this segment called "Coming attractions" -- just
bits of news of upcoming entertainment events or shows, etc.  They were

Hey, Rush freaks!  HOWSIT?

I'm a student at Pitt, and I've been playing drums my entire life.  Let's
save some BS, eh?

I'm looking for musicians in the Pittsburgh area who really know their
Rush material WELL and might think about trying a cover band this
summer (Rush, of course.)  Ever since Presto came in last February or so,
no other band has played a set of Rush.

This doesn't have to be an everyday/every night thing this summer.  But I
think it would be great to play a few times around the city and see how
much of a crowd we could draw.

Again, reply only if you know your shit well.  Bass, Guitar, and ideally,
Vocals and keys (one person) are all we need (THAT'S all!).

Post me at ewlst+@pitt.edu if you are interested.

Subject: Gilmour/Lee

Hello all,

	I've noticed a comment or two about the question I posed:  Gilmour and
Lee on the same stage...?

	Well, I'm not really sure what to think.  Each of them are /possibly/
the best to ever pick up their respective instruments.  I think, however, their
styles would clash.  Both are lead players.  I don't think Geddy's rhythm
section would go well with Gilmour's playing.  Gilmour has a more relaxed,
float-away, if you will, style.  Geddy's style pulls you in and is more
intense.  That's my $.02.

	I still think it would be an amazing thing to behold anyway...

Hey Gang!
    I just got my new asbestos suit and since I'm in a crappy Monday mood I
figured I'd vent a little and then you can all throw Molitov cocktails at me!
    First and foremost let me say that I love the band and the NMS but I feel
like stirring the hornets' nest a little.
    Remember when every Rush album was different?  I mean _really_ different.
FBN didn't sound like COS,  2112 didn't sound like AFTK, etc. all the way
up to the horrid HYF-Presto-RTB plateau (rut?).  I'm sorry but these 3 albums
do absolutely nothing for me.  It sounds like one big 3-record set of the same
wussy, English-pop-influenced, anal retentive, over-produced, sterile, Def-
Leppard-perfect... you get the idea.  It used to crack me up to hear Alex
and Geddy say "we really wanted to bring the guitars up to the front and be
really aggressive and in-your-face." Oh yeah?  Then why were you playing
thru wimpy solid-state amps and hiding behind a mountain of reverb? Jeez,
thank God for CP.  See guys, isn't it fun to play thru real amps set loud
enough to move the hairs on your arm?  Now that's tone! The only exception
is Everyday Glory which threatens to put us right back in Wussland. That tune
doesn't belong on CP.  We're headed in the right direction though.  Now, let's
all say a little prayer that the truck carrying the synths, sequencers, and
samplers gets lost on the way to the studio.
    Let's face it- the "Broon Years" were the best.  The band had the perfect
balance of aggression and precision even though  Signals started that landslide
into the Keyboardial Abyss ( saved only by the Analog Kid and Digital Man ).
P/G is too damned depressing to listen to ( except Kid Gloves ). Power Windows
is an exceptional album and the only post-Broon effort I can listen to besides
CP.  The reason CP is being raved about is  due to the fact that it's more
Broon-like than anything in the P/G-RTB era. Hey Alex, Ged, and Neil, maybe
it's time to give Terry a call!
    Okay...I've got a big bucket of water and the fire department is standing
by...Flame Away!

Aaron White's mention of Alex's last name being an acronym of elements
symbols is absolutely on the nuts.

using Plutonium_Einsteinium_Americium_Radium_Technetium for Peart doesn't
come even close (PlAmRaTc) <---LOL at this! :)

The atomic symbols thing that someone mentioned is indeed accurate...
Lithium = Li
Iron    = Fe
Sulfur  = S
Oxygen  = O
Nitrogen= N
As you should be able to tell, that spells Lifeson :)
Just wanted to clear that up, since someone commented that LISON did not spell
Lifeson, which indeed it doesn't. :)

For someone who seems to know so much about the periodic table, it seems
our flaming friend has forgotten that elements are denoted by chemical
symbol, not first initial.

Lithium-Iron-Sulfur-Oxygen-Nitrogen is Li-Fe-S-O-N, not LISON.  Lee and
Peart can't be spelled this way

As though any of this makes any difference at all. . .

Subject: RUSH FANATICS - OLD BAT

HEY RUSH FANS,

A question popped up at the office the other day. Why
didn't RUSH play at Woodstock? What really makes a RUSH
fan?

   [ Woodstock? I doubt anyone even thought to ask them. (ie. "Rush? I don't
     want that Limbaugh guy on *MY* stage")                    : rush-mgr ]

    It might have something to do with the music. I've been
a RUSH fan for a long time now but I don't consider myself
a fanatic. I enjoy jamming to their music, chilling out,
and overall grooving (welcome to the 70's).
    I like to direct this next section to the guy - Tony
Dormio - who thrown his mother-in-law out on the street for
not recognizing a RUSH song. I think I saw her on the side
on the road the other day. She was standing next to a mud
puddle. So I cranked up Where's My Thing and aimed for that
puddle. I hit the puddle, passed her, and looked behind me.
She looked like a little old black lady. It was too cool!
    Has anyone heard of Max Webster? I have an old 8-track
cassette of Max Webster - "Universal Juveniles" I heard
Geddy Lee assisted with Battle Scar/Blue River Liquor
Shine. I was cool. Has anyone else heard his?
     I saw RUSH on their last tour - Counterparts -
Everyone rocked the house. I noticed Alex's guitar. When
did he change guitars?  He used to play a PRS (Paul Reed
Smith) this time I saw him play a Bill Gordon double neck
guitar. What's the deal? It must be a new brand he's using.

Talk to y'all later.

I enjoyed reading the message about spelling out LIFESON, PEART, and LEE
using the abbreviations of the elements on the Periodic Table.  BTW,
Aaron White is right in spelling Lifeson with Iron--represented as Fe on the

Subject: Review: '2112' tribute band

Hello everyone!

I just saw the Rush tribute band '2112' this past Saturday at the Cleveland
Cafe in Cleveland, OH, so I thought I might review the show. The band went on
at about 11:00 and played two sets, both a little over an hour long.
Overall, they sounded pretty good but the second set was better than the
first. The consensus that my friends and I came to was:

1) The drummer was great (he pretty much has to be) but looked nothing
like Neil (this isn't too important in my opinion, but the more a tribute
band looks like the actual band, the better the whole experience is).
He did the drum solo from Exit Stage Left and sounded fantastic.

2) If the band had a weak link, it was the guitarist. He just barely got
through many of the solos and just couldn't quite match what Alex can do.
He seemed to mess up more than anybody else in the band too. He did look a
little like Alex though (medium length blond hair, thin).

3) The highlight of this band was the bassist/vocalist/keyboardist. He looked,
sounded, and acted like Geddy. If I'd been a bit further away, I would have
had trouble telling the difference. This guy seldom messed up and seemed to
have Geddy's sound down very well. Although his bass sounded a little 'dirty'.
He fooled me though.

I should also mention that '2112' did not play any songs off any albums past
Signals. So if you like the old stuff more than the new, this band's for you.
Here's the set list (arranged by album 'cuz that's the only way I can
remember):

(Rush)
  Working Man
(Fly by Night)
  By-Tor and the Snow Dog
(Caress of Steel)
  nothing(much to my disappointment.. I love this album)
(2112)
  Overture/Temples of Syrinx
(A Farewell to Kings)
  Xanadu
  Closer to the Heart
  Cygnus X-1(only first part)
(Hemispheres)
  Hemispheres(only first part-intro and Apollo/Dionysus)
  The Trees
  La Villa Strangiato
(Permanent Waves)
  Spirit of Radio
  Freewill
  Natural Science
(Moving Pictures)
  Tom Sawyer
  Red Barchetta
  Limelight
  Camera Eye
  Witch Hunt
(Signals)
  Analog Kid
  Subdivisions

I think that's all of them. The only bad thing about this show was the cover
charge (7$). But if you like Rush as much as I do, you'd probably have thought
it was worth it, I did. The only other Rush tribute band I've seen is
'Freewill' and they were really good too. By the way, does anyone know what
happened to these guys? I haven't heard anything about them in about 2
years. If you have any info please drop me a line. Thanks.

When...

 You check out the Rush collection of every record store you enter
 even though you already own everything.

 You make the DJ at your wedding play several Rush tunes.

 You consider anyone who does not at least acknowledge the talent
 of Rush to be musically impared.

 You have multiple Rush Web pages in your "Hotlist"

 You buy a guitar and the first song book you get is a collection
 of Rush. The first song you try to master is TS.

 One month later you are still trying to play TS at speed.

 You download Rush guitar tabs even though you can't read the damn
 things (anyone care to explain the numbers?)

 You have read many of the literary influences of Peart: Rand,
 Dos Passos, Hemmingway, etc.

 You have looked through Yosuf Karsh books searching for Rush's
 portrait.

 You get all excited when the organist (Go Dieter!) at the hockey
 game plays Subdivisions and you air drum, air keyboard along -
 annoying the hell out of everyone around you.

and of course... when you subscribe to TNMS

I've never even seen the show, but I also really like this song...it's

(turnaround's fair play, eh?)...anyone have the album?

20th ANNIVERSARY GIFT SHIRT UPDATE:
For all of you wondering, "where the heck is that shirt/button/sweatshirt
I ordered eons ago?" here's the scoop:

I'm trying to clean up the last few loose ends before I order the last set
of shirts. I want to order them all at once so they're cheaper and more $$
can go to the gift. PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY ORDERS TO ALEX OR ME. We're done
accepting orders. Fini. The End. No more. Sorry to all who missed their
chance...I'm sure with this group there'll be another shirt/button/bumper
sticker offered soon. Sigh...I hate being a meanie about this, but I hope
we made it clear from the beginning that it was a limited time offer.
Donations are still welcome, but please include a note saying that's what
the money's for so we don't send it back 'cause we think it's an order.

We'll send out the last batch starting the week after I finally order the
shirts, which is looking like maybe the middle of next week at the earliest.

The good news is that we've made over $1000 for the gift! I'll know (and post)
a final count as soon as we've sent off the last of the shirts.

Subject: Radio show for Rush
Date: Tue, 14 Mar 95 20:09:07 EST

   First, in respnse to the guy who asked about ideas for his Rush radio
show, here are some that I've done. I took two and a half hours of a weekend
show that I was doing on my radio station, 88.9 WMCX f.m. based out of West
Long Branch, New Jersey, and I did what I called THE PROGRESSION OF KINGS. It
was the playing of songs from each album in order from Rush through
CounterParts, including all three live albums and Chronicles. I took no more
than two songs from each album, and did not play the epics. Another thing I
did was, when I was really tired, I played Hemispheres and The Fountain of
Lameth in a row. I've also played 2112 in its entirety, too. Have only Signus
to go. :)

   Anyway, this brings me to a question. If I wanted to start a progressive
rock show, what other bands besides Rush, Yes, and E.L.P. would I use? Just
researching.--Damon Fibraio s0067977@hawkmail.monmouth.edu

   If anyone wants a tape of THE PROGRESSION OF KINGS, let me know, and I'll
see if I can get the tapes back from my moronic band members who stole them
from me.
