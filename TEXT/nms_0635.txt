Subject: "our compilation project" & pitkid cartoon

Hello all-

1.)  I'm wondering when the "rarities" tape will be ready, as I leave for
Germany in a month and would like to have the tape by that time.

2.)  I've been trying to print the "Pituitary Kid" cartoon which was
discussed some time ago.  I got it from the ftp site, but have had trouble
printing it.  Ideas?

3.)  I second the idea to add Heavy D to the group, thereby lending the
slightest shred of credibility to those using the appelation "boyz" on this
list.

Thanks in advance for the replies...

[regarding the gold MP CD]

&gt;The real reason I bought it is because I noticed that there is a typo on the
&gt;CD.  Track 2 is "RED BARCHETTE";  however, everywhere else it is spelled
&gt;correctly.  I figured that would add some collector value to it.

I bought this CD, too, and saw the "RED BARCHETTE" error.  I called Mobile
Fidelity Sound Labs via their 1-800-423-5759 number and talked with a
customer service person about the misprint.  I she claimed that only "About
100" of the _Moving Pictures_ CD's had been printed with the error, and
we would have to wait and see if it would become a collector's item.
I'm beginning to doubt, however, that only 100 of the discs are like this.
It seems that if people all over the country are getting them, then there
have to be more than 100.

I commented to the lady that they should release more Rush albums on Ultradisc,
such as _2112_, but she said it would most likely be a while before another
Rush album was done, because they tried not to do multiple albums from one
band at once.

Their newest catalog tells you everything you want to know about the company,
and can be ordered for free from the company.  If you do decide to order
_Moving Pictures_ directly from the company, I'd check your local CD stores
first, as they may be able to get it for $2 or $3 cheaper and several days
faster.

Jacob's Ladder, especially live, gives me chills when I hear it. I just have to
lean back and listen, no matter where I am. Everytime I see thunderstorms

Subject: Correction&CoS suggestion

First of all I want to say thanks to Dan(youknowwhoyouare)for correcting me
about WKTI(which is Top-40'OUCH') never the less it was still good to hear 2112
Another thing is maybr a good way to solve this Juno thang is to contact those
people who decide who get's the award(being from the U.S. I'm assuming it's peo
ple)  and ask for info.  I just had a great idea.  I know that you can go to th
e libary and look up past winneres of Grammy's(can't you????).  If all you
nort of the border look up past winners of Junos it might shed some light on
the subject(Just a suggestion).
Another idea about this CoS delima is that I belive that Rush might have played
shows in only big cities;  Chi. StL. Minn.  Det.  and so on.  So if you find
out where the big names of the time played back then you might be able to call
and see if they kept or still keep logs of past performences.
Thanks for your time,  Matt"HP"Davis

Hi fellow Rushians,
A few issues back someone said they were transcribing the transmissions
at the end of Countdown.  Rush-mgr suggested checking at some other
computer for the date and transcription.  I am pretty sure that the
first shuttle mission ever had Young and Crippen as pilots.  Hopefully
that will help you out.
Speaking of Countdown, I think it is a great song, my second favorite
on Signals after Analog Kid.  I especially like the line..."the magic
day when super science mingles with the bright stuff of dreams..."
Kind of makes me get all warm and tingly inside!  I haven't ever seen
much discussion about it though.  Well, enough for today.

Subject: Re: What about Jacob's Ladder?

   I like that song a lot, too. The music fits the lyrics *so* well. I
love the accent at 1:50 because it's not on "one". And the way Neil
differentiates the time starting at 3:21. In fact, I think the sound of
PeW is my favorite of all the albums because it's so up-front and not
perfectly EQ'd. When the word "rush" is mentioned in any context, I
instantly see the image of the PeW cover. (The nipped-out model showing
her underwear *might* have something to do with it, I dunno.:)

	If I'm not mistaken, Paul McCartney and Wings' 'Rockestra(sp?)

Instrumental the year Rush's 'YYZ' was a contender.  It was quite some

Grammy's, Oscars, etc.  for the previous year, for that year ('81?).

Subject: Still v. Cannot, Neil v. Squeeze, Gedster v. Dylan/Springsteen!

Regarding the "Still" vs. "Cannot" issue..... I think  they are POLAR
opposites and not at all compatible.

Case 1. "If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice".
Here  you have chosen "not to decide".  This means you have weighed the
choices and decided there is either no way or no desire to choose
between being God-fearin' and being an atheist.  This is essentially
the definition of agnosticism, i.e. "I'm not really sure if there is a
God or not".  Neil is IMHO saying "it's a valid position ('choice')to
say that you are agnostic".

Case 2. "If you choose not to decide you cannot have made a choice".
Had this been the lyric (I'm personally DELIGHTED that it isn't!), I
believe it would have implied that a decision is necessary or even
mandatory.  In other words saying "hey, if you don't have the
conviction to choose either religion or atheism, then you'd better get
on with making that choice.  Don't fool yourself into believing that
you have a position!".

Personally (and I am NOT in favor of restarting the humongous religion
debate..... please?) I think most people who call themselves agnostics
are really atheists conditioned since childhood to be afraid of rotting
in hell.  On the other hand, if you ARE a TRUE agnostic, I really have
to admire you...... it's hard to be TRULY on the fence with this issue,
keeping an open mind to both sides of the argument.  And finally on
this topic (please, please no flames), I think Neil's purpose in
writing Freewill was only to get people to QUESTION that which had been
spoon fed to them since birth..... after all, if you have had a
religious upbringing, you would first have to question your beliefs
(agnosticism) before being able to commit one way or the other!  As far
as I am concerned, anyone with strong religious beliefs who never
questioned themself is not really entitled to 'strong' belief!!!  In
other words (much better ones, IMHO) "If you choose not to decide you
STILL HAVE made a choice."!!!!!

To: Robert Miner (most definitely NOT a flame!)
You are correct in saying Neil doesn't give a lot of 'portrait' detail,
and Squeeze does (did?).  I personally feel this is the greatness of
Rush's music.... we are free to interpret his PHILOSOPHY in a way which
suits us and our world view.  There are many lyricists who can paint a
picture well, notably Springsteen and Dylan.  Are they artists that I
would spend this much time thinking/typing about? Absolutely not!  Let
us not underrate the value of Neil as one of our century's greatest
(few?) existential philosophers.  While Neil's lyrics are far from the
ONLY great part of Rush, I think many on TNMS would agree that lyrics
are the ONLY great thing about Springsteen and Dylan.  This is NOT
meant to insult S & D fans, but I would guess (Hey, Dan, how about a
poll?) that MOST Rush fans would rate S&D fairly LOW on their list of faves!!!

Actually, a very odd thought just struck me.... these two guys IMHO
have BAD voices.  So do many other singers that I really dislike.  Yet,
Geddy's was probably the most complained about voice in Rock and Roll
(Why don't you like Rush?, etc.) and I absolutely delight in his early
screeching(!).  How do I justify disliking these other guys so much?
CONVICTION.  Geddy always has had conviction about what he sings.  In
fact I think the biggest problem with Presto is that Geddy tried so
hard NOT to sing badly.  It came off lacking conviction!!

Sorry for the long post, but boy do I feel better!!

Subject: Neil's Details

I don't know who this Bob Miner character is, but I think his
"observation" that Neil Peart doesn't use details effectively is
ridiculous.  [See post of a couple of days ago.]  Not only Neil's lyrics
effectively communicate complex and even innovative ideas, they often do
so with a startling economy of language  -- including little facts and
observations that refute the aforementioned's unintelligible criticism.

I don't know which Rush this Miner fellah has been listening to, but maybe
he's been spending too much time around Texas coal to distinguish
meaningful shades of gray.

Hello again, fellow Rush heads...

Has anyone heard of Ged, Neil or Alex making personal appearances?  If not, this
story may be of interest (especially to my fellow Baldwinite, Eric Alex Liebman)
When I was in 6th grade (84-85), they called all of the drummers in the school
district to the High School - all of the elementary schools, the Jr. High and
High School had their drummers go to a "drum show", given by none other than
Neil Peart!  My friend who was telling me this didn't remember much of the
show, except that Neil was trying to show them how to play melodically and not
rhythmically.
I just found out about this over Spring Break (yes, Spring Break in February),
and I didn't go because at that point I only played piano and trumpet.  My
friend remembers that he heard some Rush a few years later and then realized
just who Neil was.
Just wondering if anyone else has heard of the guys doing anything like this.

Re:  Paul M's comparison of T.S. Eliot and Neil Peart.  On Jim Ladd's Innerview
show with Neil after Grace Under Pressure, Neil mentions Eliot as an example
of someone whose style he would like to emulate.  I think he mentioned
"Red Lenses" in particular.  I remember Neil saying something to the effect
of that when he read Eliot's poems, he found himself struck by a lot of 
meaningless images which left him saying, "Gee, I must be stupid!"  After 
finishing such a poem, however, he said that something beautiful, 
indescribable had formed in his mind which was somehow the product of all 
those images.  So, Paul, I think you are on target in mentioning "Prufock."  
Another poem which sounds suspiciously like the kind of writing Peart 
described to Jim Ladd is "The Waste Land."  Talk about lots of images which 
leave you feeling stupid!

Subject: Buddy Rich Video Tapes with Neil Peart

Hello Y'all! -
Neil Peart appears on two Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship Concert videos.
I have one of the tapes so far - it's FANTASTIC!  These videos are tapes
made of various 'concerts' performed by the late Buddy Rich's band -
except with popular drummers sitting in.  Neil appears on tape numbers
three and four.  On tape three, he plays two songs with a solo in between.
He plays a four-piece version of the kit he travelled with on the
'Presto' tour.  Most of his solo is traditional Neil soloing, but with
these videos you get a great look at his impecable technique.  You can
order these tapes from:

  PHONE: 800-628-1528

Each tape is $44.95 - or both for $79.95.  I'd bet your local drum shop or
music shop carries these videos.  What really would have made these tapes
winners is if the BR Band played a Rush tune...

Subject: Frank Beard vs. Neil Peart

In the last NMS, Aaron Silverman claimed that Neil Peart has taken much of
his techinique from Frank Beard of ZZ Top, a band which has been around
"before" Rush.  WRONG!!!  First of all, any comparison of Neil Peart and
Beard is rediculous.  Beard isn't even on the same planet, drum wise, as
Mr. Peart.  ZZ Top is mostly the same rythymically, with the old two and
four on the snare and eight notes on the hi-hat.  Put that up against
Rush songs and you have quite a joke!  Secondly, Neil Peart has mentioned
his primary influences on numerous occasions in interviews.  They include
Gene Krupa, Keith Moon, Michael Giles, and Bill Bruford to name a few.  If
you know these drummers, you'll certainly agree that they are not straight
ahead, simplistic players.  Furthermore, Mr. Peart has made it clear that
he does not subscribe to the belief that "less is more", which is generally
Frank Beard's approach.  Thus, it is entirely foolish to claim that Neil
Peart has gotten many of his ideas from Frank Beard.

Count me in as a major fan of Jacobs Ladder. love it to bits. I'm not a drummer
but after 12 years from when I first heard it, I still can't work out what
Neil's playing during the passage which follows "All at once the clouds are
parted/The light streams down in bright unbrken beams"

Subject: Rush on MTV

In regards to comments from A Moris Mays about seeing Tom Sawyer on
Headbanger's ball (and Rush and MTV in general).  I remember in the
early days of MTV seeing the Tom Sawyer video a lot.  This was back
in the days when they were primarily a rock oriented station.  Anyway,
MTV used to show concerts every Saturday night (maybe it was Friday?)
at around 11PM EST.  There used to be some GREAT bands.  As I recall
they may not have shown entire shows, as I think the segment was only
an hour long.  So, anyway, it would not be surprising if the clip they
had on Headbanger's Ball was from one of these old shows.  On a side note,
how about MTV's Rockumentary's.  Now, back then, as well as now, Rush
was certainly worthy of a Rockumentary.  But now, I wonder if MTV is
worthy of doing one, given the trendy nature of their programming.

Just a few thoughts from upstate NY.  Ignore them at will...

Subject: 	NEW RUSH FAN/ROLAND MIDI
From: john.grothman@aquila.com (John Grothman)

I know this goes back in time a bit, but I still find it exciting...

There has been some recent discussion about why most Rush fans are
male and I have to agree in the sense that my wife has never been
crazy about their music (I own every tape and generally just play
them in sequence to and from work - what else is rush hour for?).

Anyway, I was home alone last Saturday, and had just finished wiring
the audio from my VCR into my stereo system, so I thought I would
finally listened to my musical VCRs through an appropriate sound
system.  I made it all the way through the four hour Grateful Dead
Summer Solstice concert (taped off Pay-Per-View), Home Of the Brave
by Laurie Anderson and the beginning of the Anderson, Bruford,
Wakeman and Howe concert (also off of PPV) before my wife returned.

Well, I wasn't about to turn the volume down then, so I just let it
go.  To finish off the afternoon, I throw in my new copy of the Show
Of Hands video and turned up the volume a notch or two (pretty sure
that I would catch some hell, but I was fortunate this time).

And the reason for all this???  When Show Of Hands was over, my wife
came into the living room and said something that startled me,
something on the order of:

    "You know, after that, the Yes songs sure sound kind of thin. And
    Rush's lyrics are very interesting, too."

A new Rush fan is born!  And I saw it happen!!  The joy of life!!!

Ciao for now.

FLASH!!!  Just in.  A friend just stepped into my office to tell me
about a new MIDI board he had just bought, the Roland Sound Canvas.
He thinks it's great, top of the line, and all that.  But what he
really wanted to tell me was that one of the sample .MID files that
shipped with the board was YYZ.MID!!!  Way to go, Roland!  And, he
says the quality is so good, that it is hard to distinguish it from
the original recording.

Here's what I could make of the last part of _Countdown_ :

Columbia is now steering for its precise window in space for main
engine cutoff.
launch ... 2 minutes, 40 seconds, Columbia now 39 miles in
altitude, ah, 42 nautical miles downrange.
Columbia, you're looking a little hot and all your calls will be a
little early.
Young and Crippen really moving out now, velocity now reading just
6200 feet per second.
What a view! What a view!
Glad you enjoyed it.
Gee, how'd it all look.
Columbia, Houston, we have 40 seconds to LOS, configure LOS, you're
looking good for an over-the-hill, we'll see you in Madrid.
And we enjoyed the music Bob, thank ya.
Oh we enjoyed it. We just wanted to share somehing with ya.

-----

LOS means Loss Of Signal, and Columbia was about to enter a space
where mission control loses communication, and only regains it at a
station in Madrid. I think this is correct, but perhaps someone can
correct me on this.

Hi Again Everybody!

Yes, I am also a Jacob's Ladder lover.  I don't know why it is underrated,
but I do know that once in a while I forget about it and when I'm listening
to Permanent Waves and it comes on I'm really jazzed and it becomes brand
new.  And everytime I hear it, I say to myself, "This is so awesome, I can't
believe I don't listen to it everyday".  Yes, I find myself stopping to listen
to the entire thing as if I were inside the music.  I must admit, that I do
cry with the most moving emotion when I hear it. (Marathon and Losing It also
have the same effect on me).  I'm usually alone when I hear these, because I
tend to get emotional and intense, but once in a while my friend and fellow
musician and fellow Rush fan listen to it together and wow, the effects are
doubled when shared with another lover!  Okay, okay, see how I get?  Thanks
for listening!!

	Well, I am sure that most of you know, but here goes anyway..
(This info was requested in NMS # 634, when the mgr asked us to
write in if we knew the answer).  In   "Red Sector A", there is a
quote attributed to the national midnight star.. "Says the

Subject: The COS Tour

Here's what we know about the COS tour:

They toured between June '75 and March '76 (I would guess most likely in the
fall of '75).
40 shows were played.
The tour lasted 3 and a half months.
It was mostly in the midwest U.S.

I have gone through the Rush tour dates listing, and here are some possible
places they could have played on that tour (based on where they played before
and after this tour):

Agora Ballroom. Cleveland/Columbus, OH
Michigan Palace. Detroit, MI
Aragon Ballroom. Chicago, IL
Soldier & Sailor Auditorium. Kansas City, MO
Akron Civic Theater. Cleveland, OH
Ambassador Theater. St. Louis, MO

I would think the best idea would be for people who live in/around these areas
to check the local libraries for their newspapers around this time, and see if
they can find a concert review for a show. Or better yet, call up those places
and see if they kept records of who played there. I know this is tough to do
since places have a way of changing names/ownership or being demolished (like
the Palace was). So dust off that microfilm... :)
