Subject: Giving Thanks.

Hi all,

I know that Thanksgiving is an American holiday so I ask all of the list
members from other countries to indulge me.

What am I giving thanks for this year?  Well, a lot of things.

#1.  That all of the supposed "Mainstream Media" outlets just don't get
it.

Think about it.  Would Rush still be Rush if we had to share them with
the closed minded, monosyllabic masses.  These are the same idiots who
gave Milli Vanilli a grammy.  Do we want these people endorsing Rush.
If Rush is the "thinking persons" band then we must be the thinking
people.

Hell, I've actually gotten several people to make DS their first Rush
album.  Can you hear minds expanding.

#2.  That the rumblings out of the Rush camp point towards a positive
future for the boys.

I will not mention any of the stuff that has gone on.  We all know that
times have been hard recently.  But Ged and Alex seem to be saying that
Neil will eventually come up for air, and that when he does they will be
there and ready to get on with the business of being Rush.  Hopefully so
will Neil.

#3.  That DS, and to a lesser extent Victor will be getting me my Rush
fix until new a studio album comes out.

One of my other favorites Peter Gabriel hasn't put out a new album since
before Roll the Bones, and he doesn't have an excuse.  So, I'm getting
used to waiting.  (Pardon the pun.)

#4.  My new PRS guitar looks just like Alex's main ax!

OK, this one is purely personal.  But, I just had to brag after all I
spent the money.

That's all I have to say, I'm curious what you guys and gals have to
say.

Peace.

JT

I was watching "Behind the Menu", a spoof of VH1's Behind the Music,
promoting the new South Park Chef Aid CD.  They're 'interviewing' a
recording engineer who's wearing a shirt with the "star man" on it. 
Thought it was neat.

Actually, the original name is "The Pink Floyd."  Or did you mean that? 
Your grammar is confusing.  Oh, well. Neil knew what he meant.

Subject: Rush Chart Update

Proving that they're either better loved or promoted in their homeland,
Rush's Different Stages debuted at #12 on the Canadian Album Charts.

In its 2nd week on the U.S. Album Charts, Different Stages fell from #35 to
#97.

For The Spirit of Radio (DS Live Cut) single, it moved back up to #28 on
the Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart after falling to #34 last week.  Two weeks
ago it was at #27.  It has been on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 5
weeks now.

A few clarifications to others' recent postings:
	- Different Stages has not been awarded a Gold album yet.
	- Also neither Retrospective I nor II has gone Gold yet.
	- Rush is currently the #4 Group for the most Gold albums.
	- They follow #1: the Beatles, #2: the Rolling Stones, #3: Kiss
	- Rush has been back and forth with Kiss for the #3 spot during the 90s

Subject: The Rhythm Method and tinker toys

I really like Neil Peart's drum solo...not only does it
showcase his talent as a drummer, but it is
a nice musical composition in itself.  Why do they
keep it? maybe they like it...maybe Peart likes doing
it...anyway, I didn't see anyone complaining about it at the
concerts...in fact, i quite enjoyed it! 

PS...if anyone wants some huge tinker toys...there is
a furniture store here in Wilmington that sells some giant
ones....for childrens' bedrooms

I think Dan Snietson (the reviewer that gave DS a C+ is
a really talented person, this is why he is a great critic.
I'd like to hear him play a "happenin" drum solo.  And his
use of words such a "masturbatory masterpieces" show his
skill as a writer too....what a guy! He probably thinks the 
Cherry Poppin Daddy's are destined for greatness and writes
this crap he call a critique while he listens to Poison's greatest
hits.

John wrote re. Remastered Rush CDs.

I purchased my copy of AFTK on CD prior to the release of the Remasters.
During the final
chords of CYGNUS on my copy, an audible bump very like vinyl player 'wobble'
is evident 'til fade-out. Can you tell me whether this occurs on the 'proper'
recording?
I have the suspicion I may have purchased one of those infamous 'digital
recording of a vinyl player' copies which I have heard were prevalent in the
early days of CD.
I'd appreciate any input.
Cheers, Cyg

Subject: Drum Solo

Another view on Neil's drum solo on DS and other observations....

Greg actually said that the Rhythm Method would be the most skipped
song.....I agree. While I looked forward to hearing the solo on the first
time I played the disc is not something I will play every time the disc gets
spun....

I think the reason for this is that I believe that drum solos are an
integral part of a live concert, but should be left there. Part of the solo
is to actually SEE the player and be able to appreciate the skills that go
into making the sounds. 

One of the best I ever saw was at Wembley on the RTB tour. I was side on to
the band, in between Geddy and Alex and Neil (it was a late ticket
purchase). Watching Neil from high up and to the side made the solo really
come alive.

In fact I've found myself doing a double skip and going from Resist straight
to Natural Science (Leave That Thing Alone doesn't do a lot for me either)

The rest of the album is pretty damned good.....I agree with whoever
commented that that Counterparts tour stuff isn't as "in your face" as the
rest of the set. Its nice to have in there though, especially (The) Analogue
Kid.

Favorite tracks have to be Dreamline, Natural Science & Driven and the stuff
form Hammersmith is awesome ; Bastille Day, Anthem, Something for Nothing &
Cygnus are "tingle moments" from when I was a kid......Bytor is in retreat
as I write here at work

Just as an aside I paid £20 + £1 p&p from www.gft-cyclops.co.uk thanks to a
tip from some one on the list. Disc arrived on Saturday AM (two days before
release date) along with a remastered ATWAS (£8.50)

Bezza.

Subject: Remasters

Good day, and welcome to my post...

Someone asked 'Should I buy the remasters?'. 
I (and several others answer) YES!!!

The remasters sound a heck of a lot better, especially Caress of Steel. 
And to my ears the synth-heavy albums have the guitar brought up a 
little more. One can hear the things that Alex is doing on Signals, 
Grace Under Pressure, and Power Windows better than before.

Now, a suggestion which could save you some money...
Some retailers will exchange a CD if it is 'broken' or 'skips' (The Wall 
in the eastern US immediately comes to mind. Other parts of the US could 
try Camelot Music [which owns The Wall]). Sometimes they require a 
sticker or a receipt, but if the customer bitches and whines enough, the 
customer will get his/her way. So bring a few of the old CD's back to 
the store and try to do this. You got nothing to lose!

FYI, I am not posting this to get my former employers any extra 
business. I just know it's a good way to take advantage of them. Do your 
actual CD shopping elsewhere.

Take Off, Eh!!!

Normally, you can expect Rolling Stone to offer reviews about a month
after the release of an album...

As for the Entertainment Weekly review, all I can say is....
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"  I'd really like to read some of this guy's reviews
of other bands, just to see if his head ever comes OUT of his ass.

Happy Thanksgiving to all the US listers.

Subject: Billboard: Rush drops to #97 in 2nd Week

>...Ouch!

Rush debuted in Billboard last week at #35, then immediately dropped 62
notches to #97 in only its second week!

Bruce Springsteen fared no better. He entered last week at #27 but then
dropped this week to #98 - one below Rush.

If one removed all rap artists, female pop divas, and Garth Brooks, Rush
would, however, be close to the number one slot.

Let's face it. Commercially in the U.S., Rush is history! Number 35 is
their lowest peak in over 20 years. More than two weeks after the DS
release, and the only album reviews we can come with NATIONALLY are two
from newspapers and Entertainment Weekly!!!

 We are now TRULY fans of a "cult band".

concerts, nothing!!  and nothing else ever happens here (whoo, the stones
on feb 17...), the only conventions are the home shows.  nothng else, no
car shows, good concerts, and only 1 store where you MIGHT find a Rush

comes, tell them you never recieved the cd's and you're not going to pay.
 i'm not guaranteeing this will work, i haven't tried it (my friends do

Subject: vh1 drum solo thingy

ok, i don't remember when it was, but i was flipping through the channels
and saw soe drumer doing a drum solo on vh1.  he looked like either Neil
or John Bonham, and was doing one hell of a job playing this really
amazing solo all over the place!  it went on for a few minutes (it was
really late) and i decided to keep changing stations.  the reason i
coudn't tell who it was is because it was definitely a tape from a 70's
show (quality is like "song remains the same," if you haven't seen it,
see it!) and we all know both Neil and John had long hair and mustaches
in that era, so it made them look that much more alike.  

can anyone help me out with what this might be from?

Subject: Different Stages, what else?

OK, I've been reading all your comments about DS and now its
my turn... First of all, I don't think we should be asking for
"negative" reviews, just honest ones. So I am going to try to
be objective and honest here. Overall, I think DS is very good.
The greatest live CD ever? I don't know. I really love ESL,
and Metallica's Live Shit (also a triple CD).

I wasn't looking forward to another live version of 2112, but
after hearing it, I was glad that it was included. I didn't even
notice the key change. I had to get my bass and play along to
figure out that it was played a full step lower. I'm sure they
wouldn't have done that unless they had to. What puzzles me is
that they played 2112 in that lower key so Geddy could sing it,
but he nailed the high "each if us, a cell of awareness..." part
in Freewill. All the songs from Presto and Roll the Bones sound
much better on DS. I love how the heavy guitar comes in on Bravado
at the line "And if the music stops..." Much better than the studio
version. I love how Natural Science sounds. The repeated "Wheels
within wheels..." verse sounds good. It fits well. I remember
noticing that when I saw the T4E show. No one else in my party
noticed it.  But they took out the "Art as expression..." verse
and Alex's solo! They did a similar thing with The Camera Eye
once. They cut out a big chunk in the middle and got it down to
about 5 or 6 minutes. I wonder why they left out Alex's band
introduction during the extended jam on CTTH? I heard a bit of
guitar overdubs. On Driven, when the guitar and drums come in
after the bass solo, you came clearly hear the high lead part
and the rhythm part. That was not there when I saw the T4E show,
and Alex can't possibly play both parts at once. I also noticed
a few small mistakes by Alex, probably because he wasn't there
in the studio to say "Hey! I fucked up there! we can't use that!"
But I think that's what we all wanted: an unpolished true
representation of a Rush concert.

The Hammersmith disk is good. Aside from the 4 songs from AFTK,
which is about 1/3 of the disk, it sounds like ATWAS part 2 to me,
except the sound quality is much better. I would rather have heard
a set from the Hem tour. That would be about half way between ATWAS
and ESL. Better still, I would have loved to have more stuff from
the Counterparts and T4E tapes, such as The Pass (I can't believe
they left this off), Half the World, Cold Fire (with that hilarious
country intro), Double Agent, etc.

I like the packaging of DS. The first thing a did was put CDs 1 & 2
in a double jewel case, mostly to protect the cardboard package from
travel damage. I remember hearing that the cover was going to be 3
sets of tinkertoys in different stages of development. I guess that 
was just a rumor. I think that the monolith tinkertoy with the crowd
would have been a better cover. When you see that picture, you
immediately know its a live CD. I loved all the pictures! The pics
of Alex with the HUGE sideburns are hilarious! I assumed that the
turtles where a reference to the Counterparts album. I didn't try
to put any deep meaning to them.  I cracked up when I saw Geddy
scalping tickets on the Hammersmith sleeve! They should have put 
Neil zooming by on his bike. I wonder if that picture was taken in 
1978 and the boys were added in, or if it was taken recently. I 
like the dedication to Jackie & Selena. Didn't we all expect this?
I sure did.

I hope that Rush does something different on their next tour. (I
am certain that there will be one!) I'd love to hear some different
or older stuff such as Anthem, Cygnus X-1, the Camera Eye, etc.

I just got the new Metallica "Garage, Inc" and it came with sort of
a history of Metallica booklet. There are a couple of Rush references
in there. When I finish reading it I'll post the Rush references.

Later dudes,
Chris

In response to all those who have been complaining about the boys
performing their songs differently on DS than on the studio versions.
Isn't that the point of a live performance?  If you want to hear the
songs the same as the studio versions why by a live version?  Just an
opinion.

Subject: Different Stages Commercial

Hi fellow Rushians,
	On Thanksgiving I was watching Rock & Roll's 100 Greatest Artists on
VH-1. Rush wasn't on it though. I expected that to happen. To many
people are constantly ignoring them. Rush doesn't get the credit that
they deserve. 
	Anyway, during that whole 4 hr. marathon, a was watching and I saw the
commercial for Different Stages. It looked cool. It had some clips from
of the "A Farewell To Kings" videos and some clips from the "test For
Echo" tour. But, I wasn't taping it. If I had I would've sent it to the
rush-mgr.

Subject: Alex underrated - I think not!

I am sitting here listening to the bass solo in SDT on DS (actually
listening to what Alex is doing in the background) and I started thinking
about how people keep saying that Alex is underrated as a guitarist.  I am
not sure this is totally true.  

I will agree with him being underrated when it comes to recognition from
the general masses.  That's probably true for two reasons.  First, being in
Rush, he just doesn't have the exposure and fan base that these other
guitarists like EVH, SRV, EC, Hendrix, Jimmy Page, etc have had.  Second,
if we look at his style of playing since MP (and probably even before),
Alex operates alot more in the "atmosphere" so to speak than your typical
Rock guitar god, opting for more ethereal effects, textures and subtle
nuance rather than straight in your face riff based playing in many
instances.  Such a style places alot more burden on the listener to really
digest it and figure out that what is going on is really hard to do.  So
for the songs that already garner a fair amount of airplay, the skill level
is lost on those people who listen just for the sake of listening to a nice
melody, rather than listening to hear the nuance as I am sure many of us do. 

But I will argue that within the music industry and those in the know, Alex
is highly respected and well recognized as being a top guitarist.  For one,
I was really surprised when several years back, he was inducted into Guitar
magazine's Hall of Fame of all-time best guitarists, even though there were
many other supposedly more popular guitarists out there who had yet to
garner such distinction.  It was at this point that I realized that he
really is not as underrated as I originally thought - at least within the
music industry.
I also think that Alex's demand to appear on projects outside of Rush
(Merry Axemas is just one example) also serves to demonstrate this point.

BTW, if anyone is interested in listening to a guitarist whose skill level
I believe to be the best out all that I have ever heard, take a listen to
Al DiMeola (the songs Mediterranean Sundance & Race With Devil on Spanish
Highway would be a good place to start).  The guy is simply amazing.  While
most rock guitarists get their speed from hammer-on and pull-off and
tapping techniques, this guy reaches the same level of speed but by picking
every note!!

Subject: DS at # 14 in Brasil!!

Rush Fans,

Greetings from Brasil. This is my first post , after reading some posts 
on DS' debut on the American charts I thought this would be kinda 
of interesting to post.

We don't have a major national album charts here in Brasil, but one of 
the largest CD store( with sores around the country ) keeps a chart 
based on their sales, and what ya'know DS debut was numer 14!! Pretty 
great.

Rush has never played in Brasil, but hey, we're patient, one day they 
come...

Just wanted to let you know what's going on in this neck of the woods...

Take care all  and just Roll the Bones,

Subject: Magic moments!

Good morning everybody,

Heavily change in posting frequency. 2nd post
in a week, but only the third in 2 1/2 years.

First of all I would like to thank all the people 
who responded to my last post about traveling to 
the U.S. to see Rush. I will reply to all of you 
next week. It´s good to see that there are some
Europeans who care.

My magic moments on DS:

1. "Because we´re here" plus power ending on "Roll the bones".
They played it the same way on their last European tour
waaayyyyy back in ´92. 

2. Geddys voice going up and down at the end of 
"Resist" (3:29  "..with all the things I don´t KNOW").
I cannot explain. It´s just the way it should be sung.
There is a similar part in the chorus of "Limelight".

3. "Ooooh Chiicaaagoo" at about 2:30 in "Spirit of radio".
I think that great crowd deserved it to be mentioned.

4. The ending of "Test for Eeeechooooo".

5. There are two very special parts in "Dreamline"
(which I think is the best song on DS. I know, I know
there is "2112" and "Natural science" and I love them, so
don´t flame). At first Alex is scratching the guitar up and
down at about 2:18 just between the first "..when we are 
young" and "..wandering the face of the earth". You have to listen 
closely, because it´s very short but it´s just very nice to hear.
The second "event" is Neil´s power drumfills between
5:15-5:20.God, how can anybody be that fast!! 
I just put on the studio recording to compare
these parts and the drumfills are real additions to the live
version. By the way listen to the studio version directly after
the DS version and you know that "Roll the bones" has a very
weak sound.  

As I started writing this post I thought I should complain
about why they did not add one or two more songs 
especially when there´s room for it and about why the 
European release isn´t enhanced and that there is "something´s
wrong" with the "Analog kid" and.... But I will not!!!

Nobody (or nothing) is perfect but DS is damn close.
We have to take it as it is and I´m very happy they 
released such a beautiful piece of music. You know,
when I listen to it (especially Dreamline) I want to
scream, I want to jump around, I want to run...run straight
to Jones Beach, Long Island sit down and wait for the
next Rush concert. That´s all.

Take care all,  

Holger

Subject: Alex interviewed 11/27/98

Hi all:

Alex was interviwed last night on 97.7 Hitz FM out of St. Catherines,
Ontario.   The
interviewer at first was very interested in Neil's progress,  Alex
basically said that Rush has no plans for a new album at this time but
that Neil is slowly making progress and a decision will be made sometime
in the near future.  The interviewer seemed to push the Neil questions a
little too far because Alex eventually asked that they just talk about
Different Stages.

When asked about a new Victor project Alex stated that he is right now
renovating his home studio and that it is something he wants to do again
but still there are no definite plans to do anything.  When asked about
a video to accompany Different Stages he said that it is being worked on
as we speak and one will be released.

Subject: Dan Snierson & his Rush "Different Stages" review.

To the editors,

I'm glad to know that Mr. Snierson thinks that "The Dead" or "The Stones"
are the only bands that have a right to release albums that their fans want
to hear.  

Unfortunately, I hate to inform inform him that he is wrong.  Proven so by
the tens of thousands of fans that have bought the 3-cd set already.  

Unlike the average flash in the pan / next big thing artists that your
magazine seems to shine so favorably upon Rush's new release will quietly
go gold and most likely platinum.  All the while being ignored or put down
upon by publications such as yours. 

Mr. Snierson should have listened to the album before declaring the
versions of these songs to so "comparable" to the other live albums.  The
differences are quite obvious to even casual listeners.  I know this is
true as my thirteen year-old nephew has noticed them and he is not a fan of
the band. 

As for the mastubatory hang-up of Mr. Snierson that's his own problem.  If
his obviously limited mental faculties can't handle a song with more than 3
chords then please send the material to be reviewed to someone who will
keep the personal vendettas to themselves.

In case you haven't picked up on it by now I am offended by the criticism
that your reviewer heaped on the band.  Not because he did not like it but,
because of the personal and vindictive nature of what he said.  I don't
care that he does not like the band. (Actually... I'm grateful.)  But how
about reviewing the album instead of lamenting that their career has gone
on too long because they're not Mick or Jerry.

Just had to share a cute Rush moment....

Even though I've been a huge Rush fan for about 15 years, I rarely listen at
home due to being married to an avid non-fan (hold your divorce flames, I
have a $3k system in my car that is always loaded with the boys!)  Tonight
she was out so I had PWaves on the stereo while I was doing some
programming.  During NS I happened to turn around to see my 14 month old
daughter bobbing her head and shakin' her tush with a big smile on her face.

Ahhh....I love a new recruit

First off, I've got to tell you all my 2 year old daughter, Megan (cool name

sings "Show don't tell me...."    I was beaming!

Whoever thought the pic of the Odeon was actually taken in 78 with the boyz
posing, look closely at the snapshot on the "memorabilia" foldout, under the
"caught in the act" newspaper clipping.  There is a photo of what looks to be
Neil and Alex in front of the Odeon, and the hairstyles are obviously
different.

And a question for all you British chaps, are the "Hammersmith Odeon" and
"Hammersmith Palais" two differernt venues?  What are the root of the names
(i.e. what is an odeon/palais)?

Order directly from the publisher.

Geez...Sorry guys (& gals)...
I hadn't heard of the reformation (as it were) of QR.  You can stop

Working on the Hammersmith disk now...so far the only comment I have 
about the set: (eyes closed, sitting in my jeep alone with the stereo 
cranked in the middle of nowhere) "Wow."
What a set!!  Who-ever-in-the-hell-of-his-own-life it was at Rolling 
Stone that wrote the article is an idiot!!!  I agree with you all, he 
obviously (in his innane wisdom) didn't listen to it!!  One of the best

terrific.
Quick Rush sighting:  Look for pics of my old license plate (retired 
after the boys autographed it..pity, I didn't get to meet them, the 
plate went backstage with a paramedic buddy of mine) on the website 
sometime soon.  Nevada Plate: RUSHFAN, autographed in indelible ink @

Hi from outer southwest Portlandia, America's beer capitol.
It's green here because of the rain...try to keep that in

I'm perhaps the most hard core, unrepentant atheist you'll 
ever meet.  The exact term I used was "unbeliever," but I'd
just as soon use "nonbeliever," since I find neither to be 
offensive, and both are accurate.

> I'm a Buddhist (by philosophy, 
> not by religion) and I believe that Christ was too (read an awful lot 
> that points to this conclusion) 

Or at least that which is attributed to "Christ" by those
who wrote about him decades and centuries after the fact.
Note that I concede that a Hebrew named Jesus probably did
in fact live in Palestine during Pilate's reign, but that I 
dispute the notion that he was the son of "God."

> so what does that make me??  Neil 
> believes in what he believes...so what if it's not your patriarchal 
> deity?????

Not sure where to start.  It's common knowledge that Neil is
a secular humanist, if not an outright atheist(*).  As such, he
doesn't believe in gods or the utility of prayer in improving
the human condition.  He's a non-believer in such things, and I 
was referring specifically to the guy who offered his prayers 
on behalf of the NMS at large.  What good, exactly, would 
offering prayers to a non-believer in the utility of prayer do?

The first time I questioned some NMS'rs intent in offering their 
prayers "to Neil" months ago, I got a number of bizarre, often
hostile emails in response, as I'd expected to.  It was
interesting, though, to note how my responses to those emails
went completely unanswered except one...the prayer-offering 
defenders simply wouldn't or couldn't defend their positions.

(*)I know, Peart refers to himself as an agnostic, but he also
describes his views as atheistic.  Whatever.  Functionally,
ain't much of a difference from my perspective.
