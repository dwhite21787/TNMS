I saw Rush at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston, MA in 1978;
I think it was the "Farewell to Kings" tour. The opening
act was The Babys. I wished I'd showed up late......

Subject: The French Open and Hold Your Fire

   I wasn't aware that Geddy and Alex were big tennis fans.  I found it pretty
cool that my favorite group (well, 2/3 of it) happens to like my favorite sport.
   However, in regards to the French Open they saw during the HYF recording, I
believe that Chang won it in 1989, Wilander won it in 1988... but I am not
sure who won in 1987.  I'll probably go look it up, but in case I forget, does
anybody know who did win the French in 1987?  Whoever won, the boyz must have
had a good time to acknowledge Stade Roland Garros in the album.

   (I wonder what the head of Garros would have thought?  Maybe he/she's a
   Rush fan?  :-)

I wonder how many people realize that when Neal writes in The Pass:

     Someone set a bad example, made surrender seem alright
     the act of a noble warrior who lost the will to fight.
     Christ, what have you done?

that the word "Christ" is a noun and not an interjection.

Subject: RUSH guest jam?

I've posted to the local bulletin board and haven't gotten any response on t
this subject.  So here with my first post, I'll try.

Last semester, I caught a tune on the radio that was no Rush track that I
know, yet there was Geddy's voice and I'm not sure of the rest of the band.
Definitely in the song there was enough going on, for them to have been there.
I read a post on a board at about the same time that RUSH had jammed with
this band on their album.

Problem here is, I don't remember the group's name.  It was pretty obscure
to me.  I'd like to pick up a copy next time I'm up in Toronto.  I have
a feeling that the band was from up North.

[ I traded mail with Elvin, and we've ruled out the Gowan album w/Alex, and
  anything Geddy's done/doing w/Voivod.  He said it was new last fall, so
  this rules out "Battlescar" w/Max Webster.  Any other ideas?    :rush-mgr ]

WoW! That would have been a grrrreat show! Two super power trios on
the same bill. Too bad it never came to pass. (yep, I really dig Zebra)

On the subject of opening bands, .38 Special opened some of the shows
out west on the Permanent Waves tour. And if you really want to go back
a long way, I believe Rush opened for Manfred Mann's Earth Band and
Uriah Heep in 1974 on their first tour!

&gt;I always assumed it was quite obvious that "Brought to you by the
&gt;letter D" had to do with the fact that the CD is DDD - as in digital
&gt;recording, mixing, and mastering. Maybe I was wrong to assume this but
&gt;I think this is a good explaination.

&gt;well, good assumption, but you forget the fact that
&gt;"Brought to you by the letter D", etc, was on the _ALBUMS_ long before
&gt;CDs were around.... I think the Sesame Street explanation is the correct
&gt;one... plus, to my knowledge, Rush CDs prior to Power Windows were in
&gt;AAD; HYF, Power Windows, and Presto are in DDD, while ASOH is in ADD...

Maybe, but HYF was the first Rush production that was designed specifically
for the CD format. Neil comments on this in an interview I heard (maybe
on the Profiled! CD). They planned the album for around 50 minutes and
knew that it would be done as DDD. You will recall that the big switcheroo
to CD's from LP's occurred about 1987, when HYF came out. Anyway, the idea
that "brought to you by the letter D" = DDD sounds good to me. Maybe Neil
will answer this question via the Backstage Club (eh, Hinano !).

BTW, has anyone gotten any current newsletter from the Backstage Club??
I'm a member in good standing and I haven't heard anything from them
since Presto was released.

Cheers,
David

Subject: Anticipating new Rush albums

	I don't work at a record store, but from what I've
seen, Rush albums tend to be bought heavily during the first
day that record stores receive the new shipments.  I know that
I call the local stores over and over checking up on it and it
is usually the case that the things get postponed for different
reasons.  Anyway, I have never felt this severe anxiety to get
an album so fast with any other group.  Many of my friends feel
the need to get the new material on the first day as well.  The
record stores know this, I think, and put a sale price on them
only after a week or two has passed.  How aggravating!
	My purpose in even mentioning this stuff is related to
how much people feel about the albums as they listen to it more.
How many of us thought _Signals_ was a bad album, but after a
while of listening to it, we fell in love with it.  This may be
a result of how much anxiety we have: something along the lines of
"_Moving Pictures_ was so awesome, I can't wait to hear their next
album."  Consistently for me the albums get better the more I listen.
I have come to acknowledge the fact that at first I may not think
it is a very good album compared to the others but that in time
(maybe 10 or 20 listens) it is up there with all the rest.  Yes,
I will buy the next Rush CD the first day it arrives in Seattle,
and so will many others.

Does Billboard keep any stats on first day sales?  I'm sure Rush
has the top spot hands down.

Subject: Aimee Mann and Rush and pre-concert meetings.

	Real quick question (actually two) and a statement. During the HFY
tour, when Aimee's line was sung, a picture of her drifted across the video
screen and the image "lip-synched" (I've been waiting to use that term in a
non derogatory fashion.) to the recording. However, on the Presto tour, the
screen went completely blank. I saw the show in LA, did this happen elsewhere?
And if so, any ideas why?
	Meetings before the concerts sounds like a great idea. Somebody in LA
remember this when the boyz come to town. I'm assuming they'll be there during
the school year.

Subject: Concertgoers unite

Well, I think having a net/list concert group is a great idea, and not
unreasonable at all, considering the amount of people now reading this.
As long as we organize it in advance, we can probably do really well getting
tickets for large groups.

At any rate, I'd be happy to organize a Northeast/lower New England group,
I guess composed of New York, upper Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Vermont, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania people -- basically all who are
within a two-hour driving limit.  We could get the list together, and once
we find out the tour dates, work out multiple concert trips that suit our
schedules.  This is way ahead of us, of course, but when the time is right
it could work out really well.  E-mail is faster and more reliable than
most other methods of communication...

[ Count me in; I've got friends in Philly.  We might consider driving a
  ways if it's a Saturday show.                                :rush-mgr ]

(Oh, yeah... since my girlfriend lives in Maryland, I'd be interested in
 the "Capital Region sphere" as well.  :-)  D.C., Baltimore, even Philly
 -- any excuse to visit my gf!)

                        I guess that'll do, except for the obligatory RQ:

   Yes, the Rush Mgr got it right. I was merely trying to make a joke.
I apologize if my humor was a bit too subtle. (Sorry Ron.) I also hope
that I didn't create a false sense of euphoria in 650 people's hearts
with the possibility of unreleased songs. But anyway, carry on, carry on.

Subject: Rush on MFSL Gold CDs (oooooohhhhhh!)
Date: Thu, 7 Feb 91 10:38:28 EST

  With all due respect to the Patster, do we really care whether or not MFSL
releases a gold Rush CD?  This gold CD is an audiophile marketing gimmick,
and nothing more.  If you really want to pay $25 for a Rush CD, go right
ahead, but don't expect much more.  Unless you also dab green ink or Armor
All on your CDs!

  Unless, of course, MFSL remastered one of the analog early albums.  Then
it might be worth it.  Personally, I think Mercury or Polygram or whoever
should remaster the old disks to modern digital standards.  That's the only
real advantage to the MFSL disks.

From: Doug Grumann &lt;dougg@hpptc16.rose.hp.com&gt;

Thanks to all you Rush fans who sent me your 10 favorite albums for my poll.
Response was terrific.. I received about 90 replies!

Many of you have quite eclectic tastes in music.  I was surprised at the
sheer number of different albums nominated.. 460 in all!  That averages out
to be over 5 unique albums per person!  Yow!  Rather than listing every
single album nominated, I'll email the results file to anybody who asks for
it.  Send requests to dougg@hpptc16.hp.com.

To score the nominations, I chose a point scheme.  When an album was somebody's
first place choice, I gave it 20 points.  19 points went to people's second
place choice, 18 for third, and so on, down to 11 points for 10th place votes.
Nominations that were "in no particular order" all got 16 points each.  This
way, two people voting an album for 10th place scored roughly equal to one
person voting an album their 1st place choice.  It makes sense to me, anyways.

Now for the album list.  The "points" column is the total score for that
album.  The "#votes" column is the number of people who voted for that album.
The "times #1" column is the number of people who voted that album as their
#1 choice.

ranks the groups themselves according to the total scores of all albums
nominated.  The "#albums" column shows how many albums by that group were
nominated, and the "#votes" column shows how many votes total were received
for all albums by that group.
