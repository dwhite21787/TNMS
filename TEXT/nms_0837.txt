interested email rush-srv@syrinx.umd.edu and I can put your name in as well.

Also, in the coming weeks, I'll be setting up syrinx with its own WWW home

Subject: Cold Fire: Pretty straightforward to me

Re: all the suggestions about what the lyrics to Cold Fire mean. Some
of the ideas submitted were creative and personal, and of course
there's everything right with that--one *should* interpret and apply
lyrics personally. However, these lyrics seem pretty straightforward to
me, to wit:

- phosphorescent wave: as posted by others, this natural phenomenon is
one where you have light without heat. A cold fire. (Not to get off
track too much, but I've seen this phenomenon in breaking waves at a
Northern California beach. Having grown up in Arizona, I've also seen a
few sun dogs. Groovy, nutty stuff.)

- pawnbroker's diamond: Any light you see in a diamond is only a
reflection. A cold fire.

- look in your eyes: She's mad and insensitive as she heads for the
door. She's "cold."  Her eyes are probably shooting daggers. A cold fire.

Subject: Degrassi/ASOH debate/Necromancer live 1977

Eric, I too have heard Rush on the Canadian PBS show, Degrassi High/Junior
High - I was bored on Sunday mornings!  ANyway, around 1990, I heard both
Time Stand Still and Lock and Key during two separate episodes.  (see ASOF
for more info - BTW, anyone know when the next issue is coming out?!).

"slipshod" is not exactly what I would the productionof ASOH.  (btw, what do
you see in The Big Money that is horrible?!)  Actually, to assume that Rush
were being "funny" in the 2112 parts of the video is dead-on!  It's stated by
Geddy I believe that it was meant to be a joke (just like the radiation signs
in La Villa).  The production doesn't look "screwed up" IMHO.  He didn't break
strings on both evenings, but they used footage from the second night (white
guitar) for the joke - he used the white Signature for Tom Sawyer on the 23rd,
then the string broke, he then switched to the Black Signature.  But on the
24th he used the white Signature throughout and they cut the pieces together
for humourous purposes alone!  Alex does switch back to the white Sig on th
23rd right before "and the meek shall inherit the earth...", hence the
delay and Geddy's sute smile over to Alex's side of the stage.
As for Rush not wanting to be cute because they pride themselves on technical
marval and attention to detail, then why did they stick Alex on the end of
Chain Lightning saying "thhaaats nice" - not really because it was an integral
part of the song, but for fun (check Profiled!).

I have to agree with the rush-mgr that Alien Shore beats The Speed of Love, as
well as his comment about the uncalled for highlighting of comment about sig's.

   [ Remember keep the flames to email.  Thanks.               :rush-mgr ]

On to bigger and better things:  I am listening to 6-2-77 as we speak and a
very interesting occurance that I hadn't noticed before (since the show had
been collecting dust in my closet with the other 125 shows I have), that on
one of the only recordings of The Necromancer around, that Alex breaks a string
(probably not on his white Signature this time!), right after the line
"by-tor slays his foe...."  kind of funny!
ALso, one last note, Happy anniversary to me who saw Rush both in Albany
(last night two years ago) and Hartford (tonight two years ago) and a Hello
to Ed Kerr who informed me that the Hartford show wasn't on Dec 1.  BTW, as
listed in the Tourdates, there WAS NOT A HARTFORD SHOW ON THE 14th.!!

Subject: jones beach...

Hey all,
	Okay, I have a few things...
	First of all, (call it school loyalty, whatever),
I agree with Gregg Jaeger about the video.  Provided that
a) we ever do ANY of the stuff we're talking about and b) we
use the video as the entertainment before the actual presentation
of the award, it would seem that at the very least WE all will
enjoy it, and if we do a classy, creative enough job with it--and
put in some jokes, too--I'm sure the band will appreciate both
the effort AND the show.  I mention jokes because I was at the
Musicians of the Millenium thing at Harvard, and the guys from the
Lampoon basically went all-out making fun of the band, and they
ate it up.
	My pinion, for whatever it may be worth.
	But now another thing:  Someone posted (sorry, I don't
remember who it was) that they were offended by the lines "people
bu yythe things they need, and borrow for a little more".  Well,
correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the song say "people buy the
things they WANT, and borrow..."?  That alone tremendously changes
the meaning.  And I wonder how you could read into that and see
the fall of Communism so specifically?  Okay, we're all entitled
to get what we want from lyrics, but I always thought Rush fans
were a little less uptight, and more willing to respect opinions
and different viewpoints.  If we consider Rush an intelligent-man's
(and woman's, into which category I fall!) band, then we should
respect the way their lyrics _do_ make us think, and even argue
issues.  As for myself, specifically regarding the lyrics in question,
I always looke dat them more as the way it seems we are all pressured
to live beyond our means, buying the things we want, borrowing
(charging, whatver) that little bit extra--whatever it may be.  And
hey--who is to judge what is necessary, and what isn't?  I know my own
values; I don't judge anyone else's.  We all have different priorites.
	Anyway, I feel strongly about this, and I could probably s
say a lot more, but this is the first *real* post I have ever made, and
perhaps I should get off my soapbox.

	But, before I go, maybe I should go back to my subject
header:  Someone also requested info on obtaining the "Cold Flames"
boot from Jones Beach on June 20, 1993.  I woudl also like info
about this, since I was there, too, and one of the guys I was with
had his jacket disintegrated by a firecracker (of some sort) that someone
threw from the upper level!  So thanks in advance fdor any info...

Subject: Beezus: Moron or just stupid?

 I don't mean to toss some gasoline on the flame war that has started because
of one Beezus - er, BEEZUS's - recent commentary... The ASOH video was edited
with the help of Geddy himself, and, though it may be tough for you to
believe, the reason Alex's guitar is different in every shot is because Ged
was just having fun in the editing stage. It's the same thing as the fake
"radioactive warning" part of the same vid. It is a joke... the band does
pride itself on technical merit, true, but they do like to have a little fun
every once in a while. I personally thought the changing guitar was kind of
funny... Of course it might just be me. ;)
 Besides that, BEEZUS, myself and most of the NMS readers would really
appreciate it if you took your drivel off our mailing list. If you're gonna
flame me by the way, do it by email...

   [ Come on people, drop BEEZUS some email if you want.  Email me if you want 
     the address.  Private email wars are fine and are encouraged :-)  Just try 
     not and drag the list into it.                           :rush-mgr ]

 I suppose I should post something relevant too...
 Regarding the 20th anniversary video tribute, I want to voice mysupport for
the idea that it should be part of a presentation for them rather than an
actual gift. I think there's kind of a fine line we could fall on either side
of. It could be a really cool presentation for them but it could end up being
really tacky and maybe distasteful or offensive to tha boys. If you go
through with the idea, do be careful to keep it tasteful, and show more
thanks to the boys than worship, if you know what I mean. Otherwise best
wishes...
 One more thing: I've heard from a few different sources, including Anthem
quoted, that after this short tour, the plan is to release a live album and
_then_ to go on an extended 20th anniversary tour starting later next year,
with elaborate staging and a totally revamped setup. This has come from a few
different sources, and it's interesting that not many have noted this on the
NMS. Anyone with more info feel free to post... :)

   [ Actually there was a very recent interview with Alex in a Canadian
     magazine, I forget the title, Alex said they were thinking about taping
     as many shows as possible on this tour, with the possibility of releasing 
     a live album.  This would allow them more time to work on new material, 
     and also stage a short 20th Anniversary tour where they might do a song 
     from each album, starting in early Jan/Feb of 1995.  When I get some 
     time, I will type in the interview and send it out as a special issue.  
                                                                  :rush-mgr ]

 Liking the possibility of a live album again,

Subject: Phoenix tour 1994 & Boot

Hello fellow rushians.
	I will be seeing RUSH at Veterans Memorial Colluseum in Phoenix on Feb.
1st.  I would rather see them at Desert Sky Pavillion.  The colluseum Sucks as
far as acoustics are concerned.  Will definitely be brining ear plugs along.
Thought I had damaged an ear during the Presto tour at the colloseum cause the
show was either too loud as well as the poor acoustics in the buiding.  Any way,
I hear this is supposed to be quite the multimedia event this tour.  couldnt 
miiss that.  Does anyone out there know if Kings X will e opening for Rush?

Along a different note, just recieved the boot "Superconductor" on CD.  Not bad.
It is soundboard but I would have to recommend the boot Rush -n- Roulette 92
over Superconductor as far as sound is concerned.  Rush -n- Roulette has a very
superior sound that one does not normally find in a boot.

   [ Supposedly a DAT recording off the soundboard, it sure sounds like it!
                                                                 :rush-mgr ]

Well,  gotta go now.  Will be wearing my National Midnight Star shirt at the
Phoenix show.  Look forward to bumping into any other NMSers out there at the
show.

Subject: To the EXCEEDINGLY bitter BEEZUS

I forget exactly where I read this, but Geddy made a particularly enlightening
comment about the "A Show of Hands" video.  Something along the lines of

"...During the editing phase, we decided to have some fun, and cut about 20
segments of Alex, each with different guitars, into the end of 2112."

I hope this enlightens you all out there who think that it is merely
shoddy editing.  INCORRECT!!  Merely "fun" editing.

Also, for those of you who think that "Alien Shore" is a bad song, listen
to the bass line.  TO sum it up in the words of my roommate (an extremely
proficient bass player), "that bass line is the most deceptively simple
thing I have EVER heard.  Geddy does that to me, just to piss me off, I
know it...He'll write something that sounds easy, but is downright
IMPOSSIBLE to duplicate precisely.  I can play 90% of it, but there are some
fills in there that are just RIDICLULOUS.  And I won't even go into the
rhythmic structure of it."

In further listening, I must agree with him.

Hope this helps "widen the reality."

   [ And from non-bass players I have heard "Alien Shore - I'm going to buy a 
     bass now.."  I dig that bassline too.                          :rush-mgr ]

Well, I am not a bio major (far from it actually ;) but this 'cold fire'
phenomenon does occur in my home-country.

         ^^^^^^^^^^^
I hardly doubt that. I live in the Netherlands and I saw the light-up organisms
at a place where air-polution is one of the highest in the Netherlands so
I reckon that fresh water is not really necessary to create this really
beautiful phenomenon.

The most beautiful thing to do with it is to swim through the organisms,
it looks like you're swimming through fire, especially when you look
at someone else who is swimming through this cold fire. The organisms
appear at the coasts on warm summer-evenings when the wind comes
from the right direction and has a really ehr...spooky, almost
ghost-like effect. Hope this cleared somethings up.

NOT! NOT! NOT!
It's not like you could hit the wrong key on the word processor and
suddenly have this funny black box with a white E in the middle.
Besides, its been in every issue of their catalog since RTB came out.
You'd think a type would (eventually) get corrected wouldn't you.

Funny thing is, my personal opinion is it would cost them sales, but in
reality I think this type of thing actually generates MORE sales in this
morally bankrupt society we live in.

I personally always thought they got that rating because there was a
(shudder, shudder), rap, in there, regardless of its actual content.

Meg: You were talking about the "Rush Hour" boot (#832), said that while
it claimed to be a 1992 show, it must have been on the 1st leg since it
didn't have Cygnus X-1 in the medly. Wasn't the New Orleans show on the
2nd leg of the tour? Because when they hit New Orleans and Primus opened
and all, Cygnus was absent from /that/ medly too. (The New Orleans show
had been Feb 23 1992.)

Subject: 1812 in 2112

	The only shred I could find of the 1812 Overature in the 2112
masterpiece was about 4 minutes 10 seconds into the piece. There is
heavy Twelve string electric work and bass to accompany it and a cacephony
of drums in the background. All of this fades, and from the din arises Alex
on a very tinny six string electric. This is, I hope, where the controversy
is. Anyway. I know the 1812 VERY well as an Fighting Irishman, and a
fan of classical music as well as Rush, so don't tell me I can't tell
if that is it or not.
	Alex repeats the exact same pattern THREE times. The 1812 overture
has the that pattern repeated twice with a modulation on the third to
different chord. This modulation is missing for Rush, and I expect it was
on purpose.
	Everyone can guess as to whether it was intentional or not, but
I expect we would have to ask Geddy and Alex about that. Make your own
guess, these are just my personal findings.

Subject: Bye, all, it's been a blast . . .

Y'all,

Relocation and re-jobbing will force me to unsubscribe tomorrow, so I just
wanted to drop a line to tell everybody how much I've enjoyed the digest over
the last several months.  It's a huge kick to sit down at my desk every
morning and be able to read several pages about my favorite band.  As you all
know, it's rare enough to see anything about Rush in print as it is, and the
generosity of those out there who have taken the time to transcribe articles,
interviews, and tourbooks for the rest of us is overwhelming.  Take a bow,
all, ESPECIALLY the rush-mgr.  I hope you'll be in Pensacola, friend.  We all
owe you a beer, at least, for all your hard work and patience in putting up
with all of this!

   [ Actually I will be in Pensacola, things will be updated as soon as I get 
     the NMS Hookup thing up and running on the gopher.  And it's not all fun 
     and games running the list, there's a lot of headaches too.  Right now 
     I'm having a flamefest with a certain NMS'er, I don't care what he says, 
     I still don't like Speed of Love and I'll have a SIG if I feel like it.
                                                                :rush-mgr ]

As for parting thoughts . . . . hmm, a post from a European socialist upset
about "Heresy."  Pal, I've been in your country, I've lived in England, and
I've seen the sorry wreckage that is east Germany and Czechoslovakia  . . .
and Neil is DEAD ON RIGHT.  Socialism and particularly communism are such
utter and miserable failures, only somebody living on the U.K. dole or on an
American college faculty could possible debase themselves enough to defend
them.  Get a clue.  So much for things political.

Hey, I wish I'd seen that helpful post on phone ticket ordering before the
weekend.  I had a friend in Pensacola order mine over the phone, and he
couldn't even get a busy signal.  He finally gave up and went to a
TicketMaster outlet; we're on Geddy's side on the risers about two sections
back.  But another friend of mine, a former roommate who I INTORDUCED TO THE
BAND living in Mississippi got right through and the ungrateful little
bastard is on the SIXTH ROW!  I think I'm going to kill him.  Well, at least
I know what to do for Atlanta.

Yes, Virginia, the Columbia House "E" is a typo.

In closing, everybody have a safe and musical holiday, and a great time on
the tour-to-come.  I've enjoyed my stay in this particular Subdivision, and I
hope I can find a way down the road for another visit soon.

And now, my first (and last) Obligatory Rush Quote:
"Spirits fly on dangerous missions, imaginations on fire
 Focused high on soaring ambitions, consumed in a single desire . . . ."

Good day, all.

Subject: Re: 12/13/93 - The National Midnight Star #836

Since I am being blasted for my 1812 post, let me explain.  I have heard
the 1812 Overture, but am not that familiar with it.  My mother teaches
at a school for emotionally disturbed children.  She herself is a
classical musician, but these students care very little about anything
and very often she can't teach music at all.  Therefore, when she has
the opportunity, she tries to connect her training and knowledge of
music to something the kids can relate to better.  I was only trying to
help her.  Personally, I think being "learned" has nothing to do with it
and that you should get off your high horse and learn to shut up (sorry
rush-mgr for the flame; if he wants to continue this tirade I shall
respond for now on in email).

Thanks Dan for your helpful information.

Yes, the boys will be on that show sometime after the new year.
Does any know of a specific date yet?

Subject: ASOH controversy

     Will you people just calm down?  Who cares?  In the 2112 problem, it was
noticed that Alex broke a string before in Tom Sawyer.  As a guitarist, I
have a favorite guitar that I play live but I have a *backup* in case of
an emergency (broken string etc.)  this section of the video was filmed in
one night and Alex was changing his guitar during this time.  Ged. was
just poking fun at him while he waited for his cue.
     Also the two guitars are different (pickups) they are used to get
different sounds (in any guitar interview, it is made quite clear that
Alex is a stickler for sound) so he changes guitar for whatever sound he
requires for each tune - he has done that since the beginning, he does
that today.
	Enough of this, who cares about it, they must have liked the video
as Ged produced it and Neil wrote about it (on the back of the case) - if
they are a serious about their music as they portray themselves to be,
they would not put out a product they would be unhappy with - they wan
their fans to know what standards they have.
	Well, I've babbled on too long over this, let's put an end to this
controversy, it takes a long time to edit a 90 minute video such as they
have done, leave it alone.

Offensive? The concept of living in debt may be distasteful, but that fact that
people do it, and people *want* to do it is fact for the most part. It's not
Neil's fault.

*I* find it offensive that you assume that he's been taken in. I see the song as
*reporting* what is happening. Do aslso assume that reporters are taken in by
everything they report? Maybe it's a falacy and maybe it's not, but don't kill
the messenger.

Rush was not the only Canadian artist featured in that series. It was made in
Toronto and a number of Canadian acts let the program use their music free of
charge (according to the credits anyway). I remember hearing Rush, Gowan and FM

   Well you know, however, I have heard the 1812 Overture, but have
yet to pick it out of 2112 (yes, I've have heard 2112, too), maybe I
should listen closer, maybe I should listen again to 1812 Overture,
but either way, I resent the implication that I am some musically
illiterate bozo who shouldn't even care or does not have a clue, I
guess were not all so gifted.

  Whoa, what a revelation!  Just think, I've actually been enjoying
AS for nearly 2 months now, without realizing it sucked.  Boy do I
feel stupid.

I was reading the review by one of the folks who said that he/she
liked counterparts intrumetnally but not lyrically, mainly due to
Peart's shift in theme to love and the likes...and i pretty much
have to agree with that. Intrumentally i love counterparts, but
none of the songs get me the same as like hyf or powor anything
up till rtb, which i think the shift started. but anyhow, things
change and artists do thwat they want, but i just thought id share
my opinion. may the force be with you.

Hey
Has anybody ever seen the movie Miss Firecracker.....
Anyway it stars Holly Hunter, Mary Steenbergen, and Scott Glenn
anyway I saw this last night on Cinemax or HBO, can't remeber.

Anyway - about 1hr 15min or so into the film when Holly is doing
her tap dance number you see a shot from behind the crowd. Right smack
in the middle of the crowd in plain view is a kid wearing a HYF
tour shirt, I'd bet my last donut on it.

It's the all red T-shirt with the three balls floating on it. You only see
it once and from the back. Gee all that for a T-shirt.

Excuse me I'm going to find a life now.....
