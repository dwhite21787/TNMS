Ok, well I'm not totally caught up with the admin. stuff, but I think I've
gotted all the "unsubscribe me" messages weeded out.  If you've asked to be
taken off the list, you SHOULD NOT be seeing this mailing.  If you do, please
send me mail (again) with "Remove me" or "Unsubscribe" in the subject where
I can spot it.  I still have a list of ~100 "add me" messages to plow throgh,
but at least I won't be pissing off people by continuing to send them the NMS.

On the T-shirt idea:  I think it's great, and support it 100%, for what that's
worth.  :-)  One poster today did make a good observation (thanks, Pat) that
different people have been talking about doing it.  I hope the three of you
have been in contact with each other, and not working at odds?  Also, another
member (hi, Rob) came up with a good idea - submit gifs of the design to the
ftp site so people can see what it's going to (does, eventually) look like.
Hey, it might help sales!  :-)  If you don't have a scanner, contact me at
the admin. address and we'll get you in touch with someone who does (right,
Jimmy?).

That's all for now.  Oh, the FAQL will be coming out Real Soon Now...

Subject:      T-Shirt

I originally sent some ideas to Cheryl Crenshaw, but I'm not sure who is
actually going to go through with the project; so here they are for all to see:

1)Format like that of the National Enquirer (Red Block Font) in the upper left
    corner:  National Midnight Star
2)Subtitle (in smaller letters):  What You Believe Is What You Are
3)Price (upper right corner) = $21.12
4)Bar Code (lower left corner) = 1001001
5)Lower right hand page is "pulled back" a little bit, and says: Turn The Page
6)Possible headlines/pictures:
   a)picture of Peart (with bandanna) and Geddy: "Rock Band Plagued by Cancer"
   b)picture of boy looking thru binoculars (PW): "Boy Caught Spying on Lifeson
     Family!"
   c)Star over Water (w/o man): "Demon Worshipping Cult Vanishes Mysteriously!"
   d)Skeleton with mohawk graphic: "New Diet Tips from Professor Pratt -
     Guaranteed Weight-Loss!)
   e)"Win a Red Barchetta!  Details inside!"
   f)Signals-like graphic: "Rabid Sundogs spotted in Toronto"
   g)"Syrinx Plague Spreads Like Wildfire"  (yuk-yuk: Syrinx Plague=NMS)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Professor Pratt (skeleton) could be the "big celebrity" (page length) on
the left, with other (smaller) pictures and headlines along the right.  If this
were on the front, there could be an NMS logo and subtitle on the back.

Wuddya think?  Would that be a cool tabloid cover or what?????????????????????
   I would obviously be interested in a T-Shirt.  Please let me know if anyone
actually makes up a batch.
                                          Thanks,
                                                  Hans (HGRUENIG@UVMVM.UVM.EDU)

Hey,

with ALEX in it!!  very cool.  I'm going to buy the mag
just for the ad.

anyway...we got   Neil going ads for LUDWIG
                  Alex doing ads for PRS
what about Geddy?????????  the M.C. himself?

well he sure has given Wal some good press.  In every RTB interview
I have read he always tells the interviewer how much he likes
his HORNY RED WAL.   They should ask him to do an ad...ya think?

does anyone know of any other ads the boys have been in?????

Subject: Primus, Grammys, CA driving

I'll keep this succinct:

1) My brother (7 years younger than me) introduced me to Primus.
   I've only heard _Frizzle Fry_, but it is *great*.  I'm surprised
   no one has mentioned this, but the first song on the album
   opens with the first few bars of YYZ (just the cymbal).  It
   sounds like Primus playing in a small club somewhere.

2) I finally heard RTB the other day.  I wasn't about to buy it
   since I dislike _Presto_ so much.  Although I think RTB is a
   little better, I'm not sure I'll buy it.  All I can say is,
   while I'm glad RUSH changes direction every few albums, I hope
   I like their next phase better than this one.  I admit I should
   listen to RTB several more times though.  It's just that I'm
   not used to having to *work* to like RUSH albums.  All the
   pre-Presto albums impressed me on first listen.

   In this vein, of "Where's My Thing," "Masquarade,", and "Cliffs
   of Dover," the latter is *clearly* the superior song, both
   compositionally and in execution.  However, I could care less who
   wins the Grammy.  My not-so-humble opinion.

3) Upon reading of the near accident in CA, I thought I'd mention
   that when I attended a conference in San Francisco back in
   November, I witnessed two incredible accidents within 1/2-hour
   of getting off the plane.  I wanted to just turn the rental car
   immediately.

From: "Philip M. Simon" &lt;ps3q+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;
Subject: Rush and Queen

   First, let me say that I'm in for a T-Shirt.  Sounds like a great idea.

   I received quite a response when I asked the NMS subscribers if they
were fans of the group Queen.  I figured that at least some people would
like them as well, since I find that most tend to like music from the
same period, and Rush and Queen certainly fall into that category.
Anyway, I do not know a whole hell of a lot about Queen, in terms of
their history.  I was just starting to discover them when Freddie
Mercury died.  With the digitally remastering of their old albums, it is
relatively easy (albeit costly) to pick up one of their discs now.

    With regard to them and Rush, I do see a few similarities.  First,
the bass is pretty pronounced in terms of their respective musical
styles.  Secondly, both bands have drastically evolved, for better or
worse, over the course of the past 20 years and roughly that many
albums.  Lastly, it is an indisputable fact that both bands possess
exceptionally talented members.  As far as I can tell, that's where the
similarities end.  Rush is not nearly as sensational on stage as Queen.
Not to say that the boyz don't put on one hell of a show (quite the
contrary), but Queen set a standard for the 70s shows in terms of
energy.  Furthermore, Queen's members have embarked on various solo
projects, while Alex, Ged, and Neil have remained very loyal to the
development of Rush.

    That's about all.  I wonder what will happen to Queen now.  I heard
that they were in the process of putting out another album when Freddie
died.  Anyone out there heard anything?

In order to allow everyone to see what the NMS T-Shirt is going to look like,
has anyone thought of digitizing the final product and saving it out as a .GIF
and having it available at the ftp site?  I think it would be a good idea to
allow people to see what they are going to be getting, or once the artwork gets
kicking, maybe a few examples in .GIF format made available will help decide
what should go on the shirt... just some ideas  :)

Subject: concert, t-shirts, and info needed about summer dates

Just got back from the concert in Vancouver, it was awesome!!!!!
I'd like to describe the bits I liked best but that seems to be most
of it, but I must mention the lighting for "Where's My Thing?" (goes
with the song well) and Alex's fooling around during the non-guitar
parts of "Roll the Bones". Neil's "skull" cap was a nice touch.
As I floated out on an adrenalin high, someone behind me said he thought
Geddy was lip-synching. Completely ridiculous, especially since he
screwed up the lyrics to "Dreamline" but recovered. Some people just
outside the Coliseum were selling cheap Rush shirts - ordinary typeface
and picture taken from the tour publicity info. If those people aren't
being penalized, I hardly think they'll care about us having shirts made
for ourselves (not for profit) with some careful Rush references.

Count me in for the shirts. I like all the ideas so far, especially
Doug White's ideas yesterday for working non-copyright Rush stuff
into the shirt. All papers have some sort of name banner, this could
be the star with "National Midnight Star" around it, with some tabloid
press mottos : "It's True" and "Anything Can Happen". Maybe even some
fuzzy, could-be-anything-or-anyone photos? And here's some more headline
ideas :
    Riverboat Gangster Bet Life on Spin of Wheel
    Mystery Driver Escapes Police Trap
    Elvis Sighted Working Security at Omaha Rush Concert
              (I couldn't resist)

Dream concert date : August 6 in Victoria B.C. (in the open air so
                              we can see the Perseid meteor shower)

I'm thinking of going to California for a short vacation sometime this
summer, so could someone there please keep me posted about any Rush
concert dates? I heard something about June in L.A. which sounds good.
It's been less than a day, but already I can't wait to see them again...

To whomever asked about whatever Ged sings in La Villa:
It's in German, not French. On Exit Stage...Left, it says

Father's gonna buy you socks,
Baby's going to have red cheeks.
Enough said"

Make what you want of it.

Also, again I am asking anyone who has a good boot of the RTB
concert to email me at the above address!!!!
I remember seeing posts from people saying they had them, but I've
had no replies. I know you're out there!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!

Ya know - I've kinda noticed that there have been at least 3 addresses to

I'd like a shirt, btw, but I'd feel more comfortable about the whole

Subject: Primus sucks!

Well someone asked for the opinions of West-coasters on this matter, so:

I've been following Primus since they were playing frat parties here
in the Bay Area.  If you get the chance, see them in a club since the
reserved seating in an arena is not condusive to moshing.  It's great
to see them getting some national recognition by opening for Rush, I
just hope that success doesn't ruin them, as it seems to do with a
lot of bands.  If you are wondering which Primus album to buy, I'd
recommend "Frizzle Fry" -- although "Suck on This" has a cool cover of
the beginning of "YYZ."

One other thing:  What was the first ever Rush concert all of you have
attended?  Mine was at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, B.C. on the
Moving Pictures tour.

Hello all!!

I just found this mail server that send out people's lists of rare and live
recordings.  I thought some might be interested in it here.  The address is
sl291003@silver.ucs.indiana.edu and put a subject of BOOTHELP.  That'll get
you a message explaining what it is about.  The list I got has about half a
dozen people on it.  It also includes video bootlegs.

Speaking of boots, don't forget about the anonymous ftp site at brandeis.
I don't have the address on hand, but anyone interested in trading can mail
me, for trade or just the address.

Oh, one totally unrelated RUSH thing.  Do any of the Bay area folks out
there know anything about local band called THE RIGHTEOUS PREDAMENTS?  I
girl I know mentioned them, I think they may be sorta progressive in style.
If I can found out anything I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thanx all.

In the last TNMS, Stephen Kutner mentions a possible Rush
reference in the movie "Strange Brew." Well, I found one
in another film.

In the movie "A Nightmare On Elm Street," (yes, the very
first one), there's a scene near the middle where you get
an interior shot of the boyfriend character's room. Right
over his bed is a poster of the GUP album cover! I was very
surprised to see it, as a lot of the posters in movie bed-
rooms are for shitty bands....

Does anyone have a list of cities and dates that the Laser Rush show will
be going to? If anyone sees the show, see if you can get the people there
to give you a list of cities its going to. I really hope the show comes
to Denver. I heard a long time ago there was a Rush laser show, but
didn't catch it. The Floyd and Zepplin shows I have seen there (Gates
Planetarium) have been great. Rush would be wonderful.

    Hey There! Count me in for a Midnite Star shirt. Personally, I
would prefer a white 50/50 shirt. The design idea sounds good...what
would everyone think of a red star on a white shirt with the
lettering in black? This would be my preference,but it's only an
idea! See ya'll at RICHMOND!!!

   P.S. Whoever is hiding boots of the Caress Of Steel tour in a
vault somewhere...please share!

I remember seeing East Rutherford on the tour shirt when I saw the Boyz
at Madison Square Garden. Does anybody know if the show will be at the
Brendan Byrne Arena in early spring, or in Giants Stadium in late spring/
summer?

I am also looking for a boot of any RTB show. Please e-mail.

&gt; NMS readers will be glad to know that, on behalf of our entire

&gt; That'll teach 'em.

I hate these stupid magazines as much as the next guy, but they are
correct on this "award".  When I used to read the various music newsgroups,
an insult of Rush, or even a slightly critical remark, would draw billions
and billions of nasty responses from RUSH fans.  I think most of us are
very sensitive about RUSH and react violenty when they are insulted.  I
just ignore those people; they don't deserve the time of day anyway.

Subject: T-Shirts

	Here's an update on the t-shirts.  I've gotten enough responses to go
ahead and do it (I'll still take orders however).  What we need to come to an
agreement on (as someome else mentioned) is the design.  I'm open to anything
(that won't infringe upon copyrights).  My idea was the star with NMS written
around it that would resemble the pentagram (an obviously RUSH symbol that they
can't have a copywrite on - unless we put the man in front of it).  Another
idea is the tabloid one.  Which do you prefer?  Please let me know and the
majority takes it!!!  By the way - those in favour of the tabloid idea - if you
would also send some headlines you would like to see on it that would be really
great.  I know you must have a good imagination - be creative!!!  I'll post the
results of the design idea poll on Friday.  In the meantime those who haven't
written and would like the shirt (cost $7 plus about $2 shipping) let me know.
I'll get back to everone personally just before I print them up.

-Mark

P.S. For those who wrote and asked - the shirts WILL be good quality - Oneida,
Beefy T or something comprable - no cheap stuff.  I assume most people want
100% cotton - the main concern here is the shrinkage.  I can get prewash 100%
cotton that won't shrink as much.

Subject: Another T-shirt idea

Hey-

Since it appears that the back of the shiry may end up blank, how about
having a list of everyone's NAME on the back of the shirt?  I am sure
that we could fit a few hundred if not 1200.  Who knows?  Just an
idea...

Subject: T-Shirt (again)

	Sorry to post twice in the same day, but someone just wrote in with an
idea that I really like for the shirts.  If we had the NMS with the star on the
front and on the back something like this...

			NMS
		  World Tour 1992

&gt;...and then listed all the names of the members on the NMS mailing list
(instead of tour dates).

	All in favor say AY!

	AAAYYYY!!!!

Someone asked what songs had the coolest bass lines.  Although about 90% of
them are cool, YYZ and Turn the Page have to be near the top.  Just my $.02.
