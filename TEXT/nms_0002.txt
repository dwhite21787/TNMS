Re: Rush and Mr. Big
	Well, as was stated a while back, The Boyz really like Mr. Big.
	I'm not	really sure why cause their musical direction and technique
	are totally opposite but for some reason they have enjoyed touring
	with them.  Maybe they like the members personally or possibly Mr.
	Big reminds Rush of their early days.  Take your pick...
	In the 9 yrs or so I've seen Rush live, I've never seen them enjoy
	or even get remotely involved with their opening act like on this
	tour.  I don't know about you but I think the best opening act they've
	had since the Signals New World Tour was on Hold Your Fire with
	none other than Tommy Shaw (great hearing those old Styx tunes again).
	And the *ALL TIME BEST* opening act I've seen was on the Yes 90125
	Tour with Bugs Bunny cartoons on a big screen! :-).
	(As a side note, I've heard that Styx is getting back together minus
	Mr. Shaw who is with the Damn Yankees).

	BTW, can any one remember Rush's opening acts?
	I can only remember the Signals tour being John Butcher Axis (Golden
	Earring cancelled which was a bummer cause I wanted to hear
	"Twilight Zone") and Grace being Y&T (who was very good).  Can't
	remember Power Windows (must not have been that good if I can't
	remember).  Of course, Fire was T. Shaw and this one being Mr. Big.
	Thoughts on this?

	Jeez... sounds like it's better than sex :-) ....... NAAAAAA!

	but this is what I thought when I was reading this article and I
	just had to mention it).

If I remember correctly, in 1979 they had Saxon open for them in Largo,
Maryland.  A couple of years later, they had a Canadian band named "FM"
open for them.  That band had the same sort of lineup (guitar, bass/keys,
and drums), and sounded a bit like RUSH.  (Just a bit)  I've also seen MSG
open for them (LOUD), and the rest slip my mind. On the Power Windows tour,
they didn't have anybody open for them in Baltimore, MD (unless I missed
them entirely).

I know it would be too good to be true, but was that microphone I saw
sticking up out of the crowd anyone on this list?

A few quick observations as well:

1. I'm not sorry I missed Mr Big the first time around.  Sure they're
talented, but they bored the hell out of me (except for their 30 Years
cover, and the bit of Dazed & Confused that got me all excited).  Also
that one song early on that consisted mostly of scales almost got me
moving...

2. Rush was, of course, phenomenal.  I did prefer Neil's Arco solo (in
the usual order (or close)) to Expo's mixed-up one though.

3. Good to see you Ron - Let's do it again.

For those of you wondering what the h*ll went on last night/this morning,
let me apologise.  In the testing of the new Digest software, apparently
mail got sent to a wider group of the list than the test group intended.
I'm sorry (and embarassed) this happened, and let me assure you that it
shouldn't reoccur.

Subject: I want my soapbox back!

   Anybody know exactly what happened to Broon (Terry Brown)? Why he left?

P.S. if you go to a concert, go to the left side of the stage (ie, exit...stage
   left).  You may find Skip Gildersleeve (SP?).  He's the left side tech.  I 
   got
his autograph on the HYF tour.  The guy is cool.  He told me - "Man, why is it
that everybody that wants my autograph is male?  Why don't and females ask me?"
Let's take some pitty on the guy.  He keeps the show going.  Please, some female
   Rushian - ask for his autograph.

                                As my mind gets warped, so
                                        does my soapbox.

   Hey folks! It's the Alber, here again ('Said I've played this song....')
anyway, I was wondering if our fearless leader (YO! RUSHMGR!), would be so
kind, and put up a list of all the Rushians in this group (with addresses).
I'm kinda interested in finding out who we are dealing with ('We have met the
enemy, and he is us.' - Pogo).

[ This is available - just send mail to the administrative address (NOT
  this one!), and I'll zip you off a current list.               :rush-mgr ]

   A question for debate - as some of you are no doubt Dead Heads (they grow
like Kudzu - they're all over the place) - you know about tape trees, but for
those who aren't and don't know what they is - here goes:
   A tape tree is a way to insure high quality tapes for a long time.  The
master is used to make about 5-10 copies (? - depends on total number of
people), then those are distributed out, and those 1st generations are used to
make the next generation and so on.  But the difference is, that a record is
kept of who has what generation.  This way - people are assigned to be the
root(master copy), branches (1st gens), and leaves(later generations).  By
having a record of this, you can contact someone who has a better copy than
just guessing as to what generation you have.   My question is - would the
other wackos in this talk session be interested in starting a tape tree for
Rush Bootlegs?

   Another question is - The Dead are cool about taping their concerts.  Are
Rush?  Do they mind boots made, if not are we actually allowed to tape them?  I
know that at concerts, the ever popular "no sound recorders allowed" is always
heard, but Rush doesn't seem to be the kind of band to care.  I know it may not
be their choice on the matter, it's probably that of the record companies
(Mercury, Moon, Atlantic, etc.).  But...who knows.  Anyway - anybody know what
the actuall reasoning is that we cannot tape?

   Anybody know of a song called 'Dog Days' (?) that Rush did and released in
Europe?  I heard a rumor - that's all it was - that this existed.  Any idea?

                                the all EGO,
                                AlberCrombie.

"You can't get something for nothing, you can't have freedom for free..."

BTW : what does the B in OBRQ stand for.  I may have the letters out of place.
I know that the rest is 'Ole Rush Quote'.

Subdivisions mistake:

Oooops.  I've got the tape, but no jacket, so I got the lyrics from
listening to the song a good zillion times or so.  Well, after
listening to it again, I can hear "the restless dreams of youth"
instead of the "the restless scream anew".

Makes more sense now, too.

Still an awesome song.

Well, I just finished Rushfest - I listened to all the albums
in order, one after another.  Took three evenings.  Awesome way to
listen to their music, since you can feel almost two decades of
growth within a short 10 hours.

Know what's neat?  I have a friend at Berkeley who's a classics major
and knows little of Rush.  Every day or so I send her the lyrics to
a song.  All of a sudden, she's a Rush fan, and has never even heard
the music!  Her favorite is Hemispheres - she's an ancient Greek literature
major, which explains her fascination with the song - and luckily she DOES
own that one album.  If you're gonna own one, I think that's the one to
own.

And then go out and buy the rest.

Subject: RUSH on tour

I was talking to a friend of mine last night and he said, according to
_Rolling Stones_ magazine, RUSH will be touring during the summer on
and off.  I thought their tour ended today!  Is this normal for most
bands on tour, to go around the country several times?  Is this normal
for a RUSH tour?  I figured they would, at least, finish the American
tour now so they could spend the summer with their families, which is
pretty much their custom.  Can anyone confirm a RUSH tour this summer?
Or is the tour for Europe?  If not, I definitely plan on flying up
again to see them!

With all this talk of symbolism in watches and stuff, I went back and
took a look at the picture on HYF.  I had never really looked at it
before, but lo and behold discovered some amazing things (yeah, I
know, where have _I_ been?).  Let's see if I got them
straight:

	Larry Stein mentioned the time of the clock--2112 (it has also
	  occured to me--has anyone wondered why Neil picked the
	  number "2112"?  If time-wise, it's 9:12, birthdate wise,
	  it's September 12, Neil's birthday. Sorry if this was
	  common knowledge)

	The T.V. in the window--Power Windows

	The red fire hydrant--Signals

	The shape of the window arches behind the man--Moving Pictures

	This may be going a little too far: the newspapers--Permanent
	   Waves

Am I missing anything?  I guess one could even make an argument that
the three staircases (or even the three buildings!) represent the
Boyz...I wonder what Hugh Syme would say to that!  Sorry to ramble on,
but I just saw "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" last
night.  Great art film; gross movie.  It's like watching the atrocities
(sp?) of war.  I still haven't recovered.  I think the Digest is
helping to regain my sanity!  I think I'll watch the GUP video this
weekend...

          Hi all!  I was wondering if anyone out there in Netland would be able
to me a favor...
          I am looking for Rush paraphanailia.  Specifically, bootlegs, videos,
etc.  If you aren't within driving range of Dayton, I'l be willing to pay for
the shipping and the blank tape.  If anyone out there can help me, please
e-mail me at either address below.
          Snif... The tour is over...:-(
