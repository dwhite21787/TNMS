Subject: Guten Tage vom Germany, Rush Fans

Well here we are again reading the NMS when we should be doing work, right. Ok
i'm just as guilty as everyone else. But what the hey, working night shift in
the middle of germany with a bunch of Army people (not me), I needed some
releif. Anyway, I saw in the NMS#1052 about the Cronicles CD not including "Take
off" with Bob, Doug and Geddy. I think that they missed a chance to show Geddy's
sense of humor. I remember when that song came out and only people in the North
(Upstate NY) area had heard it. I was stationed in Georgia at the time and on
leave at home (Niagara Falls). Well about 6 months later a DJ in Macon,Ga puts
on a new song and says it's from RUSH. I was thinking "great" then I
hear...Well, Gooday eh.... I knew then that this wasn't a new RUSH song, what a
damn shame.

Oh, before I forget to mention it. The other night overhere on HeadBangers Ball,
I saw for the first time " Stick it out" from CP. I had never seen it before,
great video. How many videos di they do for the CP album. I recently received
the "A show of Hands" video, wow great stuff.

   [ As far as I know, they only did videos for SIO and Nobody's Hero.
                                                                : rush-mgr ]

I would also hope that the people who start the rumors about "new albums" or
tours to stop. Its the rumor game in cyberspace and it seems that not many
people believe these rumors. Come on and lets stick to the facts.

A question for the rush.mgr, Do you know if the guys in the band read the NMS?
I'm sure that they have be curious about how their fans feel. If they have, is
there a issue that perhaps one of them made a comment in?

   [ They are aware of it, and I believe that several people in the Rush
     organization (but not the band themselves) do read it. In issue #4
     (I think) was a comment by Neil about the digest. Keep in mind he was
     referring to the endless debate at the time about "what time does Neil's
     watch say in the Presto booklet?"                          : rush-mgr ]

And one more things about the bootleg CD's in Europe. I was in a second hand CD
store over here the other day. I picked up a Bootleg, MY FIRST so don't get mad
at me anyone. It is " Rush-Live from the Electric Ladyland studio" well lets say
that the quality "SUCKS", I can't believe that people get excited about these
things. I was reading in the NMS from the rush.mgr that the NMS does not support
the "bootleg" trade, well I know why. Flush, there goes 20 bucks down the
crapper. Ok now that I have bored you...TAKE OFF EHhhhh

Hello Ron,

In NMS #1058 you ask...

My wife was an Engish teacher in a Scottish Secondary School. In the time
between the end of the exams and the end of the school term, her English
department allowed the 5th years (i.e. about 17 year olds) to opt for
"interest" classes once a week. The English teachers offered something
different and the pupils choose somthing they wanted to do. My wife did
"Music lyrics".

The idea was that the pupils would bring in a tape of a song, play it to
the class and then explain why they liked it. The idea was then to discuss
the lyrics and how they interrelated with the music. She did it the first
week with a selection of songs to give the idea. The problem was she
couldn't get the pupils to bring in their own songs. I don't know if it was
natural Scottish reticence, or adolecent embarrassment (at 17?) or what,
but weeks went past of her playing her own tapes. Janet (my wife) was
getting increasingly scunnered with the whole thing.

Finally one boy admitted to having a couple of songs with him.  he played
was Freebird by Lynyrd Skynyrd (spelling?). This took a bit of a slagging
from the rest of trhe class because of the three hour instrumental bit at
the end. (He was finally made to turn it off part way through while still
protesting, "This is really good, honest! It's the best bit..." etc.)

The second song he played (and at last we are getting to the reason for
posting this to a Rush list rather than a long.boring.pointless.anecdotes
list) was Losing it by guess who. Well, needless to say, this went down a
lot better than Freebird. Even Janet was impressed. (Usually I can only
listen to Rush on headphones, or when Janet is out of the house. :-(  )

I must admit to being impressed too. I would have thoght that the kind of
issues raised by Losing It would, at best, have only have been of marginal
interest to 17 year olds... but there you are! I'm not often right, but
obviously I was wrong again! :-)

Encouraged by this I played her Middletown Dreams - another song which (I
think) shows how a good song is more than just poetry set to music. Perhaps
you yould make use of these songs, but really it depends what you are
"counseling" them about.

Sorry, not much use to you, but it let me wander happily down memmory lane
for a while.

In response to Aaron's (Alex Zivojinovic <ASCIFRES@middlebury.edu>)
2/22/95 post...

I think the brain cells in your left and right hemisphere's (no pun... well, 
alright, pun intended) are "fillers."  Well, maybe "not completely fillers --
just parts of them."

It's amazing - to think that the Boys used to be limited to 40
minutes due to vinyl's physical constraints yet, according to Aaron,
they put "fillers" on the records.  So now that their CD's have
reached 50 minutes, I guess they've decided to right even MORE
filler material?  Get real, dude.  I'll take what Aaron calls
"fillers" any day!

Hey, we all have our RUSH favorites (and not so favorites), but to
think that entire album sides are filler material!?! Yeah..sure...

Aaron, find another forum - you're obviuosly not a "real" fan.

Sorry if this message is too hot to handle for some of y'all,

P.S. Even when they decide to "fill" an empty slot (e.g., New World Man - aka

Subject:  TNMS readers meet...

Are there others out there who can't remember the last time they actually
went ONE day without listening to 'something' by Rush?  I'm sure there are.

Anyway...
I was recently reading the Dream Theater posts, and they were talking about
having regional conventions for their readers to actually meet each other
in person.  I'm sure this may have been an idea already by rush fans, and
it probably has already happened.  But I thought it was a pretty good idea,
especially when the boyz tour again...

If anyone has done this before, or would be interested in getting something
organized for the Baltimore/DC area when Rush comes back, please post ideas
thru email directly to me....
It could be a lot of fun......

I'd suggest "New World Man," plus maybe "Scars," "The Pass," and "Cold

I know that all of those songs have some meaning to me, at any rate.

	Fellow Rushians,

This guy,who call's himself Alex Zilovinch(sp?) or whatever has got a lot
of nerve.  First, where does he get off making claims like he does, and
then not accept flames?  CAn't he support what he says?  Then to top it
off he says that La Villa, the whole 1st album, and By-Tor and the Snow
Dog to name a few are all like fillers!  What is this guy thinking?  I do
not know, maybe he likes Chronicles only or something.  I like Chronicles
too, but I also like all the other albums.  To touch on one deatil...to
degrade something as well done as La Villa Strangiato is amazing.  This
guy does not good music when he hears it.  Every instrument has a lead
somewhere, and the intonation is amazing.  Just my 2 cents worth.

In reference to Alex Zivojinovic's post about "filler" songs... sorry

but you reduce some pretty damn fine music to the status of mere
filler.   La Villa Strangiato is filler? I think not!
And about this whole marijuana thing... Lighten the fuck up!  One guy
a few days ago was willing to accept that Rush was into Satanic
worship around the time of 2112 (misinformation anyway), but was
horrified to think that the guys might have smoke a little pot...
Who cares!

Thankyou for your time :)

Well, Ron,
	First let me say that if my high school did this, I would have
gotten involved.  These songs immediatly came to mind.  _The Pass_ from
_Presto_, and _Nobody's Hero_ and _Everyday Glory_ both from _Counterparts_.
_The Pass_ is a great song to use because it deals with suicide, which is
something that a lot of teenagers I know, myself included, have all
considered.  There is a great write up on the song in the FAQ I got when
I subscribed to TNMS.  Good luck with this, sounds like a great idea.

This jibes somewhat with what Alex said in that backstage interview during
the CP tour (posted here a while back).  Didn't Alex say something about
picking up some different old material on the next tour, "we can't put
Closer to the Heart on another live album"?  That sounds like "reworked
older studio stuff" to me.  "A few USA concerts" jibes with the idea of a new
studio album to precede the live one.

I think that's a misinterpretation...

Someone asked which live song sounds significantly better live than on
the record.  The one that stands out most in my mind is "A Passage To
Bangkok."  The original is weak and almost brooding, while the live
version is powerful and energetic.  Plus those stupid chimes aren't on
the live version.  Just my $.02...

Subject: RUSH covers...

Since I've seen several posts of bands that either cover RUSH or write songs
a la RUSH style.  I figured that I would list a couple.

Here in San Antonio a band called WatchTower use to cover 2112/Overture.  These
guys did an excellent job on this.  This band was more of a progressive metal
band but their originals contained the "weird" time signatures and creativity
found in RUSH songs.

Also, Primus use to cover YYZ.  The bassist, Les Claypool (I believe), was
inspired by bassist such as Chris Squire (YES), John Entwistle (WHO), and
of course Geddy.

Primus opened for RUSH during the CP tour, I felt that this was an excellent
combination.

Subject:      Fates Warning

Hey RUSH fans,

I'm sent a post some time ago and then left for Christmas break
and didn't get all the replies sent to me.
I posted because I would liked to have known if there any Dream
Theatre /RUSH fans around.  Reading the last two month's issues I
found some, but I found a new love and I'd like to Know if there any
  Dream Theatre/RUSH/Fates Warning fans around now.

I heard of Fates from a friend and have purchased the last three LPs.
I have yet to find, other than the three of my friends, who listen to
them.
I figured since they are friends with DT that some of thier fans
must listen and since RUSH fans....  well, you get the point.
Couple things that interest me, are that their album PARALLELS
was produced by Terry Brown, and is an intense album.  The

Subject: Better live than studio

it seems i'm one of the few who actually like ESL. i consider it more of
an album of reworked songs than live because of the 'studio-like' sound.
anyway, i think that Xanadu, A Passage to Bangkok, YYZ (definitely), and
La Villa Strangiato are better sounding on ESL than their respective
studio albums. of course, ESL was the first tape of Rush's i ever owned,
so this could have something to do with it.

first post, bla bla bla

i consider myself a rush fan, though i'm only a young'n(13) and may not be
able to say "yeah, i remember back in '76 when i went to that 2112 concert".
i got interested in rush because my brother let me listen to 2112 last year.
hmm, he was 21, i was 12.....
Anyway, i'm not like other young people you may meet, as i despise greenday
and hole and those types of bands. as for rush's popularity, i believe that
it is perfect that they aren't on eMpTyV 24 hours a day or on every radio
station every 3 songs like some other bands because it means that much more
when you find another rush fan, or see a rush poster or bumper sticker, or
hear a rush song on the radio because it really makes -my- day when i find
someone saying 'wow you like rush too?' that's my view on it anyway.

some of my other interests besides RUSH:
pearl jam, peter gabriel, boingo, primus, barenaked ladies, MST3K, M:tG

	In a recent issue of Modern Drummer, Neil talks about his
experiences with each individual drummer.  If there's any particular one
you want to know about, I or the other drummers on NMS could help you.  I
doubtthat you're going to find written bios for all of them all in the
same  place.  I don't remember who all is on the disc (I can't find it for
less than $16.99, and I'm a poor college student).  Anyway, Steve Gadd
also played for Paul Simon.  (The cool cool drum intro on "50 Ways to
Leave Your Lover" comes to mind.)  I didn't realize that Simon Phillips
played for Judas Priest (??).  If he did, though, it's most definitely
not his crowning achievement.  He played on the huge Who reunion tour in
'89, and totally kicked.  Both Gadd and Phillips (and others on the disc)
are accomplished session players who have played with lots of people.

This is often a problem when demoing (supposedly) high quality

shoddy its impossible to tell the difference between two different items.

I've found MoFi gold re-issues to vary in quality between tremendously
better than the original release to modestly better.  The two Rush
MoFi CDs I have fall closer to the second half of the spectrum; I
think this is due to Rush's recording process, wherein many different
microphones, takes, tracks, etc. are mixed together.  Even the master
tapes don't have huge amounts of low-level musically important
information hiding on them (whereas a modestly miked, single pass
recording of a more acoustic piece of music would have a lot of subtle
sound-staging information, background sounds, etc. hiding onthe master
tapes...check out the MoFi reissue of Muddy Waters' "Folk Singer" for
a great example).

I can confirm your hypothesis that the difference between MoFi
recordings and the originals are often not audible with out decent
playback equipment.  I can reliably tell the difference between my old
and new copies of the Rush CDs on my current rig, but (a) it is not a
stunning difference; and (b) its pretty good equipment: Stax Lambda
Signatures electrostatic headphones fed from a Marantz CD player.

Hope this raw data is of some use to you as you try to make your
purchasing decision,

I usually don't post publicly about the the power gods from up north, but I 
was reading and noticed a fan commenting about the HYF tour when Rush, 
supposedly, had to fill in extra time due to the fact that Tommy Shaw was 
less than acceptable as an opening act.

This poster believes TS was a great opener when, in fact, I was there at the 
Houston show and TS was the biggest joke of an opening band I ever saw.  He 
played hardly ANY styx songs and resolved himself to being booed when his 
little love song ran over the 4 or 5 minute mark.  (sorry - only RUSH is 
allowed to play the long ones!!)

The boys then played an extra 30 mins and more than made up for TS disgrace.  
The guys is a lamer and it took em a while to actually accept he had any 
musical input in the Damn Yankees thing.

This is in response to ASCIFRES@middlebury.edu (Alex Zivojinovic, obviously not
his real name) commments about Rush using filler songs. And yes, this is a
flame. I'm not sending it to him directly because I want him to hear this. I'm
not quoting it back, I thought I might vomit if I had to read that absolute
garbage again. I'm sure everyone who read #1057 knows what I'm talking about.
He claims that La Villa Strangiato is just instrumental filler for Hemispheres.
What the hell is this guy smoking? "Draging out" The Camera Eye? Have you ever
really listened to these songs? I like the nice scarcastic comments too, sounds
like a Rush fan to me. Sounds more like the alternative freak that lives on my
floor trying to rip on Rush. Ok, he may be right about the first album, but the
rest of what he said wouldn't be fit to wipe my ass (if it was written on
paper, of course). Just some advice: Listen closer to the instrumental parts of
those "filler songs", listen to the bass line on "Cinderella Man" (A great
song, IMHO), and think before plaguing the NMS readers with trash like that
ever again. Thank you.

	I have to disagree: in fact, I'll go so far as to say that "Everyday
Glory" is one of my favorite tracks on the album (CD...whatever), if not my
FAVORITE! The lyrics are just wonderful (idealism is great, no?)--and
Geddy's vocalization of the second in each pair of "No matter what they
say"'s makes me think he learned something from HYF's exposure to
Aimee Mann (yes, that tone-bending  _does_ sound to me like an A.Mann-
ism): that's not a bad thing, by the way, those are my favorite moments in
the song!
	Personally, I find two songs from the MIDDLE
of the album to be far less provocative musically (and lyrically), "The
Speed of Love" and "Between Sun & Moon."
	Well "to each his/her own" as far as favorite tracks go, right?, so
no debating that--though I _do_ think I'll use this occasion to digress into a
defense of "Presto" (also mentioned by Dave), which I find to have taken
quite a beating over the past few months on the NMS.
	First of all, yes I am one of those long-time Rush fans: I still
remember hearing a just-released "2112" IN CANADA while visiting
grandma and grandpa (yes, I've got "maple" in my blood) at the tender age
of 7 or so (circ. 1976), taking a copy of the album home with my big
brother and laughing at what I thought was the Mona Lisa on the inset
liner photos (has any one else ever viewed Geddy's "2112" photo this
way?).  Of course I couldn't make heads or tails of the music at that
age, but still, that experience "lit my {Rush} fire" and began a trend
that's continued ever since, though I didn't _really_ begin to appreciate the 
boys until around PeW/MP era...I was old enough then.
	Well enough "waffling on" about that, I just wanted to share what
I regard as being an extensive exposure to the guys' music over the years,
and I have to say that as pinnacle RUSH-"defining" albums I would have to
posit both "Moving Pictures" and "Presto" as culminations, with "Presto"
solidifying the trend begun in SG and GUP: the expanded use of keyboards
and the heavily emphasized (post)production process (but without some of the
OVER-produced drawbacks of let's say, HYF.  (No, No, don't get on my
case about this one folks, HYF too is a favorite of mine--I'm just trying
to make what I think is a valid comparison.)
	It is in this sense that "Presto" really shines, and I often recommend
it (along with MP) to Rush-newcomers as perhaps one of the most thoughtful
introductions to the band.  The overall "Sound" of this album, as a
summation of the tunes' individual "sounds," really works for me.  There's
some fantastic songwriting on this album, too, which was a definite goal of
the band at that time.
	Standout tracks include: "Show Don't Tell" (it had and has been a
while since we've had such a conspicuous Geddy bass solo), "The Pass"
(great bass playing again, and the song as a overall experience: WOW!),
"Presto" (Alex's most prominent use of the acoustic in years!), "Red Tide"
(some of you may remember my last post...my pro-environmental  defense
of this very strongly pro-environmental song, despite the misguided
opinion of certain others--Ok, I'll leave it at that...don't get me started),
"Hand Over Fist" (I just LOVE Alex's guitar parts on this song and check
out Neil's really loosening up at the end), and of course I cannot neglect
"Available Light" (a gorgeous way to end the album, where I've always
sensed almost Clapton-esque fills by Alex, and again some of
Neil's best drumming in years).
	So all in all I find this album to be a real milestone for RUSH.  It
seems to me for the past X number of years or Rush has consciously
wanted to hold on to those valuable lessons learned in the recording of the
most highly produced albums (especially PeW and HYF), while at the same time
bringing back some of that more direct three-piece sound and energy of the
earlier records: I'd have to say from GUP through RTB (perhaps even
including CP), "Presto" seems to really be the most successful for me in this
vein: the perfect mixture of great songwriting, great playing, and a balanced
recording/production scheme (neither over- nor under- produced), and I
think the actual sound of the recording betrays this...I find it to be a much
warmer recording, for example, than either HYF before
it or RTB after it...
