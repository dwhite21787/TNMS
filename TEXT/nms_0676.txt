&gt;From my WAM account's Webster.app:

:a didactic person

di7dac7tic \duE-'dak-tik, de-\ adj

This seems accurate, with the deep voice shouting at Geddy to do
basically everything that he doesn't want to, maybe as a teacher
would to a "problem child."  The app had no idea what a narpet is,
but given this, my guess would be some real or made-up euphemism for
such a problem child, or more likely someone who knows just what
he/she wants out of life and will be damned if they'll let some
so-called superior stand in his/her way.  Just a thought.

Subject: MTV Unplugged

Here's a thought for all of you who have been kicking the unplugged thing
around:

     What if someone got a hold of the address for MTV and all of us loyal
     fans sent in our own letters requesting a RUSH unplugged feature (and
     perhaps le them know that we would love to see more RUSH videos).

MTV seems to respond only to what is popular, but the definition of popular
is what the people want to see & hear.  If we let MTV know that enough people
want to see and hear something in particular, then maybe they will decide that
it is a good idea to show it.

Just my 2.5 cents worth.

Subject: Goldmine

	For anyone who's interested, the best places to get boots are in
Goldmine, but it's not because of the issue itself.  In the past, Goldmine
had a "hands-off" bootleg policy (i.e. anyone who wanted to advertise could
and did).  However, about six months ago this all changed.  The advertising
section is mighty lame, and only a few dealers have CD boots listed under
"imports."  The real reason to get a copy of Goldmine now is for the record
convention listings.  This is the way to get bootleg CDs, videos, singles
LPS, etc.  Check for a show near you and go to it!  My normal convention
trips run about 2 hours one way (I come from PA, so most of the shows are
in NJ), but 4 hours of driving is well worth it for the stuff I come home
with.  So, if you have access to a car, there's no excuse.  JUST GO!

	Has anyone picked up Rush 'N' Roulette '92?  I heard that it's the
soundboard show from Oakland.  Can anyone confirm this or vouch for its
quality?  Again, eMail me privately if you've got info.

Subject: Afterimage

   My father was killed on March 04 1993 when the motorcycle he was riding
blew its front tire.  Since he was the person who introduced me to Rush
(among many other influences) and since I also found it very appropriate
(he was a very neat person), I put "Afterimage" on the memorial card insert
which is given out at the funeral service.  I also wrote part of his
eulogy, which I called "An open letter from son to father" which I won't
reprint here.  (For those who are curious, for whatever reason, I could
email a copy).  That's all.

Subject: Geddy singing Oh Canada

I know this was discussed earlier in the year, and dismissed as an
improbability, but I got to thinking . . . couldn't someone, given
the patience and technology, put together phonemes from different
songs and get some approximation of the song?  There are many songs
which have Geddy singing over a quiter music background, cf.
Rivendell, Cinderella Man, Madrigal, Ghost of a Chance (chorus),
etc., so it would be possible for the most part to grab bites of
words that don't have a drum beat or other dischordant sound.

So here's my proposal: I have the technology to put it all together,
but I would like someone else to do the phoneme analysation and
picking out of spots in songs where good examples of these phonemes
exist.  I know, from the previous discussion of "the sign of eth"
that there's members with linguistic leanings - so I'd like to hear
from you!  Email, please.

Subject:  Prophets or Profits?

I think Neil is just using this opportunity to play around and use both
meanings.  He spells it as "profits" to get the one idea across, and the
other, "prophets" is implied from the phrase, and the Simon and Garfunkel
quote.

Perhaps a preview of one of his techniques in "Red Lenses", which I must
defend.  It is one of my favorites.

Subject: Rush boxed set.......

	I've been reading the musings about the possibilities of a Rush
boxed set, pros and cons.  I personally think this would be a great idea -
Rush is coming up on 20 years as a band, and a 20 years boxed set would be
pretty fitting, I think.
	Someone mentioned that most boxed sets are released at the end of
a band's career.  Well, I think that this is only partly true.  There are
a lot of good sets, and there are a lot of really worthless sets.  I think
that boxed sets like the two Jethro Tull sets are exceptional.  I also
like the Yes box set a lot, as it has some good rarities.  However, there
are some big dogs, as far as I'm concerned.  I think that the Pink Floyd
set is pretty worthless (with the exception of one CD with old b-sides),
and I think the Aerosmith one is pretty bad.
	I think that it would be a good idea for a 20 years Rush boxed
set.  Though there are only a few rarities to go in it (perhaps one CD
worth of stuff - like pieces of eight, Take Off, the first two
singles, etc,), the other three or two CD's could be live stuff, or even
accoustic stuff (as in "unplugged" versions).  There have got to be some
exceptional concert tapes out there.  I read that Andrew MacNaughton is
sitting on the vault conatining all the concert tapes - I'll bet he could
find some gem.  Think of a Caress of Steel "Down the tubes Tour" live CD.
I don't know of any boots of this tour, so that would be a gem.  Also, a
Signals show would be great stuff.  It would cover that period in between
ESL and the GUP video that we rarely hear stuff from.
	Rush fans got ripped off with "Chronicles".  It was not a fitting
compilation album for a great band.  However, I'm of the opinion that
boxed sets are not produced for the casual listener - they're made for
real fans who can appreciate the rarities.  I hope that they do not waste
CD space with already relelased material.  We can all do without another
"Closer to the Heart" or "Tom Sawyer" (except a "catch the fish"
version!).  If they wanted to, they could make a real collectable that
Rush fans could absolutely covet and have lots of listening enjoyment
with.
	I'm going to write Anthem with this idea.  I'm not going to be
irate, or pressure them.  I'm just going to say that I really think that
it would be a fitting tribute for the band and a good seller for the fans.
I'd like to see some other (a lot!) of NMS subscribers follow my lead and
suggest a 20 years of Rush boxed set.

Subject:      Black Holes, Light with Mass, et al + short note to Meg

hello again all...

i've been reading all of the discussion of the black holes, whether or not
photons have mass, etc. with fascination and great bemusement.  first of
all, i would like to thank everyone who has been contributing to this
thread, as the theories are quite interesting and beautiful to me, and
your words have helped to prepare me for some of what i may come up against,
being a computer science major with at least a minor in physics and quite
possibly more, if i enjoy it as much as i think i will (yes, i can speak
these words in the midst of my last week of the semester: true sign of the
insane...  :&gt;  )  but i feel, having seen exactly how bristled some of you
have become over the differing opinions and statements represented on the
subject, that it is my duty to remind you that these viewpoints are all
_theories_ and are not scientific law.  just because something doesn't fit
into a particular equation doesn't mean that it is wrong...perhaps the
equation is wrong, perhaps the thing is an anomaly...whatever.  all i am
trying to say is that the speculation on black holes and the nature of
light should be read more as poetry and admired for its simple elegant
beauty rather than being thrown on the grill as meat to be flamed just
because it does not fit the particular explanation that one subscribes to.
for all we know, this could all be an illusion, or perhaps some grand joke
by a whimsical higher power.  :)  ok, ok, i'll quit now.  i just felt i
to express my own opinion and open myself as a target for anyone's stress
induced trigger-happy flamethrower finger.

to meg:  yayyyy!  i finally have money and i'm sendin' a check in the mail
         for a shirt...  sure hope you've got some more big-big ones when
         the mail arrives.  ;}

laughed at by time
tricked by circumstances

tmt.

p.s.  my sincere apologies for the absence of rush content...alas.  :}

p.p.s  thinking about the subject of scientific _laws_ and the subject of
speculation, even these can fall by the wayside.  being poorly informed
on these matters, the last i remember hearing about newton's law of
gravitation was that, although einstein's ideas of space-time curves are
considered the correct explanation and newton had it wrong, the equations
that newton provided are still used because they are so very close and
are much easier to use that space-time curve theory.  (is there even a
method for determining "gravitational effect" by the space-time theory?)

ok, ok...again, i know.  'nuff already.  i'll shut it.  *8-)

Subject: Neuromancer and Cyberpunk

In the last NMS issue, someone brought up the parallels between William
Gibson's novel Neuromancer and "Digital Man".  Indeed, the similarities
between the two are not mere coincidence.  Gibson has been a pioneer in
science fiction writing for some years, with his greatest contribution being
the creation of a new genre known as cyberpunk.  He was not the only writer
to blaze the trail, but he is widely considered to be the founder of
cyberpunk.  A more common term for culture which has resulted in cyberpunk
is "new wave."  This genre is charactrized by bringing mainstream stylistic
experimentation into science fiction, a concern for ontological and
epistemological problems, drugs and drug realitites, and a dismal worldview,
especially in terms of politics, technology, and love.  Not all "new wave"
literature features these characteristics, but they are prevalent.  Rush
seemed to move into a "new wave" period with the Signals album, as Neil
Peart began to explore themes of technology and science in his lyrics.
"Digital Man", "Countdown", "The Body Electric" and "Distant Early Warning"
are all examples of Mr. Peart's exploration of technology and its effects
on humanity.  "Red Sector A" provides a trademark dismal view of current
political trends, by creating a possible future in which North America is
occupied by Soviet forces (at least that's my interpretation).  This leads
to another connection -- the use of speculative fiction -- between "new
wave" and Rush.  Neil Peart has repeatedly set his lyrical stories in the
future and has made use of the "stardust and spaceships" principle, as seen
in Cygnus X-1.  This is why Rush was actually called "new wave" by many
people during the Signals/Grace Under Pressure era.  Their musical
experimentation with keyboards, electronic drums and other samples of
tenchology was the icing on the cake.  Thus, logical conclusions as to the
similarity of Neuromancer and Rush songs, such as "Digital Man", may be made,
considering the "new wave" undercurrent existing in both the novel and in
the work of the band.

Subject: *NO* !! Photons do *NOT* have mass

re: Mark Miesch's black hole comments:
(1) it's a bad idea to criticize the criticizers of a post if you
haven't read the original post.

(2) it's a really bad idea to criticize physicists about physics, and
tell them to "go read up on your relativity".  At least one (I think
2) of the criticizers were physics grad students).

(3) E = m*c^2    is a description of the energy liberated from a mass
that is destroyed.  Or it describes the mass that could be created out of
nothing but energy.  It does not say that a chunk 'o energy (TM) has
mass.  The formula has been quoted too widely w/ too little
explanation.  If you want further details e-mail me.

To Matt Van Horn/Phil D. Croix... I completely agree with your thoughts on
Hold Your Fire, it is the best Rush album IMHO, the first one I listened
to completely, I went through a phase of loving old Rush and disliking the
newer stuff, but now I've come back to think that the newer, more mature
stuff, is of higher quality, both musically and lyrically. (But I still
rock out to the older stuff quite often).
To Luis Arturo Loyo Delgrado: can you please send me a copy of the arcane
trivia file? Thanx.
To Barret Paul Robert: I don't think that RtB expresses the idea that life
is "up to fate." He does, after all, say "I don't believe in destiny..."
What would be a contrast to this is Closer to the Heart where he says
"...sailing into destiny." Now there's a contradiction! ;) Is he sailing
into something he doesn't believe in? :)
And to Michael J. Miller: sorry, you're wrong about black holes on several
points...
1. Photons (light) have no mass, regardless of speed, even if they are
traveling unimpeded through empty space (i.e. at light-speed). Energy,
however, does have a _equivilant_ mass specified by E=Mc^2.
2. Black holes do not have infinite mass, they have whatever mass
collapsed to form the singularity.
3. Relativity does not break down near places of infinite mass.
	a. relativity breaks down _at_places of infinitely concentrated
		mass
	b. infinite mass does not exist in current cosmological model
4. relativity does not _cause_ the slowdown of time near places of mass
(near the earth works too, and this slowdown has been actually measured)
but relativity does _describe_ the slowdown.
	Sorry to be pedantic, but I'm an astronomy major, forgive me!!!

        be achived before they can be listened to and appreciatted, It seems
        when ever I turn on my Stereo it has to go up at least 30% before
        I am comfortable with the volume, so I can hear Rush Properly.
        Anyone else feel this way?
First encounters:
        Its it true as it seems to me that Rush is a band that has to be
        introduced to someone by a RushFan(Tm).  Rush can't just be picked
        up in a music store and bought, and listened too.  There has
        to be someone who is already a RushFan(Tm) introducing it to a person
        leading them through the early stages of the addiction, until they
        are completely Hooked and can never pull away.
           My first encounter With Rush was my collage roommate who was a
        serious fan.  He sat me down(up till this time I was a Serious
        Billy JoelFan(Tm), wipe that smirk off your face! #|:]) and played
        some of the songs off Presto, my first time hearing Rush.  Then
        it seemed to crawl into everything in our room the music he played,
        "If you like that you'll love this", "You think that Guy is good
        on Drums listen to Niel" so forth and so on.  Eventually I became
        an even worse RushFan(Tm) then him.  NMS helped alot in that respect.
Rush Dream #3:
        I'm in the local Music store, checking out some Wal-Basses, and
        Promark sticks.  Suddenly this guy a mass of blond hair atop his
        head, comes running in.  "I got have this Guitar Restrung by tonight"
        says he.  "I can't I'm back logged a week here" says the shop keep.
        "I'll make it worth your while"  says the mysterious stranger.
        "Sorry can't", says te shop keep
        "I'll do it" says I  to the Man before me suddenly realizing who
        he is.
        "Great" says Blonde man "How much you want for it"
        "Nothing" I reply "Just a lesson or two from the master and front row
        ticks to the show"
        "Deal" says he.

I have heard the story many times of Dwayne, a strange alumnus of my
internet node---oops I mean my university---and his rush biography.
Apparently he, as a writing major, decided to write it as his senior
project.  He got into a long corespondence with the guys, and tried to
publish his result.  I've heard that he asked Neil to help him publish it,
but Neil said something about it not being his place to do so.  Eventually
they had a falling out, as Dwayne started asking for free tickets or
something.
I haven't been able to find a copy of this work...but the story is one
of the reasons that I went to the university of redlands.
The guys seem to manage to stay so busy, it's a wonder they answer people
at all...but apparently they do.=)

Subject: Assorted stuff.. and Presto, the song..

Hey Jennifer-
I agree with you on that part about Presto.. maybe almost being
Peart's 'love song'.. actually, whenever I hear that part, that's
what I think of, and oddly enough, about 2 months after Presto was
released, I flew down to Florida and thought of my old girlfriend
exactly as Peart wrote, and had the song 'blasting' through my
head.. also, with a last name like that Jennifer I'm suprised
you didn't say anything about the latest physics discussions
(as in Feynman's notes on physics..  Unfortunately, I just realized
the spelling was different, but still kinda sorta funny)

About rush being lampooned... well, I think since they are
travelling there to accept the award, I think maybe that it
is more serious than a jab at them.. Well, at least I take
it in a positive way.. Anyone who goes there, find out about
their latest album, and invite Geddy to a baseball game between
the Orioles and the Blue Jays at Camden Yards for me, okay? :)

I'm not sure what it is, but I always like hearing a Rush tune
on the radio better than playing it myself (I mean, I always
enjoy playing Rush tunes in the car, etc.., but when I occasionally
go to the radio and hear a rush tune, it's just better). The
best feeling I had was listening to Rush win the Superbowl of
Rock -n- Roll last year, when they played a multitude of Rush
songs all weekend as they beat up on other groups (they beat
Q-ryche in the superbowl) - people call in with votes.. Looks
like there is a big Rush fan base here in Baltimore..

well, time to study (had to say this incase mom and dad were
reading.. *grin*)

Subject: My woman, a chick fan!

Hello,

	Don't know who asked, but the question was asked, "Does anyone know
any girls that actually like Rush?".  Well, aside from our devoted women
NMS subscribers, I can proudly say that my girlfriend is a fan!  Not only
is she female, (thank god...you never know these days...) but she is also
Thai.  We are really killing multiple birds with one stone here eh?  I mean
a minority fan that is also a woman!  I would have to say that her favorite
songs were Presto and definitly Bravado.  I have tried to make a By-tor
and the Snowdog fan out of her but she just doesn't dig songs about a dude
from hell in a fray with Snowdog.  She is more into the lovish-type songs
like Presto and Bravada.  Other favorites would include Ghost of a Chance
and The Pass.  Well enough about her, just thought you might like to know.

	I would also like to address the question concerning a full length
play of 2112.  I have a bootleg of a 1978 concert in Oslo Norway in which
the full 20 minutes and 24 seconds is played.  This whole tape is very
amusing because after every song the audience starts cheering, "Oy, oy, oy
oy, oy, oy...".  Then Ged can be heard chanting along with them in his
Toronto accent, "Oy, oy, oy...".  It is really hilarious.

	P.S.  My roomate is a DICK!!!! Can't wait til after finals so I can
go home.  He listens to nothing but country music on MY stereo which is used
to nothing but Rush.  Oh well, only a week left.  I plan to be very out of
touch with reality a week from now...  I think I will honor the Boyz and
drink La Batts for the occation.  Well, happy post-final partying!!!
Listen to By-tor and the Snowdog when you are shit-faced... It's a trip...

I don't post much, but I love reading what you all have to say.  I was just
thinking about two recent threads of conversation here, anagrams, and MTV.
I remember a while ago realizing that "Music Television" is an anagram
for "Live Mice Sit On Us".  Quite hilarious actually.  Maybe it could have
been fit into Anagram (for Mongo).  The only reason I mention this is I love
anagrams, and never even realized the cleverness and wit that Peart put into
that song until you all started mentioning it.  Also on the anagram subject,
if you have seen the movie "Sneakers", the opening credits cleverly and
humorously twist the actors names into legible (if not sensible) phrases.
Can't remeber the the actors name, but one of the phrases was something like
"Turnips cured Elvis" or something therabouts.
Anyway, enough rambling.  Hope the Harvard Lampoon appearance is for real...

Subject: Battle Scar

Hi All!

I spent about 4 months looking for any of the Max Webster CD's and
had no luck around here or in Minneapolis or by calling a specialty
store that specialized in ordering, so I e-mailed some people off
the list and one of the replies included a list of places that
will mail-order CD's.

I called them and asked if by chance they had any Max Webster CD's
and they said they had all of them and which would I like!  I ordered
all five of them and as they came in, they were shipped to me and I
was not billed until they were shipped.  Each was $15.99cdn plus
$3.00cdn shipping and handling.  This worked out to about $15.29
in the U.S.  I was very happy with the service and the response.

I ordered them from:

	The CD Bar
	281 Queen St W
	Toronto MSV 1Z9
	(800) 663-1616

The Max Webster CD's are:

1976    Max Webster                     Max Webster
1977    Max Webster                     High Class in Borrowed Shoes
1978    Max Webster                     Mutiny Up My Sleeve
1979    Max Webster                     A Million Vacations
1980    Max Webster                     Universal Juveniles

I recorded "Battle Scar" onto my Sun system and a friend has uploaded it
to the incoming directory on 'syrinx.umd.edu'.

Later!

Subject: Syme and Aerosmith, Critical Mass Meaning Speculation

/-/ello:

	If the following news and thoughts have already been mentioned
  recently, I apologize.  I have sometimes had to quickly scan the NMS
  in recent weeks due to work overload.  So it goes...

  HUGH SYME:

        I noticed that Hugh Syme designed the cover for the latest
  Aerosmith CD, _Get a Grip_.  The cover features a large and
  pendulous cow udder prominently displayed, with one of the nipples
  sporting a nipple ring.  The cow has also apparently been branded
  with a large Aerosmith "flying-A" logo.  Ooch! Ouch!  I hope this is
  all special effects created by Hugh Syme, otherwise he may get the
  animal rights folks upset.

  CRITICAL MASS SPECULATION:

        I've enjoyed the speculation on the various possible meanings
  of "Critical Mass," especially the discussion on astronomy and other
  scientific interpretations.  One possible meaning is: the fate of
  the universe.  If there's enough mass in the universe, then it will
  eventually stop expanding and begin to contract, eventually causing
  another Big Bang.  Some astronomers and cosmologists theorize that
  the universe may undergo this cycle of expansion, contraction, and
  explosion repeatedly, ad infinitum, *if* there is "critical mass,"
  that is, enough matter in the universe to hold it all together.  If
  there's not enough matter, then the universe will expand forever
  until all atoms are distributed evenly across space and the universe
  experiences heat death.  Which will it be?  Roll the bones.

Subject: Re: Neil Peart fan mail

In response to *Neil Peart fan mail* from Andrew LeCren.

I wrote to Neil many years back and received a response several months later.
My letter dealt with drumming questions that I had about HYF. Most of it was
tech junk and he didn't respond to it all. As the rush-mgr stated, it was a
postcard, and there is limited room for response. A friend of mine at the
time was a big Rush fan and was convinced that Neil was dying of Leukemia,
so I of course asked Neil about that. He wasn't dying. I didn't even ask
about the rumor that during the MP tour in Toronto, Neil got so into the show
that he threw his throne (drum stool) into the audience half way through his
solo and then proceeded to finish the show. When writing to him, give him an
address where you'll be for a long time.

I've been thinking about writing Neil since I heard him speak on a radio show
called *Rock and the Environment* or *Rocking the Environment* where he
talked
about the need for cleaner air. Some friends of mine here at the Dept. of
Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences did an aerosol study of Chicago's
industrial district. To make a long story short, in order to publish such
things as aerosol output, the polluter must be legally notified that he is
being studied. These friends of mine compared pollution output during the
legal notified time, and the unnotified times, and found that aerosol output
increased 300% minutes after the end of the allotted time. But of course this is
illegally obtained, and therefore unpublishable information, but it may say a
lot about reported decreases in aerosol output. I think Neil might be
interested. Maybe not.

Subject: Mtv

Hello everyone,
	I have been reading for the past months about Mtv and their (lack of)
airplay of Rush.  While I agree that they are woefully lax, I do have to thank
them for something... wonderful.  In my younger days when I was not so
musically mature in my tastes, I watched lots of Mtv.  Ok so it was only 3.5
years ago!  Anyway, I was watching one day and I saw this video for a song
called "Show Don't Tell" by some band called Rush.  Well, there wasn't a lot of
flash to the video, mostly just concert-like footage of the three guys in the
band playing their instruments and singing.  I though to myself, 'hey that's a
cool song.'  I saw it a couple more times after that also, and then I saw
another video in the same style by the same band.  This one was called
"Superconductor".  Well, I thought to myself 'Self, this new band is pretty
good.  You've heard two good songs off the album.  Take a chance and buy it.'
So I bought it and liked every song on it.  I thought, 'hey, I bet this band is
gonna have a great career'.  So I told a new friend of mine about this album
(I was a college freshman at the time).  Of course he came back to me with
about 20 albums of previous material.  Needless to say, I was a tad
flabergasted about having NEVER heard of a band that had been around sinc
1974!
	The point is (there really is a point? cool!) ... the point is that
Mtv, those lowly scum(tm) introduced me to Rush.  I have built up my collection
to nearly all albums now and am a huge fan of Rush.  (Really? never woulda
guessed it ;-)  So I guess Mtv can't be ALL bad, eh?

In response to *Rush on MTV, Orioles and Rush, Light & Physics, Breakin 
period* by Christopher Mermagen.

On the topic of light... Whether or not light has mass is good question. In 
theory it has no mass, but if it had no mass, the gravitational pull of a 
black hole would not bend back the light, and the black hole would not be 
black. Also there is gravitational refraction in Astronomy which bends the
light from star A which is blocked by star B so star A can be seen on earth as 
the light is refracted around star B. Light is a curious thing. It behaves 
like a wave, and like a particle.  Largely though, it is nicest to think about 
light as massless. It is also important to remember that equations are 
equations, and most if not all are approximations. As for the Solar
Sail, I know nothing about that. Although, I should point out that in addition 
to all that light, the Sun ejects billions of tons of energetic plasma called 
the solar wind, and it's my bet that the solar wind is what is supposed to 
move these solar sails. And the heating by light... When a photon interacts 
with an atom or molecule it can photoionize, photodissociate, photoexite or a 
combination of these. In each case, the energy carried by the photon is 
*absorbed* by the particle, and depending on conditions, will lead to one of 
the aforementioned processes. What we think of as heating is the Photoexitation,
where the atom or molecule is brought to a higher electronic state. Blah 
blah blah.

I heard Critical Mass is due out in September, and the tour begins in January. 
Also I've heard that's Collins is producing, and it's taking place in Seattle. 
None of this is verified, but It's what I'm hearing.
