Lots of news and notes for this issue...

First, the pop-up video thing. Pop-Up's web site is www.spinthebottle.com
and it has a listing for the episode and also has a listing of airdates
for each show up until May 9th. Good news: they're not only showing "Limelight"
but the Tears Are Not Enough video (Geddy sang in this, but I don't remember
if he's in the video or not).

Here's the listing for episode #81:

SHOW #81 - Canadian Invasion
           VIDEO                         ARTIST
           Sunglasses at Night           Corey Hart 
           Cuts like a Knife             Bryan Adams 
           Limelight                     Rush 
           Keep on Rock'in               Neil Young 
           Tears are not Enough          Northern Lights 

Bad news: best I can tell, the episode is not showing until AT LEAST May 10th,
because it doesn't show up in the current schedule (through May 9th) which
is odd considering they're showing episodes 86 & 84 on the 9th...

Next, on the Maple Leaf Gardens closing, here's a direct article that scoots
was able to dig up for me:

>>Says Joe Pantalone, Chairman of the Board of Exhibition Place, ``Entering 
formal negotiations with Maple Leaf Gardens confirms our solid commitment to 
the revitalization of Exhibition Place. This project builds on the successes 
of the National Trade Centre and will bring more business opportunities and
entertainment value to the site.'' The proposal is for a two-phase development,
to begin after Exhibition Stadium is demo-lished. The first phase would use 
about 12.5 acres and include the construction and operation of the new 19,000 
seat multi-purpose arena, a parking facility for 1,200 vehicles and other 
entertainment developments. The goal is to have the facilities operational for 
the first Leafs game in September 2000.<<

So it sounds like MLG won't be torn down for a while, possibly not even until
next year!

Finally, REAL Rush news!!

  * Neil will begin work with Hugh on packaging for the live album, probably in
    mid-May

  * They also plan to start writting a new studio record later this year or
    early next year

  * They want to release the album in January of 2000

I am glad that you discovered Dream Theater, they are number 2 for me 
(guess who is number 1)....

I know they did cover some Rush songs in the past and apparently Neil 
was not impressed with it. But Ill check with the people on theYtsejam 
mailling list and find out more about this and report to the NMS next week.

They are currently touring in the US so check the web for dates if 
you want to cacht them live, they are like Rush live they usually 
dont deviate much from the original song.

Was flipping through channels last night, and came across VH-1.  They 
had some special on about sci-fi movies.  They were talking about 
Terminator 2 and in the background they were playing Driven.  Of 
course the band isn't good enough to make the top 100, but they can be 
used as background music.  I still say we go down to their building 
and paint a few red stars on the building.  Did anyone else happen to 
catch the show???

Hello fellow Rush fans and musicians, I'm looking to find someone with a
Hiwatt speaker cabinet for sale.
I'm looking for one that  has been manufactured between 1968 through
1978, I will however consider other years depending on condition and model.
 Do you have a Hiwatt Custom DR1003 from the same period you might part
with as well?
Write me  at  asegura1@concentric.net

Thanks,

     Let me get this out of the way. The 2112 red star. Oh christ, I can't 
     believe I'm even going here.... Whether the band is satanic or wiccan 
     or christians or space aliens doesn't matter. The penta-whatever 
     doesn't prove anything; except that they liked poking at people's 
     moral sensibility. Come on. They (along w/ Hugh) KNEW what they were 
     doing in using the infamous red star; playing with satanic imagery for 
     the symbol of the oppressive federation. The fact that we're still 
     talking about it is proof of that. Mission accomplished, boys!
     
     Now, to make up for my contribution to the penta/satan/star/naked guy 
     thread, here's a neat story! While traversing Wisconsin on my way back 
     to college, I was driving through a thunder storm.... AND listening to 
     Presto (the plot thickens). EXACTLY as the line "...electrical storm 
     in your veins" was uttered, the hair on my arms stood up. A 
     microsecond later, lightning struck the ditch to the right of my 1982 
     Plymouth Horizon. This is all true. It was rather spectacular. 
     
     Chad
     
     P.S. My 1982 Plymouth Horizon was called "the Happy Snacker" (ask if 
     you care - NOTHING to do with Rush).

Hey There Rushianites!!!!!
I have noticed that the last two albums do not exactly sound like rush.  I
tuned into a local radio station here in maine, and it was Driven, but for the
life of me I could not think of who wrote it, personally, I love rush, but I
can't get over this.  It seems like geddy has lost his voice alittle and not
nearly as orchestrated as their music in the past, What I am triing to say is
it is not totally Rush!!!  If you agree do not hesitate to e-mail me!!!!!!!
As they say in Maine...................it is not a car, but a kah!!!!!so lets
take the kah to bah habaa (Bar Harbor).

Yesterday I recieved a very well done fold out flyer in the mail.  It =
was a promotion for 99.5 KISS radio station advertising 6 concert fly =
away packages.  They called it a six pack of concert flyaways.  There =
was paicture of the top of a six pack in the graphics.  Each can had a =
name of a concert.  Included were Pearl Jam,  Metallica,  Ozzfest,  Van =
Halen,  Robert Plant/Jimmy Page,  and ....RUSH.  There's also mention of =
a seventh concert with the Rolling Stones at Wembly stadium. =20

This is probably one of the nicest advertisements I have ever recieved =
from them.  I have to disagree with the Rush Mgr on this one,  I don't =
think that this is just DJ hearsay.  I don't think they would go ahead =
with a promotion of this scale,  include RUSH,   and not have some =
inkling of what they are talking about. =20

Subject: Rush as a back-up band?

Now before any of you get your panties in a twist, this is only a dorky
attempt at a thread, so please don't get offended or bent out of shape
because you think it's stupid (I already know it's stupid).

You know how sometimes solo artists will use established bands as back-up
for tours or limited engagement shows (for example: Chuck Berry w/ the E
street band, Eric Clapton w/ The Robert Cray Band, that sort of thing). I
was listening to Peter Gabriel's "Secret World Live" CD the other day, and
thought that it could be kind of cool to see the boys backing someone like
Gabriel. Any other Ideas from out in Rushland?
 BTW, hey rush mgr, I found a bunch of stubs from Seattle / Tacoma shows
from MP to the present. Need any scanned? You may have some of these
already, so I just thought I'd ask.

   [ I want ANY AND ALL ticket stub scans, even if I already have them!!

Subject: IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU ALL READ THIS NOW-

As a RUSH fanatic for 19 years I would never post anything I thought was
bogus.  After about 10,000 times listening to Alien Shore, I swear it
hit me when I started hearing unclear speaking or chanting during the
last instrumental section-you almost have to not even listen to the
music-JUST KEEP HITTING REWIND-Who is it and what is he saying-it's like
a very  muffled version of "we have assumed control" or something.
How can we decipher this?
I am convinced there is some kind of hidden chanting or message at the
last instrumental section on ALIEN SHORE.  I am not the only one who is
convinced.  It's not guitar or keyboard, reverb, or echo either.

Subject: stooges

It appears that Alex did the 3 Stooges thing at every Rush show, and I
know he did the 3 times I saw the Test For Echo Tour.  The fact that he
did the same gimmick at every show leads to a major complaint about Rush
concerts:  lack of spontaneity.  The Stooges thing is suddenly not so
funny when I realize that he does it every night.  It's kind of like when
I saw Van Halen a couple of years ago and Sammy came out in a Houston
Rockets jersey.  Most on the crowd tripped out because of the jersey,
failing to realize that he would be wearing a Spurs jersey the next night
in San Antonio.  By the time I saw Test For Echo for the 3rd time, I was
quite bored with it all (were you bored too, Codeman?) because I knew
exactly what I was getting.

In addition to using the same jokes, they also use the same set list for
the entire tour (with maybe 1 or 2 substitutions along the way). 
Although I will always still catch Rush shows when they are in my area,
it is not as much fun as some of the other shows that I really look
forward to.  My favorite bands to see live (such as FNM, Bosstones)
always come in with the crowd wondering what they are gonna see and hear
different that night.  Maybe half the set list is written in stone and
the other half is written right before the show.   This makes the
anticipation many times greater for me and that is an important part of
the concert-going experience.  I feel like Rush is a well planned
theatrical production and have lost much of what Rock & Roll is to me: 
spontaneity and live improvisation.  I think they are the greatest
recorded group ever, but the live show is somewhat lacking.

In response to Kate Collins' query about the meaning of "COS" -
IMHO, as a guitar player, caress of steel = playing a guitar (or bass).
Electric guitars and basses are strung with steel strings, and the act of
playing the instrument can be described as a "caress", hence the title.

Subject: Re: Riverside what????

Lot's of mis-information here - I thought I'd set the story straight.

The venue that the original poster was talking about is the Riverfront
Colisium <sorry for the spelling - sue me ;-)>  For the longest time, it
was the ONLY venue, aside from the Cincinnati Gardens, that would hold
rock concerts of any real size.  This is situated next to Riverfront
Stadium - renamed Cinergy Field just over a year ago - but rarely have
they held rock concerts there - only the Rolling Stones - Kool Jazz
Festival - large draws.

Riverfront Colisium was the sight of the Who Concert Tragedy - where 11 (I
think) people were trampled to death.  The insurance rates for the
Colisium became so high for musical events, most promoters stopped booking
shows there.  Since the construction of Riverbend Music Center - our
outdoor venue - most rock shows would skip Cincinnati during the winter
months so they could play at Riverbend in the summer.  And besides, the
Achoustics really DID suck.

RC was purchased by a group of investors (As the venue was privately
constructed - not a city owned building) and renamed the Crown.  The venue
has been completely refurbished, and it's my understanding (from some
knowledgeable sources) that the achoustics are MUCH better now.
Nedderlander Entertainment (who also books for Riverbend Music Center) has
become partners with the investors, and MANY shows of all kinds are
scheduled and held there now.

It appears that Riverfront Stadium is headed for the wrecking ball
shortly.  A new Football complex will be built down on the riverfront West
of the current facility - Baseball only facility looks like it will end up
on the east side of Downtown - the Crown will remain at it's current
location.

there ya go - more information than ya wanted to know about Cincinnati
Venues. ;-)

personally am getting sick of all the people that bitch.  Some folks won't
post anything but bitch lists about other posts.  If you don't like it,
don't read it.   You have a scroll bar in your mail program.... USE IT!  Of
the many people on NMS, I am sure that yopu can't get everyone of them to
agree with every post.

But, maybe I am wrong.  Maybe you are the one collective mind for the whole
mailing list.  EVERYONE communicates with you through telepathy, and you
speak for everyone.

If this is not the case, Shut the hell up!

One other thought,  If you don't like the way the Rush Mgr. manages this
list, MAKE YOUR OWN!  Then you can put in only the posts you wish to read!
You could even be the only one who posts, and then you can argue with
yourself about the dumb posts.

Hey,

Rush will, indeed be on Pop-Up Video, Episode #81.  The question is = when?
If you go to www.popupvideo.com, they have air dates for all of the = shows they

April 12.

I just e-mailed them to see when the hell they will air that show (called

I'd like to make a couple of comments regarding this post. First, 
welcome to enlightenment Brooke, glad you could join us. As a 
musician who plays the drums, I'm obviously sick of the bad
drummer jokes out there , e.g. Definition of a band: 3 musicians and a drummer.

Drummers, like other musicians, posess a wide variety of musical 
tastes as well as skillsets. I think any honest observer would agree 
that there are equally egregious examples of musical overkill (or 
monotony) displayed by guitarists, bassists and keyboardists. Just as 
music can be reduced to lowest common denominator status by plodding, 
unimaginative parts, soo too can it be reduced to a mere technical 
exercise by those refusing to show any restraint in the construction 
of parts and solos. While interesting as a showcase for technical 
ability, such displays can hardly be called musical.

Rush, like other progressive rock bands, has occasionally walked a 
very fine line between musicality and bombast. I credit our heroes 
with a great deal of restraint for choosing music over technical 
exercises. When you have the kind of chops they have it's very hard 
not to want to show them off constantly.

Don't forget, however, that in rock music one of the crucial elements 
of a song is the 'feel' or 'groove' that underlies it. I don't mean 
this in the 'Superconductor' sense but as a larger measure of what 
makes a great song. The drummer provides the direction to produce 
this feel or groove, and the complexity of a part is usually 
inversely proportional to the feel of the song, unless you posess the 
awesome talents of a Neil Peart, etc.

Listen to a Boz Scaggs song called "Lido Shuffle", from the Silk 
Degrees album (showing my age there) as an example of a song with a 
very non-embellished (don't call it simple) drum part that absolutely 
grooves as if there's no tomorrow. I could listen to that track for 
hours without getting tired of it. The drummer was Jeff Porcaro, who 
sadly is no longer with us. Another example, famous in drumming 
circles, is Steve Gadd's groove on Paul Simon's "50 Ways to Leave Your 
Lover." This part is more complex without losing any of the groove.

So please, don't confuse technical ability (actually, Gadd and 
Porcaro have/had loads of it) with musical skill. While chops can 
help facilitate good music, musicianship means a lot more than how 
fast you can play.

After all, a guy named Ringo did pretty well with one bass drum and 
two toms.

John

P.S. Cut Hanson some slack. I know quite a few drummers who don't 
have as much groove as that kid does.

Can anyone from Toronto confirm if in fact the Maple Leaf Garden will be 
closing?  Where will the new home of the hockey team be?  If the Garden is 
to close in the very near future, wouldn't construction of a new arena 
be nearing completetion by now?  I doubt that the Maple Leaves will be 
leaving Toronto for a new city.  Certainly there would been a lot of talk 
about this move or proposed move.  Unfortunately, I think this fall show is
just a rumour.

Subject: pentagram (the truth)

if you're debating the fact that Rush is a satanic band by the pentagram
on the cover of 2112, you're highly mistaken, and obviously don't know
what a pentagram means.  the star is what makes it a pentagram.  the
points all have a meaning.  since i can't remember the exact meaning of 
each line and point is, but i know the overall meaning.  it starts by
going down (man's attraction to the devil), and ends by going up (man's
ascension from the attraction to the devil).  that's if it points up,
which it does on the cover of 2112.  
if you don't believe what i say, look it up in a witchcraft, alchemy, or
black magic book.

Has anyone thought to check what the schedule is for the closing of MLG?
Or, to even verify that it's closing, for that matter?  I don't doubt that
it's closing but, if you find out it isn't, then that proves for certain
that there's no show.  If it is closing, then that establishes a time frame
for a potential show.  Perhaps someone from MLG can verify some of this?

   [ Check the article above. They ARE demolishing MLG at some point, but
     it might not be until next year.                          : rush-mgr ]

Also, I've noticed that when big venues like this close their doors they
usually have one big bash to close it with a bunch of celebs who have a
history with the venue.  Considering this, I think it is VERY likely that
Rush may show up at the 'closing bash' and maybe even bang-out a song or
two with a minimal set-up.  That may very well be the extent of this MLG show.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Regarding the red star controversy: Hugh Syme said it pretty plainly in the
interview blurb that was posted: The naked man represents the hero of the
story (and the movement he creates) and the star represents the oppressive
Solar Federation.  Taken together, the man and the star symbolize the
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO, nothing more.  Specifically, it does not imply
ANYTHING about any potential resolution to the conflict.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Regarding the playing of Presto on the Presto tour: Someone (I forget who
it was) has asserted that Presto was played in Providence and Worcester.  I
cannot speak for the remainder of the tour, however, I was at both the
Providence and the Worcester shows and I can AUTHORITATIVELY state that
Presto WAS NOT PLAYED AT EITHER VENUE.  The person who asserted this was
mistaken and possibly confused the song Presto with some other song, as has
been suggested.

The reason I am so certain about this is because of circumstances that
existed around the time of the two shows.  The local Providence radio
station, WHJY, supported the Presto album VERY STRONGLY.  Probably the only
Rush album they supported more strongly was Moving Pictures!  One of the
reasons for this strong support was that the song Presto had become a
pretty large hit on the station.  One of their DJs (who is no longer with
them) was called Rick OB, and he was probably the biggest supporter.  He
was very excited when Rush came to town and he made no bones about it.
After the show, we (i.e. me and my friends) were all very disappointed that
The Boys did not play Presto, and Rick OB was also very unhappy about it;
he even made several comments on the air about it.  I had the impression
that he actually felt slighted over it since he and the station had
promoted the song and the show so strongly.  The station still plays Rush
(one of the few in the area that do, in fact) but they've never supported
them that strongly again.

So, after all this, you could say that the experience left an indelible
impression on me and I have not forgotten it since.

BTW, I suspect that the reason Rush has never played the song is because of
the very-difficult-to-reproduce switching between electric and acoustic
guitars in the song.  Even with The Omega Concern's funky acoustic guitar
stand, this song would be a bear to play live!  It would probably be much
easier to play now with the funky new electric/acoustic guitar that Alex
used on the TFE tour.  (Sorry, I forgot the name of it.)  So, maybe they'll
include it in the set on the next tour??!  We can only hope....

Hey folks:

I have been reading about this "K.I.S.S." radio station saying that
Rush  will be playing Maple Leaf Gardens when it closes.

Well, there are a few things to remeber here first. I live in Toronto,
and KNOW that there is no "scheduled" date for the closing of Maple Leaf
Gardens. (I think Torontonians would know aboult this one!!)First off,
they STILL haven't chosen a new arena site. (They are currently building
a site for the Toronto Raptors basketball team, but STILL have not come
up with a location for a new arena for the Toronto Maple Leafs.) So,
there will be a new arena for the Tor. Maple Leafs, but that would be a
fair time down the road. Unless, this radio station knows something the
rest of T.O. doesn't, this doesn't sound like something that will happen
in the near future. 

If anybody else has accurate info, please post.

Subject: The presto debate

Once and for all, let's settled the debate: I know they didn't played that
song on the Presto tour esp. at Worcester centrum in May, 1990 (god, my
memory is good on Rush). It may have been mistaken as Presto, but the song
does not sound like presto. Also, another evidence of this: I had a bootleg
videoof the phillie show (lost it, Damn!!!) and i certainly did not see or
hear presto played live. In short they played five  tracks from that album
(the last LP released by the boys): Show don't tell, the pass, war paint,
scars, and superconductor, not much in terms of new material. It might hAve
been different around the country, so I'm not doubting. But since Rush is a
tight band with an unchanging setlist, I honestly don't think they did so.

Hey!

I just had to say:

Craig'sVirtual Concert Hall just made available a
T4E title "Never Stand Still". Entire concert from
Albany, NY October 19th 1996, opening night.
I'm listening to Driven live for the first time since
the second leg.

remember: Ged gettin' all funky on the bass line,
then tossing in a 90 sec bass solo? It does rock!

Sound quality is about a 7 mainly for the audience
noise (which is pretty funny in it's own way!). I did
have to max the treble and back off on the bass
some to get the best sound but overall this title is
worth it. If you get winamp (freeware) you can get
all 23 songs. The Virtual Concert Hall will close
for the summer starting May 6th. So get it soon I
guess. I'm I no way connected to the VCH just a
user. Thanks Craig.

This San Antonio radio station seems to swear that Rush will playing in
Toronto sometime later this year and that there may be a tour.  Obviously, all
evidence would seem contrary except that they are so adament about this and it
is part of a 6 show giveaway where the other 5 are legit (Van Halen,
Metallica, Pearl Jam...).

On all of this list, isn't there ANYONE who either is close to the band, or
knows someone close to the band who could give all of us the REAL STORY on
their plans?  

Rush's fans have been very loyal over the years to them and I don't think it
would be asking too much in return for them to come out with some kind of
statement as to their status and their plans over the next year or two so that
we don't have to keep speculating, spreading wild rumors, and be left in
suspense.  Is there anyone on this list that has access to the band and can
find out the real story once and for all?  I think we are all entitled to that
and I don't think the band should take their loyal fans for granted,
especially in this day and age where musical tastes change with the wind.
