Yes indeedy, it did come out today, and with a suprise....

I looked over the song list, and "Take Off" was nowhere to be found....

Instead, they had "Show Don't Tell"!

How did they manage this, considering that it's from an album released by a different recording
company?

My theory is that when they saw that "Take Off" was going to be on a collection of their music,
RUSH offered to sell them the rights to SDT if they would leave the song off, since it is not
representative of their music, and possibly embarrassment. Imagine people listening and thinking that
RUSH was playing the instruments on there? Hmmmm....

Oh yeah, we have "Get The Led Out" on WAAF up here, too. Seems like a plague......

Subject: Backstage Club and Radio Airplay (what's that?)

Since the beginning of the school year is upon us I imagine there
will again be a wave of questions about the RUSH Backstage Club.
So I thought that I would follow our manager's lead and supply
a little info.

The club is based in Las Vegas (see the last  Digest..9/4/90).
It is run by a kindly lady by the name of Dottie. It is mainly
an outlet for mail order stuff....T-shirts, posters, etc. etc.
You can order Visions too.... I recommend that you do because
it is much easier that hunting down bookstores that carry it.
Once you become a member you are required to buy an item in order
to remain active for 1 year. If you don't buy an item in a 1 year
period you are dropped from the list.

To become a member you should send $9.00 PLUS $2.95 postage and
handling to the Las Vegas address. If you don't send the $2.95
your membership won't be processed...you get some goodies in the
mail with the membership (a Hold Your Fire poster, a Signals
tour book, a patch, and a membership card...oh boy!) and the
p&h money is to cover these items.

Maybe twice a year you will receive a newsletter. The best part of
this is that Neil writes part of it.. a sort of question and answer
session... he responds to various questions that fans write to him about.
Although you will notice that his responses are a bit sarcastic.

Also I might add that if you have questions about the club, you must
send them a self-addressed stamped envelop or you won't get a response.
Understandably they are a low budget outfit.

I hope this answers a few of the more commonly asked questions!!:-&gt;

Regarding Rush radio airplay: It is virtually non-exsistant in Seattle.
The only Rush tunes I have heard in the last few months have come from
Presto... Show Don't Tell and The Pass. The so called "progressive
rock" and "classic rock" stations play tons of Zepplin, Eric Clapton,
Eagles, Beatles, Stones, etc...not bad stuff... but I listen alot and
would be tickled to hear a little A Farewell To Kings era stuff.
The only time I have heard any classic Rush played was on March 26,
1990. Why do I remember that date you are wondering?? That was the
date of the Presto show here and KISW played a Rush set after the
show...how nice of them!!!

Cheers,

Dave C.

Subject: _Chronicles_, YYZ

Greetings RUSHans--

Hello hello again, Rush fans.  I have a little distressing message.  It is,
today, the fourth of September, the day that someone on the list said that
_Chronicles_ was supposed to hit the stores.  My roommate (Anagram) went to
look at his lunch break and found naught.  I, for one (dunno 'bout him), am WAY
bummed.  Anyone have more accurate information?

Now, to share a little bit of neatness.  A friend of mine just made a jaunt up
to Toronto to do some work or something (it surprised ME too, someone going to
Toronto and NOT on a Rush-quest, go figger!).  Before he left, I asked him to
bring me back some luggage tags from Toronto Airport (for those who don't know
the signifigance, the code for Toronto Airport is YYZ).  He succeeded in
spades!  Not only did he bring 3 tags (one in MINT condition), but he got
another tag that was quite interesting.  It was a parcel delivery tag or some
such (you know, with the fill-in-the-blanks for destination, etc.), and it was
a request for an accelerated delivery, or a Rush tag.  The "To:" black was
filled in with, you guessed it, YYZ.  So, effectively, the tag says "Rush to
YYZ!"  Neat, I thought.  They now hand in a place of honor above the TV,
attached to the fishnet we have on the wall behind it.

Subject: Chronicles

I saw Chronoicles in the record store today...  The packaging is impressive..
I didn't have the money to buy it, so someone else will have to post
about the inside etc..

I noticed one song (Show Don't Tell) from Presto made it on there....  this
baffles me since this of course off an Atlantic album...  I was under the
impression that this record would cover the Mercury years..

Does anyone know for sure what will be on the video??  BTW, although I
saw the Chronicles CD's in 2 record stores, the video was nowhere to be
seen.

Subject: airplay; new comer's list

 First let me confirm what Dan Kelley says about RUSH airplay in the Akron/
Cleveland area. There certainly isn't enough. This trend continues to the
immediate south in Youngstown (Oh.). If I hear 1 RUSH song an afternoon on
"The Wolf" I feel lucky. Sort of ironic since RUSH first received airplay on
WMMS in Cleveland.
 Here at school the airplay is not better. WJXQ, 106.1 Lansing, plays very
little RUSH, 2 songs a day if you're lucky. It also seems that they play the
san
(oops!P same song in repeated spurts then move on to another song. This group
includes Tom Sawyer, Closer to the Heart, Limelight, Fly By Night with the
stuff from Presto thrown in.
 Comment: Perhaps the reason RUSH gets less airplay than groups such as Zep is
because many of their songs tend to be longer than average. Any other comments.

 Our RUSH mngr. asked about topics to compile for newcomers. How about the
lists of favorite RUSH albums, songs, alltime groups etc. Just my humble
suggestion.

Subject: Chronicles (review), C-64, airplay

Hi Rushfans,

   I have info on 3 topics: Chronicles, (a review), C-64 stuff,
Rush airplay.

  CHRONICES REVIEW

  This may be one of the first Chronicles reviews but I'm sure
it's not the last.  I bought the album today at Tower Records,
(9/4/90), but couldn't find the video, (apparently, there's some
delay).  In a nutshell, don't bother buying this 2 CD set.  If
you have and extra $31.99 + tax, spend it on something else.

  The cover says "Rush Chronicles", etched on an old rust-covered
piece of metal rather than the original "smooth appearence", (old
and rusty?! Is Mercury trying to make a statment here?).  A large
golden sticker on the cover says, "Digitally Remastered".  The
liner notes credit a guy named Bob Ludwig as having done the
mastering, (not remastering).  Don't believe this marketing
bullshit.  The album was NOT digitally remastered, trust me.  The
album quality is crap.  Every pre-moving pictures track, (all of
Disc 1), is hiss-city.  Mercury/Polygram made no attempt to
"re-master" the album.  The tracks are as bad or worse than the
shitty sounding CDs.  Most songs could have been radically
improved with even the cheapest digital workstation available on the 
market.  Yet Mercury made absolutely NO ATTEMPT to improve or
re-master the original recordings.  (they didn't even bother to
remove the hiss before and after each track!)  The
signal-to-noise ratio is so low that it makes me puke.  The
sticker also said "2 1/2 hours of music".  Actually, it totaled 2
hours 23 minutes.  The large golden sticker on the cover is sadly
mistaken.

  Since the release of the first Rush CD by Mercury/Polygram,
(Moving Pictures, I think), I have been sadly disappointed.  The
original was just plain defective.  The beginning of the first
track, (Tom Sawyer), was cut off.  (Ludicrous!!).  After that, it
only got worse!  The rest of the CDs, (pre-Moving Pictures),
released were so hissy that it makes me puke to hear them!  The
problem is twofold:  The albums were not truly "remastered" and
they probably didn't come from the original "master" tapes.  Even
if they did come from the masters, they were probably doomed from
the beginning.  Most Pre-80's master tapes come from normal-bias,
Type-I ferric-oxide tapes.  These have a lousy signal-to-noise
ratio, (they're very hissy), and oxidize and degrade, (get
hissier), rapidly over time.  After years of sitting in the tape
vaults and getting played and copied, much of their original
sound is lost forever.  It wasn't until Moving Pictures and
Signals that Rush started digitally recording their work.  More
likely though, the earlier Rush CDs came from 3rd or 4th
generation tapes.  Anyway, compare an album with the CD and
you'll see what I mean.  The CD's are unbelievably hissy and have
almost no high-end.  What can I say.  Every track on Disc 1 is
practically drowned out in a sea of hiss and noise.  All I can
say is if you have a virgin vinyl "original release" Rush LP,
(not budget re-release), hang onto it and DON'T play it!  By the
way, 40% of all CD's currently released, or re-released, come
from vinyl!  NOT from tapes.  Many record companies have learned
their lesson.  Maybe Mercury will learn theirs.  It's no wonder
that Rush was opposed to the whole project from the start!   I
feel as Neil does that $31.99 is a rip-off for a 2 CD set.

  Anyway, the song linup for Chronicles differs only slightly
from the original press-release that I posted a year ago:

Disc 1:
Finding my way
Working Man
Fly By night
Anthem
Bastille Day
Lakeside Park
2112
a) Overture
b) Temples of Syrinx
What You're Doing (live)   &lt;==Cut from All the World's A Stage
A Farewell to Kings
Closer to the Heart
The Trees
La Villa Strangiato
Freewill
The Spirit of Radio

Disc 2:
Tom Sawyer
Red Barchetta
Limelight
A Passage to Bangkik (live) &lt;==Cut from Exit..Stage Left
Subdivisions
New World Man
Distant Early Warning
Red Sector A
The Big Money
Manhattan Project
Force Ten
Time Stand Still
Mystic Rhythms (live) &lt;== From A Show of Hands
Show Don't Tell

  Omitted was "Take Off (to the Great White North)" which Geddy
sang on the Bob and Doug album.  There is a nice 10 page insert
containing a 4 page profile on the band by John Swenson.  I have
to admit, it's an interesting experience to sit down and hear a
"chronology" of Rush recordings from their first album to their
most recent.  It's like a time trip.  Other than the novelty of
that experience, I can't see the value of the CD set to anyone.
For $31.99 you could easily buy 3 full-length Rush CDs, (or
anything else worth $31.99).

COMMODORE 64

  Somebody mentioned that they had a few Rush tracks on SID
player.  5 years ago I had a few for "Master Composer", I think.
I made 1 myself, (Red Barchetta), from the sheet music.  It was
pretty darn good, using all 3 voices and totalling 6 minutes.  I
also had Fly by Night and one other song.  If anybody's still
interested, send me a message and I'll see if I can dig it up.

RUSH AIRPLAY

  Someone else mentioned that Rush didn't receive too much
airplay in the Ohio area but that one DJ sometimes plays blocks
of it.  Growing up in New England, I found that a few stations,
(DJs rather), played lots of Rush, others didn't.  When I moved
to the Bay area, only KOME plays a serious amount of Rush.  One
DJ is a really big fan and he actually played "Battlescar" every
day for 1 week during the evening commute.  I heard a double shot
this evening, in fact.  I guess it depends on the DJs personal
interest.  It's ironic that Ohio doesn't get much airplay since
Rush practically owes their carrer to Donna Halper of QFM96 in
Columbus for getting them started in the early years.

  Well, I have to get some sleep.  Someone mentioned putting
together all the most common Rush questions.  I have another
idea.  I also have all the Rush postings back to the very
beginning and could put together a list of all the published
material, (ie, articles, interviews, tour programs, iteneraries,
etc).  This would take up a number of postings but I think it
would be a great resource for the subscribers.  I also have all
the lyrics from the lyrics server.  &lt;SYSOP, get back to me on
this if you're interested&gt;.  Well, I have to go.  Whoever get's
the Chronicles Video first, be sure to Post a review!

                                                    Take Care,

                                                 - Chris Michael
