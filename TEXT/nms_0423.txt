Hi all, yes indeedy, we're BACK ON THE AIR!

Thanks for putting up with the week-long hiatus, since it was about 200 of
you who made it possible in the first place.  My trip to southern CA was
incredible, seeing three shows and meeting lots of people.  Rest assured,
I'll bore you with a trip report in the next few days.  But now, I'm back,
mostly recovered from jet-lag, and will get back into the swing of things.

This issue will be the first of two issues for today, and the two will
contain all the mail that got here in the last week or so.  If you posted
something here and it didn't show up, feel free to send it again, or drop
me a line to see what's up.

There are about 200 mail items at the administrative address, so I'll be
plowing through those for another day or so.  In the meantime, some of you
who have submitted "remove me" requests may get another copy or two of the
NMS, but I *will* process all of them before too long, so you shouldn't be
unduly inundated with mail.  Just give me a little while to catch up, please!

Any changes/additions to the files available via ftp will be mentioned in the
next couple of days.

Enough of me blabbing, on with the show (of hands?)  !!

Subject: Mr. Big on Most Wanted

Here's something interesting that just happened.  I was flipping the channels
around and low and behold a couple of the members of Mr. Big were on MTV's most
Wanted tonight (I have to admit, I was stunned!).  Well, as the conversation
progressed the topic turned to none other than the Rush/Mr. Big tour in 1990.

Well, I have never heard any musicians praise other musicians as much as these
guys.  Basically they sounded as if they met their idols!!! (sound familiar?).
Well needless to say, they told stories about jamming on In the Mood (the VJ,
I think her name was Karen Bryant was dare I say "familiar" with In the Mood
and other Rush songs) and eating dinner with the boyz etc.  In fact the guitar
player even had all of his old Rush tapes autographed by the band.

In closing they came to the conclusion that dem boyz are the greatest thing in
the world!  FYI.

Neil said on a Dec 2 (I believe) Rock-Line that that particular story was
found in a mid-70's Car and Driver Magazine.  He didn't give a specific year
but seemed to suggest that a letter to the editors might prove fruitful.

Subject: Lakeside Park - so many memories ...

For what it's worth, I concur with the Lakeside Park-at-St.
Catherine's theory - mainly because St. Catherine's is where Neil
grew up, not in or near Toronto. Moreover, I was told by a St.
Catharine's Rush fan, Maryanne Hoekstra, that this is THE
Lakeside Park. (Maryanne is - or was - a Rush Backstage Club pen
pal, and says she knows some of Neil's relatives and one of his
former teachers, so I figure she has credibility.)

The park is in Port Dalhousie (pronounced DaLOOzy), which is
either a suburb or a neighborhood of St. Cat's. Neil used to live
in Port Dalhousie, Maryanne told me. Port Dalhousie is not on
most maps, but I was able to get directions to both it and
Lakeside Park by calling the St. Catherine's Chamber of Commerce
(which had never heard of the song, btw). It's on Lake Ontario,
natch, and easy to get to from Queen Elizabeth Way expressway.

Anyway, as of 1989 (May 24, of course), Lakeside Park was a nice
place, but indeed the magic has faded from the late '50s and
early '60s days that Neil presumably remembers it from. There's
still a lighthouse, and a pier, and of course the beach (where
it's probably now illegal to drink, smoke, or light fires,
respectively). I don't recall noticing any indications that
there was ever an amusement park there (I'm sure I would remember
a merry-go-round, defunct or no). There were no fireworks on the
particular Victoria Day evening that I visited. For entertainment,
there are a few small shops, a couple of nice restaurants, a few
lighted trees, and other people's memories on the breeze, but
that's about it.

For *real* Rush freaks, it's interesting to visit, worth bopping
off the freeway to check out. For anyone else, it's just another
place with a name.

I don't know if anyone has brought this up yet (I haven't been reading
TNMS for a month or so), but Request magazine voted Rush fans the worst
fans of any rock band.  Gee, I wonder what their criteria was.

Also, if anyone has bass tab to:  Roll the Bones, Working Man, or Kid
Gloves, please send it to me at the address listed at the top of this

Also, does anyone know if Rush will come back to or near (within a 5 hour

Tom,
Neil first read this story in Road & Track magazine. I started reading
R&T religiously in Feb. of 78 and I do remember reading that
particular story. It could be however that I read it in an older issue
that my dad had laying around his office. Anyhow, to find the story, I
would find a library that has a catalog of all previous R&T's and
start around 1975. USC has them so I'd imagine that UP or CMU would as
well. Good luck and let us know what you find. I'd like to read the
story again myself.

Greetings Rush Fans,

  	I'm writing _again_ to ask for votes in a poll I'm conducting.
Excluding the members of Rush, I'd like to know who you, Rush Fans, consider to
be the best:1)Keyboardist 2)Guitarist 3)Bassist 4)Drummer and 5)Vocalist.  I
know polls have been conducted before, but they haven't seemed to be too
succesful.  That is why I am posting this announcement to ask for YOUR votes.
Besides, with a mailing list of over 1100(?) we should get a pretty good
idea of what Rush fans really like.  So how 'bout it, give me your votes.
Your votes can be e-mailed to: smm0264@ritvax.isc.rit.edu
                               smm0264@ultb.isc.rit.edu

PS-  Depending upon the responce, I plan to post the results by 1 Febuary.
I know that many of you have just gotten done with your first semester.  I will
continue the poll long enough so that I will hopefully be able to collect your
votes as well.

Subject: Re: the t-shirt idea

Being as how most of my wardrobe consists of t-shirts, I'd buy an NMS shirt
if the price was reasonable.  As for artwork, I don't know what a good design
would be, but I can suggest color schemes I like:  red on black, red or black
on white.  I don't know how much the price goes up with extra colors, but
I'd rather have a cheaper shirt and just one color, personally, if the
difference was more than a couple of bucks....

Subject: Bad T-shirts
From: tiverson@lynx.northeastern.edu!

	I wholeheartedly agree with Dennis Rivard's grip about the poor
quality of t-shirts at Rush concerts.  For a band that is so concerned with
integrity as to rule out corporate sponsorship, and produce such great
tour books each year, it seems odd that they would allow such substandard
merchandise to be associated with them.  None of my Rush shirts (all bought
X-large when I saw the material--I wear medium) are wearable, from shrinking
and from fading of the designs.  And, to be frank, I'm not even too impressed
with the designs...although I do enjoy owning one of the infamous "Hold Your
Fir" misspelled t-shirts.
	I do have a bit of advice, sad though I am to make it.  Buy homemade
t-shirts.  I bought a blue tie-dye with the star/man logo on the front and
the tour list on the back (both in red) that looks very cool, is printed
with high-quality ink and such, is on a good-quality shirt, and cost $10
less than the shirts I saw inside (this was in Philly).  There were about
a million of a multi-color design that were _much_ better than the official
designs floating around, and in all I probably saw 20 different designs being
sold.
	I hate to recommend this, because I'd rather buy good shirts _and_
give my $ to the band (does anyone know what % they get?), but I just can't
conscience paying $20 for a shirt that I can wear five times.  My God, I
can buy three live shows on tape for that! ;-)  Oh, well, my 2 pfennigs...
 	By the way, the word "grip" on the first line of this posting is
supposed to be "gripe".  Comes from typing with my forehead...

Ok, I think I'm going to go ahead and make a design...BUT I want your
help. If you have any favorite Rush images or particular images that
make you think of the National Midnight Star, please drop me a note
at crenshaw@netcom.com and I'll see if I can work you ideas into the
shirt.

The best brainstorm I've had so far is to have the shirt look
like the front of one of those National Enquirer/Star etc. rags and
instead of Liz and Dolly and JFK and Ellllvis we can have Geddy and
Alex and Neil and Ellll--er, um, I mean...well, you get the picture.
Make up some good juicy headlines and we're all set.

So send me your ideas!  I'd also like to get a tally going to find
out how many of these we're going to need to print, so drop me a line
if you're willing to pay around $10 (final cost will depend on how
many shirts, among other things) for one of these things.

Thanks,

Greetings...

I was paging through a rag called "The Goldmine" and I saw a number
of ads for companies that sell bootleg CD's.  I was wondering if
anyone has purchased anything from these companies and could provide
expert testimonial to their credibility.  Which of these places has
the best selection of Rush?  What are the best Rush boots to buy?
One company called the "CD Connection" ( located in Heidelberg,
Germany ) has the following on sale: any of 'em good?

        Live Under Pressure  ( Pittsburgh 1984 )
           heard rumors that this one was actually the audio
           from the GuP tour video...  true?

	About the T-shirts...my brother owns and operates a T-shirt business

volume).  He's done things for me before (including making me a custom RUSH
T-shirt...very nice, way better looking than any T's I've ever gotten
at one of their concerts).  Anyway, if anyone's interested I could help with
the T-shirt idea, I have the resources to get really good quality at prices

Subject: back from break

Well, hello all you residents of Schmeng!

I'm back from Christmas break and just read through about
20 issues of TNMS. Took a couple hours.
Doesn't seem like much happened while I was gone, other than
the Grammy thing.
I guess that's my only question: when is Grammy night and do
the boys have a show that night? I mean how important is this to
them? If hell just does happen to freeze over that night and
they get the Grammy, would they be there to accept it, I mean,
if they didn't have a show that night? I don't even know where
the awards ceremony is but, maybe, if they were only a couple hours
away by plane or something, they might make it, again, providing they
have the night off. Or do they just not give a shit?

Anyway, it would be a thrill to see them win AND get up there
in front of the world and accept it. Who cares if the whole audience
says "Who are they?" Everyone here would certainly appreciate it.

Oh well, I guess the chances of that are very slim.

Oh! I was in Camelot a couple weeks ago buying the Led Zep boxset, right?
Well, I dont know how widespread Camelot is, but it's this chain of
record stores and about half of their locations have this huge
video wall made of sixteen seperate tv screens. Well, I'm walking
around the store and then I hear a very familiar tune playing. They
were playing the Roll the Bones video on this huge screen. It was
pretty cool.

One more thing. I'd like to shake the hand of the guy who referred to
Kurt Loder as Lode(of Crap)r. I laughed out loud when I read that
and it still gives a smile when I think about it. I hate that guy!
He even has an essay in the LZ boxset!! It's the worst thing I've
ever read. He starts out marvelling about Robert Plant's glistening
chest and dubious satin clad bulge. What a loser! Loder?

Well, seeya all later!

Subject: Polls / What makes great music
From: Howard_Bartel@mindlink.bc.ca (Howard Bartel)

While I voted in Sean Morrison's "Best Instrumentalists/Vocalist" poll, I
doubt that the poll results will really mean much to me.  For one thing,
there are so many good guitarists, bassists, etc. in both rock and jazz
that it is very difficult for anyone to have a wide enough knowledge to
say who the _best_ is.  Secondly, IMO, vocal and instrument-playing
ability are just one aspect of what makes great music, and certainly not
the most important.  Just recently I've tried to determine exactly what
elements are common to artistically great music, and came up with the
following categories, in order of importance to me:

1.  Composition.  This is the actual notes, rhythms, dynamics, etc. that
    make up the song -- those things that can be described in written
    music.  Too many songs these days lack in this area, and sound like
    the same songs reworked over and over again.  Songs that have some
    level of innovation and abstraction (eg. Rush's time-signature     changes
in Cygnus X-1 and Hemispheres; the morse-code beginning to     YYZ) are much
more satisfying to me than simplistic, formula music,     regardless of how
talented the musicians are.  Too often great     composers are shunned by the
general population, because most people
    are not open-minded enough to accept things outside their musical
"comfort zone".  I have to admit, many of my now-favourite Rush songs
    took more than a few listens to really appreciate.  J.S. Bach was not
    popularly recognized until the 1820s, over 70 years after his death.
    With extremely simplistic rock music and rap dominating the music
industry these days, I think the general populace is even harder to
    reach now than it was in the 18th century, although Rush has the
advantage of mass worldwide distribution and radio airplay (limited     as it
is...).

2.  Choice and balance of instruments (including vocals) and sound
    effects.  This is how well the chosen instrument/singer fits with the
    composition, also how sound effects, or other non-traditional
instruments, can serve to enhance the music.  I think of the     backwards tape
used on the Beatles "Tomorrow Never Knows", or Queen's
    unique vocal harmonies in "Death on Two Legs", or the sound effects
used in the ATWAS version of "By-Tor" as a few good examples.  It     also
includes balance between instruments -- there are many popular
    guitarists whose songs I find boring quickly, because the bass and     the
drumming are uninteresting and/or drowned out.  I've heard some     heavy metal
where the bass sounds more like constant background     distortion...  Rush, on
the other hand, does things like switching
    between Lee's bass and Lifeson's electric guitar for lead (eg. in
"Xanadu") for artistic effect, and you can always hear every     instrument
clearly.  Even in Lifeson's "improv" section in "A Lerxst
    in Wonderland", the drumming is still interesting, without taking
    away from the guitar, which has the spotlight at that point.

3.  Technical instrumental/vocal ability.  This is essentially technical
    skill with an instrument, or in singing ability.  I'm sure there's no
    disputing here that all the members of Rush are world class     musicians.
What is more surprising is that they actually _use_ that
    talent creatively.  The Beatles (except Ringo) are excellent vocally,
    but they lack in instrumental ability, except for those songs which
employ orchestral musicians, eg. the violins in "Eleanor Rigby".

4.  Production.  This includes whether the song is done live or in     studio,
what kind of editing and mixing is done.  Whether     intentionally or not (I
heard that Geddy doesn't like ESL that much),
    I think that most of Rush's songs are greatly improved when done     live.
Not all -- I think "Tom Sawyer", "Spirit of the Radio", and     other songs
that rely more heavily on studio sound effects, overlayed
    instrumental tracks, etc. are better in studio, but I think "Red     Sector
A" is especially improved with the added echo effect in the     live version,
and most of their hard-edged songs are improved with     the harder-sounding
guitars that are used in concert.  Editing and     mixing also has an obvious
effect on song quality (compare any     bootleg to an officially released live
album, or the difference     between AAD and DDD compact discs for studio
albums).

5.  Lyrics.  Are they thoughtful, do they fit with the music?  Do they
communicate in a creative way?  I think Rush is very fortunate to
    have a brilliant lyricist like Peart; although lyrics are not the
    foremost thing I look for, they certainly add another creative
    dimension to the song.

I think Rush excels in every point above, except perhaps Geddy Lee's vocal
abilities in earlier Rush albums, and this is just one aspect of (2) and (3).
The popular rating system would probably be:

1. Image  (looks, dancing ability, flashy videos)
2. Vocal ability
3. Instrumental ability
4. Production
5. Lyrics
&gt; ...and virtually unnoticeable...
6. Choice and balance of instruments/effects
7. Composition
Back to the issue of polls, I would be more interested in the continued
results of Anthony Delbusso's poll of favourite bands/composers, covering all
genres of music, since this does not isolate any one aspect
of what makes for interesting, creative music.  Or maybe even more interesting
would be a poll on everyone's favourite three non-Rush songs/musical works.

Well I think that's enough for today.  I'd be interested in other people's
thoughts on what makes great music, and how other bands stack
up according to your criteria.  I can hardly wait for the Feb. 2 concert
in Vancouver !!!

As luck would have it, I have one flakey friend too many, and
it has left me with an extra ticket to the 2nd Oakland show
(Jan 30, Section 122 Row H - real close to the stage, but looking
at it from a 90-degree angle: check your phone book for details)

Subject: Las Cruces rocked!
Date: Sun, 19 Jan 92 16:08:56 MST

Hello readers!

This is probably one of at least 4 reviews of the Las Cruces show.  I had a
great time, I got to meet Elise, who got Ian and Pat their tickets, and
discovered what a great place the Pan-Am center is to see a show.

The only non-Rush thing I'll say is that I liked Primus enough so that I am
planing to purchase their latest album.

As for the Rush portion.....

Opened with Force 10.  The "Rockin' Constructivists" background video was
great, and had the marquis headline "Skulls on Ice."  (Compare with "Attack
of the Killer Bunnies" from the Presto tour.)

I noticed Neil grimacing a lot early on.  Probably because of a few small
technical mistakes that most audience members missed.  (Y'know, uneven double
BD licks, rushing fills, and things like that were what I noticed.)  They
played Limelight, which was welcomed back after a small hiatus from previous
tours with a roar from the crowd.  Alex's long, drawn-out style was wonderful,
and Limelight is a song that really shows it off.

After a few more old songs, Geddy introduced Dreamline, and they went into it,
with few, if any, mistakes.  Dreamline featured an extended guitar solo, which
Alex again shined.  They played Bravado, which the audience really seemed to
get into early on.  (I thought they took a little too much time to end Bravado,
but the mix may have drowned out some subtleties.)

Other new stuff they played included (for the first time on this tour, I
believe) Ghost of a Chance.  It needs a better mix, but it wasn't too bad.
They also played Roll The Bones, which had the cool video, the audience rapping
along with the skeleton, and Alex's little toy skeleton vibrating on top of one
of the stage speakers.

The best part of the main show was the extended jam leading into Where's My
Thing.  It started off with Neil playing the same pattern he plays in the
studio version's beginning, with Alex playing long notes, and Geddy JAMMING
up a storm on the bass.  It sounded very jazzy, and was a great intro into a
great song.  This also had an extended guitar solo.

The encore started with Spirit of Radio (I LOVE that song!), and was followed
by almost all of Xanadu, and snippets from 2112, Red Barchetta, most of Finding
My Way, and a bit more of Spirit of Radio.

It was a good show, especially for a first show on the leg.  Alex was ON TOP,
and Neil and Geddy weren't bad either.

Have fun!  And I hope you all get to catch them live (if you haven't already).

I've got some floor seats (Sec. 10 Row 16) available for the
Austin show.  Precisely 2 floor seats.

I will sell them at face value since I do not like scalpers.
If you are a scalper, forget it, because if I see non-NMSers
or friends in those seats, I'll hit the roof!  The scalpers
nearly prevented us from getting good seats despite waiting
two days of nearly freezing wind chill outside to get them.

But they failed!  We have front row seats.

So I've got two extra decent floor seats at the $24.00 price--
no convenience charge, no charge for our time.  Just the desire
to help fellow fans out.  E-mail me if interested; if no
response within a week, I'm posting to austin.general, etc....

Subject: Rebellion, Satanism, Televangelists, and RUSH!

    I saw something that may interest somebody out there. Tonight I was
flippin through the channels and came upon onee of those BS televangelist 
shows.
I usually skip em, but this one caught my attention. The guy was talking to
some other guy (in a recording studio, of all places), about the "dangers of
rock music", how it affects our youth, blah blah. I was taking this with a 
grainuntil they offered a videotape of the dangers of r-n-r. The tapes gave 
the guy's
narrowminded views on rock&satanism, philosophy of life, backmasking (they
rewound a part of Zep's "Stairway" from "Song Remains the Same" - this got me),
etc. to anyone who would shell out $80. While they were talking about the tape,
they played songs in the background, and as the announcer stopped talking, 
right
bebefore the end, what do I hear but "temples of syrinx, our brave 
computers..."
That's right, 2112! (sounded live to me).
     I am wondering several things. First of all, how did Mr. evangelist get
the idea that Rush is satanic? What I am saying is, are there many rumors
circulating within the general public about it? Of course, all the mandatory
groups were included: Zep, Slayer, AC/DC, Megadeth, Priest. But RUSH?! Come on!
I am quite certain that this guy knows nothing about a)religion, b)rock music,
cc) today's youth (so impressionable, we are), and d)Rush. The concept of 
Satanism has absolutely nothing to do with 2112, at least not with the "priests
of the Temples of Syrinx.." I hope this guy doesn't think that Rush were
starting a cult of some kind with that album. And as for a philosophy of life,
I
see 2112 as a reflection of normal human acts, at least according to Neil from
Rockline last December. The _concept_ album mirrored the band's own feelings.
Now if anyone says the boyz are satanic, _I_ want to hear it. (Can't wait to
see Ged bite the head off a chicken in the middle of Time Stand Still :-])
Personally, I think the guy just picked out any group that has a pentagram on
the cover of any of its albums.

Oh well, just my 2.718 cents worth...

Subject: Interesting sounds in The Camera Eye

Hello again, my excellant friends!

Quick question - On the Moving Pictures CD, around the 8:54 mark
in The Camera Eye, I hear what sounds like someone belching, and
someone saying something right after this.  Anyone else notice
this?
	By the way, last night (sat. the 18th), I had the honor
of being the 1st one into the world premiere of the "LaserRush"
show at the Cleveland Agora.  This awesome show had about 2 hours
of the boyz's best songs, and 4 songs were accompaignied (sp?) by
the matching concert video footage.  All this was set to LOTS of
cool lasers!  This show will be going on a U.S. tour soon, starting
off back in Cleveland!  DON'T MISS THIS!!!!  (Yes, there were 3D
glasses for xtra cool effects).
	Dat's all for now.  Keep rockin' and rollin' the bones!
