Subject: Madonna Ripping off Rush ????

  This was on MTV website.I don't know what song they're talking about?

Lately, portions of Madonna's "Ray Of Light" have also turned up in its
show , and Pearl Jam talked with MTV News recently
about how the song had worked its way into the band's live set.

"Ed has been singing 'Ray of Light,'" said
guitarist Stone Gossard, "and he's pretty into that song...I think it's
a great song."

"It reminds me of some old Rush song
though," added bassist Jeff Ament, "like the chorus and the melody, you know?"

"I can't believe Madonna is ripping-off Rush," Gossard said, "but [the cover 
songs have] been fun. The best part has been to be able to play different
songs off different records every night -- that's the fun of having
five records.

Subject: Fat Boy Slim

Er..., I should just like to apologise for the rantings of my 
compatriot Slim, who appears not to know the difference between 
basketball and baseball (yes, I know Jordan played some baseball 
too).  Most of the kids at my younger brothers' school could tell you 
who Michael Jordan is and probably Dennis Rodman.  It is a generation 
thing, but Slim is right that as far as most of us are concerned, the 
basketball comparisons are pretty arcane, and his point about the 
world series is correct - no one in Europe gives a monkeys.

Ouch, I bet our English TNMS contributors will have a hard time with =
that comment.  To shed some light, Maradonna (from Argentina) is =
infamous for "single handedly" beating England in the 1986 Mexico World =
Cup (I believe quarter finals) by using his hand to deflect the ball =

Subject: Re: Phil & Live Aid (Music content, but no mention of Rush)

     Gary recently posted in TNMS #2177:
     
     "While I'm at it, John Caufield wrote about Phil Collins..."
     
     -> First off, my name is spelled "Caulfeild".  Thanks. :)
     
     My original post in an earlier TNMS:
     
      FYI - Phil Collins has also been the subject of a rather long-winded
     (and at times, rather heated!) thread on the Led Zeppelin mailing 
     list.  What began as comments on Phil's talents (or lack thereof)     
     during Zep's Live Aid reunion, digressed into comparisons between his 
     and John Bonham's styles (much like has been going on in TNMS in the 
     Peart vs. Collins debates).
     
     Gary's reply in TNMS# 2177:
     
     "First of all, the guys asked Phil if he would play with them, then 
     stuck him next to Tony Thompson. Never mentioned there'd be another 
     drummer. Just put him there. Tony acted like he was the only drummer, 
     not giving Phil room to play. So, after a while, Phil just laid back.
     Now did you catch his set with Eric Clapton? I bet Tony Thompson did."
     
     -> Hey Gary, I wasn't trying to express an opinion one way or the 
     other on Phil's performance with Zep.  I was just summarizing the 
     discussion on the Zep list.
     
     I realize that Robert Plant had asked Collins if he'd drum for them 
     (on rather short notice too), but regardless of the circumstances, 
     history now shows that Zep's reunion at Live Aid was severely lacking 
     in good drumming.  The debate on the Zep mailing list was discussing 
     this, but at times, it got into personal attacks on Phil.  I have 
     nothing against Phil Collins, or his contributions to music at large, 
     but I do think he underestimated the complexity of Zep's music when he 
     agreed to help out at Zep's Live Aid reunion.  Messing up on "Whole 
     Lotta Love" and a few slips during "Stairway" doesn't indicate to me 
     that Phil was "laying back". (shrug)
     
     Tony Thompson, on the other hand, was asked to play because Plant and 
     Jimmy Page liked his work with Power Station, and to his credit, Tony 
     found the time to rehearse with the band (albeit only a few hours 
     before they hit the stage) - unlike Phil who went on without prior 
     rehearsal.
     
     As for Phil's set with Clapton, it doesn't stand out in my memory like 
     Zep's performance.  Zep was the reason I was basically tuned in to 
     Live Aid that day back in '85 (well, Zep and Madonna's pointy 
     brassiere).  I'd have to dig up my tapes. :)
     
     Obligatory Rush content: Wouldn't it have been cool to see Rush 
     perform at Live Aid?  The day was dominated by 80's synth-pop artists; 
     it would've been refreshing to hear our boys play a set for the cause. 
      Perhaps they could've played the "Fear" trilogy or something?  I 
     guess neither Geddy, Alex or Neil kept in touch with Bob Geldof, or 
     else Geldof & Co. didn't care for The Boys' brand of music.
     
     Cheers,
     John

Subject: Best Bassists

Hello all,

I haven't read through a NMS in a couple of years, but I've started
again to see what is goin down.

And I noticed a "Chris Squire vs. Geddy Lee" thread.  Well, I'm going to
give in give my opinion.

Not only are there guys out there who MAY be better than Geddy, there
are a ton of them.  Don't get me wrong.  Geddy is certainly my
favorite.  His style is awesome.  I'd listen to him before anyone
else...however.  There are many cool guys out there that I have been
exposed to.  And there are hundreds more that are probably just as good
or better.

Some excellent bassists:  Victor Wooten.  The bassist for Bela Fleck and
the Flecktones...absolutly unbelievable, maybe the best I've ever
heard.  He has a few solo albums out there, too.  I've had the
priveledge to see him live.....wow.

Michael Manring.  This guy rocks.  His only rock album, "Thonk," is so
damn cool.  He's a jazz bassist at heart, however.  He does some real
nutty things, but is incredibly musical.

Jaco.  Jaco Pastorius.  Not only is he phenominal (jazz) but he's an
innovator of a lot fo bass techniques you hear today.

Those are just three guys.  But each need to be mentioned when talking
about a "Best Bassist" list.

Email me personally with any comments...

Subject: Rush Kids - Baseball a US Sport? - Garth Brooks

Terri Doer asked: "Are there other parents out there who have raised their
children while listening to Rush?"

My 2.5 year old daughter's favorite band is prounonced "Brush" :)  and for
awhile whenever she heard rock music would scream out "BRUSH DADDY!".
Although she can now discern Rush from other bands, and is quick to scream out
BRUSH when she hears Ged's voice.  Her favorite song from DS is "Show Don't
Tell".

Also, Hans implied baseball is strictly a domestic U.S. sport.  Well don't
tell Geddy that, we like to keep him fooled into thinking its ok for Canadians
to enjoy the sport, not to mention a few million Japanese, and those in South
and Central America.

On a completely different note, my sister, who's a NY theater actress,

She was watching Regis & Kathie Lee of all things, and during an intro for

Greetings fellow Rushers! Long time reader first time poster. This is mainly 
for your interest. By the time you read this post it will probably be 
history. But due to civic progress, another Landmark in our great city of 
St. Louis, will be /is now history. Just great memories of concerts gone by. 
As of 520pm central time the St. Louis Arena will have been imploded. I saw 
Rush there about 4 times before they started playing Riverport Amphitheatre. 
For anyone interested you probably can catch it on CNN or surf the web at 
www.postnet.com
(the local newspaper)and check out some info on it. The local radio station 
Kshe-95 has shirts for the event for sale. it has the Arena on the front, (a 
photo from b-4 the tornado, for those who know). And on the back has all the 
roch shows that played there from '71-'94. You can find them at 
[www.kshe95.com] if you have real audio they have a great classics show from 
8-12 c/t on sunday mornings. Got to go, the Arena will be missed but not 
forgoten. Kinda reminds me of "Trees", see ya.... Earl.

I just read the last two issues, and I can't believe no one else has posted
on this yet.  Bet ya 5 bucks, there's 3 other posts like mine in this
issue.  Anyway, I was watching the "Rock and Rockets" concert on pay per
view the other night, they had six or seven different groups/artists one of
which was Better than Ezra, filmed in Orlando Florida.  Better than Ezra
was at a pause in their performance of "Rosalita" when the lead
guitarist/singer kicked into "Limelight".  The band started to join in when
he stopped them and started the guitar intro to "Spirit of the Radio".  The
crowd went nuts.  They only played a few seconds of each song then went
back into "Rosalita".  To be honest, he kind of slaughtered the SOR part,
but I thought it was pretty damn cool anyway.

Hi,
I have noticed alot of stuff about Neil vs Phil Collins and other drummers.
In my humble opinion, Neil is one of the best ever.  As for other drummers,
here's some that I think are excellent:

Roger Taylor - Queen, The Cross
Cozy Powell - The Brian May Band
Keith Moon - The Who

Anyway, bye for now

This had me laughing out loud. You gotta love a sport where a country is
still bitter over a play that happened 13 years ago. (For the NBA fans
listening: "The Hand of God" goal where in the '86 World Cup for
Argentina Diego Maradona cheated and knocked in the winning goal with
his hand against England)

I have to agree. Neil is much more of a team player than Maradona ever
was. I have to go with the Kaiser, Franz Beckenbauer, the revolutionary
sweeper who controlled Germany's defense and showed the world that
fullbacks can go past the halfway line, as a good match for Neil. He
held his role but would move up and take over the game at key moments.

How about Alex? Definitely a forward, but I'm having a hard time coming
up with someone with his joy of performing and sense of humor. Maybe
Chris Waddle? Great moves, some mind-blowing shots, just forget about
Italy '90...

Please quit all that or I'll start comparing Collins, Peart, Lee, et
al to our local drummer and bassist "heroes" of whom you have
absolutely no idea how good they are... would be as boring for you to
read my postings as it is for me to read your postings... 

>Sholz guitar emulator thingy

You must be referring to Monsieur Tom Scholz (note the spelling), the
great talent behind a (one-man-)band called Boston? And the device
must be "Rockman", right?

Oh, Rush content? Hmmm... maybe I should replace the Boston CD with a
Rush CD first...

>the trees

Either canucks vs yanks, your country vs your stoopid neigboring
country, men vs women, kids vs parents, gay people vs. hetero people,
fat people vs skinny people, white folks vs black folks (slavery), US
army vs indians, turkish people vs kurdish people, poor people vs rich
sonnawabitches, basketball lovers vs soccer fans, any minority group

>rush phone tones

http://jukeboksi.radiolinja.fi/ is the place to go and listen to and
to compose your own ringing tone. Too bad you have to be roaming in
Finland and your phone has to be a Nokia 6110, 6150, 8110i, 8810 phone
(or any Nokia 9xxx Communicator series phone anywhere in the world;
this one requires only some help from someone living/roaming in
Finland) in order to use the tones you or someone else created and
added to those pages.... The other drawback for you must be the
jibberish language on those pages ;0) English pages are not available
for the ringing tone composer part. Here's where you can test the tone
composer:

http://jukeboksi.radiolinja.fi/Saveltaja/Urku.html

I've seen at least 2 versions of YYZ on those pages. Lousy ones.
Mine's better ;0) Not that I've composed it myself...

Im not so talented when it comes to music (read: no can undestand them
notes :0), but if someone is more talented and wants to create a Rush
ringing tone and use it as a ringing tone in his/her cell phone, I'd
be glad to help: I can fetch any tone from those pages and forward it
as a short message to your GSM 900 Mhz phone or in case you have a
Nokia 9000 Communicator for 1900 (US) or 1800 (UK, Germany, Oz, etc.)
MHz I can send the tone via email for you to download into your
Communicator...

Ok, enough of this commercial kinda talk, even tho I have nothing to
do with Nokia my nose is big and I sure am ugly! ;0)

DRUMMERS
The judge said:
<<Tim "Herb" Alexander from Primus (formerly) - this guy is just amazing -
period. I am not a Primus fan, but...>>

YESS!! He is totally amazing... and totally baffling.

<<Danny Carey from Tool - just a damn good player>>

Not technically I suppose, but aesthetically - YESS!! I agree.

Has anyone heard Todd Trainer from Steve Albini's new band Shellac? I
haven't heard him, but many say he's really great!

TROLLING
Mike Kerns' troll cannot, by any stretch of the word, be called 'thinking'.
I cannot believe a Rush fan would speak this way -- then again, I may be
naive. I hope that the Rush-mgr will in the future banish such foulness
>from the list.

And Mr Nickb, you're alright!! I'm with you - on this, at least. But I
think you might be wasting your time slugging it out on TNMS. Personally, I
think life is elsewhere - life is also short. No? :-) And living life on a
mailing-list, as some are prone to do, itself seems to be an act of cynicism.

I was talking with my Dad about Animate.  He is a Jungian analyst so I =
was asking him if this is a love song.  He said that it could be if one =
is referring to the self-love a man can have for his feminine side.  =
This song isn't about the love between two people, however.

There are three songs from PeW on DS and they are all on Disc 2.  That =
is a lot!  It is equal to the number of songs from PeW on E...SL!
=20
It is surprising to me that Half The World doesn't appear on DS.  =
Especially after Geddy had said this was one of his favorites off t4e.  =
Another surprise is the fact that Witch Hunt is on ASoH.  Where did this =
one come from?
=20
I had a comment with regard to the discussion of the HEY! shouts during =
2112: Overture.  For the Signals tour, they actually paused the music =
each time so that the crowd shouting HEY! was the only thing heard.  I =
believe this the first time that the crowd interaction was emphasized =
this much by the band.

Ok...I'll bite,

Seventh grade, many moons ago, on the rebound from Kiss "Dynasty" (the last
Kiss album I was to buy), a good friend and respected music critic for the
time (7th grade, remember) would always brag about this band, "Rush." So to
get his goat, I would always respond, "Rush sucks." Finally one day in art
class, while working on reproducing album covers as a special assignment
(mine was Steve Winwood "Arc of a Diver" - matching that colour was a
bitch!), my friend had had enough. So he told me to supply him with a tape
and he would record 2 songs for me, assured I would love them. The next day
found him with a Memorex 60 minute blank (in a funny, hinged 2-piece case
with white stops for the rollers) in which to record this "miracle music."
The day after, I'm sitting at home with my jaw on the floor as TS and SotR
roar thru my JC Penny stereo. Needless to say, a goat died that day.

Take care,
Chris

I don't know if a transcript exists, but in Ged's fall of 1987 Rockline 
appearance he did mention that Alex had invented seveal items including 
a backlit music stand for Geddy. Somebody had asked what the Omega 
Concern was, and Geddy gave the answer that it was what Alex's

>What was YOUR introduction to Rush? Who, what, where, when, and how?

This kid in my algebra 2 class in high school (is there an Andrew from Helix
High on this mailing list?  Andrew from Helix?) lent me what I now think to be a
bootleg of some sort, because it featured a live version of Roll the Bones (as
we know, not released officially until DS).  It was in 11th grade, so three...
almost four years ago.  He also had with him a printout of all of the lyrics,
which seem to have been straight from the NMS webpage, though I could be wrong
(how long has the NMS page been around, anyway?).  What caught my interest with
Rush was the clarity of the music itself, it wasn't muddy and indistinct, but
crisp and definite. I was also drawn in by the lyrics and the clarity with which
Ged sings them.  I bought a few albums.  Then a few more.  Then all of them, and
the rest is history.

To the guy who was interested in how people became Rush fans, here is my
story, in short of course! Basically, in 1979, my older brother had
borrowed a copy of "2112" from a friend of his, and I listened to it out
of curiosity.( I was ten years old at the time.) I can honestly say that
>from the first time I heard Rush, I instantly liked them a lot! The next
year I was fortunate enough to see them in concert here in Cincinnati,
and that was it! From that point on, I had to get my hands on every Rush
album available!  Later!     Steve Eads

I had been thinking about suggesting this exact thread! Good one John!

When : 1984
Where: New Zealand
Album: GUP
How  : I was ~15 at the time, and was starting to pick up on the
       musical tastes of several American neighbours. The fact that
       several rather cute females were involved had nothing to do
       with it :^)
       After hearing GUP, I rapidly obtained Signals, PW, MP, 2112,
       and ESL.

As a sidenote, the young ladies who introduced me to the joys
of Rush no longer listen to Rush themselves.

there were 5 Genesis live albums, (Genesis Live, Seconds Out, Three Sides
Live, and The two "Way We Walk" albums) and Bruford plays mostly
everything on Seconds out,<<<<

Actually...Bruford is only featured on one track on the album (and this is
taken straight from the liner notes on the album...)  Chester did most of the
drums except for:

Robbery, Assault & Battery--keyboard solo, Phil
Firth of Fifth--Phil & Chester
Musical Box--Chester & Phil
Supper's Ready-Apocalypse 9/8--Chester & Phil
Cinema Show--Bill Bruford, Phil during keyboard solo
Los Endos--Phil & Chester....

>>From what I've gandered about the Genesis history from back then, was Bill
Bruford helped out for a short while on the drumming, until they hired Chester
Thompson as their full time backing drummer....Phil commonly played during
sections that he wasn't singing, or at least would duet with Chester very
frequently

Given that Bill wasn't really playing with them for very long...only one track

Can anyone help me on finding posters for sale at a secure sight? I need a DS

please direct me to a web site that I could buy a few things. I have only been
a fan for about three years and I need to catch up. 
Plus to those who care the King Crimson DVD kicks ass. The disc has about
eight different camera angles. You can watch any musician you want to plus
many other angles. The disc is in DTS and Dolby Digital.  And another thing to
those of you who want Rush tours on DVD (or remaster video) have you seen "A
work in progress" ?  If not they play a clip of Xanadu from Exit Stage Left
the picture is amazing.  If there is not going to be a DVD at all soon (due to
polygrams DVD troubles) at least give us a remaster of videos.  Does anyone
else think Rush could release more live albums to stimulate us rather then
sell us and themselves out?  I do, for one.

TOP TEN THOUGHTS OF TODAY
(the email equivalent of a chat room's ".")

10.  Boy I wish I had something humorous to write.

  9.  What if we invented a style of golf that had to be played as "Rush Rules"?

  8.  The extended ending to Bravado on DS is probably the best live enhancement
to a Rush song ever (and I'll brook no arguments).  The first time I heard it, I
was openly weeping.  If I ever meet Geddy Lee, I am going to thank him
personally.  If I ever meet Neil, I'll ask him, "What happened to your pig
tail?" right after I find out when he's gonna pay back the twenty bucks he owes
me.

  7.  Have you seen the screen saver with the dancing babies?  For a few
seconds, each baby does a little air guitar parody and the resemblance to Lerxst
during the Permanent Waves era is both exhilarating and frightening.  If I ever
met Alex, I'll ask him if they sampled his baby pictures.  After all, real
babies don't move like that.  (I already tried it with my nieces and nephews --
trial date is still pending)

  6.  My girlfriend is allergic to latex.  I really like the last half of the
Rhythm Method on DS; it could be the drum track for just about any top ten song
for the last ten years (by mariah carey or whitney houston), but it ain't and
that is just too cool.

  5.  If Phil Collins boards a train to Manchester at 10:15 and Neil gets on his
cycle in Leeds at 11:30 and both of them run out of kleenex at around noon, who
is the better drummer?

  4.  Geddy Lee is the Mary Tyler Moore of bass players.

  3.  Alex invented the Omega Guitar Stand (tm), new relief for hemmroid
sufferers (Lerxst Rinse and Shine -- ask for it by name) and the semi-colon.

  2.  When I was a kid, my friends and I bought Rush ALBUMS [and except for 
the first two, they all had liner notes] so there was never any doubt as to 
what the lyrics of song actually were.

  1.  When naming my new cats, I called the boy kitty "Gord Downy" (sp) from 
the tragically hip and the girl kitty "aimee mann", but my lady friend keeps 
calling her "aimee girl" because she is hardly manly.  I believe I will keep 
all three of them...in the cellar.  [I'm KIDDING]
