Holy numbers Rushman!

We've now passed the 1000 mark on the electronic petition, way to go! We've
also almost hit 800 posts on the RNRHOF message board (which makes 700 posts
in the last 10 days, woo hoo!)

Also, look for some new stuff showing up on the web page. Now that I've 
pretty much relinquished control of the Live site, I have much more time
(yeah right). Ok, well at least I can pretend I have more time! The Rush 
covers listing will be making its debut (thanks to Al Horta), along with
30-second clips of each of the songs! I have some updates for live concert
pictures & license plates, will move all the TFE dates into the main tour 
dates listing, and plan to finally get around to putting up the setlists 
for each tour.

In other news, anyone on this glorious list into cross stitch? I know, it's not
a manly thing to do ;-)  but I downloaded an AWESOME program that converts
images into a chart, plugged in the Grace Under Pressure cover, and now I'm 
off! (I always do the hardest things first :-)

It'll end up being about 36" x 30" on 14-count (ie. 14 stitches per inch) and
has over 100 colors. Maybe I should put up digital pictures of the banner as 
I go. heh. I'm hoping to have it done by May, anyone into taking bets? *grin*
I know, I'll put it up on the posters/banners page, list it as the rarest
banner ever, one in existance, and see if I get any offers... hee hee...

through the postings on the R&RHOF induction site when I noticed this

mid '80s, would you please write back to me?  I tried sending you an

Hi Rushians!

What?!  You're an expert, but hadn't heard of Dionysus?
Hmmm...makes me doubt your credentials.  ;)

I was into G, R & E mythology when I was a teenager too.  I still
like those stories.  It's amazing how many books, movies, etc.
are based on those mythologies (Xena or Hercules anyone?).

Although I knew that Dionysus and Bacchus were the same
god/different culture, I never consciously connected Bacchus
Plateau and Hemispheres.  I've been on the NMS for a few years
and no one has mentioned it before, so Matt gets first dibs on
discovery.  Looking at the lyrics, though, I don't see a
connection between the two songs.

IMHO, BP is talking about plateauing, or leveling off, in one's
life after a difficult struggle.  For example, a band works for
years trying to get gigs, record company interest, a fan base,
etc.  Finally, they reach some notoriety or fame.  Then things
start to "plateau" and the band continues at this new level for a
while.  The song seems to be about that leveling off period, when
the gigs and other stuff are a little less exciting and new.
"Give me back my wonder  -- I've something more to give / I guess
it doesn't matter  -- There's not much more to live".  It sounds
like after the struggle, when one attains his dream, life can be
a little blah.  I have seen or read many stories in which this
concept is explored.  Although I have no reason to think so,
maybe Neil started drinking more after reaching a certain goal in
life.  That would explain the usage of Bacchus, the god of wine.

Hemispheres is about balance and lots of other things.  It's a
long song and I'm not gonna try to interpret it here!  :)

I guess you can connect working towards a dream and balance in
one's life, but the themes are more of an outlook on life than a
direct connection.

Bacchanalianly Yours,

Valkyrie

Subject: Fulfilling One's Duty & A Techie Question

     Hello all,
     
     I was on the TNMS site last night, to check out what everyone has been 
     talking about.  I fulfilled my "Rush-fan" obligations, and posted my 
     nomination for the boys to enter the R&R HoF as members, not as 
     cash-paying visitors.  I also signed the petition, (#921 or 
     something).  We got a long way to go, but as Confucius or somebody 
     once said, "a thousand mile journey begins with the first step..."  
     I'm confident that our boys will get in the Hall, and when they do, 
     there'll be one serious Rush party in Cleveland!
     
     I then downloaded the TS remix file from the TNMS site (what else did 
     I have to do for 40 minutes?).  File was retrieved and saved - no 
     problem.  Problem is that my PC cannot read the .mp3 file.  My 
     question to anyone who knows is: what do I need to run these mp3 audio 
     files?  And, perhaps more importantly, is there a shareware version of 
     this program that I can access, 'cuz if I have to buy an audio 
     program, I might as well just buy the actual CD with the remix!

   [ For .mp3 files, go to www.winamp.com -- the program is FREE!!

Now you know how we Georgia Tech fans felt when he left us....

Anyway, I've heard the new Rush studio work, well sort of.
I was busily dreaming last night -- that one recurring dream where I've got
to return to graduate school for the final three days I never attended so I
can get my degree. I stepped outside after talking with a professor and
someone's radio was playing a new Rush song. It was called "Pressure
Point," or at least that's was the main lyric of the chorus. Don't remember
much else, other than it had a wonderful solo by Alex and sounded like a
mixture of the last two albums. Here's hoping a I dream again tonight.

Just had a scary thought...

Once issue #2112 is gone (I think it should be a regular issue) are 
we going to have to hear OVER and OVER and OVER what issue 
#1001001 is going to be?

You know, there will only be 998,889 issues until we hit that one.

Hi all,

Been a while since I posted here, but I saw this threat and wanted to
respond.  I'd have to say that Gentle Giant's "Playing the Fool" is the
best live album I've heard.  Those guys used to play 30 different
instruments on stage.  Amazing.

These are on *my* list of great live albums...

Queen  --  Live at Wembley '86   ---   Since I never got to see the boys
live, the best I can have is an entire concert on CD.  Simply
incredible...(and the sound quality on the operatic portion of Bohemian
Rhapsody is *so* much better than on Live Killers)

Queen  --  Live Killers   ---   So, it's not quite as good as
Wembley...but it's a great collection of live songs....

Kansas  --  Live at the Whisky   ---   I'm sure "Two For The Show" is
*much* better, but this one is *still* pretty dang good, missed vocal
notes and all...

And, one that will be on my list if it's ever released -- Grammatrain,
live in Germany (I don't even know that they've played there yet, but
they're scheduelled to, and they're recording it, since it's their last
show ever...).

Really??  You'd let me make a great big post about Queen on TNMS?????  :)
 WOO-HOO!!!!  ;)

What's it gonna be?  We've got 10 more issues to decide, folks...

(Of course, I can just see it now...#2113 is gonna start the bitching
about what we *should have* done for issue 2112...)

I still say we should all go out, buy a copy of our favorite Rush disc,
and give it to a non-Rush fan to celebrate.  And if we could get even
*one* other Rush list to join us...just imagine how many sales that would
pick up for the boys!!  It doesn't matter *which* album we get...they all
rock!  But if we each get one person hooked on Rush as a result of issue
2112...that one person that's hooked on Rush now has 20 more CDs to go
out and buy!  And if you multiply that by....well, however many people
are on this list....that's a whole lot of CDs being sold!!

Anyone else have any better ideas???

Subject: sequencing

I'm a studio owner and the principal engineer and producer. I'm also a
drummer of just about 20 years as well as a part time keyboardist, bassist,
and guitarist. I just felt like clarifying some technical issues regarding
modern audio technologies.

The question of sequencing vs sampling are essentially one and the same.
When a keyboard creates a sound, it is (usually) playing some kind of
sample (unless it's an actual synthesizer). It doesn't matter where that
sound comes from. It can be a sampled fart as far as the keyboard is
concerned. The keyboard will resample the sound to the correct pitch offset
depending on which key is hit. Middle C usually indicates no pitch shift,
but that's up to the sample designer. It's also notable that today's
samplers can shift a pitch without changing the apparent speed or length of
the sample. When that's used in conjunction with some kind of timing
device, it's called sequencing. Any sample can be triggered by practically
anything; a drum hit, a pedal, a guitar note, your toilet, whatever. The
notion that samples didn't play until a button was released is simply not
true. If that were the case, then you wouldn't get any sound out of your
keyboard when you pushed a key. Obviously one can't play an instrument that
operates this way.

How this applies to Rush? Well, technically speaking, there are a variety
of ways they could pull this off.

a. Modern sequencers have the ability to adjust their tempo based on a tap
time of some sort. The smarter ones can lock to a drum beat fairly easily,
so it's possible that all their songs can be chased by a sequencer
regardless of the tempo. That could be done by following Neil's kick or by
someone tapping along in back. The sequencer just has to know where the
song begins. Pretty easy. The cool thing about this scenario is that if the
computer (sequencer) knows what song they're playing (we all use setlists
right?), and the tempo they're playing it at, then it's very easy to
sequence all the lights and effects processors or even the mixing boards -
exactly in time. (Great for the crew)

b. It's also possible that Ged's using a Harmonizer (pitch shifter) of
sorts, like a Digitech Vocalist Pro, but that's unlikely. It's unnatural.

c. the particular sample could have been triggered by any of the three guys
just for that one event, at the exact time that it's needed. The tempo is
almost irrelevant because even if Neil was slightly slow or fast, the
sample is so short that nobody would notice.

I use a variety of all these techniques in my recordings. It's common
practice for everyone to play along with a prerecorded sync track. If
that's not possible, I chase the band later with a tap key and lock the
sequencers to that. The SMPTE time code track is necessary for all the
studio automation these days, and it's not as unlikely as it seems for a
band to use some variant of this for live performances. It's not cheating
at all. It's the way it's done.

Cheers!
keep the Rush

First, a short apology to James E. Tolve..I was unnecessarily hard on Rand
fans.  I have read a chunk of her work, liked a lot of it.  Sorry for coming
across so defensively...speaking out against Ayn in the NMS used to get you
tarred.  I am glad we can talk about this with less hostility.  I guess I'm
just conditioned into defensiveness.

For the fun stuff...my Top 5 (in no particular order) misheard lyrics:

1.  Red Barchetta - "...he says it used to be a farm, before they mowed the
lawn."

2.  Camera Eye - "...the Pope has a shop in the city!"

3.  Countdown - "...the cars full of spectators' pants."

4.  Kid Gloves - "...and the wicked gloves, and the wicked gloves.."

5.  A Farewell to Kings - "..beating down the Beatitudes and stopping at the
white.."  I have absolutely no idea what Neil would have against the meek
inheriting the Earth and where "white" fits in...

1) Overdubbing

  from previous posting... "Jason, in answer to your question, all of the songs
on the forthcoming live album were overdubbed in a studio in Toronto."

What exactly is being overdubbed?  Does anyone have any specific examples of
overdubs on previous live Rush albums?  Does the existence of overdubbing make
this a truly "live" album, then?

2) John Rutsey

  from previous posting..."I have never understood the tendency among NMS
contributors to attack John Rutsey."

a)  his drumming sucked.  Listen to the "awesome" finale of Working Man.
b)  his drums sounded crappy.  Listen to any song off of the Rush album.
c)  he pulled the ultimate "D'OH!" (a major screw up 'rond these parts is still
known at times as "pulling a Rutsey")

Ola Mein Rushian Comrades!

Well, for a brief moment, I want to hit the football thread...if you hate
football, just listen to Time & Motion for a moment...or page down!

Anyway, I hear the San Diego faithful cry'in in their beer over their current
growing pains...Hey guys you are not the Indianappolis Colts, be thankful
for that, and your level of competition in the AFC - West is much greater,
second to only the Black & Blue division...

However, take heart, I do know football, and I can tell you, RYAN LEAF is
THE REAL DEAL....you have much to look forward too...don't be suprised if
you make the playoffs within three years...Elway did...

With Leaf, I see a team capable of beating any team, anywhere, any time, but
it will take time to get the team to play as one unit, and have great game
plans, essentially time to build the team neucleus and team chemistry...

See, I am a life long fan of the Denver Broncos, and we went through some rough
times watching our hero fall quite often, especially his first two seasons...
but now, he will more than likely go out on top of every other quarterback to 
have ever played the game...yes including Marino, even though Dan will 
probably posses the total yards record...

Take heart, San Diego is now on the path to becoming a championship calibur
team...

The truth about John Elway is, he will be back if he has a great year and
the Broncos repeat...  it's a tall task, but if Denver repeats, John would 
love to be the first quarterback to ever three-peat at the Super Bowl...and 
he would be the best ever....no more questions to ask of there...

Denver probably has the most depth of any team in the NFL right now, they
will probably win the division, and may very well end up in Miami in January...
if they make it that far...I will gaurantee the Super Bowl repeat win...

Last weekend, I was watching one of those "Investigative Reports" type of 
programs on the A&E network. This particular show was about the inner workings 
of an outlaw motorcycle club called The Ching-a-lings. This is a predominantly 
Puerto Rican club in Brooklyn. Anyway, at one point in the show they had a 
segment inside the club's headquarters during a party. The music playing in the 
background was Tom Sawyer!

If you happen across a copy of this month's issue of Pulse magazine from Tower 
Records, take a look on the first page. They are advertising some cheesy 
compilation CD, and it contains a Rush track. Surprise, it's NOT Tom Sawyer for

Maybe, maybe not.  Though a producer may have some impact on the sound overall,
unless they are also the recording engineer, it is the Recording Engineers' work
that most affects what we hear in the final mix (not to mention the person 
mixing the album!).    And there was a change of engineer's between CP 
(Recorded by Kevin Caveman Shirley, mixed by Michael Letho) and T4E (Recorded 
by Clif Norrell, mixed by Andy Wallace).  I'll bet that if you find some 
other work by these people, you will find some Serious similiarities!

I'm gonna check into who was the engineer and mixer for my fav Rush Albums and
make a pick there!

I don't know.  Personally, I would ALWAYS be interested in hearing what a Terry
Brown production would sound like after all these years, but at the same
time...maybe not.
    But here are a few of my ideas for a producer:
            Steve Lillywhite  (of U2, Cranberries, Dave Matthews)
            Brendan O'Brien (STP, Pearl Jam, Matthew Sweet)
            Jay Healy (Live)

Hi All,
     I've spent the last week doing the Rush in chronilogical order thing, so
I'm a happy camper.  I'd like to respond to a few posts, very few.
      First, Tom Robbins:  EXCELLENT author.  Anything by him is worth a read.
But I never caught the Neil quote.  Other writers I like sometimes use phrases
right from a Rush song, and I wonder.......Nevada Barr, Nelson De
Mille.....anyone else ever find this?
      Second, $40 or $50 bucks  for the next set?  Gee, I never thought of
that.  I may have to save up.   Anyone know of a shop in the Hudson Valley
area having a release party or anything?  
      Third, interesting bit of thread on the "will" thing...I have nothing to
contribute, but I like to watch.
       Fourth, issue #2112, we may be attaching too much to a number, but I
guess it's fun, and I'm sure the Rush mgr will do just fine.  (Talk about
needing a little grace under pressure).  It would be great to have something
from the boys, but I bet they don't want to start a precedent.
       And now for something completely different.......
      At my college graduation, as we walked up to get our diplomas we had to
say what our degree was in, and many people added their own snippets.  I
dedicated my degree to my daughters, Sara and Jenna, and thanked "Neil, Geddy
and Alex" for helping me get through many nights.  Unfortunately, there was
nary a Rush fan in attendence, and the meaning was lost.  They all must have
thought I had rotating boyfriends.  Hmmmmm............I feel a fantasy come
on....................Gotta run,
        Lisa
  PS
    Opening weekend for Army football.  I'm a ticket seller at the games, so

>.... GET A NEW PRODUCER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This note carries the torch transferred, and perhaps lit, by:

"(Ryan & Stimpy...) Peter Collins has sort of lost his touch, I'm
afraid...he did *excellent* work on CP, but T4E *does* sound rather
muddy by comparison...so, yes, maybe it's time to change producers... I
was wondering about possibly for the first album of the new cycle, do a
co-producer thing, between Terry Brown (help recapture the old sound)
and Trent Reznor (help them maintain the edginess they have now, and
maybe help them regain some raw power in their sound).  The reason I
want Terry in their for the first one is just to make sure Trent doesn't
try and turn the new Rush album into halo fourteen for his Nine Inch
Nails catalog.  But I think after Trent has one album under his belt,
he'd be
fine working on his own with the boys... Ryan/Stimpy"
______________________
PETER COLLINS:
	... CHANGE, for God's sake!
	Yes - he was GREAT, a true breath of fresh air on PoW. He stalled
instantly in HYF.

RUPERT HINE
	Presto was yet another FRESH release, largely because they brought in
Ruper Hine and his engineer, Steven Taylor. They made Rush sound crisp
again! No wonder rock critics loved Presto.
	Some fans may complain about the Presto sound being too "sterile" and
"hi-end" (as opposed to "low-end"), but that's engineering talk. I
personally LOVE to the engineering on Presto.
	RTB, the sequel, sounded trite in relation to Presto. Hine produced
that one, too. AFAIAC (as far as I am concerned), Rush once again
stagnated.
__________________________
	So, they bring in Collins again. He helps them with CP. Who engineered
it? Not Collins - Aussie Kevin Shirley (who accumulated fame with future
credits as well, such as Journey). How much did Collins have to do with
the CP sound? Probably very little.
	Rush largely produces their own records, no matter who is listed as
"first-in-line" for producer credit. Most fans are aware of this.
	Yes, CP was a great album overall. Ironically, the engineering was
frequently suspect (e.g. the terrible hissing sound throughout many of
the tracks).
	And then, Test For Echo (TFE). TFE was another Collins production. It
is extremely lackluster sonically. Yes, some good songs were written.
But because they relied so heavily on the Collins team, in the end, the
songs on TFE didn't receive quite the sonic treatment they should have
received. End of point.
__________________________
	So NOW, who should produce a Rush album? I keep hearing about Trent
Reznor. That would certainly be interesting, but how likely is that? How
likely is it, in addition, that Rush would select anyone oher than the
old "stand-by"?
__________________________
Rahther than add to the list of potential producers, I just want to say
that I will be strongly in favor of a substantial CHANGE.

E.g.: 	Rush & Daniel Lanois = ?

   [ Heh heh, I *DO* actually own this cd, if anyone wants an MP3 of one of
     the songs so they too can moan the loss of the money I spent on it, let 
     me know.                                                     : rush-mgr ]
