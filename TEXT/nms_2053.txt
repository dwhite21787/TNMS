Ooops! I think I screwed up the mail system here, I think any mail sent after
10pm Pacific time last night either bounced or got eaten. If you sent anything
after that time, please resend it!

I will be moving all of the NMS web site to its new home on syrinx.yyz.com
(which right now does not exist), although because of the machine I'm going
to be temporarily hosting it on I won't be able to put up the larger files
until it moves to its permanent machine. I'll probably leave off all the
digests, and maybe the realvideo files. 

What will actually show up on the new site depends a lot on the lawyers, I 
got their generic fax which basically states if we use copyrights & 
trademarks of Rush they can sue us, unless we get permission to use them, 
something along those lines. It was very vague, but it almost sounds like 
we'll be able to keep the site pretty much unchanged but we may have to 
pay for the "privilege"... again I'll keep you posted.

And those of you with Rush sites that have a lot of MP3's might want to 
take them down for now, or consider making them "less obvious"...

Subject: Long Time No Post

I'm glad to be back to the NMS.  I quit reading TNMS several months ago when
the postings became way too political, cynical, moral, Amoral or just
downright juvenile.  Unfortunately, I still haven't found what I'm looking
for.  Which is: Just when is Rush going release a live album (ER...CD) and
when is the next tour???

While I'm at it, and I hope not to take up too much space doing so, I do have
a few token comments about recent postings.  (Don't we all.....)

First of all, Greg wrote:

I have to agree, sort of.  Bastille Day IS a kicking song, and on some days, I
can turn off all the lights, close my eyes, a genuinely relax to the second
side of COS.  Other than that, I never really got into COS personally.  I got
into Rush about 17 years ago (circa MP/ESL) because of #1, the depth and
diversity of their music and, #2, I was a high school kid, playing drums in a
rock and roll band, and I wanted to be "just like Neil."  With an introduction
to such tunes as Red Barchetta, Limelight, and Camera Eye, I can't explain
why, but nothing on COS ever did anything for me.

But I totally agree with Adam, albums like COS were out of time.  If Rush re-
released a lot of their older songs, they would be a big hit today.  Look at
how Natural Science and Analog Kid went over on the T4E tour.  Those songs
went by the wayside and never got any play time.  Some other rocking songs
that I would like to hear live, or redone: A Farewell To Kings, Between the
Wheels, Superconductor, and Cold Fire for starters.  

One more idea, hate to say this, but they are playing Tom Sawyer to death.
Great tune, it's their signature song and all, but com'on.  What if they tried
an "Every Breath You Take" remake solution?  Speed it up, change or add a
lyric or two, redo the solo?  Heck, call it "Huckleberry Finn." 

For Nichoals, (or is that anagram for Nicholas?)  The other Signals EP you are
referring to is the "New World Man" EP.  It is actually a 12" single with NWM
on the front and live versions of Freewill and Vital Signs on the flipside.
(The ONLY live version of VS I do believe.)  The availability of the album, I
do not know.  But I do own a copy purely as a collector's item.

     __________________________________________________________________
     
     As for the rest of the Small Soldiers soundtrack -- which features 
     classic '80s rock songs given a '90s remix with some additional vocals 
     -- 
     here is the track listing: 
     *Edwin Starr's "War" performed by Bone Thugs- N- Harmony, featuring 
     Flesh-N-Bone, Henry Rollins, Tom Morello, and Flea. E-A-Ski is 
     remixing the song 
     *Billy Squier's "The Stroke" remixed by Dallas Austin 
     *Gary Glitter's "Rock and Roll (Part 2)" by Dutch 
     *The Cult's "Love Removal Machine" by Mickey Petralia 
     *Rush's "Tom Sawyer" by DJ Z-Trip 
     *Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust" featuring additional vocals by 
     Wyclef Jean with Pras and Free 
     *Pat Benatar's "Love Is a Battlefield" featuring additional vocals by 
     Queen Latifah, and remixed by KayGee from Naughty by Nature 
     *The Pretenders' "My City Was Gone" featuring additional vocals by 
     Kool Keith (allstar, May 22) and remixed by the Butcher Brothers 
     *Cheap Trick's "Surrender" by Rich Costey 
     The last track will most likely be the original version of "War"; 
     however, it wasn't determined at press time. 
     The soundtrack is due July 7, while the movie (which stars Tommy Lee 
     Jones as the voice of Chip Hazard and Frank Langella as the voice of 
     Archer, along with Kirsten Dunst, the late Phil Hartman, Ann Magnuson, 
     Denis Leary, and others) is out July 10 via DreamWorks Pictures and 
     Universal Pictures.

Oh, fate.

I was staying at the Sheraton hotel only a  couple of
miles from the Dugout "Sports Bar" in Commack, Long Island,
NY from Sunday until Saturday morning last week.  I even
had beers (and other assorted improvised live entertainment
from a young dancer girlfriend of the bartender) at the
Dugout, since it's the only place open after midnight around
there.

So what?  Well, I just saw that the famous Power Windows
band wer to have played there *the*night*I*left*LI*!  Damn,
I would've liked to have seen that show...anyone here go to
it?

 Does anyone know a web site which has Rush audio files in an MP3 format ?
 I remember something called "Craigs virtual concert hall" but never had a 
chance to check it out. There are a few songs on the NMS page under audio 
files but I'm looking for a more comprehensive site with maybe some live 
material in an MP3 format. 

Any info would be greatly appreciated.

  I read either here or on another Rush newsgroup that someone knew a 
member of the studio recording crew from the Counterparts CD. The claim was 
that the mystery words at the beginning of "Alien Shore" was actualy a crew 
member pinching his nostrils shut and saying "out of my nose" !!! 

Does anyone else remember hearing this mentioned before and can they either 
positively confirm or deny the claim ? This has been haunting me for quite 
some time. I hate to rehash any old threads but I have to know !!!

I for one was happy with the lack of promotion for the T4E tour.
I called ticketmaster exactly when the tickets went on sale, and got seats no
more than 10 feet from the stage on Alex's side of the stage.  It was awesome
  I hope they continue to under promote their tours - I know I'll find out
about it in time at the TMS web site!

Subject: Track speed on Xanadu

I assume everyone has noticed that Xanadu is not in tune with the rest of the
songs on the A Farewell To Kings album.  It appears that the boys recorded the
song at a little slower tempo than they wanted, and the track was slightly
sped up in the mixing.  

When I used to play along with the LP version of the album, I could slow the
turntable down by adjusting the tracking speed knob.  Unfortunately, I have
not seen such a device for CD players.  

By any chance (and I know this is highly unlikely) did they fix this problem
when they produced the remastered version of A Farewell To Kings?  You'd think
with all the digital technology available today, they could speed up the tempo
of the track without changing the pitch of the song.  

It's a bitch to have to re-tune a doubleneck every time I want to play along
with this tune!

Suzy Lydall is a missing person.  She has been missing since March of
this year.  She was last seen in Albany, NY.  She is also a Rush Fan. 
As such, I think that we, the members of the NMS, can chip in and try
to help find her.  Please access the web site below for more

Subject: 'Scuse me, while I kiss this guy...

     I thought I had insight into Geddy's personal grooming habits with the 
     line:  Maybe Roll-On's not so bad...
     
     No one to my knowledge (on the list about 6 months) has ever mentioned 
     the humorous line:
     
                Lying in the warm grass
                Feel the sun upon your *face*
     
     FBN being the album that hooked me on Rush, I found that line amusing. 
     In the End is still one of my favorite songs, up there with Vital 
     Signs and The Weapon.
     
     Hope Ged has tried stick deodorant a least once since '75.

I sent this to a friend of mine who worked on the remastered RUSH CDs. This is
what he said:

  PolyGram certainly does list engineering credits on MOST of their reissues. 
 The only time they don't is when it is a "Special Markets" label like Rebound
 or PSM.  These are the reissues you see in drug stores and truck stops.  No 
 credits there.  But all others should have them.  Especially for Mercury,  
 since we do most of that stuff. 
  
  I know.  My name is on several of those CDs. As for the DDD/ADD listings,  
 the RIAA was responsible for getting those codes put on CDs. They are no 
 longer obligatory,  as a given album might go through several stages before 
 the actual digital production master is created. It's not that simple
anymore.

My "Red Barchetta" is my 1993 Red Mitsubishi Eclipse, which bears a close

Subject: Grace Under Pressure Video

Recently, I was in the process of cleaning out my room of old drum stuff
and I found an old video tape of the Grace Under Pressure Tour video that I
taped from MTV in 1985.  Tonight, I watched it.  Amazingly, the video has
aged quite well!  It was hilarious to see the old videos and commercials
and then finally JJ Jackson introducing the thing (along with the list of
radio stations that were simulcasting the event.)  The concert was (of
course) awesome - it brought back memories of the show that I saw at the
Glens Falls (NY) civic center on September 15, 1984 and many other memories
of high school......

Anyway, I noticed a couple of interesting names in the final credits. 
First off, there was a VTR Operator named Bruce Peart.  Any relation to
Neil??  And what the heck is a VTR?  Also, I noticed that the sound was
coproduced by Terry Brown.  I found this interesting because Terry was
essentially axed prior to the recording of P/G.  I didn't seem to recall
that he was ever brought back into the Rush fold (other than
the....ah...tribute....ah)  Very interesting indeed...

It's too bad that I never bought a store copy of this video - it captures
that era very nicely.  I wonder if Polygram (or somebody else) will ever
reissue it.........

                 "Draft" for the 2112 edition.
  
                   MEMO FROM A HIGHER OFFICE

I'm sorry to report that at this point in time, there are NO plans for 
any new Rush books to be published. There are several tomes in progress, 
and a couple completely finished, "This Week In Rush History," 
"Re-Visions" and "All The World's Indeed A Stage," to name a few. 
Unfortunately, the band does NOT want any new books coming out on them 
at this time. I know that I don't need their permission to have these 
works published, but it is "their" band, and not "mine," so I "respect" 
their wishes. It's a shame, 
too, because fans would really enjoy the efforts, most fans that is. 
Some folks from the National Midnight Slander may have a hard time 
dealing with something that is totally factual and accurate. My 
friend's, wife's. sister's, 2nd cousin, knows someone, 
who moved to Toronto, and their neighbors, girlfriend's, mother-in-law, 
gets her hair cut by someone who grew up with John Rutsey, and she says: 
BS-BS-BS!!! Do yourself a favor, if you believe only "half" of what you 
read on the National Midnight 
Slander, then you'll only have to question the other "half" of the crap 
they print! The person who posts some of this fictional material should 
really be ashamed of herself! I subscribe to lists of many different 
bands, and it's really "sad" that the Rush list 
has the worst content of any of them, by far! It's nice to know that 
Black Sabbath fans are so much nicer. Their list (for the most part) 
concentrates on the positive elements of the band, while the NMS dwells 
on the negative, SAD! It's a wonder the band are 
still together, you people should be happy! But NO! That's not enough 
for you. If these are the fans of the band, I'd hate to see their 
enemies! (stepping off of the soapbox). There is so much slanderous crap 
being posted, and not just about me, but about the 
band, etc. One of the truly sad things, is that , if someone posts a 
slanderous, or fictional (so-called) fact, people take it as truth, but 
the FACT is, it’s FICTION! 
 Do yourself a favor people, ENJOY WHATEVER WORK'S RUSH HAPPENS TO GRACE 
US WITH, because at this point in time, it's all icing!  Look to the 
POSITIVE, PEOPLE. Don't dwell on the negative! I know for some of you, 
this will be a hard concept to grasp, but give it a try! Who knows, you 
might even like it! Get Rush into the Hall of Fame....you hold the key 
to the door......KNOCK IT DOWN!!!  Go listen to all of the songs you 
supossedly “hate” another 111 times, and re-analize them!!! In my 
“humble” opinion, there are NO bad Rush songs.....I love them 
ALL.....(honest)  so shoot me! The Disc’s have so much depth, that, the 
song you initially couldn’t get into, sounds, “all-of-a-sudden, GREAT 
years down the road. I’m really quite jealous! It sounds like a lot of 
you have a whole lot of NEW songs to experience!
      Now, as far as the rumors are concerned, YES, I did play a demo on 
the radio before it's release. And I've NEVER denied such a fact. It 
would be awfully hard to deny something which thousands of people heard! 
Not only that, but I did it again! The 
circumstances surrounding the 2nd time really sealed my fate with the 
band. Most of you probably wouldn't understand, and I won't go into 
detail, but I worked in radio, and would take part in album 
premier's,etc, starting with Perm Waves, Mov Pix, etc., 
etc. So it was really the circumstances surrounding what happened, which 
really pissed the band off. I made a mistake! I'm sorry! I wish it never 
happened, but it did! It's my bed, and I'm lying in it. If Ged doesn't 
ever want to speak to me again, that's his 
prerogative! I'm certainly NOT losing (anymore) sleep over it. I'm still 
their biggest fan, I see them live now, more than I ever did before. I 
know more about this band than "all" of you folks at the National 
Midnight Slander combined! So don't tell me I CAN'T  write another book 
on the band. I can write five books! You folks, just may never see them! 
And from some of the "garbage" many of you write, you don't deserve to 
see them! (that certainly is NOT ALL of you. If you don't post

Subject: Merry XMAS to me

Okay, Rushians I know most of you will grasp the enormity of this.  Last night
I was totally bored so I started searching through my vast video library for
something interesting to watch.  I discovered an old homemade music video
taped when I was around 16 years old.  Duran Duran/Adam & the Ants was written
in pink highlighter on the label which was faded and yellowed with age.  I
figured, what the heck, a blast from the past will be cool, so I slipped the
video out of its battered case and noticed that on the top label Duran
Duran/Adam & the Ants had been written over with...Rush, 1984.  My heart
fluttered a bit with anticipation (also dread that I was in for a big
disappointment if now I watched the tape and it turned out to be Duran Duran).

I immediately ran downstairs, popped in the tape and practically cried as the
words Rush - Grace Under Pressure appeared on the screen.  As TSOR fired up, I
just started laughing my ass off because I have had this tape for 14 years and
never even watched it before (that I remember, I smoked a lot of pot back
then:-).  I don’t know where I taped it from, I didn’t know if it was the
whole concert in its entirety or if any second it would cut to Hungry Like the
Wolf or Ant Music.  But that didn’t happen, Rush just kept on playing.  The
smile on my face got a lot wider as they broke into the Enemy Within and I
realized that the other two fears were up next!  The Weapon, Witch Hunt; you
know ‘em, you love ‘em.

I felt like the luckiest person in the world, I was all alone, drinking a beer
and watching this treasure on our 52 inch big screen TV, blaring it and
singing at the top of my lungs.  At times I got misty, at times I rocked out
playing air drums, at times I danced with Alex—who by the way looked fabulous
with his Flock of Seagulls haircut.  I had a killer evening and can’t wait to
watch it again.

I have the other videos: Exit Stage Left, ASOH and Chronicles but this one was
all the more special because 'gup' was the first Rush album I bought the day
it came out and the first tour I went to (seen all tours since –26 shows to
date) so it brought back all the memories of why I got so passionate about
their music in the first place.  The quality of the footage is marvelous too,
it seemed very raw and unencumbered by special effects, ala ESL.  The boys
seemed like they were having fun, lots of smiling/dancing/funny faces from
Alex and Geddy, and grins/eye rolls/stick throwing from Neil.  I highly
recommend the video—two thumbs way way up. 
 
Thanks for reading!

P.S.  I was at the Counterparts show at the Pond in Anaheim, Calif. and I
could have sworn that Alex sang CTTH that night not Geddy.  Does anyone else
remember that?

   [ Alex sang the chorus, Geddy still sang the majority of the song.

Subject: "Freewill" heard on Stanley Cup Game 3, Pop-Up Video

	Hi there Rushians,
	Just thought I'd pass along that "Freewill" came in VERY loud and
clear late in the 3rd period of Saturday night's Caps-Wings game. 
Awesome. except now the Wings are up 3-0 in the series.  DAMNNN!!!
	Also, my comments about "Limelight" on Pop-Up Video (I FINALLY
saw it.)  I thought some of the comments were condescending about Rush. 
For example, they indicated that Rush was inducted into the Canadian Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame for being "influential".  Why did they put that in
quotes?  It is as if they don't believe it.  Also, at the end of the
video, they said that the McKenzie's song with Geddy was more successful
than any song by Rush.  I have nothing against Bob and Doug, in fact, I
love the "Great White North" album.  But just because Rush has only hit
the Top 40 pop charts once (New World Man in 1982), Rush isn't
successful?  I'd say making the great music they have the past 24 years
and ENDURING is more successful than any number of Top 10 hits by all
these flash-in-the-pan pop acts.  I swear, people just don't get it.
*shakes head in disgust*  OK, I'm pissed now.  Better close this up.
	Good Livin' to You All,
	Jon G.

Hey everyone!

I will right here and now apologise for the lack of Niel, Zeppelin, Floyd
and Rush content.  But despite this, I plead with you to read the rest of
this message.

I'm just sending this out to you all to inform you of some truly tragic
news.  OLGA - the online guitar archive - has been shut down.  Apparently
the bastards at EMI have finally gottent their way.  The OLGA was a free
meduim to allow guitarists (such as myself) access to other guitarists'
tabulature.  It was an archive of music notation that was free-well, the
cost of internet access - to anyone who asked for tab for a specific song.

I have been a long time user of OLGA, and i have also donated multiple
tabs.  This action totally offends me.

The problem originated with EMI.  The legal toads at EMI decided that it
infringed on their *right to charge for the use of the music* that was
copyrighten to them.  This is bulls#!t, as all tabs sent to OLGA were
simply the donator's rendition, and not necessarily accurate.  Nonetheless,
EMI pressed legal charges, but were ruled against.  However, it seems that
they have attempted a sort of geurrilla tactic, and acted once again
against OLGA, this time through a larger company whom i will not name.

Unfortunately, the managers of the OLGA lack the monetary resources to
contend with this.  They are simply waiting for the verdict.

I urge all guitarists out there to protest this.  Those who contend to the
right of freedom of information are also urged to do so.  Put protests on
your webpages, e-mail or snail mail you opinions to the bastards at EMI. 
Contact anyone who you think could aid the OLGA in keeping online.  Or, you
could aid me by tabbing out any and all songs you know in NOTEPAD, and
sending them to me.  It is my firm intention to set up my own mini archive
to continue providing service to the gutarists on the net.  I already have
a couple dozen songs, and all contributions will be more than welcome.  Any
who support this will be included in a special "thank you" section on the
end of my page.

Anyone interested in donating tab should contact me with "guitar tab" as
the subject line

I apologise for the waste of bandwidth, but this is a very personal thing
for me.  All help will be appreciated.

Thanks in advance

Later, eh?

Hi all.
 I got this snippet from Zentertainment and the last line containsRush so
be ready....

   The lead song in the upcoming film SMALL SOLDIERS is a cover
         of the 1970 hit "War," redone by BONE THUGS-N-HARMONY,
         featuring FLESH-N-BONE, with Henry Rollins, Rom Morello,
         and Flea. The soundtrack, due out on DREAMWORKS Records
         July 14th, additionally features:
         - QUEEN's "Another One Bites the Dust" remixed by Wyclef Jean
           with additional vocals by Wyclef, Pras, and Free.
         - Pat Benatar's "Love Is A Battlefield," remixed by KayGee
           with new vocals by Queen Latifah.
         - The PRETENDERS' "My City Was Gone," remixed by The
           BUTCHER BROS., with additional vocals by Kool Keith.
         - CHEAP TRICK's "Surrender," remixed by Rich Costey.
         - Billy Squier's "The Stroke," remixed by Dallas Austin.
         - Gary Glitter's "Rock and Roll (Part 2)," remixed by DUTCH.
         - The CULT's "Love Removal Machine," remixed by Michey Petralia.
         - RUSH's "Tom Sawyer," remixed by DJ Z-TRIP. 

Hmmm..Tom Sawyer needs even more bass than the double kick bass drum of
Neil? I doubt it, but I am scared yet curious about the results of such
tampering...

Oh well...just info for all yoru Rushians.

Hi y'all:

Hey..I was the guy posting the Alex comment regarding "Rush" Limbaugh...You
have to remeber..he also stated in a previous interview here in
Canada....VERY sarcastically....."yahh..like as if HE's one of my favourite
people..". Also, when Alex stated that "Rush Would NEVER write a song that
had anything to do with Limbaugh.."..you have to understand the emphasis on
NEVER...also...Al and Ged were laughing quite consideribly at the
interviewer's comments about Limbaugh being a LARGE..(hehehe) American
figure. Get over it!

Oh ya, and also, I heard Edwin (from I Mother Earth and Victor) on 102.1 the
Edge here in Toronto, and guess who happened to be on with him?????
Well...Mr. Lerxst..indeed...I was on my vacation last week, so I didn't get
a chance to post this earlier. Both are currently working toghether on the
next Victor project, which they said should be out by the end of the year. I
just caught the tail end of the interview, but Alex said it was different
and much more easy then the first project, because he knew pretty much what
he wanted and how to go about it. Edwin and Alex also stated there will be a
few other "surprise" guests on the album, but of course..wouldn't
elaborate...heh. BTW, for all you Rush triviates (is there such a
word??..heh) out there, 102.1 IS CFNY, THE station Neil wote as the
inspiration for "The Spririt of Radio" (see PeW liner notes). Al didn't
really say much about Rush, just that they had a live album coming out in
the fall.

Anyway..thats it from this reporters camp..

Peace..

Hi all,

First, a quick thank you. Thanks to reading this digest I have purchased Falling
In To Infinity and Gretchen Goes to Nebraska. Both excellent. Is all DT/KX as
good.

Does anybody remember a Canadian band called Wireless. As far as I know they
released three albums in the late 70s, the last of which (No Static I think it
was called) was produced by Geddy. The other two were called Wireless and
Positively Human, Relatively Sane. There is a 'special thanks to Rush and crew'
on the liner notes to No Static.

Any of you fellow NMSers know if any other albums were released, or anything
else about the band.

Appreciate any info.

Thanks.

Tim, you defined "TRUE Rush fan" yourself in your text......."if you weren't
on the look out", then you're not a "TRUE Rush fan".  Seriously, if you
follow Rush and don't realize that they are going to be following an album
with a tour, then you certainly won't want to drag yourself away from the
wrestling Pay-per-view you're watching to go see Rush, even if someone tells
you the date.

I've only been on the Net for one year, yet somehow, though living in
Atlanta, I've had the motivation and ingenuity to find out the Charlotte
dates for the last four tours and drive my ass up there.  And I also somehow
(by sheer luck, I'm sure) wound up in Greenville SC, Memphis, Cincinnati,
Chapel Hill NC, Pensacola FL, Murfreesboro TN, Albany NY, Dallas, Houston,
Quebec City and Ottawa to see Rush during the 90's.  As you can imagine,
none of these shows were advertised in Atlanta.  And all w/o the aid of the
internet!

As for the non-Rush fans I referred to, I am not a Spice Girls fan, yet I
know they are playing here in Atlanta Thursday night.  I am not a Tori Amos
fan, yet I knew she was playing recently in a small venue here.  I am not a
Widespread Panic fan, yet I knew they were playing in Athens recently.  I am
not a [fill in the blank] fan,.......well, you get the point (I hope).  I've
lived here fourteen years and never once have I been told about a show that
just happened and responded, "Damn, I never knew they were coming."

TIMOTHY.W.MURPHY and  Dom Kallas ...Thank-you for your 2-cents.  I am from

 The thing that pissed me off the most is there were "ump-teen thousand"
Van Halen fans that night screaming their heads off thinking that this was
a original drum solo from Alex Van-Halen.  And what makes it worse is
anytime one of the millions of Van Halen fans around the world goes to a
RUSH concert and see's a Neil solo, they will think "what I heard was a
complete and TOTAL rip-off of Alex Van Halen!"  So I have the opportunity
to get even if I so choose.  Guess who is coming to Nashville on August
2nd?  Van Halen!  And guess who has 2nd row center seats to this concert?
Yes Sir, I do!  So, if anyone has "good 1 liners" that I can write on a

In issue #2051, GM&C, (wade@firstnethou.com) had a lot to say about a
previous post from Rushme000@aol.com, whose post seemed to say that we as
serious fans have a responsibility for RUSH's general lack of commercial
domination because we don't agitate enough for more airplay, among other
things...

Rather than burn unneeded bandwidth on this, I'd like to just say one
thing:

GOOD JOB, WADE!

And to anyone in need of background, refer back to his post in issue #2051
  it says it all.

We would all be worse off if RUSH were seeking little more than increased
radio airplay.  Think about it.  One doesn't go about breaking barriers by
sniffing everyone else's asshole.   

Sure, lots of us wish others would better appreciate RUSH's talents, but
let's not overestimate the intelligence of the general public.  

Don't be sorry you told it like it is, Wade.  We all need to be realistic. 
Besides, we are their best fans already and we spread the word as the

and RTB backstage club newsletters)
but feel he may have changed his story
a little after all these years to be a little
more politically correct. Just my opinion.

Second, the possibility of losing the tour-
books page at the NMS is a bad deal!
Mainly because the last three tourbooks,
and the photo gallery from HYF were
never finished! If there is anybody out
there that has the ability/resources to put
up the tourbooks please contact me.

   [ As I said, I don't KNOW what the lawyers were talking about. They 
     mentioned "pictures" and other than the tourbooks I can't think of any
     pictures that they would say were copyrighted by Rush (I don't think
     pictures from magazines would count).                    : rush-mgr ]

Third(ly) I would like to echo the post
from GM&C <wade@firstnethou.com>
regarding blaming the fans for the lack
of radio airplay. The boys have rarely
written anything worthy of the mindless
drivel overplayed by most radio stations
these days. Which is why we all love this
band. Right?

>I'll probably be sorrier that I typed all

*Never* be sorry about your opinion my
friend! If we don't have opinions we don't
have a mailing list!

later,
scoots

The word "didactic" means (according to Webster's 9th New Collegiate):
Designed or intended to teach; intended to convey instruction and
information as well as pleasure and entertainment, or making moral
observations.

Therefore, a didact is one who instructs, i.e. a teacher.

Subject: Thanks to TNMS

Hello All,
     I just wanted to extend our thanks to TNMS, for us, being a Rush tribute
band exposure is hard to come by and the best form of communication for us
with fellow listeners of Rush has been here on The National Midnight Star. I
have shared more ideas and e-mail letters from people here than all other
places on the web combined. Some things should be never taken for granted and
we just wanted to say we appreicate your efforts for everyone, Meg & Jimmy.
