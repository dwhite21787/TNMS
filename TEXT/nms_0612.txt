Hi kids,

  I was just reading the old NMSs in the ftp and found the issue where all
you nuts went batty over _Roll the Bones_ (and rightfully so).  Utilizing
the ftp is my new skill so I've been very active in the old files and
things.  Anyways back to my point, my comment here has to do with the
album title.  WHen I first got word of _Roll the Bones_, I called a local
record store that's really good with new releases and asked them what the
name of the new Rush album was going to be.  The guy who answered the
phone told me, "Uh, it's called _Two Dog Bone_."  That was the (for lack
of a more appropriate word) silliest phrase I had ever heard!  Oh well, I
just thought you kids would get a kick out of that idiot's remark.

Subject:      What makes Rush different?

Hi all

   Someone asked what was the reason for people to like Rush or not.
Everything said here makes sense, and I agree with everyone, but there's
also another thing: the tempo. You know, Rush music is non-danceable
(and I don't mean that it should be), but people can't seem to feel
the rhythm of the songs as we do, specially after Neil joined the band.
Every instrument involves you in the songs, and you can feel that you
are the Snow Dog, or you can feel the pressure when you're hearing
The Pass, or you feel absorbed in a great Black Hole on Cygnus. I think
that's what makes Rush music so special, specially the tempo on each
song. Every song is different, and that's something a lot of groups haven't
acomplished yet.

Luis.

Subject: People that dislike Rush..

    It's true, some people really dislike Rush- I've noticed a couple of
reasons why.  First of all, one reason was already mentioned by someone-
Geddy's voice.  People seem to think it's too high and annoying.  I don't
understand it either- I mean, imagine Rush with someone else as lead vocalist?
No way.
    Another reason seems to be the complex lyrics in most of the band's songs.
I think most of us would agree that Peart is an incredible writer, but there
are some that will listen and decide that the lyrics are too "difficult" or
that they're corny.  I don't get it- bands with even slightly innovative
lyrics are few and far between.  Listen to any Top 40 radio station and see.
    The last reason I can think of, and one that I CAN relate to, is that
maybe we've all driven some of our friends and acquaintances completely nuts
from all the Rush that we play!  I mean, my roommate this year thought Rush
was pretty cool at first (although he'd never really listened to them) but a
few months later he can't stand them.  (I feel the same way about a lot of his
fave bands now.)  Unless you're as much of a fan as most of us are, I guess
hearing Rush day and night all the time wouldn't really be too cool.

Subject: Between The Wheels
Date: Mon, 1 Feb 93 16:15:30 PST

I agree with the previous person who mentioned that the solo in
"Between The Wheels" is awesome. This was the period where Alex was
heavily influenced by Allan Holdsworth (whammy technique) and Andy
Summers (staccato rhythms). The solo in "Between The Wheels" is a great
vehicle to demonstrate the whammy bar as an extremely expressive tool.
The bends up are primarily the whammy bar, and this combined with
wide intervallic slides make this solo really hit the emotional hot
spot. Almost all the vibrato is with the whammy.  The solo style
reminds me of "Ghost Of A Chance" the way it's constructed : a quick
lick in the beginning, going to a lower range with some slower
intermediate notes, some melodic scale runs, finally ending on a high
note. This is Alex at his best, though "Limelight" is also excellent
from a tonal point of view (that hollow, flanged, deep distorted tone
was great. I wish it came back!).

Subject: OtE's "Closer to the Heart" & Journey

Hi kids,

   I am replying to two posts from Monday's NMS.  The first is the Over
the Europe version of "Closer to the Heart" (sorry I always type out the
songs and album titles but I think that they deserve it) and the
mumblings.  I don't believe that there are any graphics whatsoever during
the song.  I think it's just Alex being the nut that he is and vocalizing
a fight between two oriental people, one with a high voice and one with a
low voice (the villian).  He goes back and forth until one gets shot and
then he pauses and says "Did ya get all that?"  It's Alex's voice for sure
at that point.  In relation to that, back during the Hold Your Fire Tour
when the hit Philadelphia (December 14, 1987), Alex did a similar thing.
During the chorus of "The Temples of Syrinx" in the encore, after each
line that Geddy sang, Alex would ask something like "What's the phone
number?" or "Where do they live?"  I might even have this on tape
somewhere.  I'll have to check.  I'll get back to ya on dat.

   Secondly, someone brought up the Journey box set (nice package!).  In
the back of the booklet, they go through and explain a little something
about each song on the set.  On their second or third album they did a
song called "Nickel and Dime" referring to the two time signatures in the
song.  What bothered me was that when they talked about these time
signatures they said "Rush's 'Tom Sawyer' sounds suspiciously similar to
this."  What's this deal?  No other band is allowed to use 5/4 and 10/4 in
a song besides Journey?!  I just thought that whoever wrote the snipets in
the booklet was a little bit too high on their horse about Journey.  Great
band but this dude's gotta chill.  He also puts down Kansas for a
similarity.  This one's much more obvious, but the guy still goes overboard.

  Well that's my defense of Rush for this evening.  By the way, am I the
only one that likes the new Triumph album even though Rik Emmett is not
there?

Can any other guitar playing Rush freaks out there give me a hand?
I'm trying to put together an acoustic medley of Fly By Night and In the End,
and although I've got the main riffs for each song down, I'm having trouble
with the chords for the bridge of Fly by Night, ("Start a new chapter...") and
the chorus of In the End. ("You can take me...")  If anyone out there has the
Rush Complete songbooks or is just great at figuring these things out, please
drop me a line.

	     Background is like a night sky, quarter moon in the
	     distance.

AV-8070   :  Neil Peart full size poster.  Him standing behind his
	     Presto double bass drum kit.  Drumsticks in hand.

Subject: counting Cygnus

+- &gt;I am not a musician, and know little of time signitures, but does anyone
+- &gt;know what time the different parts of cygnus X1 are in?  There's one part
+- &gt;that just seems to drop a beat every now and then.  Any feedback from the
+- &gt;musical comunity would be appreciated.
+-
+For one thing, not only does the time constantly change, but so does the tempo.
+- I don't know what part you were referring to exactly, but here's my
+- interpretation of the beginning of the song, starting from the entry of drums
+-
+-  2:12           2:25            2:41          2:56
+-   |              |               |             |
+-   3 2 4 2 4 2 4  6 7 6 8 6 7 6 8 6 7 6 8 6 7 6 8  4...Slow 4/4
+-   - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  -
+-   4 4 4 4 4 4 4  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8  4
+-
+- Try counting 8th notes with your fingers (WITHOUT tapping your foot to the
+- beat) until the above makes sense to you.  Then the rest of the song should
+- fall together.  If anyone else has a better version, let's hear it!

This strikes me as unnecessarily complicated.  If I've interpreted this
correctly, you're charting the bit of Cygnus which begins at 2:12 on
the CD...

I want to do a sanity check, here, because what I'm counting is completely
different.  I'm talking about the first track of Hemispheres, in the
Prelude section, at 2:12 where NP is playing some hi-hat stuff.

The whole section, almost until the vocal, is in straight time.  The
accents, by and large, fall on the and of 4 -- so, for any non-musicians
who feel a need to count this section, try
	1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
(beginning, if you like, with the &lt;thump&gt; at 2:12 or 2:13, which falls,
once again, on the 'and' of 4).

Also note that two times, between 2:12 and 2:56, the entire band plays
on beat 4 of a measure, then rests until beat 2 of the next measure
(except, in the first instance, for a triangle sound on beat 1).  This
creates a sort of uneven pause or pulse which might be heard as a
dropped beat.  However it is in straight 4 time.

Finally note that at 2:28 or so, there's a solid snare backbeat to
anchor the count at 2 and 4.

Apologies if we're referring to different parts of the album...

Subject: Petitions and the like

Simply put, any attempt to petition either Rush or Anthem is
a terrible idea.  First of all, Anthem will just laugh at us, and
probably threatent legal action if any ention of it is brought up
again. 1500 rabid Rush fans is not going to make Anthem release
stuff to us...As far as contacting the members of Rush ourselves,
how does anybody propose doing this...letter will get no real
response...out only hope is for one of us to contact Rush already
knowing in advance that they "have Rush's ear."
The members or Rush are perfectionists, and wouldn't want anything released
that has not gone through their rigorous screening...of course, they
could release stuff to us from their vaults, but it is unlikely that
they have the time to worry about us, with the writing for the new album
in full swing and all.

Third thing...nix the charity idea.  It doesn't change the legality of
what we are doing, and it won't make Rush look upon us in a better way.
Let's just approach this as fans making a boot of their favorite band.
Well sell the CD at cost, keep it quiet, and enjoy the result.

Gettting Rush or Anthem involved would be the worst thing we could
do...if that is done, say goodbye to the boot idea forever.

Hi all......
I have so much to say, but so little time, so I'll save it all for the
weekend.

Anyway, just one question.  I have seen Rush about 5 times, and each time
was of course orgasmic.  However, nothing would be cooler in the world than
to have backstage passes.  Does anyone out there know just how one can
get a hold of one?  I would really like to meet them!!!
Anyway, just Email me.....

Hello,
  Anybody catch Rush on MTV on Monday, Feb 1st around noonish?  I was
flipping channels and on the way past MTV, I caught the last 1/3 of
Tom Sawyer on MTV!!!!!Wow.... Anyway, it is obviously old...Alex has real
long hair.. and the caption at the end said "Tom Sawyer....Rush....an MTV
concert."   An MTV concert? It was a 'live' shot of the band with a
screen behind them, so can I conclude that they played MTV once long ago?
ooooooohhh....gasp....what a concept! I almost freaked. Then they played
Roxanne from the Police then some song from Pat Benetar...Ohhhh 80's
revisited!!  'nouf said.

hEy -
	A few people have been saying "Don't talk about the boot!"  Since this
is a theoretical debate, and will remain so until work is actually done to
develop the disk, I see no reason to stop posting.  Instead, posts should have
the flavor (which I have already read into them) of '_If_ there were to be a
Rush bootleg made, how would we go about it?'  If we can get in trouble for
philosophising, we might as well give up our other freedoms now.  So, I say, go
ahead and post about the boot.  Just don't do any work on it unless; a) you've
got permission; or b) you are willing to accept the consequences.  I myself
will say (theoretically, of course) that I would be willing to buy a copy of
the CD that I have seen discussed here (titled "Gangster of Boots" and
containing rare/hard-to-get-ahold-of material which is related to the group
Rush) whether it be a 'legal' production or not.  I just think that all
reasonable attempts should be made to 'legalize' it before going ahead and
producing it.
	And, on the subject of 'legalization'; The Petition.  Somebody
mentioned that it might be hard to come up with a proper list of names to
submit.  I've seen automated systems which can process requests like adding a
name to the petition for the user.  I don't have one, but somebody in this
group should - if you do, speak up!  The only inherent problem is how to
validate a name on the list.  I think names added to the petition should be
done by way of [full name + phone number].  By submitting this much information
- purely a request to get permission for this thing, NOT a statement of illegal
intent - each person who is interested in having this CD produced can be
verified as being 'a valid person' (not 'Mickey Mouse' or 'John Hancock').  If
we do this, we will also have the added numbers of non-network friends of ours.
I know I've got 5 people I know who would be interested in having a copy of
something like this.  (No, I haven't mentioned it to them, I just know them
well enough.)
	One last note on the subject - If this is made 'legal', and TNMS is the
ONLY way to get ahold of it, it's value as a Colectors Item will be notably
greater than it's origional purchase price.

P.S.	I will be willing to enter direct e-mail discussion of this subject.

Subject: Rush in the UK

Hello yet again, downloading more thoughts...

Graham Reilly wrote about Rush's exposure in the UK.  I agree entirely.  I
have only ever heard TWO Rush tracks on the radio (this is about 10^5 too
few).  These were Marathon (it got somewhere in the charts here) and Spirit
Of Radio which I think that some DJ used to use for a sort of opening track,
but I'm not sure.  Is it possible that this could have something to do with
Rush being a semi-underground group over here, people only hearing about them
via the enthusiastic ravings of the hardcore fans that exist in scattered
pockets about the country? (?) :)

P.S. - I also saw the poster on Lenny Henry's show, but neglected to bring
       it up here.  Can't think why, it made my day when I noticed it.

P.P.S. - Graham - outside chance, but if you're reading this and know of a
       first year medic at St-Andrews called Jacinta Smith can you say hi
       from Paul and Kathryn in Bath?  You probably don't as you're bound
       to be comp. sci.

       Apologies for the intrusion of the P.P.S. onto the NMS.

Bye

Hello All,

Out of all this fav solo stuff, I'm glad someone finally mentioned
Freewill.  IMHO one the better Lifeson solos and a reall pain in the
neck to learn to play.

&gt;Derek Lichter suggested that the boot be recorded on DAT.  I would argue that
&gt;many more people have CD players than DAT decks.  Popular opinion in stereo
&gt;magazines seems to indicate that the DAT format will not survive due to the new
&gt;formats DCC and MD.  Hence many of us who do not already own DAT machines will
&gt;in all likelihood not being buying them anytime soon.  I think CD is the
&gt;best way to go.

I must not have been clear earlier.  I think that _mastering_ it to DAT
would be a better idea -- distributed copies would be analog cassettes.
But if someone on the NMS has access to CD mastering equipment, great;
I'd _love_ a CD.  As Jason Birzer wrote to me in email, "I don't care
what it is on, just get it on a format I can use!"  :-)

PS -- even though it was meant humorously, I think T.R. is wrong about
Rush being moderate Democrats.  I really doubt they'd want to associate
themselves with either of our political parties, because both parties
are so laced with idiocy here in the U.S.  They'd've probably voted for
Andre Marrou if they could have, although even Libertarians here include
a heck of a lot of whackos (and I consider myself libertarian).
