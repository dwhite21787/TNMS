Hey!

Just because most Rush fans might be older, married, and republican, 
doesn't mean that everybody is.  Geez, if what I've heard from most 
long-time fans is correct, most people got turned on to them in high 
school.  Now, there's not many of us, but there is a new generation of 
Rush-loving high schoolers, and I am one of them!  So don't rule out the 
power of the original fan base!  Thanks,

Well, being a well versed drummer of 20 years, I'd have to say I've never
seen "two third-notes [2/3]" either. I suppose you could say it's 3/2 or
three half notes, and that's all a matter of how you want to put it on
paper, but those are some incredibly short half-notes. Personally I'd write
that as 3/4 or 6/4, i.e. three quarter-notes or six quarter-notes per
measure. At that signature, that would make the speed about 192 bpm.

just my spin

While this person definitely needed taking to task, I would argue with
the assertation that scientists by definition can think--I know several.
Some can think, and well.  The others sort of muddle along.  I've tied
them in logical knots many times when they make blanket statements,
frequently based on the proposition that 99% = almost 100%, therefore,
the 1% variance does not exist.

But listening to Rush would cause me to give you the benefit of the
doubt--but I have met some flaming idiots who were Rush fans.

guitars playing that intro? One is acoustic the other I swear is =
electric... the one I am calling electric is the one that gives us the =

Is it Geddy backing him with an old 1970s doubleneck?

According to atlantic site, rush has 22 gold albums, but
if my memory is correct they have 23 albums (16 studio, 4

the first album, "RUSH", didnt sell atleast 500,000 copies
hunh.. I thought the first album did go gold...?  Does anyone
have an up to date listing of the number of albums sold per
album by the band?  Someone, somewhere out there gotta

I'm single, under-college education, definitely non-conservative but I'm a

40,000 miles specifically to attend 11 of their concerts, most of them

     The reason they don't have a Rush pinball game is that the table would

THIS IS NOT A FLAME!!!  EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO HIS/HER OPINION.

I am just curious as to how many people think Caress of Steel is their least
favorite album.  Personally, it is in my top three with MP and PeW.  I think
the raw sound is awesome.  And it contains two of my favorite songs, "The
Necromancer" and "The Fountain."  Anyone else agree?

Just for reference, I was not a fan when CoS came out.  I was only 5 years
old for chrisakes.  I became a fan after a friend played MP for me when I
was eleven.

I've seen Rush every tour since GuP.  It was actually my first concert ever.
I had to beg my mother to let me go, since I was fourteen years old.  Ha Ha.
My ultimate would be for Rush to play "The Necromancer" live.  I seriously
doubt this will happen though.

Subject: Another BMG question

I for one have enjoyed the BMG debate for the last few weeks.  I happen to
be lucky enough to read TNMS while at work (like I'm sure alot of you do) so
it breaks up the day very nicely.

I have taken advantage of the 11 CDs for 1 special this year and have used
the 7 out of the 11 to update my RUSH collection.

Here's my question:  If they are the same quality, how on earth can they
afford to give them away.  I am almost positive that most people take
advantage of the special, but whatever is the minimum required, and then
quit the club.  How do they stay in business?  Any theories?  I know they
make some money on shipping, but they can't make that much on it.

I am dying to find out, being a marketing major and an MBA student in
Finance.

Doth mine eyes deceive me?  Or was that actually Uncle Joe Benson contibuting 
valuable info to TNMS?  That is awesome!  I grew up with this guy.  He's got the
best voice in radio!  Hey Joe, the 7th day ain't the same without you! 

A few people have wrote in saying they heard New World Man on the radio in LA.  
While this may register a "yeah, and the sun came out again today" response from
most of you, Rush is not on any radio stations out here.  And for a metropolitan
population of roughly 10-13 million people and 50 radio stations, you'd think 
one would have the decency to play Rush.  Sadly, I believe that the business of 
radio is dictating what's played and not the DJs.  Can you shed any light on 
this, Joe?

Subject: Fastest Guitarist

I really don't think speed is all that important when it comes to guitar
playing, however, its an interesting thread.

Once you get to a certain speed, I think it becomes almost impossible to
distinguish who is faster. What is a better measure is how clear you can
hear each note, and how complex the piece is... Then there is always the
listenability factor.. Melody DOES matter, but for the sake of argument, I'm
not considering it here...

Granted, this thread was pertaining to Rock guitarists but I have to broaden
this a little. The fastest player I have heard, with the most clarity and
complexity, is absolutely Al DiMeola.    There may be others like him or
even more fast, clear and complex, but if there are I have not heard them.
Al is a Jazz/Fusion guy who went to  Berkley School of Music and who has
been around just about as long as Rush. He started in Chick Corea's band, if
memory serves.. Anyway, I recently   saw him live close up at a Jazz club
(like within 5 feet) , and even had him sign my a CD after the show, and let
me tell you, the guy is utterly amazing.  Get the CD's "Kiss My Axe" or
"Orange and Blue" or even his new one "Infinite Desire"  to see what I
mean..  You need to open your mind a little if you tend to be a Rock or even
progressive rock fan, but trust me, once you do,  you'll be addicted...

Subject: You asked about Speed Demons?

Seeing Al DiMeola's mention at TNMS was very cool indeed. One of Al's
fortes is that he has *tremendous* right-hand picking technique and that
this carries over perfectly to the accoustic guitar. He is unbelievably
clean on the accoustic (listen to the original 'Mediterranean Sundance' to
hear this) and he likes to use partial right-hand muting to gain speed and
cleanliness.
I always like to mention another guitarist in the same breath as Al DiMeola
  John McLaughlin. To hear these two at their most amazing, IMO, you should
hear their accoustic recordings. John McLaughlin's live 'Shakti' album, on
which he plays an accoustic with Zakir Hussain on 'tabla', features the
fastest playing I have ever heard *on the guitar*, accoustic or electric.
To call it simply 'fast' seems kind of demeaning - 'lightning' is more like
it.

Even better are the live recordings Al and John made together with Paco de
Lucia (the amazing flamenco guitarist). These are 99% improvisation and
sound inaccessible even to hardened players, but they are absolutely *!#%#
crazy!! 'Friday Night in San Francisco' is just one of the recordings that
trio made together.
*IMO* those two play faster any day on the accoustic than Malmsteen has
ever done on the electric. And both of them were huge influences on Alex
Lifeson. When I heard 'La Villa' for the first time, I immediately thought
'Al DiMeola' - the opening accoustic riff, the solo - not as clean and as
fast (listen to the stuff I'm talking about before you flame) but the
influence is there.

Regards,
Ashim.
P.S. I've heard 'Powers of Ten'. Shawn Lane is fast, but even more amazing
is the sound he gets from his lace-transensor pickups. If you think he was
fast on that album, you ought to hear him in 'Temporal Analogues of
Paradise'!! ;-)

Hey folks,
Just thought I'd let y'all know that in this month's Mix magazine, there is
an article on recording drums. They interview some big name producers,
including Peter Collins. He briefly mentions the differences in approach
Rush had for their sound in the '80's as opposed to the last two studio
albums. He also talks very briefly about the work he's done with the Indigo
Girls.
bye for now,

Subject: A Little Bit of Everything

Hi everybody,

I've not posted in a while but I saw some things that interested me and 
I had to put my 2 cents in.

I consider myself a true Rush fan, even though I've only been into the 
band for a year and a half (just in time to miss the T4E tour).  Sure,  
I'm a "thinking man" with a college education, but other than that, my 
similarities to that other Republican "true fan" ends.  I don't 
associate myself with either flavor of Republicrat.  I'm single.  I'm 
young (well, relatively speaking.. 23 is still considered young, isn't 
it?).  Bleh!  It's all demographics anyway.

I don't think there's any such time signature like X/3.  The bottom 
number indicates what kind of note is counted as a "beat".  2/3 would 
mean that a triplet-half-note (is there such a thing?) would get a beat, 
and there are 2 of these beats in a measure.  Huh?  No, that part of the 
drum solo seems to be in 3/4.  3 quarter-note beats per measure.  I seem 
to remember a similar debate coming up on the King Crimson mailing list.

Relayer takes some getting used to.  It helps to be predisposed to 
liking Yes.  For the new Yes listener, I recommend something a little 
more straight-forward, like Fragile or The Yes Album.  Relayer is much 
more experimental and harder to listen to.

Which reminds me.  Does "The Spirit of Radio" remind anybody else of 
some of the riffs in "Roundabout"?

I also agree with those who deride that guy's #20 ranking of p/g, which 
happens to be my 2nd favorite Rush album.  Dark?  Paranoid?  Minor?  
Emotional?  Bring it on!

The first time I heard 2112 on DS, I thought it sounded much lower than 
just tuned down just one whole step.  I thought it was like B or 
something.  Heavy!  I love it!

I still remember my favorite Rush radio moment, when they played YYZ 
(from E...SL) and La Villa Strangiato (from Hemispheres) back-to-back.    
This was in Janesville, WI, when a station there was in a transition 
period (they had a rock format then; now I think they play dance music).

First epic song?  It's all subjective.  For someone out there, "Finding 
My Way" could be an epic.  And who knows?  Maybe they had "epic" songs 
way back before they even recorded anything.

I know a lot of you are entertained by flames, but I'm not.  Sorry, but 
I'd like to see them stop, or at least kept off the public list when 
they are private in nature.

I highly doubt they used a Taurus II on "Xanadu".  I don't think the 
Taurus II came out until 1979 or so, and most likely after AFTK came 
out.  Most likely they used an original Taurus.  The original Taurus 
sounds better than the Taurus II anyway, and is better at producing that 
classic growl/whomp that the Taurus is famous for.  Anybody else here 
play a Taurus (either kind)?  Do Geddy and Alex still use theirs?  Would 
they be willing to sell me one? :)

What's this about 22 gold Rush records being all of their releases?  
There's the 16 studio albums, the 4 live albums, Archives, Chronicles, 
and the 2 Retrospectives.  So, which ones haven't gone gold?  I would 
imagine the Retrospectives, since those are so new, and most of us have 
all those songs anyway.

  Jack

Subject: Mixing Neil's Drums

I finally took some time last night to listen to some of the Rush re-masters on
my stereo, specifically "Hold Your Fire" and "Signals" and I noticed something I
don't remember ever noticing before.  (I should mention I've played drums for 20
years, so I always pay close attention to Neil.)  On HYF Neil's drums are mixed
as though you are sitting at his drums (ride cymbal on the right, toms panned
left to right, etc.).  I could have sworn every album was mixed as though you
were looking at them on-stage and I remember I used to listen to Rush through
headphones backwards (left phone on right ear) so I could feel like I was
sitting at Neil's drums.  I thought there was something wrong with my stereo, so
I threw in "Signals" and sure enough that one is mixed as I recall -- like you
are looking at them.  Does anyone know why HYF is different?  Is it the only
album like this?  Is it just the remaster?

Anyway, it made me very happy.

Subject: Album certification

Okay here's an interesting question I was recently discussing with
someone.  Maybe someone can shed some insight....

Why is it that whenever you see a Rush Discography, the Retrospectives
albums are not listed?  Is it not a "real" album for some reason?

On the TNMS website, the discography does not include Retro OR Archives.
And most website discographies ignore both of those albums (including
mine).

   [ They're not included because I don't have them :-)     : rush-mgr ]

And in the recent press release from Atlantic Records about DS going
gold, they refer to "22 albums, the band's entire catalog".  Well, I
count 16 studio albums, 4 live albums, and I guess they're counting
Chronicles & Archives.  Where are Retro I & II ???  And how come they
cound Archives but TNMS does not and most Rush fans do not?

Furthermore, when I went to the RIAA website (where they list all the
gold & platinum certifications), Archives is there, Chronicles is there,
but NOT Retrospectives I & II.  I'm sure that Retro went at least Gold,
but it's not there.

Can anyone help me out with this quixotic pursuit of mine?

Thanks!
Rob

This is in reply to Cat's memo.  I agree with you.  I don't think anyone
should stereotype the "Diehard Rush Fan" or stereotype anybody for that
matter.  However I am mainly focused on the fact that Rush Fans are older.
I myself just turned 23 (Think what you want but I'm a diehard).  Most of
the other stuff is true, I am married, college edjumacated.  But I am not
conservative.  
So, Cat if  you get flamed, we can get flamed together.

Michael Leach said "I must state that it appears that true die hard Rush fans
are older, married, have college educations, and are conservative."

And someone replied "does that mean once I'm married--I pass on all other
accounts..?"

And I respond: once you're married and providing for others, especially your
children, or running your own business, etc., your priorities and political
beliefs change (once you've openned your eyes).  I don't want to talk politics
in the NMS (its like beating a dead horse, eh?), so I'll end my comments with
the following quote which sums it up quite well:  

"Any man who is under 30, and is not a liberal, has not heart; and any man who
is over 30, and is not a conservative, has no brains. " - Sir Winston
Churchill

Of course in todays society, ol' Winston would have to be politically correct
and substitue "person" for "man", lest he offend someone!

Subject: Relayer By Yes, Brad Webb! / Small sighting

Hey Rush-Heads.  A reply to Brad's justification of checking out Yes' =
Relayer....

An admitted Yes fan for many of the same musical reasons I enjoy Rush, =
Relayer is up there for a Yes favorite of mine.  My biggest defense =
usually lies in the incredible dexterity it takes to play ALL the parts =
for Gates of Delerium. Vocals, guitar, bass, drums, keyboards... Totally =
phenomenal, yet still flawed.  Not FM friendly, and not widely heard and =
enjoyed by Yes fans in 1975 because so many bailed after the first live =
album & Topographic Oceans - Relayer's predecessors.

There's a point during Gates that most listeners interpret as one big, =
mad, English art-rock amplified Cluster Fuck... that's approaching the =
big slowing climax before the 2nd to last slow theme bursts in.  No =
matter how I tried, I could never hit the mark OR count that entire =
section, pretty much a necessity if you're going to play along on the =
drums.  =20

In a way, I've always conceded as a listener to what the composers MEANT =
to convey with that song, but couldn't quite hit exactly where most =
listeners decide it makes for good music.  I cut them slack as a player, =
acknowledging the technical point being made instead of the musical one.

Lots of people feel the same way about Rush... that the technical side =
of their wonderful playing sacrifices an emotional hit -sometimes-, or =
that certain something that gaurantees big radio exposure, whatever that =
may be that month. =20

Too bad for them.

Check out the live performances of the songs from Relayer & you might =
find they take on needed life from the live setting & arrangement.

Just don't play it at parties.   Not pretty.

Mas Rush Content.  Since DS is hanging well on the charts, it made a =
mention in a syndicated article about this holiday's live music =
selections, which I saw in San Antonio's Express-News.  3 1/2 stars, =
positive mentions of it being a "...good starting point for the new =
listner, a must-have for any Rush fan, a decent cross-section of Rush as =
a whole....", or words to that effect.  And a photo of Ged.  Good stuff!

Yes, these are really fast.  No way to say who is the
fastest (who cares anyway, just LISTEN (Rush Content -
Didacts and Narpets))

Other really, really fast stuff:

Whitesnake's album "Slip of the tongue" track 6
"Wings of the Storm".  Solo starts around 2:14 -
great stuff so diverse and it's loong - 1m16sec.
At 3:04 a passage comes on and you think "Damn,
that's fast.  Just warming up, because at 3:17
he shows his true power - this is *!*FAST*!*
One of the best solos I've ever heard.  None
other than Steve Vai, I would say possibly the
most creative guitarist who ever lived.  He 
defers to Hendrix, but Steve has NO limits.

T-Ride's album "T-Ride", track 5 "I Hunger"
Check the run at 0:49 - wicked.  Track 9,
"Bone Down" is awesome for sheer wild 
MIDI-type sounds.  Guitarist: Jeff Tyson,
studied with Joe Satriani.

Song most used to show off speed:
  "Flight of the Bumblebee"

Versions I know of:

Tony MacAlpine's album "Madness" track 7
"Confrontation with the Electric Bees"

Nuno Bettencourt on Extreme's "Pornograffitti"
track 11 part 1 "Flight of the Wounded Bumble Bee"
As referred to above, this is really fast.  Did
you know Nuno transcribed it, every other one of
those notes are produced by a delay unit?  It
was in an interview in GFTPM.  The piece is still
really difficult, as Nuno said his hand hurts 
whenever he finishes playing it.

Jennifer Batten on her solo album "Above Below
and Behind" (Sounds like the title to a track by
our favorite band, eh?) track 1 "Flight of the
Bumblebee"  Note no doubling here, this is done
with 2 hand tapping.  Unreal.  I saw her do it
on one of those terrible late-night infomercials
for guitar videos.  Sad that a guitarist this
good has to do something like that for money.

If some of you wanna hear this stuff, backchannel
me and I will consider mp3-ing the stuff onto my
web page.

Sorry this is so long.

Brad,

I found the Relayer quite hard to get into on a first
listen.....BUT....I had only listened to Yes for
abotu a month at that point.  I loved Fragile and then
went and bought Relayer.  Fragile is a great introduction
to Yes, whereas Relayer is really for the seasoned Yes
listener.  I can tell you this, the album is unbelievably
cool once you have about three listens.  Soundchaser
is fantastic and the musicianship of all members is great.

Geddy probably likes it for the dynamics and the "strangeness"
of the album.  For 1974, that album was priceless and was very, very,
very futuristic sounding!  I admit, it's not my fav. album but I think
you and I both would have REALLy appreciated this album
a bit more way back in 1974.  (I am only 25)

Subject: NEIL IS A HUMAN BEING!

For the gentleman taking me to task for opposing Neil's illogical stand
on guns:

1:  He's entitled to his opinion.
2:  His lyrics suggest he would like us to think for ourselves, not
blindly follow an authority figure.  Good thing, because:
3:  He smokes.  Is that wise?
4:  The only proveable argument for vegetarianism is that it is cheaper
in terms of acreage per calorie produced.  Were Neil logical in his
environmentalism, he'd be a vegetarian.
5:  Despite his lyrical objection to socialism and oppression, he
continues to live in a nation that confiscates, at a guess, 80% of his
income in taxes.
6:  Neil, as a self-professed libertarian, seems quite willing to invade
other people's rights and privacy if guns are in the equation, and by
remaining in Canada supports the oppressive burden personal income tax
and other regressive taxes place on those with less than his money.
7:  Speaking of money, I'm sure Neil lives in a nice neighborhood, and
has all his banking done for him.  I doubt he actually takes his
Thousand$$$$ to the bank in cash the way some of us in business must.
8:  Again as a professed libertarian, he should recognize my common-law
right to defend myself (oh, yes--he'll let me use my bare hands. 
Unfortunately, the crowbar-weilding imbecile I had to contend with
didn't see them as a threat.  I have the skill to have crippled him and
disarmed him with my bare hands, but my .45 was a much more convincing
argument--and no lives were lost, no one injured, no police paperwork
needed to be filled out.  Saved the taxpayers a bundle, but I digress.)  
9:  Claims to the contrary, Neil is a liberal socialist.  And that is
his right.  I respect him for his music and talent.  I do not blindly
worship him for his politics.  I save that for Washington and Jeffeson,
who:
10:  Kept slaves.  Should I follow their example, too?

think we need more postings like the one BJ wrote instead of the wars =
that people are waging against one another.

I tried to reply to this already, but I clicked "reply" instead
of using the correct address :^/

I'm Juno! The person who asked- is that you, Zuck? Cool.

I haven't posted much because I don't have time to read the whole
NMS's and reply to a bunch of stuff. I'm getting married on 12/22,
so I won't be Julie Oneida, I'll be Juno Farnsworth (the Indiana
Motor Vehicles Dept. will take my word for name changes, so I can
put in the new first name also.) I'm back in school- Purdue premed.

DS kicks ass! My fiance watched me listening to LTTA! and said that
I get the same look on my face during foreplay :^).

So, are all those other weirdos who went to the CP Pittsburgh
get-together still here too?

Hey there, Hi there, Ho there....

     I was just thinking (a bad habit, I know). I get a laugh out of some
of these posts. Some people on here are truely amazing and some are, well,
comical to say the least. I have enjoyed my first year of TNMS, and I look
forward to many more. Happy holidays, fellow RUSH FANS.
