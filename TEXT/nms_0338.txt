First, Syrinx was down for about 1/2 hour today to be moved.  It now
sits in my office again!!  If you tried to ftp and got refused, that's
probably why.

Secondly, I will not be around tomorrow through Sunday, so there will
be no NMS for tomorrow.  The next one should be Monday, 9/16.

I'm pleased to see all the excellent spoofs of the new album.  Who says
Rush fans don't have a sense of humour about the band??

Subject: Immunity or a bowl of rice...

Hey, hey, hey! (It's Fat Albert -- no, no ...)

I haven't posted much lately, because I don't
feel like boring anyone with my opinions on
'Dem Bones.  I don't believe anybody really cares
about that particular belabored topic of conversation,
but I just remembered a first impression I had of the
title track.  The line in question is:

"Faith is as cold as ice-
 Why are little ones born only to suffer
 For the want of immunity
 Or a bowl of rice?"

When I first heard this tune, this verse
was understood by me to be:

"Faith is as cold as ice-
 Why are little ones born only to suffer
 For the want of immunity
 Or abortive rights?"

I am not bringing this up to cause any kind
of moral posturing on the issue of abortion,
but you have got to admit that this verse
fits with Neil's non-religious ideology and
it makes just as strong a point as the original
verse (and it rhymes!). I admit that it may have
grammatical problems but hey, it just came into
my head, it wasn't a conscious thing.  Anyway,
the thing that I want to know is if anyone else
experienced this particular little episode of
weirdness.  Also, is Neil's stand on abortion
documented?  Just a curious guy...

Shortly after HYF was released Rock Express did an article called

expiriences as well as Neil describing how he came to write the songs.
Interesting article indeed.

&gt;There's a text on my CD-cover: "Rush". Do you all agree with this? But they
&gt;surely aren't just "another three-chord band".

	Oh well. A three-chord band with a glorious past.

	As to my problems, I'd rather see you practice what you preach.

First I said to Gregg:
&gt;Thank you, you just confirmed my suspicions, you aren't really a Rush fan,
&gt;Rush is your religion.

	A couple of chapters later I hear Mr. Jazz claiming I think Rush
	are gods. Can't you see the fallacy of your thought chain?

&gt;The point is that you're so young and you want to be n:o 1 on everything.

	I would not subscribe to that. Young I may be, the latter is a
	trait I see in you.

&gt; telling one's opinion out of this album just after listening [to] it [for]
&gt; a day or two...

	Why shouldn't I have done that? You are correct in that great albums
	take several listens to be fully appreciated, but all relative finesse
	there is on RtB could be grasped in one take, as I said before.

&gt; How you must stand just there where you are with your own opinion.

	How so? I take it you meant "now" I must. Should I change my
	opinion, I would readily admit it. I'm not infallible. I am
	just another human being and I do make errors, and so do you.

&gt; They're not gods, even if you may think so.

	A basic course in reading comprehension is sorely needed. See
	another chapter above.

&gt;&gt; HYF: the font used in the "restaurant" is not similar to that of p/g
&gt;&gt; cover. See it for yourself! Whoever found that out must have made it up!
&gt;
&gt; Please don't ever tell me that something is wrong when it's something as
&gt; intangible as being "similar."  I *did* see this for myself.  I looked in
&gt; my CD booklet and said "ok, that's kind of similar."

	Both the fonts are slim. That's the only similarity. Otherwise,
	they're two different beasts. Entirely.

&gt; From: erik habbinga &lt;habbinga@tramp.Colorado.EDU&gt;

&gt;Why do I like Rush? Because it's Rush.

	I can't think of a stupider reason. Should they come out with
	an album made without real instruments, machines only, and
	Geddy only rapping, (this only as an example of a music form
	I don't like too much) and call it Rush, would you love it
	even if you otherwise hated rap just because it was Rush?

	Get a life.

&gt; From: jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger)

&gt;As for Alex's work: only one word, SUPERB!!

	What about it? Everything we've heard before except the
	abnormally simple and boring solos.

&gt; From: Rauli Lauhanen

&gt; work of beauty, and after that 100-min tape he included a special track,
&gt; which was named, "Geddy Lee, Truly sucks" ...Not only was this song 100 %
&gt; pure shit, It's tempo was abt 260 pps and and it lasted only 48 secs. Its
&gt; lyrics are hilarious and highly intellectual: "Geddy Lee truly sucks!
&gt; Geddy Lee truly sucks! Wanker!" and it ended like YYZ begun, I mean
&gt; similar Morse-code section but -.-- -.-.-  as ya know, -.-- is Y , but
&gt; -.-.- is nothing but start-mark.

	Y.U.P. is the band. Fairly well known in speed/core circles here,
	I gather. Actually the rest of the demo is fairly good, that
	Geddy-smashing song is just an exception.

jest a couple of things:
	1. a friend of mine is visiting his dad in Toronto.  could any of you
Max Webster and/or Kim Mitchel fans give me some info about their music?  you
know, what its like, best albums, etc. (I figured I'd get the non-rUSh stuff
out of the way first.)

	2. knock off the blatent, knee-jerk, belittling of rap.  most of the
rap the average person hears is POP-rap, and along with POP-metal, POP-rock,
top-40, and (its hard to believe this exists, but it does) POP-alternative,
it sucks.  however, there is good rap out there, it's just not heard much
because it ain't POP.

	3. don't pan RTB just because its not better than _____ or i wish
they would redo _____. its different, they're experimenting. think how must
life would suck if every class, project at work, movie or meal was just a
rehash of something you did yesterday, and have been doing for the past 10
years.

	4. i think there's a trend here. which albums do you rarely hear
about except in a negative way? PeW, S, and HYF. what albums follow them? MP,
g/p and Presto, albums which are among the best. its almost as if they were
trying something new, but didn't get it quite right on the first try.

	5. if you don't like RTB, put it away and listen to something else;
you'll probably pick it up again and all of a sudden we'll get a rash of "You
know, I didn't really like it when it came out, but RTB has some really
interesting parts ...." submissions just like Presto, just like HYF, just
like PoW, etc. it seems that the boyz grow a little faster (or in different
directions) than some of their listeners.

share and enjoy,

p.s. for those who still feel that rock and rap don't mix, check out
Anthrax's cover of Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise", esp. the video.  this
little ditty is rather popular on both eMpTyV's Headbangers Ball and
Yo! MTV Raps. oh, by the way, guess who's touring together, Anthrax and
Public Enemy.

Hi there,
	I went to a record store around here a couple days ago and
got a promo poster of the cover of RTB's (it looks even cooler bigger
:-))..I hung it up over my bed so that when I sit on my bed and look
in the mirror (directly in front) I see the reflection of the
poster..Needless to say, it's really cool...I'm not going to
start analyzing the cover thought although I must admit  I think
the skull represents the band's fatalistic, pessimistic attitude
towards life..:-) :-) :-) :-)...All I'm going to say about RTB's
for the moment is that Ghost of a Chance is my favorite and the
rap is meant to be playful so take it for what it's worth...

Chill and be excellent to on another..after all we are *all*

Subject: It's Parallax, You Dig?

Hi Everyone,

I thought I'd try to throw some light on what I find are the most
enigmatic lines of lyrics on the new album, namely

   It's a parallax, you dig?
   You move around
   The small gets big. It's a rig

&gt;From ``Roll the Bones.'' In particular ``It's a parallax...You move
around/The small gets big.''

It seems to me what Neil is saying here is that one's perspective on
events is capable of distorting them. From the objective point of
view events which seem big may not be so big. For example, on the
religious side ``miracles'' -- or on the career side getting a
``big break.'' From an objective point of view events are just
what they are and they ``just happen,'' and people tend to add their
own ``deep meaning''  to or take advantage of some while downplaying
or ignoring others. The `moving around' is just taking an alternative
mental perspective of the event -- what is a miracle to one person
is just an improbable event to another, and what is `just another
job interview' to one could be a `golden opportunity' to another.

This seems particularly so in light of the lines:

  Jack, relax.
  Get busy with the facts.
  No zodiacs or almanacs,
  No maniacs in polyester slacks.   (e.g. `Televangelists'!)
  Just the facts.
  Gonna kick some gluteus max.

and

  What's the deal? Spin the wheel.
  If the dice are hot -- take a shot.
  Play your cards. Show us what you got --
  What you're holding.
  If the cards are cold
  Don't go folding.
  Lady Luck is golden;
  She favors the bold.

In the final analysis:

  We come in to the world and take our chances
  Fate is just the weight of circumstances
  That's the way that lady luck dances

      Does anyone remember the name "Red and the Two-bar" in the credits
      of Presto? I think I know what they're talking about, but I can't be
      absolutely sure. If you've got an idea or know for sure, drop me a line!
      Incidentally, I suppose I must join the ranks and give my 2 cents about
      RTB. It made logical sense that an album of this nature was going to be
      made; its just the way the band is progressing. It doesn't show off their
      massive talents the way the older albums did, but it has a different kind
      of energy that is geared toward soul-searching and playing from within-
      which doesn't always mean bass or drum fills at warp 10. And don't always
      think that just because aspects of the world around you change, that your
      music *has* to change. Music is created from the soul, and whatever it
      feels usually dictates the kind of music you write. I've had personal
      experience with this kind of thing, so I can understand where Rush is
      coming from when they create this 'new' type of sound. And most
      importantly, don't ever think that because technology dictates a
      certain sound or type of song, that it will be followed. Bands today
      are as capable of producing the epic compositions made famous by such
      bands as Rush and Yes in the 70's. Don't count that type of music out
      yet. Thanks for your time.

Why is the subject &lt;none&gt;???
I don't know....

These aren't some opinions....these are facts...live with it.

1.) The rapper on "Roll The Bones" is Tony Gerainos
2.) Rupert Hine is the best thing to happen to Rush since the invention
    of the bass guitar.  Not only in their music, but in their personal
    attitudes.  Geddy, specifically, can't wait to begin work on the
    next album....
3.) There is no extra symbolism on the album cover that doesn't relate
    to the title 'Roll The Bones'.
4.) Rush isn't selling out...the 'fans' who think they are are the ones
    who are selling out.
5.) Alex, isn't pregnant.   (heheheh.)  :)

Rather than offer my impressions of the new album in the form of a

These are only OPINIONS, and I imagine as time passes they will
change.  As of today, I have listened to RTB 10 times.

My favorite (so-far) is 'Ghost.'  Except for disagreeing with some of
Neil's disbeliefs (which is just fine ...), I can really identify with this
song.  My wife and I have often expressed similar thoughts regarding our
meeting, relationship etc.  I've always been impressed with Neil's approach
to relationships.  'Open Secrets', 'Madrigal', 'Entre Nous' and 'Ghost of a
Chance', (and others) demonstrate a mature, realistic attitude towards one
of life's most challenging and rewarding endeavors: love.

On a related subject.  Does anyone find it ironic that Neil would write
                       'I don't believe in forever'
                   and 'I don't believe in ... angels'

yet also say 'I believe there's a GHOST of a chance' ?

I realize that this is simply a common expression, but it's mixture with
expressions of disbelief in any sort of afterlife seems a little strange.
Perhaps this was intended.

Comments: 'Where's My Thing?' sounds VERY 90s-ish.  Love those
synthesizers... Has anyone figured out what that voice-like sound at the
end of 'Neurotica' is saying?  (It also occurs 2:50 into the piece)

And... how about this explanation of the elephant's tail end:

The gestation period of an elephant is 22 months.  It has been 22 months
since _Presto_ was released.  ;-)

Subject: You know you're a Rush fan when...

Before the album comes out, you sit in class listening to Z-Rock and
waiting for the teacher to arrive when the DJ announces he's going to
play new Rush.  Not knowing *which* new song he's going to play, you
sit and ponder about what to do when you realize he's going to play the
song during class.  In a moment of excitement and panic, you rush (!)
out the door and head into the bathroom and lock yourself in a stall
(in case anyone from class comes in) -- and you miss a full 10 min. of
class just so you can hear a new Rush song!!!

With all of the talk about the up coming tour, I have, with all of my
mystical powers envested in me by the Fountain of Lammeth predicted the
songs the Boyz will play for the up coming tour, at least for a certain
portion of it.
Show Don't Tell
Fly By Night
Time Stand Still
Superconductor
Closer To The Heart
Roll The Bones
New World Man/
Dreamline
Bravado
Where's My Thing/
By-Tor And The Snow Dog
YYZ/
Neil's Thing
Scars
Manhattan Project
Tom Sawyer

-encore-
Spirit of Radio
2112
La Villa
In The Mood

I guess this looks kind of ambitious, or lacking, depending on how you
look at it. Basically I just picked the songs according to what they
have and have not been playing the last couple of tours. (And also
according to what I want to hear!)
    Most notably is the addition of Fly By Night and By-Tor. I guess
these are something of longshots, but I can just feel the vibes of oldie
coming to me. Maybe not Fly By Night, but something from that era.
Anthem possibly? And as for By-Tor, they have got to play one long type
song. Hey, I could have picked Cygnus X-1. Maybe Natural Science.
    Also notable are the songs missing. I'm a BIG fan of Subdivisions,
but they have been playing this song ever since Signals came out. I
predict they will retire it for this tour so they can fill its place
with something they haven't played in a while.
   And also the new songs. There will probably be one or two more than I
have up there. Face Up. Maybe Heresy. I wouldn't mind hearing Neuratica
(sp?)..
   And lastly, the encore. I also predict they will do something
slightly different for the encore, but I can't decide on what they will
get rid of to add. All of the songs are such Rush staples. Maybe replace
Spirit with something rare. Maybe shorten 2112 a little more.
   All in all, I predict some good playing and good times, especially
with the Boyz' new found energy. Look for some good song intro films,
and new lighting arangments.
   Any thoughts?

&gt;
&gt;From: eric@ovl.osc.edu
&gt;
&gt;Now, don't get me wrong, Copeland's a great percussionist, writer, and
&gt;producer, but he's just not in the ranks of the illustrius (Murder by 
&gt;Numbers).
&gt;By the ranks of the illustrius, I mean guys who have explored themselves just
&gt;to see what's possible with skins and sticks.
&gt;

Were I to create a list of the current "illustrious", it would
definitely include:
	Neil Peart &lt;not necessarily first, just the first to come to mind&gt;
	Billy Cobham
	Stuart Copeland &lt;if nothing else, his movie "The Rhythmatist"&gt;
	Steve Gadd &lt;*incredible* session work&gt;
	Omar Hakim
	Ed Shaughnessey (of the Tonight Show) &lt;not flashy, but *amazing*&gt;

&gt;However, I don't see Copeland reaching anymore. He did for a few years in the
&gt;early eighties, but most of the Police songs that get the attention are
&gt;relatively stagnant as far as new time signatures, sycopation, or even drum
&gt;flare at all.

That's more of a group decision than anything else.  If the group doesn't
reach for new things, it's difficult for the percussionist to do it on his
own.  I would encourage you to listen to "The Rhythmatist", a movie Copeland
made about 4 years ago.  It's *definitely* an exploratory piece.

&gt;I know what you're thinking now, the same is true of Neal. But Neal is a
&gt;drummer's drummer. He's the kind of guy you can listen to and not help getting
&gt;reinspired to become a better percussionist. Imitating Neal on the drums has
&gt;always helped me improve what I'm able to do on my own. As for Copeland, it
&gt;just makes you wish he would quit fooling around and show us what he can do.

Again, it's a question of where the *group* wants to go.  Rush has long been
know for exploring new areas *as a group*, and Neil benefits from that.  I
think that Copeland could do just as much with a different group.  This is not
a slam on The Police, it's just my opinion on their style's potential.

[ begin endorsement ]
If the Kentucky Headhunters ever release an album with a straight rock
tune, watch out!  The Headhunters' drummer, Fred Young, is my cousin, and
he's been playing for a *long* time.  As a matter of fact, their rock group
was signed by Swan Song records (Led Zep's label); however, that group dis-
solved.  If he ever gets a chance to cut loose, you may be amazed.  He is
NOT your typical one-dimensional country drummer.
[ end endorsement ]

Best,
Wes

&gt;From: "Thomas Koenig"  &lt;UI0T%DKAUNI2.BITNET@YALEVM.YCC.Yale.Edu&gt;
&gt;Subject: The meaning of 'Tom Sawyer'
&gt;
&gt;I think I understand most of Rush's lyrics, but 'Tom Sawyer' has me
&gt;baffeled so far.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody who can shed some light on it?

``Tom Sawyer'' is a song about a _persona_, much like ``The Analog Kid''
and ``Digital Man.'' Obviously Neil finds these personae worthy of
thought and effort, presuming that we will find them interesting also.
To me, the ``Tom Sawyer'' persona represents a certain portion of
Rush fans, possessing certain virtues (like taking no B.S. and
wasting no time on irrelevant or just plain stupid accusations
(e.g. `You like _Rush_? -- Rush sucks! You suck!): ``His reserve
is his quiet defence'') and clearly being characteristic of our
times. The title is chosen in order to recall Mark Twain's young hero,
who could be considered an intelligent (not necessarily _educated_,
but thoughtful and not prejudiced by society either) rocker before his
time, IMHO. I find a certain resonance with ``Tom Sawyer'' in
``Roll the Bones.'' I've always thought the guys outside the
Hammersmith Odeon in the photo of the inside cover of the _Moving
Pictures_ tourbook look like they fit this mold.

The core of any deeper `meaning' of the song seems to be contained in
the lines

``What you say about his company/ Is what you say about society,''

which I take to be saying to anyone making criticisms of his character or
making accusations against him: also consider the source of his
choice to remove himself from the mainstream of societal behavior --
namely that very mainstream behavior and its underlying menality.

On a sadder note:

&gt;P.S. - Don't answer with that sophomoric philosophy...
&gt;"Roll the Bones".  I mean "Why do I have a microwave oven?
&gt;Because I have a microwave oven.  Try Bud Dry.  Roll the
&gt;bones."

ARGH!!! In our very midst someone applying the `s' adjective
to Rush. Perhaps the ``Roll the Bones'' idea seems sophomoric
to you because you haven't _thought_ much about the song.
As for ``Why are we here/ Because we're here,'' this is
relatively deep (IMHO) contrary to the apparent banality of
wording. Certain very important things may actually have
no fully satisfactory (rational) explanation -- this is no
shallow idea. All one can do when faced with such a situation
is take some position on faith or reduce one's need for
explanation.

As for Bud Dry: ``Fuck that shit! Pabst Blue Ribbon!!''

``Now it's dark.''

Has anybody even considered the fact that with today's technology, that
it could have been A N Y B O D Y ' S voice that could be in that part
of the title track? It could be one of their wives for all we know, all
they'd have to do is send it through a processor and you'd never know who
it was. It could be Jim Burgess for all we know he has that nice little

maybe not..But does anyone get my point?

1. Matthew Coohills post about his girlfriend was the funniest thing I
   have read in ages!!! Laughed for about 1/2 an hour. Thank you for that
   hilarious (yet somehow, true to life - yeech!) post.
2. Admit it, ye scurvy dogs...Where's ma thang rules hard. I have a great idea:
    let Rush release it as a single...it gets mondo airplay on Rock stations...
   and it wins the long-delayed Grammy for best instrumental that should have
   gone to YYZ!!!! (I love it...can you tell? For those of you who think it
   is too short, it isn't. It's just so perfect that it leaves you gasping for
   more!)
3. I must be the last poster to do this, but my fave non-Rush disks at the
   moment are:
   (In no particular order, preferencewise)
	1. Prong - Beg to Differ
	2. Jesus Jones - Liquidizer
