Subject: RUSH as musicians

Hello all.  I am way, way, way behind on reading NMS's but scanning through
it seems that the thread of the boyz as musicians has come up again.  Well,
I'd like to say that they are perhaps one of the most talented groups around
today, or back when they started.  Perhaps individually they aren't the best
in what they do, but as a whole they really click together.  In general that
is why I chose the bands that I like.  That is, that they can work together
well.

Individually, I can think of people, dead or alive, that rival each of the
boyz talents.  To a none musician, I think Flea is a great bassist, and no
one will ever rival Jimmy Page, besides Hendrix or maybe Claypton.  But what
they write, music and lyrics, is inventive, and insentive.  Not only that,
but most important it fits together well, i.e. is aesthetically pleaseing
to me.

To summarize, I think the boyz are in their own right great (though not
deserving worship).  Their music is good, doesn't sound like junk, and they
perform together well.  I'd scroll on by now, cause I have no idea when I'll
stop.

Just to illustrate my point I could contrast some other groups.  For one, I
indirectly mentioned above, The Red Hot Chili Peppers.  As far as musicians
go, their os only one that stands out to me, Flea.  But again as a whole they
can play with good unity, and the stuff they write is fun to listen to, and
have a great time with.  Next would be U2, with no one (at least to a
nonmusician) of any great talent.  Yet again they play well together, and the
music they write is good.  Yet perhaps the band that fit together the best,
with the best talent, as writers and performers, is Led Zeppelin.

To go to the opposite side, I would Vernon Reid is a very good guitarist.  Yet
I dislike some of the stuff Living Color has made.  I don't like their writing
style, and think they only really click on some of their tracks.  Also, I
think Madonna (don't flame me for this), is a very talented writer, with a
good voice.  She is inovative and certainly creative, but I dislike her style
and performances, and music in general.

As a conclusion I just want to say that when some say a group is crap simply
for one reason it is the biggest bunch a arrogant bullsh*t I ever heard.  Even
if it is simply that it "is my opinion".  I have tried to take all that I
percieve and experience in performing my opinions.  But when people formulate
their opinions on limited ...

Sorry, that was the sleep, in me talking :).  I get this way when I'm tired.
Let me just say that I think Rush is a great band because of all that I've
listened to and experienced has led me to think so.

Howdy fellow Rush Fans-
   I just got back from a little road trip to Hartford and thought you might
like to hear about the concert (and some neat synchronistic events)!  Upon
arriving I noticed that the Hartford Civic center is on Pratt street (no way!).
I had some time to kill, so I walked around a bit only to find a stand-n-eat
place called "On the Roll" (Roll the B__es anagram), and a bar called the
"Russian Lady", which was selling "Presto Shots" in honor of Rush.  Kind of
cool, eh?  I also saw a streamlined (running) bus parked in back of the Civic
center, and caught a glimpse of a long-haired bespectacled individual quickly
climbing in (Geddy?).  This all psyched me up for the show, but Vinnie Moore
sucked and ruined my roll.  This is musical self-masturbation at its best,
folks.  The guy was getting himself off but doing nothing for the audience,
who politely sat and clapped (I plugged my ears for him) - only a third of the
audience was there for this part of the show.  The guy is technically a great
player, but is clueless in the area of composition - his songs were like
continuous solos.  Anyhow, my mood changed when the boyz came on stage.  They
were awesome, and the show was way better than the Presto show.  Lasers and
lights aflashing (dig those rotating pyramids around Geddy and Alex), an
awesome quadrophonic drum solo, and incredibly crisp solos by Geddy, and Alex
especially.  Xanadu was awesome and Geddy's voice was wonderfully accurate and
flexible, he hit all those highs (even that high "Xanadu").  At the beginning
of "Big Money" some girls threw handfuls of big money into the air, letting it
rain down on the surrounding audience (large reproductions of 1000 dollar bills
) -very cool (I even kept one).  Peart lost a stick (but not a beat) and had
some mixing problems during Force 10 (nearly inaudible jackhammers), but other-
wise the show went pretty smoothly.  I brought a friend who sort of liked Rush
with me to the concert, but he left the show a serious fan.  He had seen
several other rock bands in concert, and he said that Rush blew them all away!
Now he won't listen to anything but Rush! (this doesn't bother me - He's one of
my flatmates!)  Anyhow, I think we have a new convert.  A guy was also handing
out info on bootleg cassettes and videos of concerts, if I can dig this up I
will post it later.  (The thing on the rack unit was a spastic plastic skeleton
- to whoever it was that asked).  Adieu!

Subject:      Leiber & Musical Talent

Oh yeah-
     I almost forgot...I found and read Fritz Leiber's "Gonna Roll The Bones"
in Harlan Ellison's "Dangerous Visions" (a collection).  It is pretty short
and is about a miner (I'm not sure where or when) who is a small time gambler
who has a remarkable talent for shooting craps.  He (Joe Slattermill) goes to
a casino called "The Boneyard" (run by Mr. Bones).  Joe goes to a table where
the big gamblers are playing, and notices a very dark looking indiviual, and is
convinced that he must be a very bad dude.  Joe quickly doubles his money many
times over and makes 4096 dollars out of one, but decides that he wants to see
the dark dude roll the dice (which have skulls on them), so he purposely
fumbles his roll.  The dice work their way around to the dark gambler who is
not a very fancy roller and borders on cheating.  This annoys Joe, who finally
demands a test and shows that he is cheating.  The dice then come to Joe, who
bets and craps out by mistake (although there are supernatural powers acting).
He throws the dice at the eyes of his opponent - the dice go into his head - he
gargles them and spits them out:  he is nothing but a skeleton in cognito.  The
skeleton tells joe that he can bet his life, since he has nothing else, and he
does.  The ending, however, is baffling.  I won't give it away, in case anyone
wants to read it.  Anyone who has a good idea about what the ending means,
please email me/or TMNS.
    As far as the "there are better drummers/guitarists/bass players" argument,
it holds no water.  First of all, each of the musicians in Rush have been voted
at least once (if not several times) drummer/guitarist/bassist of the year by
serious polls of seriously based opinions in the recent past.  This, as well as
simply listening to their technical playing should be evidence enough that they
are all, at the very least, passable world-class musicians.  This, however, is
not what is important: composition, craftsmanship, and interpersonal chemistry
between the members is what makes them great.  If you can play, but not compose
,you will never be very interesting (take Vinnie Moore for example:  strong
technique, weak composition).  If you do not put great care into what you do,
you will not be interesting (look at the majority of the lyrics out there:
there's nothing very interesting about "ooh ooh baby - I love you" - no thought
or craftsmanship went into it).  If the chemistry is non-existent or unbalanced
you will not be interesting either (Satriani can play, compose, etc., but he
uses boring drum and bass tracks as a platform for his guitar playing, rather
than trying to find/play tracks which are of equal quality to his guitar
playing, so he gets boring fairly quickly).  Rush are doing a good job at
finding that complimentary chemistry which is necessary to form a stable rock
band and produce interesting music.  This is not to say that other bands don't
do this, but few do it with the style and graceful power that the boyz do.  If
you are not after this type of chemistry (ie. you like guitar-dominated music
or totally non-serious music or whatever) that's fine too - you can't argue
over taste - but Rush IMHO are redefining or at least exemplifying what good
musicianship is all about, and I appreciate it!
                                              -Hans G. (HGRUENIG@UVMVM.UVM.EDU)

To Ray:
I agree with you that this discussion should continue in EMail, but I
feel the need to respond...

I know Rand wouldn't advocate with "Unfair" tactics, but the simple fact
is that she DID support the "Robber barons".  If you wish, I can send
you specific references of her saying, point blank, that the "Robber
Barons" are noble men, despite these misdeeds.

The only reason that I even metioned that is because she would say that
some of their actions (when isolated from their lives) weren't moral,
but she WOULD say that they (the men themselves) were the nearly epitome
of her philosophy.

If she advocated these actions my post would have been meaningless.  She
DOESN'T advocate them, however.

Subject: "Stage" Question

     I didn't see this in the FAQL, so if I missed it, please don't flame me. 
I just got the "All the World's A Stage" CD. In the song "In the End", which 
happens to be one of my favorite RUsh oldies, right between the part where, 
in the version, Alex switches from the acoustic to the electric (the little 
quiet part) Geddy says something that I can't quite make out. I think it's 
something like "one... two... buckle my... shoe..." and then Alex kicks in. 
Am I correct here?
Is Geddy having fun counting off a bar or what?

[ That's what he says, and that's my impression, for what it's worth.
                                                                  :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Fun with Ticketbozo

Now I understand why everyone on this list seems to be
ragging on Ticketbozo.  This weekend, I got two tickets
to the Oakland Coliseum show (not bad, but not great either)
to go with my two Fresno tickets.  Today, I called in again to see
just for fun if Oakland was sold out yet.  And what do I hear on
their little recording but that tickets for Oakland, Fresno, and
Sacramento were all on sale now.

Sacramento? I ask myself.  I hadn't heard anything about
Sacramento.

So the woman comes on the line, and I say, "What's this about
Sacramento?  When did tickets go on sale?"

"Oh, that was last Saturday at 10 am."

"Now, wait a minute,"  I protest.  "I called Friday at 2:00 asking
for Rush information.  I was told that tickets for the Fresno show
went on sale at 10:00 that morning..." (I had called at 9:00 and of
course they had been clueless) "....and no one said anything about Sacramento."

"Well," she said, "I don't know what happened.  The computer
might have been backlogged, or we do have a lot of new people
working here..."

"So in other words there's nothing you can do."

"Sorry.  Rush tickets go on sale on the spur of the moment.  The
best thing you can do is keep calling in...But since they're in Fresno
on the 25th, Sacramento on the 27th, and Oakland on the 29th, they
might be adding second shows..."

"Which of course you'll announce on the spur of the moment too...?"

"They usually go on sale at 10:00 on Saturday or Sunday....Sorry..."

"Right..." &gt;sigh&lt;

[ Sounds like my experience when I tried to get tickets for Largo. Another
  NMS member had checked at a TM outlet, and had been told the date tickets
  went on sale, and the prices.  I called the main TM number in Washinton DC,
  and was told they had no information on Rush for any date.  (This is less
  than a week before tickets went on sale.)  I told them that another branch
  *did* have information, and after making them look TWICE more, they finally
  found the information.  Their excuse was that it wasn't listed under "Rush."
  Sheesh, what idiots.  And they control the ticket market.         :rush-mgr ]

I would have preferred Sacramento to Oakland, but oh well...that's Ticketbozo
for you.  I guess I should just be glad I got semi-decent
seats to two shows.

&gt;...And that I don't have to call BASS again until the next tour! (There
are advantages to the fact that my only other real favorite band,
the Alan Parsons Project, don't tour!)

Still looking forward to the shows,
--Rat

PS:  They're selling the sides of the stage now (Monday) for Oakland.
The woman said they may or may not start selling the back (behind the stage).

[ If they do, you'll get terrible seats.  They have a projection screen and
  curtain which goes across the back of the whole stage!  I guess if you want
  to see all the projection in reverse, and not see the band...    :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Songs played Live!!!

Well, lets see....I am sure some are mentioned in backlogs...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
&gt;After receiving my first Rush bootlegs I got the idea of collecting
&gt;all the Rush songs live. However, there are a few songs that they
&gt;haven't played in concert ever;
&gt; The first album: I really don't know about this. Have they played
&gt; every track?
Working Man, Finding My Way, In The Mood   &gt; All the Worlds a Stage.
What You're Doing (can't rememeber)

&gt;Fly by night: I don't know about this either.
Fly By Night, Beneath, Between and Behind,  In The End, Bytor and the
 SnowDog, Anthem
&gt;Caress of steel: I think they've played the whole album
  Not sure...   Bastille Day, LakeSide Park
&gt;2112: Oracle:the dream hasn't been played but I don't know about the r st.
2112, all but part III, at least on AtWaS.  Something for Nothing

&gt;A farewell to kings: I think they haven't played Cinderella man. What
&gt;about Madrigal?
Closer to the Heart, Xanadu, don't know bout the rest.

&gt;Hemispheres: They've played all the songs live, haven't they?
The Trees, La Villa Stranginato

&gt;Permanent waves: Different strings? Entre nous?
Spirit Of Radio, Jacob's Ladder, FreeWill, ???

&gt;The whole album Moving pictures has been played live.
Cool, would like to hear Camera's Eye...or is it on the video???
&gt;Signals: Losing it.
SubDivisions, The Weapon, New World Man, ???
&gt;Grace under pressure: Afterimage. I don't know about Red lenses.
DEW, Red Sector A, Enemy Within, ???
&gt;Power windows: Grand designs, Emotion detector?
????
&gt;I don't know about Hold your fire. Have they played High water,
&gt;Open secrets and Second nature? They probably haven't done Tai Shan.
Force Ten, Time Stand Still, Prime Mover, Lock And Key, Mission,
Turn The Page, I think High Water
&gt;(..and for Presto and RTB: I'm not interested)
Your Loss... :)
&gt;Does anyone know for sure about the abovementioned tunes?

       The "lost lyrics" to Rush - Fly By Night
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For now, I'll post the "lost" lyrics for "Fly by Night".  These
came from a copy written in Neils handwriting while in Lansing,
Michigan and Toronto Canada.  They were shortened for marketing
reasons when the final track was cut in the studio.  I believe
they were also published in one of the many Rush biographies.
The first time Geddy performed the song live, he screwed up the
lyrics but he stuck closely to the album version.  As far as I
know, he has never sang the first part live.  I think we should
all encourage him to do it live someday!!

*** Fly By Night by Neil Peart ***

Airport scurry flurry faces
Parade of passers by
People going many places
With a smile or just a sigh
Waiting waiting pass the time
Another cigarette
Get in line - gate thirty-nine
The time is not here yet

Why try?  I know why
The feeling inside me says it's time I was gone
Clear head, new life ahead
I want to be king now not just one more pawn

Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night goodbye my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend

Moon rise, thoughtful eyes
Staring back at me from the window beside
No fright or hindsight
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside

Start a new chapter
Find what I'm after
It's changing every day
The change of a season
Is enough of a reason
To want to get away

Quiet and pensive
My thoughts apprehensive
The hours drift away
Leaving my homeland
Playing a lone hand
My life begins today

RE:  Songs NOT played Live

I believe the only songs of the actual 2112 songthat have been played live
are the Overature and the Temples of Syrinx.  I know they were on one
of their concert tapes, Exit...Stage Left, and later appeared in Chronicles,
which I have heard is basically a mastered rundown of their Presto concert.
If anyone has bootleg material of the entire 2112 song in conce.xrt, I would
give dearly...  Hemispheres would be nice too.

[ Umm, the first side of _2112_ (minus Oracle: The Dream) is on _All The
  Worlds A Stage_.  I don't think "Oracle" was *ever* done live...  :rush-mgr ]

People have mentioned that the pattern 1-0-0-1-0-0-1 might have been used
because it sounded good.  I guess it's possible, but there are several
other patterns that would have flown as well: 1-1-0-1-1-0-1, or
0-0-1-0-0-1-1, or others.  On the other hand, It was my understanding
that the Boyz weren't really into computers, so why would they be
worrying about an ascii code?

After posting this, I'm never going to remember the proper bit sequence...

  I made a bit of a typo in the previous TMNS.  What I'm looking for
are votes for people other than the members of Rush.  IOW, I know that
almost everyone on this mailing list would vote for Rush, what I'm
looking for is other people.  Know what I mean?

To Ron Conescu and everyone else who's interested in Absalom's
biblical roots: Check out II Samuel from the Old Testament.
It has a lot about kind David (rush-mgr: Is he an ancestor of
yours?) and Absalom.

Subject:  Seems a lot like Rush

I noticed that Micheal Jackson (sp?) also broke for a rap session in his
song "Black or White" is Rush in a trend?  Mariah Carey tried to rap on
her first album (oooh I cringe) which was released nearly a year before
RTB.
Also - I feel that many of you are smashing the Presto album.  I am
starting to realise why you treat that one album so poorly as I listen
more to Rush's older songs.  Presto is actualy my more liked albums and
is special to me because not too long ago ... (Testimony time) Last summer
I was looking around for new ideas.  Until then I was strictly bound to
classical music, REM, Amy Grant, U2, Crowded House, and motion picture
theme music.  I was a light listener, although I have always had a strict
policy to know and understand the lyrics of any lieder, song, opera I
heard more than once.  I saw the rabits on the cover of this used CD in
an old shop off of I35 south of Austin.  Sure - I'll give anything a try
for three bucks.  At that time I was looking at rock music through straws.
Very few groups would sing of anything other than "oh baby" or "now what
will I do that you're gone..." knowing there had to be more intellectual
music I tried just about everything.  From pop releases to country to
rap... I came across REM on Mtv from their song "It's the end of the world"
and started listening to that group.  I had heard from one of my college
inmates (or is that room-mates) that rush was also good with lyrics.
RUSH PRESTO.  It looked light hearted enough to be seen easily with that
narrow perception of rock I had at that time.
Brought the CD home, played it on my brother's system, recorded it on tape.
Listened to it in the car.  Read the lyrics.  Soon enough, the cunning and
cynical humor of that album started to make sense... ohh ohh! ANAGRAM I get
it... cool! *the* *pass* ... so that's what that is.... time passed by and
I got a modem for my computer.  I got onto a BBS which had fidonet or eggnet
(something of the like) and heard some people talking about their thing.
What was that? oh! "Where's my Thing?" I soon realized that this was a song
from rush.  I got back to college (in San Marcos, Texas regardless of what
that header sais) and searched through a list of lists to find anything
that may have to do with this rush group.  The hook was now candied and I
wanted a bite.  I wanted more of a taste of this group.  the New Midnight
Star was there.  All other listservers I had in the past were managed by
lazy dogs and heretics.  One person would send to the list and that one
note would be sent to everyone on that list.  Really messy because you always
had to find the header in that 20 line address to figure out what the topic
was about before you read it.
I became so impressed by the organization and the skill this list site was
handled in that I began paying more attention to this list than all other
lists I had in the past.  Many people send their mail to the rush-mgr, he
sorts the mail, categorizes them in a concordance, posts it all as one letter.
The clarity of this mail conference led me to believe that Rush had some
true potential in their older albums.  I am now the proud owner of Power
Windows and Moving pictures ... along with Presto and Roll the Bones and
as soon as christmas is over I'm planning on getting hemespheres and
2112.  I enjoy their music thoroughly - and am now a devoted fan and defender
of rush.  I know of one other person who, like me, would not have ever become
interested in rush if it weren't for a slam surprise opening to an album
with a bunch of bunny rabbits.
