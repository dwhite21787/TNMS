is it just me, or does it seem like matt has been 14 years old for like 3 
years.  i've read the nms religiously for some time, and i can't wait to 
see matt's signature change to "age 15".  i feel like i'm getting older 
and everyone else is staying the same age.  sorry for the blabberous 
nonsense.  i guess it's just been a long year.

a semi truck and trailer from a company that calls itself "Rush

Uh...like, I have three items of interest:

1.  To Ashim who stated that John Petrucci doesn't have his own style:
You are drunk.  Stop drinking so much man.  Stuff will kill you quick.

2.  Neil Peart rules; however, Mike Portney from Dream Theater is taking
percussion to another level.  

3.  Ronald Reagan once said: "Today's hard-liner on law and order is
yesterday's liberal who was mugged last night."

Have a nice day.

Subject: In response to Nick (not you, the other one) and some additions 

Fellow Rushians,

  I know this conservative/liberal thread is wearing thin.  In light of
that I'll make it brief.  Nick's (bassplyr) response to his initial post
about conservatives and Rush makes a lot of sense.  I agree that one should
drawn upon many facets of knowledge and not limit one's self to other
aspects of information due to prejudice.  I also think it was a little
naive of him to think that most people wouldn't construe his comments to be
political in nature when he tosses words around like "conservative" and
"liberal."  
		I'd like to add 2 groups to Dom's list in 2169.

1.  Semisonic- Before everyone declares I've lost my grip on sanity I must
explain.  I met the band last summer and talked with them for a little
while.  The lead singer, Dan Wilson, said that he admires the musicianship
of 2112 in response to the question if Rush had influenced any of their
songwriting.  

2.  Juliana Hatfield- She used to be in a Rush cover band in Boston before
she joined the Lemonheads and Blake Babies.  All of her solo stuff is
great, particularly 1993's "Become What You Are."  In addition to being a
talented singer, songwriter and guitarist, Juliana almost directly lifts
some riffs from the song Hemispheres and puts them in her song "President
Garfield" (which is on "Become What You Are.")

Subject: I Feel NO Need for Speed

Hey Rushians,

Everyone keeps talking about the fastest guitarist.  Why is speed such a
big deal?  I just don't get it.  Yeah, when thrown in once in a while to
change things up.  But why is that the measure of how good a guitarist
is?

Three of my favorite solos are done by David Gilmour (no offense to
Alex).  Comfortably Numb, Another Brick in the Wall Part 2, and On the
Turning Away.  The feeling and the structure are awesome!  I remember
reading an interview where Gilmour mentioned that his left hand is not a
coordinated as his right.  It couldn't keep up with the pace, so to
speak.  So his speed was a bit limited.  He would practice, but it just
never came.  Plus there wasn't really a need for it in the context of
Floyd's music.  So just because he can't play fast means he's not
considered a great guitarist?  Just wondering.

Oh, and I think the only thing cool about the Great Swedish Guitarist,
is his name.  Yngwie Malmsteen.  Sounds like he should be playing Left
Wing for the Philadelphia Flyers.

Just my thoughts.

Scott Fab....

And if Yngwie was playing for the Flyers, Darren McCarty would kick his
ass!

G'day all,

This is going back a bit, but I remember hearing "New World Man" on the
Radio 1 Chart Show when it broke the charts (at number 40?). I think the
single was a "double A-side" with Countdown and NWM.  The cover was a shot
of the shuttle. I think it was only played that one time. I was gobsmacked
at the time, which is why I remember it.  Perhaps someone else can
confirm....(Slim Jim?).

Subject: Another Game Show Rush Sighting

I was watching a game show the other day which is broadcast on the Fox
Sports cable network called The Ultimate Fan League...a great Jeopardy-type
trivia show.  In fact, my wife was watching with me one day and said "This
show is sucking the estrogen out of my body."  I replied "Yes, and it's
converting it to testosterone and infusing me!"  :-)   But I digress...

Anyway, the during the final round on the show, the host asks a
sports-related question followed by a somewhat related non-sports question.
 One of the questions was:

Name two of the four running backs who have rushed for over 2000 yards in a
single season?

One of the contestants answered "Eric Dickerson & OJ Simpson"

This was followed by the question "Name the lead singer of Rush?"

And indeed, one of the contestants rang in and replied "Geddy Lee"

Pretty cool, eh?

Since I mentioned my wife, I thought I'd also add here that she really
doesn't get my whole 22 year love affair with Rush.  "Their songs all sound
the same and Geddy Lee is ugly."  (Yet when we got our cat over a year ago,
it was her suggestion that we name it Geddy...go figure).  So yesterday, we
were watching the old classic Rush appearance on Don Kirshner in which the
band was performing "Xanadu".  To my surprise, she actually sat there and
watched intently from the beginning...about halfway through she states
"This is an amazing song.  Did they actually write this?  Unbelievable."  I
couldn't believe these words were coming from this woman.  She was
particularly impressed with Neil's drumkit and his intense concentration as
he went from tubular bells to wind chimes to drums, etc.  The whole
interchange made my day.  :-)

Just my random thinks...

Subject: Weighing in on the whole Rush/Conservative thing......

 Dear Folks,
        I've been following with great interest the debate about Rush
and Conservatism here on the list and have found it to be quite
stimulating. I'll tell you right up front that I am a staunch
Conservative Republican, just a little to the right of Genghis Khan. I
am also a staunch Rush fan and own all of their CD's and 2 concert
videos. So all you Liberals can go ahead and skip to the next message if
you want to. I also want to extend a tip of the hat to Michael Z.
Williamson and CSmock1926@aol.com for having the fortitude to speak out
on behalf of Conservatism. Well done, guys! Also I wish to extend a
salute to Bassplyr1@aol.com for his comment in which he stated that he
thought "only the truly educated were Liberals". He has brilliantly
summed up with that one brief statement how arrogant and out of touch
the typical Liberal is.
 I've also been thinking a lot about the Conservative and Liberal
connotations of Rush lyrics. It strikes me that denouncing "tough
talkin' hood boys in pro-team logo knockoffs" is a pretty Conservative
standpoint. I think that if Mr. Peart had been writing from a Liberal
point of view, he'd have tried to find a way of excusing the behavior of
these "hood boys" rather than using them to illustrate a song that
states rather eloquently one of the things that is wrong with the world
today. Also "when they turn the pages of History when these days have
passed long ago, will they read of us with sadness for the seeds that we
yet grow?" only when they read the Chapter entitled "Liberalism", and
how they've "turned our gaze from the castles in the distance, eyes cast
down on the path of least resistance". You can't tell me that Bill
Clinton is not a "scheming demon dressed in Kingly guise, beating down
the multitude and scoffing at the wise".
 However, there are two sides to every coin. I also have detected
kernels of Liberalism in Rush lyrics as well. The most glaring example
would have to be "The Big Money", an obvious denouncement of the
(illusion of) greed in the 1980's.
 As far as Conservative Rush fans go, I can tell you only this: I have a
friend who is also a staunch Conservative and I have had the pleasure of
introducing her to Rush. She loves them and plans to buy all of their
CD's.
 So there ARE Conservative Rush fans out there, and all of you
wool-headed ninny Liberals who think that there is something wrong with
that will just have to learn to live with it. If it offends you that I
put on a Rush CD after listening to Rush Limbaugh, well that's just
fine.
 Have a nice day.

Subject: Rush Sighting on ESPN2

Hey Rushians,

I was watching NHL 2 NIGHT on the deuce Friday night when the host had a
Rushian Slip.  They were going over the highlights of the Los Angeles
Kings - Washington Capitals game.  Ray Ferraro (of the Kings) had
started the scoring in the first period with a beautiful move to the net
on Olaf Kolzig, the Caps goalie.  Then in the second, he won a face-off
and drew it back to the point.  The man on the point drove it back
towards the net, where Ferraro redirected it through Kolzig's legs. 
Plus Ray helped set up a few other goals in what I believe was a 6-3
victory for the Kings.  The host of the show summed up Ferraro's
performance as, "What Geddy Lee is to Rush, is what Ray Ferraro was to
the Kings tonight."

I had one of my own a few days earlier.  I started showing signs of a
cold on Monday.  So on my way home from work, I stopped at a local drug
store to get a couple of cans of Chunky chicken noodle and a bottle of
NyQuil.  That plus tax, the total was $12.21.  So close, and yet so far.

Scott Fab....

If Ferraro is Ged, then Luc Robitaille would be Alex.

Subject: Question re Scarred Records

Hello

I wonder if you can help me.  I've found a website under the name of Scarred
Records which sells "high quality" Rush and DT bootlegs.  I'd love to place
an order with them but I'm a little cautious about their policy of accepting
cash only with orders.  I know that there are perfectly valid reasons for it
but I'm not in the habit of sending cash to people I don't know.  Therefore,
can anyone tell me of their experiences (good or bad) of dealing with either
Scarred Records or Ryan Whitaker.  No slander or insult intended, I'm merely
looking for piece of mind.  I hope its good news because the stuff they are
selling looks great.  Comments on the quality would also be appreciated.

Please reply off-list to mnelson@beagley.demon.co.uk

Many Thanks,

Subject: Rockine- it's just a "don't ask" policy

In response to the posts in the previous newsletter Re: Rockline and the 
people who call with stupid questions:
THIS IS MY OPINION:
I think that the people who call Rockline (those who get through)ask 
dumb questions because they are not really interested in what they have 
to say.  I mean, look at the questions they asked!  Ged and Neil 
couldn't even answer them... far out philosophical stuff that I wouldn't 
touch with a 10-foot pole.

We had a discussion about this over coffee and we discovered that we 
were content with the fact that we may never speak to them.  We felt the 
people that call are interested in saying "we spoke to Rush!"

anyone else share our opinion?  I'm not going to go into that thread, 
"what would you ask rush?" it's old and I don't think rush-mgr cares to 
sort through piles of the same old same old.

A little related story to Doms excellent post:

>>Toad The Wet Sprocket (no longer in existence)
Rumored to have played "Closer To The Heart" in a few
performances.<<

Although I never heard them perform CttH live, they did do a neat contest in
the midst of their show in Nashville on the Dulcinea tour. Randy Guss,
Toad's drummer, challenged any drummer in the audience to play the last drum
fill before the solo from the ESL version of YYZ. They got a guy up from the
audience who did a really good job with it. I think Randy gave him his
drumsticks as a prize. Then Glenn and Dean started the first notes of YYZ as
the guy re-took his place on the floor. It was pretty cool.

I feel Rush has influenced many a performer, older and newer.

Take care all,

check these guys out. I just saw them at a bar last friday and they were 
awesome. The played "Limelight" for those of you looking for Rush

that song, I was really surprised. If you want to check them out they 
have a web site with sound files at:

Subject: Unsung heros

I've seen this thread come and go. Looks like it's back again. 
Whoever mentioned Chris Hays from the News is way cool, and it got me 
thinking--who are some great guitarists who never get their due?

1. Robben Ford--he's what Stevie Ray Vaughn would sound like if he'd 
studied with Joe Pass.
2. Howard Roberts--bopper in the Tal Farlow tradition, wild,extremely 
tasteful phrasing.
3. Mike Kennealy--former Zappa sideman who makes music guaranteed to 
please XTC and Zappa fans     alike.
4. Dave Gregory--lead guitar in XTC since 1982.
5. Mike Campbell--lead guitar in the Heartbreakers, and a grammy-
winning songwriter for "the Boys of Summer". Spare, but can pile on 
the notes when the situation calls for it.
6. James Mankey--Lead guitar in Concrete Blonde. Chops up the wazoo 
and clever phrazing.
7. John Jennings-Lead guitar for Mary Chapin Carpenter, can go from 
chicken pickin' torrents of telecaster notes to smooth Claptonesque 
lyricism.
8. Warren Cuccurullo--Another Zappa sideman, went on to form Missing 
Persons and replaced Andy Taylor in Duran Duran. His solo on their 
cover of Zeppelin's "Thank You" is too cool for school.
9. Alan Murphy--played with both Kate Bush and Go West. Check out his 
Holdsworthian turn on GW's "Don't Look Down"
10. Eric Bazilian--The guy from the Hooters, who also wrote "One of 
Us " for Joan Osborne. His solo on the Hooters' hit "Day by Day" is 
melodic, flashy and technically right on.

Later! I'm a-goin' to the movies,

Subject: PC v NP!?!  

Firstly, I would just like to greet everyone that reads this and =
receives TNMS.  I have just read my first copy, not long having =
subscribed.  I was first moved by Rush 21 years ago and have seen them =
about 30 times and there hasn't been a day when they haven't something =
to me in some way.  So, to all of you who are like me, you have =
instantly become my friends and I will look forward to your varying =
views and insights without prejudice or malice.

Having said that, who's the mong who even thought to compare Phil =
Collins with Neil?  Having missed the original message I may have the =
discussion out of context, but probably not.  Phil is very good, I am a =
great Genesis fan and have seen him perform many times, but words fail =
me.  Even if I didn't think he was a God it must be obvious to see =
Neil's brilliance, he really is on a different level.

Must go and put new pants (underwear) on, look forward to hearing from =
you all.

Subject: Speed

I'm really enjoying this speed thread. I'm not a speed player myself. I'm
more in the Michael Cozzi (Sky Cries Mary) or Dave Navarro (Jane's
Addiction, Chili Peppers) style but I can appreciate the skill it takes
to play Like Yngwie and Petrucci. (Saw Dream Theatre live in Seattle
RAWKED!) As far as balls out speed goes I think Katherine Thomas is
probably the fastest guitarest I've ever heard. You may not have heard of
her because her music SUCKS but DAYUM!!!! She's fast! Actually I
shouldn't say her music sucks because she's a classically trained and
very proficient musician. She also plays an electric violin at about mach
2. I just wish she wouldn't open her mouth and try to sing on her CD! If
anyone's ever heard it you'll know what I'm talking about. For the
morbidly courious, search out a cd called Beethoven on Speed by The Great
Kat. When she does plays Beethoven's 5th or Flight Of The Bumblbee at the
speed of light she's truly amazing! But when she starts screaming about
pissing on our graves and how cute she is, you kind of want to barf. I
should point out though that the album is probably done totally tounge in
cheek and she really does have a lot of musical talent. Check it out! I
think she's been in the Guiness book of records as the fastest player
before. If I remember right that's why I sought out the CD. I got it back
in like 89 or something so it's old. Good luck finding it!

Subject: Super Bowl Rush Sighting

     Anyone else catch Chris Berman's piece on the similarities between 
     Super Bowl III and Super Bowl XXXIII?  He rounded it off by quoting
     the french phrase from Circumstances.  I'd say it, but I'm sure I'd
     offend everyone who has ever spoken French in every way.
     
  [ Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.                   : rush-mgr ]

     Sure, the saying is old, and Rush took it from that source, but I 
     never would have understood Berman had it not been for Rush.  I need a 
     drink, it's got to be noon somewhere in the world.

Subject: A Common Inspiration

Hola Rush Fanatics,

This is just a simple post that highlights that even superstars share common
dreams:

I was attending the NAMM Music Industry Tradeshow (more info:
http://www.namm.com) this past week with the rest of our organization at
Indiana State University.   NAMM sponsors a multi-million dollar trade show
event that is unfortunately closed to the public.  Naturally with all the
big name brands and manufacturers comes all the professional musicians who
endorse their products.  So quite frequently will you run into players such
as Steve Smith, Chad Smith, "Smitty" Smith, and other various Smiths of the
biz.  I digress...

Mike Portnoy happened to be in attendance of the trade show at the Tama drum
booth.  So, he being one of my biggest influences, (Neil Peart being
another) I HAD to get his autograph.

The line was unbelievably short.  Thus in no time, I worked my way up front.
We shook hands, exchanged a bit a conversation, I soiled myself, and he
autographed a 4 x 8 promo picture to me.   I was ecstatic!  All I could
think was, "God, your gooooood.  I wanna play just like yooooou..."

And... this was the clincher.   Just before I left, I said to him, "Well...
All I need to do now is meet Neil Peart and I'll be set!"  and Mike said,
"Yeah, me too, man."

Cool,
B.J. Morgan

Subject: TNMS Sighting:  Tom Beaudoin

I was reading the Sunday paper (Portland's daily,
_The Oregonian_) yesterday and came across Our Own Tom
Beaudoin in a piece on the recent papal hysteria in
Missouri.  I was disappointed to see no hidden Rush
references though, but  then again Tom didn't write the
piece, but was merely a subject of the piece.  

At least, I *think* that was our Tom Beaudoin, Rush
Theologian.

Oh yes.  The Hot and Heavy Express.  Happy, happy days indeed.  Heard

Also had Xanadu played as a request, way back when.  Wasn'tt it more like four

Subject: 4 degrees of separation!

I called a local radio station on a call-in 
radio contest desperately trying  to win a DS tour pack. I got through
and answered a lame question. I had to guess the last item purchased
at this adult boutique. Was it batteries, clothing or lotion? I
guessed wrong. But they giggling over zealous teenage girl got it
right. Favoritism??  I phoned back and as a joke I asked the DJ to fax
me the receipts. He became irate and went nuts calling me a crack head
and swore at me, (was up and down me like I was a set of Markleys on a
cheap guitar). After he hung up on me I called their competitor. The
DJ there said people call him and complain all the time. That is the
short of it. I later told this story to my friend who is a buyer for a
major audio retailer. She in turn relayed my story to a rep for a
record company. He said he would see what he could do for me because I
was such a huge dedicate and long time rush fan. He later called her
to inform her that after 25 years at this company he was laid off, but
also said I hadn't forgotten about your friend (me). A few days passed
and she received a call from him saying he had spoken to rush's
manager (this is after he was laid off!)and had got for me a leather
wallet and CD case with the rush insignia on it and a DS CD. This rep
a real piece of work Eh....I am very grateful an it turned out that I
was able to do some graphics for my friend that was presented to him
at a farewell party they threw
for him.

Subject: Geddy Lee interview on cdnow.com (2-1-99) 

Hello my fellow Rush fans!
	I was cruising around the "Net and came across this Geddy Lee
interview that was on cdnow.com.  I saved it to disk and forwarded it to
this message.  I tried to get most of the crap out that you get when
trying to download stuff from the 'Net.  Anyways, fairly interesting
interview I think.  Some highlights:  He tells of the importance of his
family, and some surprising insights into the Chicago show that was used
for most of "DS".    There is also a comparison to the Grateful Dead?!?! 
And the answer to the last question....well, read on....maybe there is
hope  :-)  Here is the cdnow interview...as I read it on 2-1-1999.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  What do you do when you are an aging progressive rock
trio who has toured the planet umpteen times and sold millions of
records, yet continues to attract a worldwide audience? You could take it
easy, do a Napa Valley wine harvest, ride on a 400-mile bicycle tour,
check out some Ninjatune trip-hop, or simply play with your children. Or
you could release a live album of some of your greatest shows.
                   If you are vocalist-bassist Geddy Lee of seminal
prog-rockers Rush, you do all these things. 

Different Stages is a kind of favor to the band's many fans, a
three-CD set taken from recent performances at Chicago's World
Amphitheater, as well as from London's Hammersmith Odeon in 1978.
"Greatest Hits Live" might have been an alternate title for the set as
they are all here in full regalia: "Freewill," "Tom Sawyer," "The Spirit
of the Radio," "2112" and "Closer to the Heart." The Hammersmith gig
shows a youthful Rush, an aggressive, pummeling trio with the accent on
instrumental prowess and Lee's helium-curdling vocals. Nuggets such as 
"A Farewell to Kings" and "Xanadu" are full of rage and wrath, revealing
a surprisingly different band from the previous two CDs. 

While guitarist Alex Lifeson developed his fondness for industrial music
and drummer-lyricist Neil Peart attended to family concerns,
sunglass-wearing Geddy Lee sat down to speak with CDnow about age, youth,
babies, alienation, the Grateful Dead ...   
CDnow: What was so special about the Chicago World Amphitheater
performance
that you used it for the bulk of Different Stages?

The band, the sound of the room and the enthusiasm of the crowd all came
together that night. When we set out to do this album we recorded a lot
of shows in the hopes that we would capture a special performance.

We integrated our recording technique to be as discrete as possible so
that we could avoid what is traditionally a very nervous circumstance
with all the soundchecks and crews. That creates a lot of up-tightness,
and as a result, you are never sure if you've got your best performance;
you are hyper-aware of the recording process. So we integrated a system
of recording directly from our house sound into a separate track.

It was out there every night. We didn't think about it. Our hope was that
we would grab some comfortable performances that would show the band at
its best. It turned out to be one of the very last shows of the tour.

>Do you remember the show?
I do, and at the time it didn't seem that special. It was a good show, I
remember playing well, but I actually struggled with the sound of the
venue. To my memory, it wasn't a great performance, but the tapes tell me
a different story.
The 1978 Hammersmith performance was originally a bootleg?

That was a tape that I had in my basement for 20 years. I never listened
to it at all. On a few of the songs from that show I had a voice problem,
so we made a snap decision at the time not to use them. But 20 years
later you have the technology to remove those songs that didn't sound so
great. We still were left with about 60 minutes of interesting music from
that period. I was pleased to be able to utilize that.   
After listening to a 20-year-old tape of Rush, to your ears, how has the
band changed as a working entity?

There is a decisive power trio format about the Hammersmith material;
there is a simplicity to the architecture of the band. Bass, drums,
guitar, a little bit of synthesizer -- that was it. Now there is a much
more complex array of instrumentation.

The advantage of doing these two projects simultaneously is we realized
how much of the material was carried by bass, drums and guitar. And if we
applied that same attitude to the new material, mixing the bass, drums
and guitar up front first, in some way we kind of un-invented our sound
and returned to the core of what drives our band, which is that power
trio. Sometimes we don't show that side of the band enough.
"Life in the ‘90s is very different. But it shouldn't change
communication and the way people relate to each other; it should just
improve those means of communication.Has it ever struck you that Rush is
kind of like the Grateful Dead? You travel the world with a constantly
evolving and growing fan base.

Yeah. [Laughs] There are a lot of similarities. The Dead was the world’s
largest cult band. We're like one of those big cult bands as well. 

>Has the band's message or mission statement changed, as well as its
music, over the years?

I can't generalize, but the themes have changed. There are a lot of
themes running through our music: humans grappling with technology,
modern communication and interpersonal communication, which is different
from our early days where we dealt with more grand themes in operatic
style.   

Now we can listen to the world news on our computers and buy music over
the Internet. How does that change how you live and the way you think
about how you live?

A lot of subtle things about our lives change, and it brings us to think
differently. It's like the media explosion, how we perceive news now. How
something that happens somewhere in the world can be thrown at us in such
an intense way that we feel it more than we would have 10 years ago. When
something hits the media now, like the presidential scandal, there are
people consuming off it, one after the other, like a feeding chain. The
effects are enormous -- look at the financial markets.

Life in the ‘90s is very different. But it shouldn't change communication
and the way people relate to each other; it should just improve those
means of communication. I'm not anti-technology, but I think technology
should improve the quality of life, not just complicate the quality of
life.

As a musician, how do you keep playing "Spirit of the Radio" for 20
years? Do you feel like a cover band?

[Smiles] Sometimes. But some of the tunes we do change. It's hard to
change those signature tunes cause people want to hear them. Out of
respect for getting something right you do it as part of the job. Every
flurry has to be note-perfect, or I get pissed off. But for every tune
that you have to play, there are three or four tunes that you want to
play. 

What keeps you focused as a person, outside of Rush?

I am a real family man; my wife, son and baby daughter keeps me centered.

>Does your daughter recognize your voice on the radio?

I usually listen to talk radio or classical radio; they don't play us
much on those stations. [laughs]   

>What has kept Rush together for so long?

Glue. I dunno, it's funny. We have a profound respect for each other as
players, and we have a kind of brotherly relationship.

We have remarkably similar musical tastes that have never changed enough
to make it a problem when we get together to write. That is what destroys
most bands, when ego or whatever takes you into a whole new way of
thinking. But that has never occurred.

We have always been passionate about making music together. As long as
that remains, I don't see any reason to stop the process.

Now, being a genesis fan, and being a Rush fan, and having some MAJOR
appreciation for drummers (I'm a bassist) I really think that Phil and
Neil are both extremely good, but if you've ever heard Phil play on Firth
of Fifth, Supper's Ready, and Cinema Show (not to mention most of the
Lamb lies.. and Nursery Cryme albums as well) you'll realize that Phil
might
have ranked up with Bill Bruford during that time period, and although I
love Neil, he doesn't hold a Candle to Bruford or Palmer. YMMV
