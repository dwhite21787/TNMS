There's a new message board on the NMS home page. I have moved ALL of the
Rush Trader to this new board, so the messages will now be real time rather
than the days it took before. You can also now link IMAGES in of stuff you 
have for sale (please try to keep the images small).

I also started up a discussion about the NMS shirts there, I will still read
private email about it but with the new album coming in a few weeks I didn't
want to tie up the digest with shirt talk. So if you're interested in an NMS
shirt, check out the board! You do need to register on the board before you
can post (although anyone can read the posts), so if you want a particular
nickname get it now before someone else does!

If you like the message board please let me know, I'm running it kind of as
an experiment, and an alternative to both the NMS and a.m.r. If we don't get
a lot of general discussions, I'll just leave the trader & NMS specific
discussions up.

Subject: All Things New

     Here are some observations, questions & comments from a neutral 
     reporter. They all pertain, in some way to DS:
     
     1. Anyone in Mpls./SP area hear any new live Rush on 100.3 or 93.7? 
     They are the stations most likely to play Rush. 92.5 is a long, long 
     shot. 
     
     2. All this talk about the live SOR kicking ass has caused me to turn 
     on 93.7. It is morning. That means morning radio wackiness. Omigawd! 
     This sucks. I hope this pays off with a Rush play. Speaking of SOR, 
     the best live version I've heard is the one from the Grace Under 
     Pressure video. I bought an audio "bootleg" of a Pittsburgh Rush 
     concert years ago & heard this ripping version of SOR. I thought I 
     struck paydirt. Then I rented Grace Under Pressure video & discovered 
     that my "bootleg" is simply an audio recording of the video. Oh well, 
     SOR just rips on it anyway.
     
     3. I second the thought posed by a fellow NMSer on the need for a Hugh 
     Syme book of Rush art. I've always found the album covers interesting. 
     Hugh, I'LL buy the book. WE'LL ALL buy the book.
     
     4. I'm not saying that we ought to disregard the Rush Mgr's wishes & 
     discuss at excruciating length the possible symbolism of the tinker 
     toy DS cover. However, some of us have been trained to look for 
     symbolism in everything. English majors, for example, are this way. I 
     ought to know. I was one in college, and now I am always looking for 
     symbolism in art. There's nothing wrong with people that think this 
     way. There is no reason to immediately bristle at the mention of words 
     like "motif" & "symbol". There is a fine line that must be minded, 
     though. When people drill their thoughts into others & take a 
     high-minded approach & OVERanalyze (just to show how smart they are?), 
     it alienates the others who have other interests & fortes; those who 
     just want to enjoy the art. I feel, though, that if no one cares 
     enough about art to discuss it, we run the risk of art going away. 
     Let's be careful & not turn our artistic discussions into crusades, 
     though. That said, I found the comments about the spacing of the 
     tinker discs on DS to be pretty astute & interesting. That's all I 
     really wanted to say on the subject, but I took a whole paragraph of 
     cloying drivel to get to this point. Sorry.
     
     Hmmm, I hope this isn't too long [ed - it is]. I hope no one takes 
     offense at point 4. None was intended. Let's be careful out there 
     people!

Subject: Heard Live SoR in Florida

Hi all,

I was in Florida this past weekend (for the Pepsi 400) and caught the Spirit
of Radio cut from the live album. It starts a little strange, since the
actual guitar lick seems out of sync with the beat. When I heard it, I
thought that it must be something new that they were doing on the song,
since that is the way that I remember it being played at the last show I
went to in Chicago.

Of course it all made sense, when Geddy cries out "let's hear it Chicago"
(or something to that effect) during the song. So that cut is definitely
from the first Chicago show on the Test for Echo tour, October 28th 1996 I
believe.

files including a rarity from 1974 that I had never heard before called "You
Can't Fight It". It's at.... http://members.tripod.com/~bushmills/  This is
a really nice looking page with EXCELLENT content. ....a MUST see in my

Subject: Wait for the Album, Please.

What is all this garbage about sampling pre-releases of Different Stages
(or any other album, for that matter) and putting it on the Internet? 
This is stupidity to me.  It cheapens the whole thing.  Are you really
going to enjoy some snippet of an album on the internet,  when RUSH spent
hundreds of hours putting it together for CD?  

   [ Yes.                                                         : rush-mgr ]

I have a suggestion.  Wait for the album to be released.  When you get
it, if you can contain your excitement, pleasure yourself by tearing off
the shrink wrap, and look at the literature inside.  Put that beautiful
disc in your player and take a few uninterrupted hours to hear what these
men wish to present to you.  

When I was growing up, I remember getting HEMISPHERES for Christmas.  I
was so excited.  My other gifts paled in comparison.  I took the vinyl
(ha, ha) to my room and listened for hours.  Soon, I had the bass parts
down.  It really was an experience to treasure.  I'd like to commemorate
the 20th year anniversary of the release of HEMISPHERES. Two decades ago,
the album went from the studio to me.  There was no radio premier or
computer sample to contaminate and commercialize that experience.

Kids, don't open your gift before it is time.  I know the radio premier
will be useful, but only because RUSH will be interviewed at that time. 
It's too bad so many people will first hear the album on the radio.  I
choose not to.  I want that awesome cut to enter my ears from the
pureness of CD.

Subject: Radio Fun for All in Mpls/SP!

     I have tried requesting the DS live tracks with 93.7 & 100.3 here in 
     the Twin Cities. Both said they weren't sure if they had any singles 
     or early tracks yet, but would "look into it". Both stations played 
     the MP version of TS instead. I guess I'm not surprised. However, one 
     guy at 100.3 did tell me that they would be airing the radio premier 
     of DS on Nov. 4 at "around 9PM". He said that they would be talking 
     more about it on the air in the weeks to come. So, that's something, 
     huh? I wouldn't go so far as to say that is the definitive word on the 
     subject, but it's a good bet anyway. Maybe I'll try 92.5 KQRS now.... 
     Damn. It's busy.

I totally agree.  When I heard the song on the radio, I tuned in just in
time for the solo.  It had some irregularities in it, which I loved, because
as a guitarist, it makes me feel a little better.  Heh.  But I also noticed
that it had a raw energy and robust sound quality that really appealed to
me.  I only heard half the song, but I'm stoked!  It's turned my ho-hum
attitude toward the live album into one of eager anticipation.

Take care,
Chris

For those of you close to St. Louis check out 97.1 the Rock. A friend
just told me about it so I turned it on and I heard 3 Rush songs
yesterday. They are new and have no commercials and no DJs yet. They
have an announcer in between songs who keeps saying "7000 songs in a
row" Too bad they will eventually have DJs and commercials. I just hope
they keep up the Rush!

It's a secret message in which they pledge their undying allegiance to
SATAN!!!!!!!!!!
Just kidding.

It's actually a secret code explaining how many times Alex got drunk
during the recording of the album. If they say the whole word, he got
plastered more than 5 times. If they use the symbol, then he hasn't
been hittin' the bottle much lately.

Or not...

rush manager) that KLOS plans to play the CD on November 8th. That is 
cool.

See ya!

Subject: Rush at the World Series

Hi fellow Rushians,
	The time is 8:03 p.m., 10/21/98, game 4 of the world series. I am
typing this right after I heard it. Pregame of game 4 has just started.
As it began I heard a familiar tune. It was La Villa Strangiato. My dad
and I are freaking out. Rush at the World Series. I hope the Yankees
win.

   Hello, this is my first post, and I haven't checked my last couple 
issues, so if this has already been mentioned, sorry.  I was watching 
the World Series Game 4? (I haven't been following it too 
closely)tonight (the 21st) on Fox, and during the pre-game, when they 
introduce the teams, and give a quick re-cap, they used La Villa 
Strangiiato as the song.  They played it from where it sounds like a 
swing drum solo, to just before Geddy sings the only lyrics in the song.  
I thought it was interesting, and thought someone might like to know. ;)

Subject: $16.49 DS!!!  Found a special with one day left!

Hey, I just stumbled into a really cheap deal on Different Stages... If
you access cdnow.com *through webcrawler.com* (no, I don't work for
either of them), you get an automatic $10 off on an order.  That brings
the *shipped* pre-release price on the DS CD to $16.49.  I don't think
anybody's going to beat that one (I got my order in tonight).

The $10 off link is on the main Webcrawler page, on the right side,
under "A Word From Our Sponsors".  I don't think you can get this deal
by going directly to cdnow.com; it's a promotion through Webcrawler.  

The bad news is--the deal is only good through October 22, which is
tomorrow (Thursday) as I write this... rush-mgr, not to impose on your
duties or anything, but this just might be worth a quick TNMS special
edition... 

Good luck,

Bear with me, this could get confusing. 

While everyone's talking about what the new cover could stand for, I
figured I'd throw in an idea. Seeing that they're going back to their
rougher, edgier sound of years past, onecould speculate that the tinker
toys represent their youthfulness in taking their music back to that
edgier yet more modern sound.

On another note, I usually have no problem getting my Rush WorkForce
Blocks played on 102.7 WNEW (NY area, Brian at Blue Ribbon Awards),
though I still haven't heard any DS, yet. Visit their website at :
www.wnew.com and request DS!!! I'm going there now.

Subject: 2112/TFE and DS

Hi all,

Two things:

1)  I am a comparatively recent Rush fan, and I have never seen them live (I
live in the UK).  I just picked a bootleg TFE video from the first show of
the tour.  It is not fantastic, but gets me by. :-(
What really struck me was the downtuned 2112.  What a great way to breathe
new life into the old classic.  It was so majestic and (dare I say it)
heavy!

2) So bring on DS.  When I asked in Our Price today about DS, they told me
it would be around £45 for the 3-cd "box set".  Hopefully this is just a
mistake (by the worst record chain I know)!  Can anyone in the UK confirm
whether it is a "box set" and whether it will be £45?  Seems extortionate to
me.

Just visited the "Canadian Web Site of Universal Music" at 
http://www.universalcanada.com/ and found Rush and Victor listed 
therein.  The Rush section had Neil's T4E tourbook write-up along with 
an update on DS.  The Victor page had an interview with Lerxst I hadn't 
noticed before.  There are a few pictures as well video and sound 
samples too.  It was refreshing to see Rush recognized alongside their 
younger musical counterparts like The Hip, Super Friendz, Raggadeath, 
Headstones, Gandharvas, Age of Electric, etc.  Cool site anyway, check 
it out.

that's TWO questions, totally unrelated to the other.  Mathematically,
the answer to both is a big fat NO, but an unproveable one.

>Isn't it highly likely that we (TNMS'ers) happen to live in a time when

never doubted it for a second; it's axiomatic.

ah!  but it' so much fun to read things into them.  look how many people

This article is from the Tornto Sun, and can be found at www.canoe.ca in
the "Showbiz" section. Just do a search on Rush if you can't fin it.
As it say's, Rush mgmt CONFIRMS Rush has not broken up, but there are no
"frim" plans for a new studio album or tour, YET! My guess though, is
that these things have been discussed by the band. My bet is on a year
2000 release, but not Jan.1! Anyways...enjoy:-), 'cause here it is:

Rush: No 'break-up' planned

                         By JANE STEVENSON
                              Toronto Sun

                 There's finally news from the Rush front as the
               Toronto power trio releases a new live double album,
               Different Stages, on Nov. 10. 
                
                The material on the two CDs was recorded during
               Rush's 1997 tour of North America, with emphasis
               on material from their albums Roll The Bones
               (1991), Counterparts (1993) and Test For Echo
               (1996), plus older favourites including Closer To The
               Heart, Tom Sawyer and The Spirit Of Radio. 
                
                A special limited edition of Different Stages will
               feature a third disc of Rush's long-lost performances
               recorded at London's Hammersmith Odeon during
               their A Farewell To Kings tour in 1978. 
                
                Meanwhile, Rush continues to give drummer Neil
               Peart the time he needs to grieve the loss of his wife
               to cancer this year following the death of their
               daughter in a car accident in 1997. 
                
                "There is no intention for the band to break up, but
               there are no firm plans for the next studio record or
               tour at this point," a spokesman for Rush's label said
               yesterday.

Hi Everyone,
   I talked with a guy from WEA (Warner bros) and DS will not be available on
cass.
Oh well, I think it is time for everyone to move into the Cd era. For one
reason, it is the best investment, I bought my first Cd (Power Windows) in
Jan.  1986 and it sounds perfect today. If that was a cassette, it would have
gone to the great tape shredder in the sky long ago. Also, I can get the
Japanese verson for anyone who is interested. I can get the domestic verson
shipped  it to arrive Tuesday, Nov 10th. if anyone will have trouble getting
it on street date. Feel free to contact me at:

8. Genesis - Phil can sing AND play drums... that's amazing in itself.
7. Nine Inch Nails - A one man industrial band. 
6. Primus - Rockabilly ain't bad.  At least they're inspired by "the boyz" 
5. Van Halen - Eddie's virtuosity amazes me.  Such musicality.
4. Dave Matthew's Band - Carter Beuford = funky mutha drummer
3. Dream Theatre - Mike Portnoy.  Wow.
2. Tool - Dark & somber.  Just the way I like it.
1. Rush: Rich and inspiring.  The other half of the spectrum.
