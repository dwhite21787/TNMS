Well, I'll admit in my brief haste I let a flame through, and now in
this issue a response flame back.   Matt (and Dan), please take battle
to email.  I'm sorry I let the first one through  and in all fairness
Dan your post is last in this issue.  In the future, I'll be killing off
both of your flames to one another.  Comments and such are ok, I just
think you two are getting too personal for this forum, so if such a
message comes up again, don't be surprise if it's not sent out.  Don't
say I didn't warn you.  For other readers, my apologies for this drivel.

Now, for sanity's sake how about dropping the age-old arguments?  Is
anyone else besides Geddy rooting for the Blue Jays? :-)  I bet he was
sweating it out during the last couple games of the season.

There's also a short interview that will be coming out as a special
issue today.  This from a Kerrang magazine meeting with Alex.

Hello all,

I addressed this question on alt.music.rush not that long ago, so I'll
do it again here.

In TNMS #529, Ralph.Torres@Corp.Sun.COM (Ralph Torres) writes:

&gt;I have read and heard Neil's statement that he "discovered" Rand's
&gt;Anthem as they finished 2112. Not that I'm a better authority then he,
&gt;however, I find it strange that for someone who "just noticed the
&gt;coincidental similarities" would dedicate the album to the "genius"
&gt;of Rand.

The way I understand it was that Neil had read _Anthem_ prior to the
writing of "2112".  After completing "2112", he noticed the similarity
between it and _Anthem_.  Therefore, he decided to give credit to Rand
so he wouldn't be called a plagiarist.  (Source -- Neil's December '91
Rockline interview.)

Since I don't have the tape with me, this is from memory.  Anyone out
there should feel free to correct me if I am wrong...

So am I really the only one out here who thinks that Neil's playing on
RTB is his best since Signals?  :-)

Subject: A Rarities Tape / Stupid Debates

Hi kids.  On the Yes mailing list right now, someone is making a collection of
concert recordings and rare singles, b-sides, etc. of Yes and distributing it
to all the members of the list who want it for the cost of the tape.  I know
not everyone agrees with the concept of bootlegging, and that we did have a
"box set" poll a few months back, but I think it would be great to have the
members of this list put together a great collection of unreleased Rush and
the rare stuff like "Take Off" and "Battlescars" so that everyone on the list
who wants it can have an inexpensive and comprehensive set of unreleased Rush.

Also, this senseless debating needs to stop.  Wouldn't it be great if the word
"sucks" never appeared in the NMS again?

John Miller asked about click tracks in TNMS #529.  I don't know to which
song you're referring in ASoH, but I had a brief comment about click tracks.
In an interview (in MD?) a couple of years ago, Neil mentioned that he was
using a sort of piped-in metronome, but it wasn't a click.  He used a bass
drum sound instead, so if he was right with the tempo, he wouldn't hear
anything.  Sorry I can't be more specific on time and location of interview.

Just curious... at the part of the rap where he says 'random interaction'. 
Right after that, there is a sound that is similar to a system beep that 
can be used for a Mac.. Maybe they heard that sound too much when making 
mistakes in writing and thought it funny to insert it. I thought so,

Also, Neil with Lukemia??  Bummer if true

Rush Fans -

I guess I should post this here too since Dream Theater seems to be
talked about a lot and people seem interested in tour dates.

Date	Day		City					Venue
10-6	TUE		Washington, DC			The Bayou
10-7	WED		Boston, MA				The Axis
10-8	THU		Montreal, Canada		t.b.a.
10-9	FRI		Toronto, Canada			The Spectrum
10-10	SAT		ROCHESTER, NY			3-D's
10-15	THU		Detroit, MI				Harpo's
10-16	FRI		Columbus, OH			Al Rosa Villa
10-17	SAT		Cleveland, OH			Flashes
10-18	SUN		Grand Rapids, MI		Club Eastbrook
10-20	TUE		Dayton, OH				t.b.a.
10-21	WED		Chicago, IL				Avalon
10-22	THU		Greenfield, WI			t.b.a.

These are the only dates I currently know of.  I will post future dates
when I find out.

BTW, if you want to join the fan club and get all kinds of free stuff,
send $20 (+ $3.50 US, $5 Canada) to The Dream Team, P.O. Box 230156,
Hartford, CT 06123-0156.  Send your name, address and shirt size.

And, IMO, Dream Theater does not sound like Queensryche, Rush or Yes.  They
seem to have a lot of influences from lots and lots of progressive type
bands, though.  I think they are very, very original.

Dream On!

Mike

Rushppl --

First of all... sorry about putting up that FAQ about 2112 & Ayn Rand a couple
of posts ago... no one but me seemed to notice that it was a FAQ tho, and it
brought up an interesting point....  Does the narrator commit suicide at the
end?.. I had never thought so, but it really is a good interpretation of the
"My life blood/Spills over" line.  Also -- what makes anyone assume that it's
the Elder Race that has "assumed control" at the end... I always used to think
that it was the Priests notifying their planets that they had defeated the
Elder race and were again "assuming control."   Just MHO...

Also.. someone  mentioned a Rush channel on irc and the mgr was kind enough to
point out #p/g!.. for you Rush-irc'ers who may find that channel frequently
invite only and impossible to send msgs to it, let me know.. I created RushServ
to kind of watch over that channel, so it's often left locked (but I'll happily
give access to it for someone if they care to email me or whatever...)

&gt;I didn't think that the hero in 2112 committed suicide.  Do any of the
&gt;band members actually say that?  The line "my life's blood/Spills over" &gt;might
&gt;just refer to his emotional turmoil, and intense desire to change his world.

I thiought it was pretty clear that he was committing suicide. Esp. when
I read the quotes going along with the song in the Album.

	This durn old/new argument has gotten a wee bit out o' hand.  So have
the googalplex of posts stating "This durn old/new argument has gotten a wee
bit out o' hand".  What began as:

	"I like old Rush better 'cause it makes me feel all tingly inside"
	"I like new Rush better 'cause it raises goose bumps on my thighs"

has become

	"You suck, you new Rush fiend!!!"
	"You suck, you stupid old Rush Hippie!!!"

Come now, children!  Let's play nice!  This topic could still be a reasonable
discussion(no, really!), if we try to keep it a little interesting.  This is
what the NMS is for, gosh dang it.  Nice, friendly discussions about who really
sucks without bluntly stating it.  We all *LOVE* to hear each other's opinions
(except when they REALLY SUCK) about Rush, that's why we read this compu-rag.
(Mr. Mgr-God, Sir, I mean that with the UTMOST respect!)
	The moral of the story:  Accen-tu-ate the positive,
				 Elim-in-ate the negative,
				 Be nice, even if someone says something
				 TRULY INANE
				 Also, try to keep the TRULY INANE stuff to

By the way:  I am an experienced multi-instrumentalist, I like old Rush better
than new Rush, I like New Rush better than most other stuff. . .

Subject: Click Tracks

In response to the question about Neil Peart wearing headphones during Red
Sector A, I will confirm that he is listening to a click track.  The reason
for this is that during Red Sector A and other songs, visuals such as video
clips and laser lights are sequenced and require the band to be in perfect
time.  In other words, Mr. Peart's playing must be in time with the
sequence of the video, etc.  I believe I once read or heard about Mr. Peart
using the headphones during Red Sector A because he needed to hear the
underlying keyboard sequence.

I have heard from a very reliable source that the timetable for work on
the next Rush album has unfortunately been pushed back.  As it stands
now the boyz will not start working on a new record until after the
New Year.  Basically I was told that the band has no motivation to start
at this point.  Oh well, so much for a summer tour in 1993, let's hope for
the Fall!!!

I also must say that all this talk about "old and new" Rush is making me
sick to my stomach.  Enough already, start a new thread...

Neil uses the headphones you often see him wearing in concert for a click
track. This is neccesary to keep time in songs that uses sequences that
are punched in and out at random times. This is in response to someones

Subject: Re: Melody Intro..Who Does It?

&gt;&gt; tvos@ais.org asks:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Question, who actually does the melody intro for the three blind mice?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As I recall from the concert, it appeared to be taped.  They played it
&gt;&gt; as soon as the lights went out, while everyone got into place.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My guess was it was taken directly from "The Three Stooges" series--
&gt;&gt; that's what it sounded like.

I recall reading/hearing (either by interview or from Modern Drummer)
that Neil said that he does not want to take something that exists and
just tape it.  He uses his electronic equipment (MIDI?) to recreate
something that he likes.  As I recall, the 3 Stooges intro was his own
recreation of the theme.  This seemed most evident the last time that
I heard them do it.  However, it does seem like the very first time I
heard them do it, it was the actually 3 Stooges intro -- with the Hello,
Hello, Hello stuff and everything.

If I can locate the source, I'll post it later.

Subject: My RUSH intro

Hi to all fellow RUSH fans;

The first time I heard RUSH was in 1976, when a friend in the Air Force
dorm I was in played 2112 at maximum volume.  The whole block could hear
it and I was hooked right away.  I started buying all their lp's as soon
as they were out.

After I got out of the service, I got the chance to see RUSH in concert
at the State theatre in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  What a treat!  Max Webster
opened for them and were pretty good ( I bought all their lp's ).  I
could hardly wait for the real show to start.  From reviewing the tour
dates file, this must have been one of the shows in late January, 1978.
I was sitting in the balcony of the tiny theatre and had a center stage
view.  The speakers were from stage floor to the roof of the theatre and
about 15 feet wide, on each side of the stage.  I love LOUD music and do
think you can hear so much more nuances when the volume is turned up, and
this show blew me away!  When I came out I could still here the music and
feel the vibrations.  I was floating on cloud nine.

I have slowed down since then due to personnal economic conditions, but am
still a devoted fan.  Reading the NMS has really got me excited again and I
hope it is not to long before they tour in this area.

I have rarely heard any RUSH on the radio until about a year ago when a new
radio station in Eau Claire started playing a really good mix of oldies and
newer songs.  Now at least once a week I hear a RUSH song on WISM, 98.1 FM.
Do not despair though, while at work I have my trusty Walkman and a good
supply of RUSH tapes to help me get through the day.

Thanks for listening.

Tom T.

Hello, HEllo, Hello:

If I might be so bold as to express my opinion, Ha!  I like ALL Rush -
Old and New.  That's what makes them a fun band; I can pick and
choose according to my mood.  Plus it's fun to compare and contrast
styles and devewlopment.  AND, chnage is good - I could'nt handle
eighteen years of Rivendale!  Got some cool boots (video) of the
third leg.  So, like always, if you're interested, e-mail me and I'll
just see what I can do.  AND, as if you're interested, if it wasn't
for NEW songs like Turn The Page, The Pass, Where's My Thing etc., I
would have never learned to play chordal stuff on my bass.  So there!
And what else today?  Nothing, you're all exscused!

&gt; Tim Hall writes....
&gt;
&gt;On Twilight Zone on the 2112 album, there's a place in the middle of the
&gt;song where there's a strange out-of-place guitar "noise".  I don't have the
&gt;CD with me now so I can't tell you the exact time it occurs.  I always
&gt;thought it was Alex starting to come in too early for his guitar solo,
&gt;because it's at about the right place for that, only one verse too soon.

I noticed this also, but I think it is intentional.  At that time, Rush did
not have to worry as much about studio time and getting the album out in a
given number of days.  If it was a mistake, they would have fixed it.  I
think it adds to the feeling of being in.... "The Twilight Zone". :)

Also, Frank writes ...
	&gt;Now in Anthem is Neil saying "have tunnel vision and concentrate on
&gt;what you're doing and ignore everything else lest you will fail" or is he
&gt;saying "when you are surrounded by detractors, ignore them and take pride in
&gt;who and what you are"?  But TSS seems to clearly say "I want to know what's
&gt;going on around me before I continue my life's journey to somewhere else".
&gt;
	&gt;The question would be "Are the two songs connected?", and that would
&gt;depend on the individual opinion of the listener.  Could TSS be a retraction or
&gt;addendum to Anthem, I don't know.  But the manner of the lyrics is different.
&gt;Anthem seems making a statement, while Time Stand Still seems to be explaining
&gt;a situation.

In Anthem, I think he is saying don't stop trying until you get to where you
want to be, regardless of what others say.  In TSS, it seems he has reached
the place he wants to be, and wants to remember it.

&gt;vacations and are going to their retreat in the woods to start writing their
&gt;new album.  Are these rumors true or are they just a bunch of broccoli?

If they are ready to start a new album, Alex and Neil are going to have a
tough time getting Geddy out of the ballpark with the Blue Jays in the
playoffs! :)

Subject: ASOH Video question

Hello all you Rush fans (new and old):)
I have a trivial question for anyone out there.  I have the ASOH video,
and in the final song, a medley of 2112/in the mood/Villa Strangatio I
believe, there is a part where Alex takes the mike.  The vocal portion is
edited out of this particulat segment.  Someone out there must know what
is said.  While I'm here...

There always seems to be lots of requests for the address to order the
Peart poster.  Is the address in the FAQL?  If not, maybe it should be.
I really cant remember, as I haven't seen the FAQL in some time.

New/Old debate:  Give it up!  Too many people think their opinions are law.
I like both, but for different reasons.  The issue is dead.  As a matter of
fact, I feel guilty even bringing it up.
My friend wants me to say:"Subdivisions appear on Signals not in Rush material
in general."  --Will

I hate to ask, but could the person requesting the postcards regarding the
convention, please repost your address, or E-mail me direct?  BTW I agree,
it's easier to E-mail, but anyone not committed enough to send one itsy bitsy
postcard should forget all about the convention.  $.50 is such a small price
to pay.

'Nuff said?

Subject: Rush Convention (Send me e-mail!)

   For anyone that is interested in the convention idea:

Send me your name and e-mail address (thru e-mail of course) so we can get an
idea on how many people are in favor of attending a convention. Once we get a
list compiled, we'll start planning out an agena (if there's enough interest).
If you've already sent a postcard to John Santore then you don't need to mail
me anything, but if not mail in your name!

Subject: "prepared"

Matthew Joseph Desantis (in the future, take personal shit via email, thnx.
I will respond in kind; whether you take it public or private):

&gt;An issue or two ago, a felloe named Dan wrote that he was "prepared" to speak
&gt;about rush because he took piano for 15 years, and wrote an etude... The
&gt;statement he made was like (..ask any musician and they will tell you that new
&gt;rush is not as good as old rush...) or in a different form of words...

If you'd read the previous post carefully, instead of twisting it to serve your
characterization of me as a snob, you would have seen that I detailed my
involvement in music ONLY WHEN IT WAS RHETORICALLY IMPLIED THAT I WAS
UNPREPARED TO DISCUSS MUSIC! I quote the post:

]&gt;don't discuss music from the 18th and 19th century unless you are prepared
]I am prepared with 15 years of classical training (piano) and several thousand
]hours of listening to this music.  The classical and early romantic eras are
]my foremost musical passion.  I've also written a few etudes.

I LIKE IT when people come on and say "I play drums and I like the
&lt;whatever&gt; in Bravado ...etc."  This is very educational to me, because I will
then take a different contextual listen to songs I didn't like before!  One
really shouldn't feel threatened or put off by this.

In response to those who dislike the New vs Old thread....
I understand that music is a very personal thing, and the notion that the music
one has been listening to and loving is 'unworthy' - or that the music one has
dismissed has a value you have missed - can be very FLAMMABLE.  But if you keep
the anger out of it, I think discussions about the artistic value of various
pieces of music can be very stimulating.  If you think such discussions won't
end up proving one thing or another, so what?  That doesn't give such
discussions any less value...  probably more, in fact.  Perhaps even more than
discussions about the mohawk on N. Peart's dingleberries.

I don't think we should necessarily stop NvsO, just FLAMES (esp. against poor
little me!)

What do you think?
