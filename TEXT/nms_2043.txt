Nope.  I've made a few booboos lately, but I stand by this one:  THAT IS
MASSIVE DISTORTION ON A GUITAR OVERDUB,  To do that on a Digitech
anything, max out your distortion balls and level, even it out with the
mixer, and possibly split your left channel, running one track through
another disto unit and mix it back in again.  Or use an effects loop. 
If you have multiple racks, use maximum gain on each stage before that,
and active pickups or DiMarzio Supradistortions.  I can get that sound
running EMG's into the GSP-7, through max gain on my other racks, and
into the amp, with disto cranked.  OR through my Mutron.  But it's not
easy without duplicate racks and a mixer.

Well, spoke to Mark Racop at Magichouse Productions, and he says that
he'd have a crack at a Rush Movie for $250,000 to $500,000.  So if
convince a distributor that they can sell 50,000 copies of such a movie
on video, or that it will last two weeks in national release, we can get
him the funding necessary.  Or, If 1000 NMS subscribers each chip in
with $250, on the understanding that it is a risky venture, we can do it
freelance.  He might get bank financing on 20% of that up front.  Any
bank managers on the list willing to front a loan to a small production
company with a short but reliable track record?

Met another NMS subscriber at a SF convention this weekend.  There's
gotta be more of us out there!!!

Was a Steinberger used to record New World Man?

hey, Rush-MGR, we can do one sided T-shirts at a VERY reasonable price,

I hate to pick on you again, but if you think you can hear a bass run
through "a kitchen sink" of effects and controlled by a volume pedal say
"Prince By-Tor"... either it's very expensive or not very good for you
or both. But let us have some anyway. <g>

well, it sounds a bit like a talk box effect.  If Ged says it's not, I
believe him.  But listen to that part again, and tell me it doesn't
sound a bit like that?

So Canadians have bigger balls than Americans?  Hell, we KNEW that!

map)  you'll note that Canada is bigger and on top of the US.  So in

Freedom of speech?  The fact that I paid money to attend the 
concerts to which I referred?

It's only right that any artist should be the subject of sincere
criticism now and then, especially by their paying audience.  Your

	Not to rub anybody the wrong

was saying something, too.  This was drug-

that it's a talk-box run through a synth or

Ok..
This is my first post. What should I say..?
Ok.
I know.
Do you know where I live? In Finland.
Do you know how many times I have seen Rush live? Zero times.
And the propability to see Rush live is about... zero, unless they do a 
world tour. And even then, they wouldn't come to Finland.
This is so depressing.
Rush is never played on radio here, and I have seen only one of their 
videos on TV.
But that doesn't matter, actually. I have all of their records, and I 
can buy tour videos (like ASOH and ESL, which I have)

But it would be quite nice to see the guys live...
sigh.

(btw: the guitar riff from 'the spirit of radio' was in the theme of one 
of our local radio. )

In Seattle 99.9 plays, I would honestly say, about one Rush song 
an hour!  It rocks.  I have heard: (in chronological order)

Working Man, Fly by Night, 2112 (Overture, Temples), Passage to 
Bangkok, Circumstances, The Trees, TSOR, Freewill, Entre Nous, Tom 
Sawyer, YYZ, Limelight, Subdivisons, New World Man, Roll the Bones, 
Test For Echo, Driven, Half the World.

Those are the songs I have heard them play, and have heard them 
numerous times.  Sometimes they play  an ad where the go "So-and so 
Rocks!" and then they play little sound bits of various songs by 
that band  and then play a couple of that bands songs.  Once in a 
while I hear "Rush ROCKS!" and hear parts of Distant Early Warning , 
Big Money, and a couple other songs but then the bust out into Tom 
Sawyer or something along those lines.  Sometimes 99.9 has "The 
Ultimate CD Side" where they pretty much play the greatest hits of a 
band and now and then they feature Rush.

Sorry, havn't had chance to look at the digest for a while, therefore if I
am repeating anything previously said, apologies in advance.

1. Female singers for Rush. Is this a serious theme? If so I would love to
hear them do something with Tracey Thorn (EBTG) Something Bravado or The
Pass pace would really suit her haunting voice- check out the stuff she
guested on with Massive Attack.

2. "Morning Guv" from The Camera Eye. I used to have a sneeky suspicion
that this might, just might, have possibly been  a sample of Dennis
Waterman from the '80s TV series Minder, but as no one else have ever
suggested this, I gave up on the idea.

I did have a friend who spent years intrigued by the line about "the
boldest sex shop in the city"

Dear All,

Kudos to everybody who posted on my 'guest vocalist' 
thread, but extra specials go to everybody who voted for 
Shirley Manson, since I think she's just about as good as 
it gets on the rock female vocalist front right now.  
Anyone who hasn't bought Garbage's new album Version 2.0 
should hasten to a nearby purveyor of compact discs and 
pick it up, as it is simply breathtaking.  

Lucas Harris posted this recently:

>>any Metallica fans out there? I think I like them. I'm really loving 
>>that "fuel" song that's on the radio now. What's a good 'starter' >>album? 
>>Load? (heh heh heh she said load)

>>>Load? Yeah, right. Maybe the first seven songs but not 
>>>crap like "Mama Said".
>>>The Black Album would be better.

I have to disagree.  Personally, I think Mama Said is an 
exceptional song for Metallica, demonstrating a new level 
of depth and emotional resonance for them, which is carried 
through to the new album.  I'd personally recommend Load or 
Re-load anytime over the immature, pretentious 
thrash-metal-lyrical-nonsense of The God That Failed or Of 
Wolf and Man off of the black album, *especially* if it's a 
starter album you're looking for.

And to bump up the Rush content in this post so's I don't 
get panel-beat for trying to turn the NMS into a 
Metallica-forum, somebody recently posted saying they'd 
love to do a post-Visions book on Rush.  My question is, 
isn't it about time Bill Banciewicz (probably spelt wrong) 
did an updated version?  That would be the best...

  In NMS issue #2040 Chris Herrage wrote "When I first heard this song, I 
felt that it was the best song for making you feel like you were 
experiencing everything that Neil was !"

  I totally agree with Chris on the mastery of the lyrics serving the music 
and vice versa. The best way to appreciate all the song has to offer is to 
close your eyes and block out everything else except the song and visualize 
what the words are saying and let the music set the mood. When I do this I 
definitely feel like I'm climbing all those stairs just to see that 
fantastic view ! I strongly recommend to all those skeptics of Tai Shan to 
try this method and see for yourselves the mastery of the lyrics and music 
serving each other so well.

Hello Fellow Rush Freaks...

I think this "kid thread" is pretty cool, so I must respond.  A couple 
of Xmas' ago, Santa brought my (then) 6 year old son Chris a Fender 
Strat Pack, and me a Fender P-bass package.  With the help of his 
Uncle(Hi Justin!), he and I have been learning how to play.  He has 
taken quite a liking to Rush, Black Sabbath, and Ozzy---especially Rush!  
Let me tell ya, it's been a lot harder for me to learn Ged's bass lines 
than it has for him to pick up on Alex's work(except for the leads, of 
course).  We like to jam to 2112's Overture and Temples, Fly By Night, 
Working Man, Bastille Day, The Necromancer, and a few others.  He seems 
to love old Rush and new Rush, but doesn't listen to a lot of the stuff 
in the middle.  He is totally into T4E.  His other favorite CD's:  Rush, 
FBN, CoS, 2112, AFtK, and PeW.  I've been trying to turn everyone into 
"Rushians" my whole life, and now I don't even have to try with my son.  
Life is grand sometimes! :)
Take care Rush Freaks...

What did you "straighten out"?  It had nothing to do with the band's 
attitude toward Rush L.  But that his programmer/producer or 
whoever, played some of Rush's music as bumper to his show.  I 
don't believe they need the Band's permission.

Subject: Rush 8-tracks, anyone?

I know it sounds weird, but I got a couple of Rush 8-tracks from my brother
as a gag gift, and I thought there could be someone out there in NMS-land
who might actually want these.  They are: "All the World's a Stage" and "A
Farewell to Kings"

They're really beat up, and I have no idea if they play (I haven't seen an
8-track player in close to 20 years)... but if there are any collectors out
there who've got to have it all, I will gladly send them to you if you send
me enough stamps for them.  Please e-mail me privately, in case there's
more than one of you interested...

Cheers,

sorry.  first studio use of flanger was "Barracuda" by Heart.  If there
was flanging on the first album, it was tape flanging--a tricky effect,
but well within Broon's capability.

All these solid-state effects are very new. (mid to late 70's) The
phaser Alex used sounds a bit flange-like, which is why it was
invented--to simulate tape-flanging.  You might be hearing a phaser, as
he did have one.

It's sad to hear about everyone fighting to hear Rush on the radio.  I
live in Rockville, MD and I can tell you that 98Rock out of Baltimore
plays A LOT of Rush, during the day and in the morning mostly.  the also
use musical "snippets" from 2112 and La Villa during their station
identifications.  The actually have cool DJs too.  I just came from
Richmond VA where radio is awful!  XL102 (Richmond classic rock station)
plays Rush maybe once every 2 months, but will play the Stones and
Aerosmith 157 times a day.....No lie, I once heard 3 Stones tunes during
a three hour morning show, which is mostly talk and jokes!  That station
is really pitiful.  I feel for rockers in Richmond.  But now I'm lucky
enough to live near a station on which I have heard the following:
All of Moving Pictures (sans The Camera Eye)
Something For Nothing
Working Man (once a week)
Fly by Night
Anthem
Bastille Day
Closer to the Heart
The Trees (once a week)
La Villa Strangiato
The Spirit of Radio
Freewill
Subdivisions
New World Man

Hello from England.. no, actually, although derived from the term
"Governor", "Guv" is short for "Guvnor" a very INformal way to say
"Sir", often used by taxi drivers and the lower classes, eg:

Hey gang...
Had to comment on the Rush and kids theme.. During the summers of 1991,92, I
worked at a Jewish Summer camp in Maine. (Camp Modin). I had about a dozen 7
to 10 year old boys in my charge, and would play music for them at night, to
help them relax. Their favorites? Enya's Shepard Moons, and a compilation
tape I made of quieter Rush tunes (ie) Rivendell, Different Strings, Losing
it, etc.. They just loved it. I hope, now that they're older, they still dig
Rush as much as they did then.. God I miss working at that camp. I can't
believe its been so long since I was there. Maine is about the coolest place
I've been outside New Mexico..

Oh, BTW, I can't remember if I've asked this before, but is there any word
on the when and if the new  Bob and Doug movie has even started produciton?
Did anyone see their recent commercial? Someone told me about it, but I
haven't seen it yet. I remember the Pizza Hut ad they did a while back. It
was pretty funny..
Cheers from New Mexico..

Greetings Campers,

	Kathy asked if anyone elses kids get into Rush.  Well I've got 
two of them.

	My son first got into Roll The Bones. Then, after he asked who 
that was, it dawned on him that Dad plays Rush all the time. Now he 
tells me that his favorite Rush tune is Driven.

	My daughter and I were playing on the computer the other day and 
I had Fly By Night and Presto in the Changer. She sang Fly By Night from 
beginning to end. Normally I would have told her to stop but she was 
pretty much on key with Geddy.  I, looking on from behind, smiled 
proudly.

Subject: the straight dope

ok, the story got scrambled in my memory.  I have a mind like a steel
trap--everything goes in and gets crushed and mangled.

Guitar School, May '90. interview with Alex, transcription:
Q:  How does Presto differ from past efforts?
AL: The approach on this record was to go for a chunkier, more
unaffected sound--getting away from my terrible 10-year dependency on
chorus (laughs).  I really liked having just the straight-forward guitar
into the amp sound.  It may be taking a few steps back, yet is still
refreshing for me.  My custom Signature (see Vital Stats) with the
split-coil active bridge pickup gives me clarity and brightness; at the
same time I can get a chunky thickness and warmth out of the humbucker.
Q:  Your comment on the chorus makes me think of a story about Jaco
Pastorius.  He was playing with Joni Mitchell and she came in with one
of the first chorus amps, maybe a Roland.  When he heard it, he just
immediately commandeered it and played through it the rest of the
night.  It's such a great sound.  {this is where I screwed up}
AL:  I went through exactly the same thing on AFTK, way back in _77_
(emphasis mine).  I rented a new Roland Jazz Chorus before the session,
and I couldn't _believe_ how it sounded.  I thought, "Where has this
sound been all my life?"  Unfortunately, I got very dependent on it.

So, THERE WAS NO CHORUS BEFORE AFTK.  The box came out in late '76, as
did electronic flanging.  Digital delay existed in 75, and was used on
The Necromancer.--VERY expensive effect then--about $10,000 (then) for a
fractional second delay.  These days, 8 seconds costs $200.

Greetings all !!

The posts regarding radio stations' reluctance to play more than a
couple of Rush songs strikes a chord w/ me too.  However, here in
Syracuse, N.Y., we're slightly spoiled by WAQX-FM (95.7 if you're in the
area).  In addition to Mr. Carroll's list, we also hear such delights as :

The Trees (most frequently), Red Barchetta, New World Man, Working Man
(I swear), Freewill (a lot), and occasionally Dreamline (when the moon
is full).

Like most fellow Rushians, I'd love to hear Hemispheres, 2112, and
Xanadu, but let's not push our luck !

It's just that Led Zep, though phenomenal, gets tons of airplay, about
30 songs, over & over & over  etc. And don't get me started on Boston !!
  But I guess only having the Chronicles CD in their studios (the
stations probably bring the rest to their local used record shop) limits
the selections.  But hey, who doesn't think their favorite artists get
enough respect ?

Whew !!  That felt great !  I should post more often !!

Subject: Rush in the Boston Radio Market

Hello...

There is an unwritten rule in the Boston area when it comes to radio
stations playing Rush:  your station must be outside of a 40-mile radius
from Downtown Boston.  There are occasional exceptions: WZLX (100.7) plays
Rush once in a great while (it's either "The Spirit of Radio," "Tom
Sawyer," or "Limelight.") or WBCN (which played stuff off of CP but
nothing from TFE since the station is trying to out-alternative the
"alternative" station known as WFNX).  However, if you are looking for
Rush on the radio, you have to tune your radio to the fainter stations
such as WHJY (Providence RI, 94.1), WHEB (Portsmouth NH, 100.3), WGIR
(Manchester NH, 101.1), or WAAF (Worcester MA, 107.3).  They feature Rush
in their playlists, and they make sure they play tracks off of the new
albums when they come out. 

	Here's some Rush songs I remember hearing on WAAF over the past
few years to give you an idea of their support of Rush: 

	Cinderella Man
	The Trees
	The Spirit of Radio
	Freewill
	Entre Nous
	Tom Sawyer
	YYZ
	Limelight
	Subdivisions
	The Analog Kid
	Dreamline
	Stick It Out
	Cold Fire
	Animate
	Test For Echo

>...and I believe that WAAF carried the world premiere broadcasts of both
CP and TFE.

There's been some discussion about when "Great White North" came out:

>Are you absolutely sure on this?
>
>"Take Off!" was one of the reasons I started listening to Rush, and 
>that didn't happen until late 1983, early 1984 (My senior year).  I

I'm pretty certain I got "Great White North" shortly after ESL, before
Signals came out.  I'm thinking Christmas 1981...  Anybody still got it on
vinyl and can check the date?  Then again, I suppose it doesn't really
matter when it came out, right?

Then, in another post from the same issue:

>>1-I notice in 'Freewill' that Geddy says "if you choose
>>not to decide you still have made a choice" but the
>>lyric sheet inside the album clearly say "you cannot
>>have made a choice".  Did the band do some inter-

>changes its destiny.  I realize this is a major stretch, but it fits
>and it's a good explanation.

I think this is much simpler than that... this question comes up fairly
often here.  See the FAQ, question #78.  Condensed version here:

According to a member of the Backstage Fan Club, someone wrote to Neil
about the apparent mistake in the Freewill lyrics and Neil responded:

"You and James of New York are right about this thing.  I don't know how it
happened- the lyrics are right on the Canadian sleeve- I can only imagine
that our American record company got hold of an uncorrected typeset.  I
hate that!"

Any Canadians with original copies of the PeW record able to check the
lyric sheet for us?

Cheers,

I am lucky enough to have an Arcam Alpha 8 CD Player, Alpha 9 amplifier,
Monitor Audio Studio 3 speakers, and an REL Q100E sub.  Everything I play
sounds good, but Rush really comes out well, it's a warm sound, but still
detailed with great soundspace and separation.  It's really hard to pick out
the best sounding song out of them all, but I'd have to say that La Villa,
YYZ, and The Analog Kid all sound the bollocks!!

Adding the sub has added a lot more presence, especially to those albums
previously sounding a little thin e.g. Power Windows, Presto

in the last couple of years.  I'd have to go with "Fully Completely" as
their 'magnum opus', though.  The sheer brilliance of that disc is
comparable to Rush's "2112" or "Moving Pictures"!  By the way, The Hip has
a new album due out in July...I belive it's called "Phantom Power"...a
North American tour should follow shortly thereafter.  In concert, they are
