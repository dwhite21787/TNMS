Hi all!

This is my first posting to the NMS though I have been reading it off and
on for about a year.  Just a few things:

I remember seing Rush play Xanadu on Don Kirschner's Rock Concert.  I must
have been about 8 years old.  My older brother was a big fan, so I had
already been introduced to them, but seeing them on TV was great!

BTW, the way my brother got to be a fan is that he and a friend were in a
record store and saw the All the World's a Stage album.  He told his friend
to buy the album because these guys were really good, so he did.  What my
brother neglected to tell his friend is that he'd never even heard of them
before, he just liked the album cover!  A dirty trick, I know, but it worked
out for the best.

I posted this on alt.rock-n-roll (or was it r.m.m?) but got no response, so
I'll try here:

I saw the RTB tour in LA, and was especially excited that Primus was opening.
I'd seen Primus 3 times before, but always in a more "friendly" environment,
i.e. headlining, or playing with other "alternative" bands.  Anyway, I was
very interested to see how Rush fans would react to them.  I was very
disappointed.  Many people were booing after 2 songs.  Les and the boys
were having a good time, and I think they started changing people's minds
by the end of the set, so it seems to have all worked out ok.  But I was
disturbed that Rush fans were so quick to judge.  I'll admit that Primus
is a very unusual band, but still...
What was the reaction to Primus on the rest of the tour? I'd like to believe
that is was just LA Rush fans, not Rush fans in general.  I'm especially
interested in the reaction at Bay Area shows (Primus' home turf).

One final thing:
I, too, will wait until I see a for sale sign before I start asking about
T-shirts.  So when someone finally does have them for sale, please let us
all know.  I definitely want one.

That's all for now.

					Later

Hey guys, it's been a while...

	I caught just enough of the Grannies [sic] last night to see
that Eric Johnson won the award for Best Rock Instrumental.  As we
all know, this is the only category for which Rush was even nominated.
I have nothing at all against EJ, and I think "Cliffs of Dover" is a
fine song.  But BETTER than "Where's My Thing?"??  NOT!!

	Perhaps I'm being a little biased, but this is just ONE MORE
reason why I shouldn't even watch the damn show.

Subject: Disapointment on seeing them early-Indy show...

After reading the review of San Antonio and Austin and I am disapointed I saw
them that soon. Don't get me wrong the RTB show was excellent. Definately 
betterthan the Presto show I saw at Alpine Valley. Eric Johnson opened 
(always a +) and the fellas came out with 10x more energy than the Presto 
show. The only problem I had was that Neil was laid back almost too much. 
It was great to see Alex and Geddy bounce off each other, but the professor 
seemed quiet. Also, whatis all this talk about a Towensend move at the end, 
missed that. Also, they did not play Ghost of a Chance, one of my favorite 
songs from RTB. Fantastic show, but I wished I saw them a little later into 
the tour. Hopefully there WILL be a summer tour. Thanks for letting me get 
this off my chest...

	[ Neil sometimes didn't do the Townsend windmill.  On some of
	  the shows that I saw he didn't, although for most of them he
	  did.  Guess it depends on which night it is.  - rush-mgr ]

P.S. I also think an oldies tour would be awesome. I would love to see 2112
     performed straight through...LIVE!

thanks for letting me post...

Hi guys,
	Just watched Lars Ulrich make a total fool of himself at
the Grammy awards yesterday and just wanted to know if I was
the only guy who felt like never buying a Metallica album again.
I guess the guy is still mad at some comments Ian Anderson once
made in RIP magazine about something to the effect that Metallica
were sobbing when the grammy in 1989 went to Tull in the heavy
metal category.
	Too bad Ulrich lives on Mars (heh heh) else he would
have known that Tull DID release an album last year. Maybe the
guy is really as dumb as he looks.
	Apologies to all Metallica fans. I personally liked them
too. All until yesterday.
	Ciao,
	_Aspi_

To the person who was talking about a tour of just "oldies" (he mentioned
2112 - AFTK), NO WAY!!!  While I would LOVE that, there is no way that
the boyz would do that.  Not only would Geddy have a tough time reaching
those high notes (Not that he can't; it's just that 2 hours of it would
certainly push the limits), but I think they like their new stuff too much
to skip out on it for a whole tour.  I'll say, though, that it would
certainly be interesting to see what kind of a turnout they would get for
such a tour.  Or even one or two concerts.  Hmmm....

There is a Ayn Rand "mailing" list. Last year it was taken off
a "public" computer and went private. This is a heavy duty list,
there are many Objectivist speakers i.e. professionals who
participate on it. As a consequence of being private, it costs $.

&gt;From: AARON SILVERMAN &lt;ASILVERM@vax1.trincoll.edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	Here's a thought for you all to mull over:  In the past few years,
&gt;some bands, including Judas Priest and Yes(In the form of ABW&H), have toured
&gt;playing sets consisting almost entirely of old stuff.  I don't know how many
&gt;of you share this opinion, but I'll take 2112 and Farewell To Kings over
&gt;Presto and RTB any day.  Post up what you all think of the idea of a Rush
&gt;oldies tour.
&gt;		P.P.S. Don't get me wrong, I do like the new stuff, but the
&gt;			older stuff is superior to anything this side of
&gt;			Cygnus X-1

Such a tour is definitely out of the question for Rush; they've
discussed this idea in interviews and consider such a thing regression.
I agree with that. Though I myself liked the (for the moment?) halted
direction of Power Windows and Hold Your Fire much more than the `old
stuff' (which I still value very highly). BTW, I read an interview with
Ged recently wherein he said the band would almost definitely be working
with Peter Collins again (yes! forget Rupert) some time in the future!

&gt;From: T J Moore-Read &lt;se2tm@leicester-poly.ac.uk&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;"Boy before the mirror, checks his camouflage"
&gt;&gt;&gt;"Polishes his armor, and the CHARGER in the garage"
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Charger is obviously the muscle car from the '60s (and my ALL time favorite
&gt;&gt;&gt;car!)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Just another one of my crazy obsessions (Chargers - check my .plan! :))
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Punisher
&gt;&gt;&gt;(formerly Daredevil - The Man Without Fear)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yup. A ``charger'' is also a horse ridden in battle, which fits nicely
&gt;&gt;with the armor polishing bit!
&gt;
&gt;yes but how do you polish a horse ?

Ah, Terry, being a Brit I thought you'd get this one. Since there
aren't any smilies I'll elaborate. The boy visualizes himself as
the Knight out to get the Fair Maiden. The point of the metaphor is
to capture this romantic attitude. The fact that there happens to
be a car called `charger' allows Neil to connect the metaphor with
a modern situation in a seamless way. So the horse isn't actually
polished, the car is; similarly, the boy may be actually wearing
camouflage clothing (suggesting a battle of the sexes) but can't
be actually wearing armour. The ambiguity in the language
allows Neil to present both images to us simultaneously: the actual
one of the boy preparing to go out to get the girl (in real life) and
the fantasy of the knight preparing for battle for the maiden (which
reflects his psychology).

I thought you all might like to hear something interesting and a little scary.
I have a friend at Rush's record company and from time to time he tells me
how the boyz are doing on the radio.  Well, it turns out the GOAC was
released to TOP 40 radio stations last week and is beginning to get added
to their playlists.  So far only about 10 TOP 40 stations have dared to
play it, but nonetheless we may have dare I say a HIT SINGLE on our hands.

(NOT)

Well we'll see about how many more TOP 40 stations pick it up.  In addition
Atlantic and Anthem have released a Promotional picture CD for GOAC.  It has
an edited version (which really blows) and the album version.

Does anybody in England know if they will be (or have already) added the
third night at Wembley Arena?  I heard they were considering it.

I also heard that Shreveport, LA was cancelled because Ged was sick, can any-
body confirm this??

Uh, I don't remember Rush doing any extended solo's on GOAC. I've seen
them play 3 times this tour, plus 2 soundchecks, and there was no
extended solo to Ghost. Only Bravado(now THAT was a gorgeous song!!),
Dreamline, and WMT?

IMHO, Eric Johnson really deserved the grammy.  I was lucky enough to

glad he has finally gotten some recognition for his years of hard work.

Subject: Rush oldies tour

I agree with Aaron Silverman that a Rush oldies tour would be great.  I also
think that many of their best songs are from the 70's, even though I'm into
all their albums.  The medley of old songs at the end of their concerts is
awesome, but the songs deserve a full playing, and there are many they skipped
over altogether.  I've been told that Rush doesn't like their old much as much
as their new songs, so if they have an oldies tour it probably wouldn't have
many dates.  Maybe they could have a pay-per-view showing for the everyone
who can't make it to one of the concerts.

hi there all you! i'm writing from *chilly* buffalo. read some interesting
stuff on the board, and thought i'd respond...

i saw rush in toronto for the presto tour and i must say there is nothing like
a home town audience! every one was so high strung! the opening band was voivod
(pee-yew!), but that's not why we were there! :) after leaving maple leaf
garden (where the concert was) many of us walked to neighbouring restaurants
on yonge. it was like we were one big happy family cruising the streets
of toronto, screaming and singing!

saw rush again in hamilton on the opener of the tour. they were so excited!
the bugs hadn't yet been worked out, but still fantastic (it seems so long
ago i saw them, i forget they are still on tour!). bad luck followed us there,
though....saw a car flip over on the thruway, and had a minor accident that 
left us stranded in the parking lot of a mice-infested hamilton 7-11 all 
nite long.

and about that "modern rock" station changeover.... the original "modern rock"
station that continues to play rush, and that rush pays homage to, is
cfny fm 102.1 *THE SPIRIT OF RADIO*!!!!!!!
(although they no longer use that as their on-air logo, due to a certain
radio personality who took over the station....but i won't go into that here...)
(but i do have a tee-shirt that says the spirit of radio on it! :)
live in peace, and live to love....

"And I thought Mr.Big was bad when they opened Presto!"

Gee.  That kind of suprises me.  Most Rush fans are (among other things)
interested in bass guitar, and I always thought the bass player in Mr. Big,
Bill Sheehan, was fantastic and a highly-accomplished player.  I used to enjoy
seeing him when his old (ten years ago) band used to come to bars in Upstate
New York.

(Before Mr. Big, Sheehan played in David Lee Roth's band and first started with
his Buffalo-based band Talas.)

&gt; -The injustice was announced... RUSH lost to Eric Johnson
&gt; aaaaargh

   I think it's quite fair that someone who can compose meaningful
instrumentals got the award. Where's My Thing is just a boring
collection of leftover riffs. I would have been very disappointed
if they had chosen Rush over so much new and inspiring instrumental
music.

   Alex isn't bad but Eric Johnson is more of a guitarist's guitarist.

Ohio. Let me know if you do.

hello Rush fans...

	I've heard a lot of negative remarks about the current opening
act for Rush-- Primus.  What ever happened to Eric Johnson opening?  I had
heard that he was opening during the early part of the tour.  Does anyone
know why he's not now? I figure it must have been a scheduling conflict since
Eric is a talented musician and I therfore can't see Rush telling him to "hit
the road" (sounds like from what I've heard though, that they need to tell
Primus this!).   Too bad -- I was looking forward to seeing Eric and Rush --
it isn't very often that one gets to see two talented acts ( who happen also to
be among your favorite musicians) during the same concert.
	As far as the grammies -- Eric was my choice (yes, even over Rush! --
MUTINY!!! and even over Steve Howe-- Yes is my fav band -- just ahead of Rush).
I really feel "Cliffs of Dover" is better than "Where's My Thing" and
"Masquerade".  Speaking of "Where's My Thing", I fell it's very good, but I
have to admit that I like "YYZ" better.  Any opinions? Another poll?
	Also, I highly recommend Eric's "Ah Via Musicom" -- excellent
songwriting complimented by excellent guitar work.  His album "Tones" is very
good too.  Also, I was Eric's name on th musician credits of Christopher 
Cross' big debut album ( the one w/ Ride Like The Wind and Sailing) in 
1979. Seems as if Eric has been around for awhile, though he has only 
recently been recieving the recognition he deserves.
	So don't be too disheartened that Rush didn't get the grammy -- at
least it went to another talented musician.  Anyway, I'm sure Rush will
clean-up at the Juno Awards.

Adios,

Jeff

    Just thought I would drop a note and see if any TNMS subscribers are going
to be at the Atlanta RUSH show on March 4th.  If so drop me a line at my email
address below.  I should be blowing into town about 5is-6ish (gotta drive
5 hours to see The Boyz).  Hopefully this show will be as good as some of the
other ones that I've been reading reviews about.
