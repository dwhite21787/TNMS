Subject: Extra goodies

Since we're in a temporary lull currently, I thought I'd grab this chance
to add a couple of special items into the regular digests instead of
having special editions.  The first is the last article in this edition,
an interview with Neil transcribed from Modern Drummer.  It's part one 
of the drum give-away.

Subject: RUSH in the Top 1000 songs

I listened to parts of the "Top 1000 Songs of All Time" countdown
show that was broadcast over the course of 4 days (culminating on
New Years Eve) on KISW here in Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised
to find many Rush tunes in the list. Closer to the Heart, Limelight,
and Spirit of Radio were all there, but what really made me smile
was the COMPLETE first side of 2112 checked in at #123, and get this:
Tom Saywer was #11! Kinda restores my faith in the progressive rock
stations. "One likes to believe in the freedom of music!"

Cheers
Dave

Subject: MTV and other RUSH bits

To whomever brought up eMpTyV yesterday:
   I also remember the days when RUSH was a constant group featured
 on the channel....To bad MTV changed it's ways.

Other Tidbits:
  I received the EXIT STAGE LEFT cassette dor Xmas this year and noticed the
bad audio quality of this recording...The bass line was way over what it should
be, and the midranges and highs could barely be heard...I wouldn't recommend
buying the casette version, but the CD version is much better.
  Also, I was in the record store yesterday, and noticed a Rush album titled
ARCHIVES....Picking it up, I found out that it is a double casette feturing
Rush's first 3 albums (RUSH,FLY BY NIGHT,and CARESS OF STEEL).  Just thought you
might like to know

I was reading something the other day and came across a quote that screamed
out at me to be sent to the digest:

	No other idol possesses its devotees so compellingly
	as the automobile, nor does any other god demand such
	human sacrifice, not even Ares; the apple of our modern
	Eden is a red sports car.

			    T. B. Pawlicki
			    "Exploring Hyperspace in Everyday Life"

(To be honest, I'm afraid I disagree with him about Ares.  And let's
all hope that we *don't* have Mars on the horizon, even though it's not
the Soviets giving us the blues.)

Subject: Rush and "classic rock" stations

Rush doesn't garner much, if any, airplay here in Atlanta on our soi-
disant classic rock station.  I wonder if the same is true up North,
where music and radio seem a little more, uh, advanced....?  :-)
When I queried that station as to why Rush was rarely (if ever) heard,
the jock replied that Rush "isn't classic enough."    Harrummph.

On the other hand, our AOR station plays a fair amount of Rush (in
between the trudging Southern rock stuff they overplay).  This station,
WKLS, released a Top 296 Songs of All Time list a few years back (just
after P/G, as I recall), with no less than 13 Rush songs included.
There were 7 Rush songs in the Top 80; the only other band achieving
that mark was Van Halen, and they had #80, so Rush reigned supreme
in the Top 79....  :-)

Letter from Neil
----------------

Fellow Drummers:

    I have recently put together a new drumset for myself (about which more
will appear in the next issue of MD), and I'm starting to feel like I have
too many good drums just sitting around. (You should have such problems,
right?) Now, I'm not greedy, and all these drums are more than I really
need. If I have one drumkit for touring and recording, and one at home for
practice and recreation, what use can I possibly have for all these others?
The answer, I've decided, is none; thus, I have decided to give the extra
ones away.

    Some of you may recall that a few years ago I gave away a nice Tama kit
by means of an essay contest here in MD. This worked out quite well, as I
was able to choose a deserving winner by way of his words, and he in turn
was generous enough to pass his drums along to the person I chose as
runner-up. The only trouble was that I had to read 4,625 essays, which took
up rather a large portion of my holidays! It was more than I bargained for,
I'd have to say, though I'm glad I did it -- once!

    So this time, I put my ideas together with the people here at MD, and
we decided to do it a little differently. We would like to hear a taped
drum performance from you. We have determined a limit of two minutes, to be
recorded on a cassette tape, in which you can express what you feel is your
best work. If you wish to make it shorter, that's fine (we judges won't
mind!), but please don't bother to make it longer, as we judges won't be
listening!

    Recording quality will not be taken into account, so don't worry too
much about that. We will be looking for things like originality, technique,
structure, imagination, musicality -- the intangible qualities that
together make a good musician. Play any style, any approach you like; there
are no limitations save your own (and the two-minute one!)

    So give it your best thought, give it your best shot, and put it in the
mail slot. (This guy writes lyrics?) We await your entries with open ears.

    First Prize - One Candy Apple Red Tama kit (the prototype Artstar
shells), with two 24" bass drums, 6", 8", 10", and 12" concert toms, and
12", 13", 15", and 18" toms. All the drums have brass-plated hardware.
There is also the "satellite" kit consisting of an 18" bass drum, four
matching red Simmons pads, and a Simmons SDS 5 module. Oh all right, I'll
throw in a 13" wood-shell timbale and a 22" gong bass drum, too. (This
setup was used in the recording of _Power Windows_, _Grace Under Pressure_,
and _Signals_, as well as the subsequent tours.)

    Second Prize - One Black Chrome Slingerland kit, with two 24" bass
drums, 6", 8", 10", and 12" concert toms, 12", 13", 15", and 18" toms, and
a pair of 13" and 14" brass timbales. (This kit was used in the recording
of _A Farewell To Kings_ and _Hemispheres_, and the endless tours which
followed them!)

    Third Prize - One Chrome Slingerland kit, with two 22" bass drums, 6",
8", 10", and 12" concert toms (copper finish), two 13" toms, one 14" tom, a
16" floor tom, and a chrome timbale. (Used in the recording of _Fly By
Night_, _Caress Of Steel_, _2112_, _All The World's A Stage_, and on those
equally endless tours.)

    All the kits are complete with basic mounting hardware and heads, and
even a few stands as well. I'm sorry there are no snare drums for any of
the kits, but I'm keeping the one snare that all those kits had in common!
(Some things you just can't replace!)
    To quote once again from one of the entrants in the last contest: "Good
luck is when preparation meets opportunity."
    So, Good Luck!

						Yours truly,

							Neil Peart
