Couldn't have said it better myself. I'm not saying
they can't play, it's obvious they're very talented,
but they sound as if they all riff at the same time.

Subject: Re: Hating Dream Theater

Personally, I think it's a stretch to even compare the two bands. The
musicians in DT were obviously inspired by Rush, and their writing style
is quite technical. After you get to that point, IMO, any similarities
end. Rush has evolved into a totally different band, and have
incorporated a myriad of styles and textures. They are seasoned
musicians, who think as a unit and know how to play off each other. What
Dream Theater set out to become (style, tendancies etc.) is still under
construction. They are still figuring each other out, and writing some
decent material while their at it. Their approach to each of their CD's
has a sameness from release to release. However, I wouldn't go as far as
to say they are "souless". Rush can be different on a track to track
basis on almost any CD, and still retain the qualities that make them
what they are...extrordinary. DT, in fact, is only slightly ahead of
dozens of bands at the same skill and writing level (ie: Symphony X,
Stratovarious, Blind Guardian etc.). The thing that sets them apart from
those bands, for me, is James LaBrie and Mike Portnoy. Those two guys
are special musicians. IMO, it's an apples and oranges kind of thing...

Cheers,
John

so it was very distinctive.  These days a lot of people have

Subject: Kids and Rush

I read the post from Dom and I couldn't resist commenting further on this
subject.

As a long time RUSH fan, my son has grown up listening to their music.
However, since he turned 7 years old he has really begun to appreciate and
enjoy their music.  I had always dreamed of taking my son to his first
concert, especially if it was to see RUSH.  The T4E tour gave me that
opportunity and I took him to the show in Devore, California.  He loved the
music and lasers, (especially Red Sector A).   I personally saw about 6-10
other kids at the show and was thrilled that they also were jamming along with
crowd.  As we were leaving the show the first thing my son said was, "Mom,
they rocked!  Will you take me to see them again?!"  Ahhhhh  from the mouths
of babes :) Life was definately good that night, in my heart and in the land
of RUSH!!

I agree absolutely and have said so here before.  They may be 
talented at co-ordinating fingers and notes, but they aren't
musicians by a long way.  Well said.  There's no such thing as
technically better.

I saw Rush on Friday March 11, 1994 at the Worcester Centrum, and they did not
play "The Pass" that night.  After the show, I wrote down all the songs they
played, and that was not one of them.

But I can't comment on thr RI show, I wasn't there.

Well Daniel you weren't alone on this, but you might be now !
I felt exactly the same as you after buying "Awake". For some reason I then
bought "Falling Into Infinity" and now I can't get enough of DT.  My
suggestion ... stop comparing or holding them up to Rush. After all there is
only one Rush.

Well ... some of those selections are just plain laughable.  At least
Lifeson and Petrucci (my two favorite guitarists) got mentioned even
though they are almost dead last.  I, for one, completely despise these
kind of "TOP WHATEVER" articles that we see in media.  Who can honestly
pick out "Working Man" as Alex's best solo or "Under a Glass Moon" as
John's best solo??  And who has the balls to name the #1 greatest guitar
solo??? (Guitar's writers obviously)    Blah ... Crappy surveys.

Subject: Rush playing live in Europe?

Hello fellow Rushians,

saddenig, the fact that Rush is not coming to a tour to Europe;
no, it doesn't even HAVE to be Germany, just Europe would do;
I'd GO there, anywhere! 

Let's see, the last chance I got to see them was in April, 1992,
RTB tour in the Festhalle in Frankfurt.  Still good in memory,
but far too long ago.  I little frustrating, don't you think?

I know, I know that it would probably be too far-fetched for
Rush to be playing in Europe (Germany) again, with all the
trouble involved.  But it would be nice :)  I believe they
stopped after there weren't as many U.S. Armed Forces stationed
here anymore, the hall were filled but obnoxious sometimes ...

I have had the chance to go to 5 concerts I think (still
searching for my collected old concert cards).  I have been a
Rush-Lover since 1978, that's 20 years, and only 5 concerts?
Yuck.

So, along with all the other fellow Rushians in Germany (Europe) 
waiting and hoping for next year... 

Take care and thanks for TNMS!

        Uwe

Yet another rumor, this one seems solid and certainly sounds more
RUSH-like....

live album title will be "Different Stages"

has a dual meaning, as Neil is prone to love.... no doubt the final set
will have come from various arenas, also the material covers the band
over time.

This is my bet, regardless of Doug Maher's sources.

Subject: Neil's Finest Work (IMHO) And A New Suggestion For Live Album Title

Everyone in TNMSland,
	Just thought I would send in my first post for TNMS about a few
things that have been floating around:

(1)  A while back a guy asked which songs would best portray the
Professor's mastery of the drum kit because he was trying to convince
his friend that Neil is "the man" on the drum kit. Surprisingly enough
no one suggested "Red Barchetta"!!!!.  I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!!! 
This songs has Neil's signature ride cymbal pattern and the fills
throughout the song are seamless.  The kit work after "suddenly ahead
of me across the mountainside" until the end of the song is better
than sex (especially if you're a percussionist-and we get a lot!!!). 
This song is certainly one of Rush's most powerful studio songs and it
blew my out of my seat on the TFE tour.  Therefore, IMHO I would have
to vote for "Red Barchetta".

and finally...

(2) Most people seem to hate the working title of "Dimlit Stages for
All Ages" for the new live album (is Dimlit even a real word?). 
Alright, I'm going to go out on a limb here (PLEASE don't send too
many flames for this one) and suggest the title of "Dimlit Stages
Through The Ages".  How does that sound?  It keeps with the spirit of
the original working title yet it expresses what the boys have seen
every night for years as they ran from behind the stage. Most
importantly, it expresses what we, the fans, see as the house lights
suddenly go out and the crowd begins screaming in wanting anticipation
for the boys to hit their marks and start kickin' ass!!! (I always get
that "my stomach just dropped out of my body" feeling when the house
lights go out JUST before the boys run onto stage!!!).

	So what do you think America?  Let me know and let everyone in
TNMSland know. 
	
	Well, that's it for my first TNMS experience (it wasn't as painful as
people say).  Peace everybody.

P.S.- Hey rushmgr, keep up the good work.  You ALMOST kick as much ass
as the boys!!!!

	Just the other day I bought Burning For Buddy, and LOVE it.  The only 
thing I am not to thrilled about is Neil only plays on two songs.  Well 
I might buy Burning 2, but want to know from REAL Rush fans, is it worth 
buying???  How many songs does Neil play on??

Atlantis website is finally online at http://members.tripod.com/~atlantis_it

Atlantis is the Italian Rush tribute band. Formed in 1995, they played
several concerts in Italy (where Rush never played) and are now working on
their debut-CD.

Other tribute bands are kindly requested to get in touch with me privately
at ultimateart@planet.it to trade links on the respective websites.

Subject: My thoughts on title for the new album

I think the cover should have Alex in some oversize and poorly worn
clothing holding a giant barrel of Cheetos over his head, spilling them
into his mouth open as wide as it can get.  Alex's hair will be
completely mangled a la Ted Nugent, and a wild look in his eyes.  Neil
and Geddy will be standing next to him looking off into the distance
with big eyes and arms down by the side.  The title of course, will be,
"Goddamit, I want some more Cheesy Poofs!"

I have spoken.  Let it be so.

Hey, good to see Alex made the Guitar World Top 100.  Hard to argue with
Working Man but I think his greatest solo is found at the emotive end to
Soliloquy or maybe even Presentation.

Well, I picked one up yesterday for my husband (early anniversary gift)
and he loves it.  This one looks great to me.  Maybe I didn't scrutinize
it as much as Billy, but there were no obvious problems.  Besides, it
sounds great.  Max plugged it in and cranked it up.  It was beautiful.
:)

Maybe Billy just got a lemon, which is very unfortunate.  :(  Hey Billy,
maybe you can exchange it?

If Max or I notice any probs w/ the bass in the future, I'll be sure to
report it for those who want to know.

The person who recommended the new Candlebox CD was right on the $$$.
It's a great album.  Let me repeat:  The new CANDLEBOX CD is GREAT!  It
has the power and passion of their 1st album w/ well-written songs,
interesting music and great production.  BTW, it's called _Happy Pills_.

That's enough for now.

Subject: Small Soldiers Soundtrack Article in BillBoard

The following is from BILLBOARD Magazine, July 25, 1998:

Music From The Motion Picture Small Soldiers
PRODUCERS: various
DreamWorks 50051
By enlisting cutting-edge DJs, rappers, and producers to rework such 
tracks as Queen's "Another One Bites The Dust," the Pretenders' "My City 
Was Gone," Pat Benatar's "Love Is A Battlefield," and Rush's "Tom 
Sawyer," the producers of DreamWorks' partially animated summer action 
flick "Small Soldiers" have breathed new life into the most hackneyed of 
musical forms: the classic-rock radio staple. Among the highlights of a 
refreshing set are a remake of "War" by Bone Thugs-N-Harmony featuring 
Flesh-N-Bone, Henry Rollins, Tom Morello, and Flea; DJ Z-Trip's 
reinvention of "Tom Sawyer"; Wyclef Jean's "Another One Bites The Dust"; 
Queen Latifah's "Love Is A Battlefield"; and "My City Was Gone," 
featuring Kool Keith and the Butcher Bros. Amid a profusion of 
soundtracks that simply license older material, this one stands out as an 
entertaining alternative.

Subject: Rush sighting and other matters

Dear fellow Rushians,

Have a few things to spout off so here they are in no particular order.  
First, saw Mafia! last night. It was O.K. and had its moments, but be 
sure you really, really want to see it.  Anyways, the previews were of 
interest.  Adam Sandler has a new movie coming out called "The 
Waterboy."  It looks pretty good.  He plays an idiot water boy for a 
football team, whose players push him over the edge and turns him into a 
killing machine and so he plays.  And guess what the song was that ran 
throughout the trailer?  If you said Tom Sawyer, you are correct. TS 
used for two movies in the same year in the same season.  Rush must 
really be making an impact on Hollywood.  ANd as the trailer ended with 
the credits, Geddy chimes in with "And his mind is not for rent; not to 
God or government."  Excellent!

Second, the title as is for the Live album has got to be only working. 
They already released a live album with the stage ideal attached to it 
and this one isn't as provoking as I thought it could be.  I can't 
recommend titles; it's not what I do, but if I *absolutely* had to, 
let's see, Virtual Songs for a Virtual REality.  OK, so it sounds bad. 
Flame me if you really want.  Send death threats and all the other good 
stuff to the email address above, but don't waste everyone else's 
reading time with your dislike of it.

Third, I have an aesthetics question.  I know Rush hasn't done a lot of 
full acoustic songs, but what is everyone's favorite acoustic part in 
songs or blend of acoustic and electric?  My favorites, the intro to the 
Trees, intro and finale to Fountain of Lamneth and Broon's Bane.

Fourth, someone posted about the shortcomings of the Geddy Lee Jazz.  
Has Rickenbacker done a Geddy Lee Ric. 4001 or anything like that?  Let 
me know.

Take care all.

Subject: Give me a break...  The greatest 100 solos of all time?

As a guitarist I know that the whole list of "greatist solos" is arbitrary.
 Still, I have to say that Alex, as usual got stiffed.  As a matter of fact
everyone after Neil Youngs "Cinnamon girl" (number 76) mention got stiffed.
 Come on he held the same note for four bars, twice.

But  I'm miffed that "La Villa" did not get on the list, or Red Sector A or
how about the live version of Mission.  There are so many possible solos
that Alex has cranked out that it would be impossible to list them all.  

I was glad to see David Gilmours name come up a few times as he deserves
it.  I think that the present members of Pink Floyd take too much heat in
this list from ignorant people who have no idea what transpired back in
1986.  The band did not retire, Roger Waters quit.  This does not make the
present membership a parody of themselfs in any way.  Besides David Played
most of the tricky bass parts on the records anyway.  

That's all I want to say here.  This is supposed to be about Rush.

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what
the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly dissapear and be
replaced be something even more bizzare and inexplicable.
 
There is another theory which states that this has already happened."

Michael,
I was at both Worcester shows and the Providence show (met Geddy that
night). The Pass was not played at any of those shows as I recall. I have a
song chart for all the Rush shows I've been to and I don't have it down
there. Show Don't Tell was the only Presto tune played.
They did however alternate The Pass during the RTB tour.

Well, that Top 100 solos thing was pretty interesting, and pretty
ridiculous.  Rush mentioned once, at # 94, behind 3 Pantera songs.  Gimme
a freakin' break.  Pantera?  There's 3 Pantera songs and only 1 from
Carlos Santana.  What is wrong with this picture?  And what is up with
putting Sublime on the list?  I will have to admit that I was pleasantly
surprised that Funkadelic's Maggot Brain was on the list.  It is truly an
incredible jam.  Pick up a live version and you will not be disappointed.
 Sometimes it goes for 10 or 15 minutes, sometimes 30.

 In case you didn't hear it the first thousand times you listened to ESL...
the solo from TFE is far superior,and deserves a place on the new album.
