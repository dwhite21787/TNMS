Whew! There. Now I believe this list to be accurate, but I want
feedback. If it's NOT on this list, I KNOW IT HAS BEEN PLAYED. Please
help me knock songs OFF of this list. If you know something on here
HAS BEEN PLAYED, let's hear about it!

(Note: this list is comprised of RECORDED RUSH SONGS. I realize that
I'm not including songs from the bar days or semi-outside projects
like "Battlescar" and "Tough Break"(though I'd LOVE to hear this last
one...if anyone knows where I can hear a copy, please email ME!))

Umm..it must have been the cannabis-psychose that made me mess up the
subject line. :-)

Anyway, yeah, I have experiences very similar to Sean's with playing
Rush (or Pink Floyd or Yes or Mahavishnu orchestra or old Genesis...)
in the classroom. Back in the ancient times our music teacher would
let people bring their own favorite music to school every now and
then. Needless to say, I _always_ brought something to the class
(I bet some people still have nightmares about it) and while I was
having a good time with two or three friends of mine, the rest of
the class stared and listened with astonishment. By the way, our
teacher actually _liked_ La Villa. Too bad she never let me play
2112 or The fountain of Lamneth. Yeah, right, the songs are a bit
long and other people had brought cassettes, too.

I wonder when Rush are going to bring "I think I'm going bald"
back to their tour song list. It will be very appropiate soon,
I guess.

Subject: Hampton, Va show (Spoiler???????)

I don't know if this is a spoiler or not, since I'm not going to talk about any
specifics.  I had the good fortune to see U2 on Saturday 3/7 and RUSH on
Sunday 3/8.  This was 2 years to the day after the last time I saw RUSH in
Detroit during Presto.  My sister flew down from Michigan (to Virginia) to take
in both shows.  I enjoyed the U2 show - I had seen them in Denver when they
were
making that stupid live album, I hated it, and I thought I would give them a
second chance. I'm glad we went to that, because it gave us a true measure of
the sound quality and content of the RUSH show.  U2 sold out in a couple of
hours.  Rush tickets were still on sale at the door.  RUSH made U2 look and
sound like a garage band, I kid you not.  And I really like U2's music.

In response to a posting by David Kuznick...  RUSH had lasers when I saw them
during Presto (and in previous tours).  I guess New Haven (or wherever you saw
them last) lost out.  There was also quad-sound during Neil's solo, and what I
would call surround-sound during the rest of the show.  I agree with your
assessment of the Pink Floyd laser show though - truly incredible!  The sound
was also great. I don't think it is the equipment or sound-person David, it
must be the arena they played in.  U2 and RUSH played in the same coliseum and
there was truly no comparison between the two bands' sound.

IMHO, Geddy has always been a premier bass player.  I play bass (NOT good) and
have always found RUSH music some of the most difficult to play (in the rock
genre).  I think songs from RTB are easier to play than previous RUSH on the
average.  I truly admire anyone who can play along with YYZ.  And the bass
line in Circumstances is tremendous!

To the guy who listed 11 cd's and wondered which other ones to
get... I'm serious when I say get them all.  If you're going to shell out
$175.00 or so, just pay the extra $100.00 and get them all.  If you don't,
you'll be missing out on a LOT of great music.  It seems that I don't have a
favorite RUSH album of all time, but all of them (with the exception of RUSH)
have been number one at one point of the other.

On the subject of Primus, I didn't like them, but I saw them in an old issue
of Playboy the other day. Les was posing for the camera with his pants down
and his ass facing the camera.  You got to hand it to those guys...

        Well I got the new Kerrang Mar.7 today and it has a collection of
RUsh concert photos.  Really cool.  Got my CD imports in the mail and the
y were BROKEN!!!   ARRRRGGGG!!!!   Well I have to wait anothe 8 days for
them to exchange them.  Idiots at UPS!!  My final word,  Rush should have
gotten the Grammy,  WMT is more well rounded than CoD in that all
musicians get equal playing space. Eric is great and I like him alot but
the category was instrumental rock,  not instrumental guitar exercises(no
flames)   Spinal Tap's "Break Like the Wind" was released today. Nigel
really comes into his own on this album.  His interweaving of melodies in
tunes like "Bitch School" and " Cash on Delivery" is really amazing.  The
 Grammies better notice musical talent like this. (incredible comic
talent anyway)

remember

   You will come a little faster, thanks to

On the Dennis Miller Show Friday night, the musical guest was Primus. I don't

They rocked it up. As everyone has mentioned they do an excellent version.

Subject: 2112 lyrics
Date: Sat, 21 Mar 92 21:31:14 EET

After reading the lyrics to 2112 one thought crossed my mind: where
did those "introductions" to the songs first appear? My 2112 CD does
not have any lyrics in it, there is only a very short story by an
anonymous writer (begins: "I lie awake, staring...") and a picture
of the boys that I cannot look at without bursting into laughter.
I, however, do have the lyrics on ASCII and in that file every part
of 2112 has a bit of an introduction before the lyrics. Where did
these lyrics come from? The vinyl sleeve? Backstage club? If they
were on the vinyl sleeve, why on earth they are not on the CD folder?

One more thing about drugs (and I will NOT discuss this matter on
TNMS): anyone interested in getting a "Marijuana myths" file, send
me a request via email. The file is about 10 kilobytes long and
very informative with references to scientific studies.

Since it has been a question several times, maybe a worth while

the radio stations members listen to that carry Rockline...  I know of
two (KRQR 97.3 in SF,CA and WAAF 107.3 in Boston,MA).  If everyone
will send me the stations they listen to Rockline on, I'll compile the
list and then someone can hold on to it and post it periodically after
I am gone (May).  Please be sure to include the call letters, the FULL
frequency, not just something like "KISS 108" (it's actually 107.9),
and the city and state (or whatever is relevant in other countries).
Please do not abbreviate city names, as I might not know the common
abbreviation...  Also, please be sure that your subject line reads
Rockline.  My email address is morgan@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu

hello again, fellow rushians!

for the person from northeastern who wanted directions to atlantic city,
this is to the best of my knowledge....

1) take i-95 directly to new york city.  if you come directly from
boston, then it will take about 4 or 5 hours depending on new haven/bridgeport
nyc traffic.

2) continue through the geo. washington bridge to the nj pike.

3) get off the nj pike at exit 7 (i-195).  this is the atlantic city
x-way, and it's also a toll road.

4) follow the acx about 43 miles.  total time is about 7 1/2 hours.

(if i had more time in the library, i'd give you the down n dirty details...)

&gt;
&gt;Oh, by the way, someone mentioned that they didn't see the foam arrow thingies
&gt;at New Haven. Alex did get shot with one, when he came over to Geddy's side of
&gt;the stage. He threw it back....
&gt;

I was on the left side of the stage 4 rows from the floor and had a really
good view of the foam arrow thing. I'm not sure who it was, but it appears that
on Geddy's side there's some kind of bunker or something (maybe those
more knowledgeable in the stage and it's makeup can elaborate). Someone
inside that thing had shot it out at Alex. Alex then picked it up and threw
it back at him.  There was another incident too but I didn't catch
all of it.

These foam arrow "thingies" are crossbows from, I believe, Nerf. My kids
have them (thanks to my in-laws :-)). Anyway, it was real apparent that
they were really loose and having a great time.

The best part was when Alex got off the stage and played right in front
of us (behind the barrier of course).

Great show!! The rabbits were a scream!

Subject: Directions to AC Continued

I think it was Thor Iverson (tiverson@lynx.northeastern) who asked the question
of how to get to AC for the Rush concert.  I was pressed for time last night,
because the library was closing.  Here are some _additional_ directions:

1) If you want to avoid NYC altogether, take exit 22 when you cross the NY bor-
der on I-95.  This is I-287, and it leads to the Tappan Zee bridge and into the
northern part of NJ via Nyack and Suffern.

   At I-287 there are directions to the Garden State Parkway (GSP).  This will
133 miles south (and the GSP starts at Mile 173!)  This detour may be longer
than the one I gave last night, and I think you might expect another 3 1/2
hours driving time.

2) IORN (In other Rush News)  I read _visions_ when I was at Tower Records over
the break.  It's not cheap (as another fellow rushian quoted...at $19.95!!)
but it is an excellent book, and I plan to get my mitts on it...

Off to a new world land....not Lotus-land, but something nicer....

In other Rush news, I read _Visions_ this weekend at Tower
Records in Boston.  &lt;&lt;MONDO EXCELLENTE!!!!!!!!!!&gt;&gt;  It was
written around the time of HYF, but the only holdback is
that it is expensive ACWWS (as conventional wisdom would
say-ORQ).  I plan on buying it later this year, when I can
afford it.

As for the drug sitch, I have no comment other than to bring

Well, I really enjoyed the album too, but I wouldn't get too excited about the

Subject: HYF Hidden images.

Hi,

I just read the FAQ re: the Hold Your Fire inside picture.  Just a
few comments:

- I can't spot the hand with a pistol.  _Which_ window is it in?
- The font used in the restaurant sign is similar, but NOT identical
to the one used in GUP.  Compare the E's.
- How do we know that the cloth wrapped object on the steps is a
painting, let alone which one?  (Sure sounds good, though!)
- I think the arches and the owl are stretching the point.

New observations:

- The lamp post in the foreground (not the one by the car) is the
same one that appears on the Permanent Waves cover.  It is next to
the waving gentleman.  Compare the column itself as well as the
carving on the base.

Just wondering - my CD picture is kinda small.  Someone with a better
picture might want to look at:

- In the window under Lady Liberty, the room clearly has a blackish
object hanging on the wall.  It can't be a window since it is on an
interior wall.  Any guesses?

- Next to the hydrant, behind the metal fence, is a large ring shaped
object.  Could this be the puppet king's crown?

- That black cat cries out for an explanation!

- Can anyone make out what is on the posters on the wall above the
car?

Finally, has the band (or Hugh Syme) ever commented on what is in the
picture?  I've only heard an interview where they commented on how
small the set was (I think the manhole cover is about the size of a
quarter) and joked about how hard people were searching for symbols.
(Alex asked if anyone has found the phone number yet!)

Subject: drugs and stockhausen

&gt;  Thor mentioned A Passage to Bangkok with its obvious content about drugs.
&gt;I have always had the opinion that the song doesn't portray drug use in a
&gt;good light, even though the song is in first person and the narrators are
&gt;quite happy with their "travels".  It strikes me that, because drugs are so
&gt;obviously the central point of both the song and the lives of the characters
&gt;in the song, it is showing society and drugs as a bad combination.
&gt;  -- Mike

This is a very subjective evaluation, I'd say; only someone with a clear
anti-drug point of view would see the above truths about the song as a
negative statement. In my opinion, in 1976 (16 years ago!) the boys saw
recreationa drug use as no big deal and perhaps even relatively cool in
done in style :) as the characters of the song do. Why do a great song
with such a positive feel if you're trying to give a negative
evaluation? Contrast the song with ``Afterimage'' for example.

The following is not an attempt to ``feed the flames'' but I heard
information from a relatively reliable source that Ged was using some
cocaine around the time of PeW (perhaps correlated with their
long-awaited financial success and `fame' ? cf. ``Limelight''). I've
seen a photo from a PeW-period show in Massey Hall (in the Moving
Pictures sheet music book) where Ged is wearing his Rick and jumping
more than five feet in the air! One hell of an achievement for someone
who's not wired...

&gt;I once played "La Villa Strangiato" for a music theory class.  They *really*
&gt;liked it; in fact, several people ran out and bought the album!
&gt;
&gt;We critiqued it from a composer's point of view.  The general consensus
&gt;was that it came dangerously (*grin*) close to following the classical
&gt;composition model.  The abrupt segues between styles was seen as a fine
&gt;application of well-known techniques, and the general theme was compared
&gt;to works by Mozart, Bach, and Stockhausen (?).

Stockhausen is great! One of my favorite composers, and someone nobody
with an open mind (i.e. ear) should ignore. I recommend his pieces
``Kontakte'' and ``Zyklus'' (available but hard to find on CD at the moment)
as well as ``Unsichtbare Choere'' (on DG CD)...
