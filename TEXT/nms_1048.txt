A quick take at answering  a Presto question from NMS #1047

>From: rastaman@dkunix.dkeep.com
>Subject: Some Presto Questions

>My guess would be the clenched fist=percussion and Neil.  The
>open hand suggests the guitar and Alex.  The upside down peace
>sign the plucking hand of Geddy on bass.  Is this blatantly
>obvious?  any comments welcome.

The clenched fist - Alex: frustrated at trying to play the
                          augmented D# minor add 7th without a
                          wammie.

The open hand - Neil: playing a la Congo (or Neil preparing to
                slap Alex for leaving some crumbs on his
                Slingerland)

The upside down peace sign - I don't know, but it's not Geddy.
                             Ged would've used a different
                             gesture. I once asked him if he
                             uses a pick and he said,  "NO! I use
                             THIS" and then he prominently
                             flipped me the bird.  My guess is
                             that he was showing me his big ole
                             fingernail that grew in thick after
                             some accident.

Could be anything Rastaman. Maybe even "Rock-Paper-Scissors" ;)

Tony Dormio - actually I've never spoken with Geddy, although,
              Geddy flicking me off in Rush hour traffic is a
              fantasy of mine.

Subject: Chronicles Video

Well, watching the Chronicles Video, I was simply amazed at the video for
"Mystic Rythms".  It is just great to be able to play along with the music for
the setup that I have for my drums, but watching the videos helps you to
understand the technique that Neil plays with (poor grammar, I know).  The
videos help you to understand how he plays those awesome fills during
"Subdivisions", and I think that it is a great investment for those of you out
there who would want to try to pick up some of Neil's style (you'll just have
to bypass that whole 80's look in the middle of the cassette).
 As for the Chronicles CD, just getting "What You're Doing" and "Passage To
Bangkok" live on CD is worth the $20.

Later all..

>From Larry Allan at the Buddy Rich show two months back he said that the band
would not be out on the road until 1996 and the album may or m ay not be out
by the end of 1995 - don't get your hopes up about a new album any time soon,
They were going to meet at Alex's Restuarant for an after New's Years meeting
though to discuss things, but don't expect anything too soon = but don't rule
out Rush yet though, they've still got a number of years kicking around in them
Watch out for a Summer 1995 Buddy Rich tour in Europe though (possible).

Also, according to the March 9, 1983 Forum video in Montreal Rush did not use
lasers. Someone check the video from the night before and let us know.

Subject: Mr. Big reference in Big Money

Wayne & Garth, although they would be much cooler if they listened to
Rush, are victims of circumstance.  First, Mr. Big is a pretty common
name to call any high management person, as was the character in Wayne's
World.  Also, the Mr. Big on the Rush plate is a tribute to the band
who toured with them "Mr. Big."  In fact, if you check the liner notes
on Power Windows, a thank you in England goes to "Mr. Big and the Royal
Jamaicans."  I believe I saw their name in another album, but I can't seem
to locate it anywhere.

Greetings,

	March 28th was the original release date for RUSH's new album, but now
I hear that the date's been pushed back till fall? I'm surprised that the
RUSH-MGR didn't mention that he would follow up on it, or whether this was 
true or not. Let's clear the air. The sooner the better, don't you agree?

   [ I have already stated that the album MAY be out in late fall, as they
     are supposed to start writing/recording in the next month or so...
     but don't expect a Rush tour until 1996..                    : rush-mgr ]

By the way, why do we care what a bunch of animated cartoons think about the 
world's greatest band? Huh, huh, heh, huh...

Also, was RUSH really on ROCKLINE, and if so, where the transcripts?

   [ Rush has been on rockline many times, if you're talking about the most
     recent one, it was only Neil (about the Buddy cd).           : rush-mgr ]

I also have a copy of 2112 on vinyl.  The label is a Johhny Rodriguez

Subject: The History of Rock as Seen Thru the Eyes of a Dinosaur

Hello fellow Rushies!

Isn't so appropriate that Magic 105 (our local rock station in Little Rock) is
playing "Limelight" as I begin this! I've been reading TNMS for a few weeks
now, and I must say I'm very impressed with what I read. I was really beginning
to worry that perhaps rock'n'roll as I've known it was a dying breed, but
the enthusiasm and dedication that my fellow Rush fans clearly exhibit when
writing about this wonderful band has restored my faith in today's youth.
Perhaps rock isn't quite dead just yet.

I'm sure the experienced posters out there can tell this is my first post to
TNMS (yawn!). I'm sure this will be the first of many posts I'll be making in
the months (and hopefully years) to come. I just wanted to take the opportunity
in this first post introduce myself to the other Rushies out there. Highly
opinionated and passionate posts will come later, I can assure you.

I am a 37 year-old university professor who has a fairly extensive background
as a fan of rock music. I've been a "true" Rush fan since 1980, although I've
followed the band almost from their first album. I only had a marginal interest
in the band up until 1980 because I was more into Led Zeppelin. Prior to Zep,
my favorite bands were the Beatles (first and foremost) and later Grand Funk.
I followed rock music very closely beginning with the Beatles (I have vivid
memories of seeing them on Ed Sullivan in February 1964). I was very interested
in pop music-- any pop music-- during the 60s and early 70s, but by the time
I got to high school, I was more into arena bands like Zep, the Who, Eagles,
Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Styx, Heart, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Doobie Brothers, Queen, etc.
As far as taste in music goes, I'm rather schizophrenic: I can be happily
engaged in a heavy metal band like Zep one minute, but then change to something
like Cat Stevens, Aretha Franklin, or B.B. King the next. Then, the next
minute I might be listening to Mahogany Rush, Black Crowes, Crash Test Dummies,
or Collective Soul.

Well anyway, without boring anybody further, my first live experience with Rush
was March 8, 1977 at the Norfolk (VA) Scope. Rush was the warm-up band for
Kansas during Kansas' "Leftoverture" tour. I still remember the night very
vividly (despite the fact that I was pretty blotto). Their entire set consisted
of the entire song "2112." It was incredible to say the least. I thought they
practically blew Kansas off the stage. Since that first show, I've seen them 13
more times in several different cities (e.g., Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati,
Indianapolis, St. Louis, Dallas, Little Rock). My best friend (who had never
seen Rush) and I drove 650 miles to see them in Indianapolis during the Presto
Tour.My greatest regret is that I was in Toronto several years ago when Rush
was in town and I didn't go see them! My wife and I had seen them in Detroit
and Indianapolis a few nights before, so she was fairly sick of them by the
time we reached Toronto (she's not a very big Rush fan at all, although we have
two cats, one which loves Rush at 120+ decibels-- I ought to keep the cat and
get rid of the wife!). When Zep folded after the death of John Bonham, my full
attention turned to Rush. And the rest, they say, is history.

Because of my long interest in the band (both superficially and intensively),
I've had the opportunity to see Rush and its individual members evolve over the
years. Comparing the band when I first saw them in '77 to the last time I saw
them (Dallas, January 28, 1994, Counterparts Tour), the difference is truly
amazing. Neil, Alex, and Geddy have all three evolved into premiere musicians.
The integrity of the band and its members is probably what I admire most. There
has been alot of garbage passed off as rock music the past decade or so, but
Rush just keeps on plugging along doing their own thing on their own terms.

I'm terribly sorry for the length of this; I know alot of you probably aren't
interested in an old man's perspective of Rush. I'd be pissed too if I had to
wade through something I didn't particularly care to read. So... for now I'll
close this, but before doing so just a few more tidbits. I really can't zero in
on a favorite Rush album (I love 'em all!), but if forced to do so, it would
probably be "Hemispheres." At one time, I wasn't really crazy about either p/g,
PoW, or HYF, but with each successive listen, I become more and more impressed
with them. My favorite Rush song is easier to choose-- without a doubt its
"The Trees." However, there are literally hundreds of other songs that I think
are simply masterpieces. Being as old as I am, you might think I'd pick the
early albums as more favorite over the newer ones, but in reality I like them
all. As I said, the truly interesting thing about my experience with the band
is in watching them mature year by year. Counterparts is one of the best albums
they've made in several years.

As far as possessions go, I have all the customary stuff, but my favorite Rush
possession by far are the Promark 747 drumsticks with Neil's name on them. I
managed to beg them off one of the roadies after a show in Memphis in 1982. I
still have the poster that came with the Hemispheres vinyl album; it's hanging
up on a wall in my office here at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
My students can't believe I listen to them.

To John Grothman: Ah, the old days! How my heart yearns for the days of hissing
                  and popping of vinyl. The old "coin-on-the-tone arm" trick
         	  really took me back! As Bob Hope would say, "Thanks for the
		  memories!"

I will be posting from time to time, especially if I feel my $.02 will add to a
particular discussion. Keep the faith, dear Rushies!

Hail.

Someone mentioned possibly seeing Neil on CNN in connection with the
B. Rich project.  You were right, the Neil-meister was on CNN.

Not that I saw it, of course.  My brother informed me of the momentous
occasion.  He said Neil was interviewed briefly and was saying, basically,
how inferior he felt compared to Buddy and how hard it was to try to
play up to Buddy's standards.  That was all i was told.  Just wanted to
confirm The Sighting.  :-)

Don't suppose he'd shaved his goatee, huh...?

Jazz drummer? Yes, Neil could make it. Album producer? Not so sure about
that. Anyone else feel that the non-drum instruments sound flat and
lifeless? This is supposed to be a jazz album, but the band sounds to formal
and rigid for jazz, even big band jazz (a good example: compare this album
with Si Zentner Alive in Las Vegas) Maybe this isn't Neil's fault, but isn't
a producer supposed to have a say in how the music sounds?

Comments, anyone?

Subject: Different Strings

	Since there were a couple posts about Different Strings in the last
couple issues, I thought this would be a good time to bring up a thought I had
a couple days ago while listening to it.
	All in all, I think it's a good song, especially Ged's bass stuff.  But
there's one part of the song that kinda ruins the mood of it for me:  the very
end, where Alex goes into a what-the-hell-is-he-thinking riff.  It's so
terrible, it totally ruins the mood and the feel of the song.  Here's this nice
solemn song going along, and along comes Alex with this total distorted junk
to round it all off.  I must say he really made a mistake by putting that noise
in this wonderful song.  No, I'm not an Alex hater; I just hate to see a good
thing go to waste.
	Anyone else notice this or feel the same way?

Hi,

To address the question in NMS 1046...I've heard of the rap song using some
of Tom Sawyer...

According to what I've heard it's called "Time 2 Make the Donuts".  Again, I
don't know for sure, but this is from what someone told me.  He told me it's
by a group of young black teenagers called "dead end kidz doin' lifetime
bidz"...

The person also told me that most Rush fans he shows like it.  He said also
that the liner notes of the album say that bits of "Tom Sawyer" were used by
permission, and special thanks go out to Rush.

Hope that helps...

From: pve@nml.norasia.com (Patrick Vella)

Greetings from Malta in the Mediterranean.
I think we're the first company to have an on-line Mosaic interface
to the Net.I immediately made a bee-line to the music section in the
hope of finding a rush user group. I'm very happy to have found one
although I must admit that I'm a fan of the older rush music.
I first listened to Moving Pictures at a friends house at a time
when I was searching for a good band , with good drumming and
provocative lyrics. What I found was a band with unsurpassed
drumming, thought-provoking lyrics and a style of music that was
to me new and interesting. I got hold of all the albums prior to
Moving Pictures including "Archives". (The first thing I did was
to ftp the lyrics of "RUSH" and "FLY BY NIGHT" which I did not have)
I consider the albums from RUSH all the way up to "Grace Under Pressure"
as some of the best rock albums ever produced.No offence, I just don't
relate very much to the newer albums of rush although tracks like
"Mystic Rhythms", "Available light" "Ghost of a chance" are superb.
I'm writing because I finally see in Counterparts a return to the RUSH
that I'm familiar to. A return to the centre if you like.

One point: There is talk of RUSH creating a live album this year.
I hope it's on the lines of "All The Worlds a stage" which in my
opinion is the only live album of rush. "exit" and "a show of hands"
are more like greatest hits albums.

I think it is unfair to the listner to take the best interpretation
of songs from three evenings and put these onto vinyl.The concept of
a live album in my opinion is to take a snap of a groups performing
ability at a moment in time, capturing all the atmosphere of the live
audience, all the comments etc.."All The Worlds' a Stage" is just that.
In it's simplicity, it is excellent. It is raw, and it is "there".

Just my opinion, sorry for taking so many lines.

I'll be around...

Subject: Rush on MTV

    The other day while on America Online I found an MTV section.  There was a
comments section called "Yell at MTV" where I immediately sent "PLAY MORE
RUSH!".   Later, after further thought, I don't really care if MTV plays Rush.

I don't even watch it anymore because I don't like rap.  I like Rush just the
way they are and have since 2112.  MTV can stick with their stupid game shows
and teen dramas.
    If you care about MTV but are not on AOL the email address is MtMTV@aol.com
and I found a VJ who is MTVbill@aol.com.  You can try to let MTV know they are
leaving out one of the most important bands of our time.

ORQ - All the lyrics to Grand Designs but mainly:

So much style without substance
So much stuff without style
It's hard to recognize the real thing
It comes along once in a while
Like a rare and precious metal beneath a ton of rock
It takes some time and trouble to separate from the stock
You sometimes have to listen to a lot of useless talk        -  You Know Who

I'm sure this question has been answered many times before, but anyway...
Where can I purchase the "Archives" tapes, and have they ever been made on CD?
I believe that I already knew that they aren't on CD, but I wanted to make
sure.  I have one of the tapes which i purchased from my friends girlfriend.
She has Archives, Vol II and won't sell it to me just to be a b---h and not
let me finalize my RUSH collection.  I've NEVER seen them sold in any store
around the MD (Baltimore) area.
Another item I always look for are ANY kind of poster with Rush....No record
stores have any, and I'm wondering if there's a way to get them through mail
order or what....
One more thing...I've only met 2 "true" female Rush fans in my existence who
I got to know well.  If they really exist, I'd love to hear from any of you
because I think they are scarce.  This is not a male/female ploy, only a
RUSH interest!

What are you, some snobby little kid who loves to lord who he knows over
everyone else?  You made some far fetched claims regarding the future of
Rush (I forget the specifics just now), claim it's from a high source
that knows the band.  And that's that?  We're supposed to take your
rumormongering serious just because you claim to know someone in the
Rush camp?  Give me a break.

I'm not going to spew some shit unless I can justify where I got it
from... you apparently can't.  Then when someone asks you where you get
your info, you pull an attitude, and get huffy.  Personally, I think
(and I suspect MANY NMSers think) you are talking out of your ass.

The Rush-mgr has established himself as a source of information.  If he
says he heard something through the grapevine, we tend to believe him
because 1) he's been pretty accurate in the past 2) we know a bit about
him.  You on the other hand pop up out of no where, make bizarre claims,
and refuse to back up your rumors, claiming some high placed source.
bah... put up or shut up!

Subject: Any RUSH collectors out there?

Hey!

Well, I guess I have to make the obligatory "This is my first post"
statement. Oh wait, I guess I just did! Anyway...

I am a big RUSH collector. By big, I mean I am fanatic about it, though I
don't have an extraordinarily big collection. Anyway, I would love to see
more posts about collectors' items, things people have, or things they have
seen, and where to get them. Personally, I'm always looking for good stuff.
Right now I'm looking for tour books from Permanent Waves and earlier. Lemme
know if any of you have seen them.

I also want to put the word out: lately there have been a number of auctions
for the ESL Japanese laserdisc. The bids have gone up to $50-$60. I saw an ad
in Goldmine for the disc for $47. The place is Laser Exchange. The # is (617)
231-8010. I haven't put my order in yet, 'cos I was hoping the se auctions
might offer a lower price... but they don't! Let me know if anyone's seen it
cheaper.

   [ Thanks for putting this in there, I've been meaning to get the info
     myself (it's where I saw the ad for ESL too!) but I keep forgetting
     to bring my Goldmine to work...                          : rush-mgr ]

That's all for now. If any of you have any cool vinyl/cd stuff, let me know.

Take care,

	Fellow Fans,

I saw the greatest bumper sticker in Seattle the other day.  It said
"Rush is a band."  Now I have never seen another one, and I thought it
kicked butt.  I have seen plenty for Rush Limbaugh, and I could care
less, I am hoping not to start a debate over that one, cause it's not for
the NMS.  Anyway I thought it was great.  I have also found what I
thought to be Rush fans.  I say yeah I listen to Rush, and they say
"cool, so do I!"  Then I say the band, and there like "who?"  Oh well.
eough said.

Rastaman talked aobut the hands in the Presto album. Personally I
immediately saw a different interpretation of the three hands. So here goes:

Considering the sense of humor that Rush shows on the stuff in the
sleeves for albums/CD/Tapes/etc., this came to mind:

		Closed Hand:		Rock
		Open Hand:		Paper
		Inverted Peace Sign: 	Scissors

Maybe this is a little too childish of an interpretation, but anythings
possible.

Hello, all!

Generally I do not provide information I cannot verify first-hand, but I
heard today that Rush is going on tour this summer.  I do not have actual
dates, however.  I heard this from a very reliable source who will be a
stage hand for the band throughout the tour, and her credibility was
substanitated by a very good friend of mine.

I will try to get more information, and I will post it here.  Does anyone
else have info that could verify this?

I hope this info is correct; I'd hate to mislead you.

Good day,
