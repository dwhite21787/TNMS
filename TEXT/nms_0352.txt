Ok, so I can't spel.  I've been chastised for misspelling "Supriya" and
"Pittsburgh", and I publicly apoplgise.  *sigh*  I get no respect.  :-)

If you want to get the tour dates we have so far (what SupriYa posted a
couple of weeks ago), they are now available via anonymous ftp at syrinx
in the file "rush/special/rtb.tour.dates".

For all you locals, as of 10:00 a.m. Thursday morning TicketBastard had
no information on the Cap. Ctr. show.

Last but definitely not least, Mario D'Alessio has made available a program
which creates TAB files.  See his post below (#2, I believe) for details.
I am making it available AS IS, with no warranty either written or implied
by myself.  If it hoses your machine, burn him at the stake, not me!  :-)
It's available in the directory "rush/tab/prog" in the files "tab.c" and 
"tab.example" via anonymous ftp.  If you have questions on how to get them,
send mail to the administrative address.  If you have questions about 
implementation, send mail to Mario.  Thanks Mario!

Speaking of how great seats can be gotten, On the last tour I was out
of town when the tix went on sale so I missed out that way.  I went
to the Capital Centre on the day of the show and got a single seat 8
rows up on Alex's side in line with the front edge of the stage!!
Needless to say, I was very happy with my luck.  If you end up with
lousy seats you might try this tactic if you don't mind not sitting
with your friends.

Subject: Bass Tab Creator

I don't know about everyone else, but I really enjoy the guitar and
bass tab files available to us. The only problem is that there aren't
enough of them. I know it's difficult to create tab using an editor
(unless you have an editor that can do everything or are a wiz at
creating macros), so I created the Bass Tab Creator!

The BTC is a C program that allows easy input of notes and does all the
dirty work of building the nice looking tab staffs. I specifically
wrote it to input bass tab published in magazines, so it allows the
entering of note durations and many items like slides and hammer-ons.
But it's also useful for simple stuff.

I wrote this program and am making it available because I am hoping
that more people will be willing to create tab for everyone to use. I
was able to create the complete bass tab for "Spirit of Radio" in less
than an hour (and that's because I took my time).

This version was written for bass tab and cannot handle chords, so I
don't think it would be very useful for guitar tab, but I will probably
publish (ooh, I like that word) a version that will (depending on
whether enough people ask for it).

I sent the program and the "Spirit of Radio" tab file to our Rush
manager so that it will be available for ftp (hopefully soon). If you
try this program, please feel free to send me a message telling me how
you like it and any suggestions you may have. Thank you.

PS: I have not had the time to create good documentation, but I
    think that with the sample "Spirit of Radio" file, you shouldn't
    have any problems. But let me know if you do. Thanks.

Subject: THE ART OF TICKETOLOGY !!!

Yo There.
Well, i'm here at work, a little bored and thought I would send out some
helpfull info on getting some good seats. The best methods I have found
are:

1) Camping out, only if there isn't a lottery system. Its usually pretty
good if you are first in line. My buddy got 3rd row that way. But get the
person at the machine to punch out tickets as soon as the time is due.
I was first in line but only got 25th row, guess there are a lot of
machines in Chicago. Oh, well thats why i'm seeing them 3 times on the
first leg at different locations.

2) Find someone who works for a ticket master outlet. (this is common
sense of course).

3) Lastly, but this way is most expensive. Go to ticket brokers (SCALPERS)
I didn't get a chance to buy tickets for the Vancouver, March 23, 1990
show last year so I paid $75 for 6th row centre. This method is really the
only guarantee of getting the best seats but obviously you pay for it.

4) oh, almost forgot, Knowing people who are DJs or concert promoters is
very helpful too. I got radio station box seats for the Yes tour that
way. Free beer, free popcorn! :)

thats about it for now. waiting for Oct. 31 !!!

It's a shame to hear that a Roll The Bones promo book wouldbe on sale for
20 bux! I called Atlantic Records in LA and they sent me one in two
days-Free-o-charge! I also called up again last week and gave them the
adress of a pen-pal of mine in W. Virginia. I said, "Uh, Hi. Yeah, I'm
with my school paper and I am going to do a review of Roll The Bones. I'm
wondering if you can send me a promo package?" The girl on the other line
goes, "Noooooo Problemo, Dood!"
It is hot though. It's got awesome pictures taken from the same photo
session as the ones in the inside of RTB, but they are NOT the same
photos. Also, it has "Row The Boats", the press release written by Neil.
Did I already mention all this in an earlier post?
One other thing I'd like to say is:
All you "Die Hard" rush fans who don't like Rush's last few albums? I
guess your not "Die Hard" after all are you?
"You Just Don't Get It"

Oh! Hey, you suckas can't hear or something? The ending to Red Lenses
goes like so:

 Hey! Who wrote that  &lt;?!

Any ways, hereit is:

I said I'm....Red Red
Think about what you said...
Think about it! Think-think Yeah!

So there!

Hi everyone,

To Jimmy, the person who is collecting a list of NMS subscribers going
to shows... I am going to the Milwaukee show, Nov. 10.  So put me down
on the list.  However, the reason I am posting is because you didn't
include your return mail address.  Mine is in my .sig, so if you still
need me to mail you, please let me know.

Also, I would really, really (ala kinko ;-) like to get some gifs and
DEFINITELY some sound files for a Sparc 1, but I cannot ftp to anywhere
except in this building.  Would some kind soul please email me something?
Thanks much!  See you at the show.

To the person who asked about Vital Signs, I've heard that too.

However, I always just assumed it was Geddy playing around with
the words. They kind of fall into a relaxed groove at the end of
the song, and I just figured it was improvisation.

I hope this sheds some light on the subject, and that it doesn't
turn into another "Red Lenses" oral nightmare!

&gt;     In response to the person who asked about the LIVE UNDER PRESSURE cd
&gt;boot, I've had it for a few months... Actually, its not any new material.
&gt;Its really just the GUP TOUR video on a cd, with an exception of a song or
&gt;two (Something for Nothing)...
&gt;
&gt;      On that note, has anyone spotted "RUSH - En Vogue" cd boot? No luck
&gt;for me in NYC on that. Anywaz...
&gt;
&gt;George Papadopoulos

I just picked up the ``_Life_ Under Pressure'' boot (and must say I really
like it!). It does seem very similar to the GUP video, but the CD says
that it was recorded in Pittsbur[g]h while the video claims to have been
recorded in Toronto. Would you care to clarify? I have difficulty seeing
how it could be the video soundtrack (which is what I take it that
you're saying the CD is) and have more tunes that the video, unless the
recording was an inside-job ripoff or something...

I have seen and will soon buy (I hope) the ..En Vogue CD here in Boston,
despite the fact that it has basically the same tunes as LUP!

&gt;Subject: Vital Signs mistake
&gt;...has anyone else noticed in Vital Signs:
&gt;
&gt;	Everybody got the EVELATE from the norm....
&gt;
&gt;What is the deal...it is very clear.  Is it just a screw up, is it on
&gt;purpose....Is there a word 'EVELATE' I couldn't find it anywhere.  Even
&gt;on some of the live stuff, Geddy appears to say EVELATE...
&gt;This has been bothering me for some time, so any comments would be
&gt;greatly appreciated....
&gt;			Kickin' some gluteus max,
&gt;					John Santore

This is one of my fav bits of Rush weirdness (check out the version
of Vital Signs in the Chicago Amphitheatre boot ('81) some time!!).
It's on purpose. Actually this sort of thing occurs elsewhere too.
In ``Red Lenses'', for example, Geddy sings ``thinking about the
overfed/the underread'' in the fade-out. What he's doing is just
playing with words -- in ``RL'' the way he does it means something
because he's playing with entire words, in ``VS'' it seems to make
no sense because he's playing with syllables. `Evalate' is just
`Elevate' with `va' and `le' (sounded) permuted. The way this has
meaning is that the song is (in part) about mental dysfunction.

Subject: Rose colored glasses and a New question

 Geddy and "Red Lenses":

 I was interested because someone else mentioned it a long time ago. Nobody
replied. I thought I would bring it up again, just to get people's opinions. I
certainly expected some different interpretations, as sound systems vary rather
widely. And expecting something CAN alter what you hear - but what I heard was
*awfully* close to what I *didn't* expect. Nothing that anyone has added has
really persuaded me to change my opinion - either it's incorrectly based, or
you missed the intended phrase entirely. I certainly welcome any other
opinions, though - as long as you're not nasty about it. A surprising number
of people (you know who &gt;&gt;you&lt;&lt; are) have been unpleasant, with a bit of
don't-forget-this-idiot's-address thrown in. Thanks. A lot. Really.

 Rush and Profanity:

 Unfortunately, someone said it was inconceivable for any of the 3 to use
profanity in a published format. I think you should check some of the
interviews available from FTP. I remember *several* in which the boys throw out
(rather unashamedly) a big four letter word or two. Sure they're professional,
but probably not as 'clean' as a lot think - myself included, until I read
those articles. So much for common sense.

 A new question, hopefully worded unthreateningly:

 Why is it that the replacement for 'baby' in "In the Mood" changes from show
to show? I don't have any facts here, but I have always thought that a good
explanation would be the first names of their wives. I think I've heard Ellie?
and Cookie? in different performances, and it seems reasonable. Does anyone
know if the two correlate? The question itself is one gushing disclaimer, so
try to be civil...

Neil did a talk on all the tracks of Grace Under Pressure when it came out. I
don't remember who it was interviewing and if it was local or national (I lived
in North Eastern Wisconson at the time).

But if you look at the lyrics, and look at some of e.e. cummings stuff. You
will see what he was trying to do. And as a matter of fact that is exactly what
he said he was after. And as well all know, e.e. cummings is probably more
famous for his non-capitalization than he is for his poetry.

	I must say that I was quite intrigued with Geddy wanting "everyone
to suck his dick", so I decided to give Red Lenses a very CAREFUL listen
for myself. I have concluded that he is saying "Everyone's inside my head",
which is more a less a line from earlier in the song. Besides, we all KNOW
that Geddy would NEVER say anything like "suck my dick", now would he???

I think whoever thought up the dick thing is really perverted... :-) :-) :-)
