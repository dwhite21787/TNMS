Subject: Last song on the album

One the last song on the album thread, it is certainly true that 
Available Light is a magnificent last track, and I do not think it 
has been bettered since.  Vital Signs was good at the time, because 
you knew that the band were sending us a message - prepare for change 
  at the time, though it seems less strong now (it comes over much 
better on the live versions I have heard).  But, after all these 
years (still crazy) I just adore In the End: lyrically it is a bt of 
a throwback to the first album, but taken together it still has the 
power to blow me away, and as for the version on All the World's A 
stage...
Pj wondered aloud about tracks we do not like - I think there are 
plenty.  In fact, I think that there is probably one track per album 
that I really switch off during - it all begins with Rivendell - did 
not like it in 1975 when I first heard it, and I like it even less 
now.  The lyrics are treacle.  Tai Shan has the same problem, and it 
may be the thematic similarity which linking these two which lies at 
theheart of the problem.  For what it's worth, the expanded capacity 
of the cd has led to too much material getting included.
Also, the 2112/1812 link is really tenuous.
Okay, torch me.

   Yeah; I hear it too.  I would have written in on it except this is
the station that last year described "Merry Axemas" as an "Alex Lifeson
solo album"!!!!!
     I listen to the station whenever I drive, and I sure they don't try
to confuse people, they do!!  A great station for Rush, mostly old
stuff, but some off RTB, but as for news, if they announce it, bet
against it!!!

Subject: Rush Movie (re: to MazScape <MazScape@aol.com>)

I'm a movie fan, and a Rush fan.  My movie tastes are eccentric for my
lower-income level budget, to say the very least, but look at these movies:
'Dune', 'Excalibur', 'Heavy Metal', the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy (and no,
I never did drugs)...  but I think Rush could do it.  Advertisers could play
on the SCTV Bob and Doug Mackenzy thing, the 'better beer' thing, with
lots of promos with heavy emphasis on both... might not do justice to 'the band'
itself, but could deal a heavy blow as a rockumentary.  At least better
than 'This is Spinal Tap' or 'Rutles'.  Rock fans, and especially Rush fans,
have yet to have their final say at the box office, but with THX and Dolby
sound in most good theatres our presence is felt.  Plus, Rush is a heavy
metal band--a type of group that lends itself to the [emphasis here] feeling
of its' audience.  My experience with Rush goes heavy on feeling, too.  I also
(see "Martin Gibbs" <glyndwr@hotmail.com> & Harper@magiclink.com: subj:
'Driving to Rush' in TNMS #2025) drive to them (now delivering pizza--no tick-
ets yet), especially to 'Red Barchetta', AND 'Red Sector A'.  It's DRIVING 
music.
My point is that Rush could make a good movie. It may not top the charts--
but it might, if response by fans was good enough.  If 'Dune' was good--
and it was--and lost SO much money (millions), then why not get a Bill Gates
or Hillary Clinton (now I AM nuts) to go the dough.  No--really, if the
experience of Rush was caught on film--just think... DVD--an excellent medium
for capturing live and prerecorded media, including several variable camera
angles, from what I've seen; THX--a wonderful sound for surround sound
from Lucas; and all our maze of software... My mind reels (one moment please...)
I know Geddy is good in the studio.  Maybe he could consult on some
level of a computer program (promo for the movie) team using Silicon Graph-
ics computers like those Spielberg used for his movies.  I wouldn't put it past
Neil's level of mental skill to even lead a team of programmers for a digital
promo of a movie. This is getting long, I realize... but so was 'MazScape's
'semiflame'.  There's no need for such a downer when the music is so good.

Ugh, after what Kubrick did to "The Shining"?  Of course he wouldn't
be as bad as Oliver Stone... ah yes, I can see it:  "The Rush
Conspiricy":

"The band gathered in a dark deserted warehouse... Alex picked up the
phone... it was dead...  dark sedans were drawing up outside...
moonlight glinted off the scopes of high-powered rifles... could it be
the end of Rush...?!"

Of course, if Spielberg directed, we'd get "2112 the Movie".  But
which one of the Boyz gets sacrificed under the waterfall? And who
gets to play the Elders?

If it was James Cameron, we'd have a mad-machine world with an android
running around lost and panicked, a sinking ship, and adultery (if you
haven't heard, he left Linda Hamilton for one of the actresses in
"Titanic").  Naahhh...

How about we stick with just finding actors that LOOK like the Boyz? 
Never mind the director, and the thought of a producer scares the shit
out of me...

I don't think Neil intended this, but I like to think that the Rocinante
might have been an intelligent ship, equipped with a neural network and
possessing some sort of consciousness. In this case she would be worthy of
inclusion in the term "we", and there would be no need for any other crew to
be involved. What she would think about being flown into a black hole to
certain destruction is another question. "1001001 SOS", she would probably
cry. :-)

On the subject of black holes, I was watching an episode of Blake's Seven on
UK Gold last Sunday, when they mentioned the black hole of Cygnus XL (sic).
Do you think someone misread a script, is the name just a coincidence or is
there really a Cygnus XL as well? Astronomers please tell us.

Anyone else like Blake's Seven?

the "Rocinante" herself is the other part of the "we", since in the

He's been double or multi-tracking on EVERY album, it's a standard thing
in recording.
On stage, he cranks up more distortion, and some combination of a delay,
flanger, or chorus.  Standard Al sound.  Not that hard to do.  Sounds
different, but still vey thick.

Mark Racop at Magichouse Productions made a full length (admittedly
comedy) for $20,000.  (Rock n' Roll Starship) He's a major Rush fan, as
is his composer, Chiuck Budreau, who guested as "Commander Rush." 
There's references to setting course to Red Sector A, 2112, and an
article in "Playdroid" about "1001001:  what it means to you."  I think
he'd be interested in doing it, if he could get financing.

As far as filming concert scenes--get filming rights from ANY concert,
film crowd footage, fake the stage shots in a school gym, overdub the
sound.  That's easy.  Or find a small band using a main hall and pay
them a grand to set up for a couple of hours each day.

Subject: Riverfront Coliseum -- The Real Story

I agree it is important to set the record straight  where it concerns
Riverfront Coliseum and people being "trampled to death" or a "stamped"
occurring when The Who appeared there.  Unfortunately, more incorrect
information was posted to TNMS.  Out of respect to those that died and
concert goers everywhere, please allow me to present the facts.

It was a "festival seating" or "general admission" show.  For those that
don’t recall, since they do not occur at most venues now, it means first
in line gets in first, thus can get the best seats.  Fans would show up
early to be first in line.  Security at the venue allowed people to pack
against the doors.  Now days gates are usually set up before the doors
into a concert hall to prevent people from jamming up in front of the
doors.

As the crowd grew, the pressure on people waiting in front of the doors
grew.  Security only opened a few doors and was very slow in letting
people into the coliseum.  The pressure on people in front was so great
that they could not breathe.  They died of suffocation while STANDING in
the crowed waiting to get in.  No one was trampled and there was no
stamped.

That was the beginning of the end for most general admission concerts
and hopefully security personnel are more aware of how this phenomenon
can happened and monitor crowds to make sure it does not happen. That’s
how the gates or crowd control barriers in front of doors help.  Crowds
line up at that point and there is space in front of the doors to act as
a safety valve.

Rolling Stone had a very good article many years ago explaining just
what happened on that horrific day.  You might be able to find it on the
Internet in an archive somewhere and the Library of Congress has a copy
of that issue if you ever what to check it out while in Washington.

Subject: re:  the "we" of Hemispheres

Dear fellow Rushians,

OK, I think most of you went WAY over the top in order to figure out 
who the "we" refers to.  Now, I prefer the simple explanation for in   
all things, the simplest explanation tends to be the truest and nature 
does nothing in vain (cf. William of Occam and Isaac Newton).  Although 
the idea proposed of "we" referring to the separation of rocinante into 
left and right modes of thinking was rather an intersting analytical 
look, I urge those of you thinking about this subject to listen to 
Hemispheres and sing along and then consciously replace the first person 
singular for the first person plural.  My findings?  It simply doesn't 
work.  I could go into a lenghty linguistic reasoning as to why, but 
here's the 911.  The vowel-consonant parings of "we" and "I" and of 
"our" and "my" are smoother in the first person plural and lend 
themselves better to strong consonantal words like "course" and "set." 
But, IMHO, maybe Neil just likes to write in a royal we fashion.  We 
know, I mean, I know that I do it sometimes.  Just a few thoughts!

Later!

polished it's because the boys had just gotten *better* at playing live.

Least favorite studio album (sound/engineering) : Presto, TFE
	why: For Presto, no explanation needed, eh? TFE is
muddy-sounding; not enough depth.

IMHO, sonically, Presto is one of the best.

Most favorite studio album (sound/engineering): Counterparts, of course,
then MP

Of course?

These opinions are solely the responsibility of the author and are not to
be construed as giving a shit. 

Oh.  Nevermind.

With no first-hand knowledge, I have always associated "Superconductor" with
former President Reagan who had a superconductor project (not sure if ever

Subject: Brigdge of Death

Since there's a lot of talk about Hemispheres, I thought I'd add 
something here, though I've been a silent subscriber for about 4 years 
now.  I notice very clearly that when Geddy sings, "and the Bridge of 
Death was crossed..." it comes out like so:  "and the Brigdge of Death 
was crossed..." as if there was a typo originally.  I think it's a very 
subtle joke.  I don't know if anyone else got that though, especially 
since a lot of people were hearing some very delusional things in Camera 
Eye on this post a few years back, when it was seemingly obvious to me 
that during the busy street part at the beginning, an old man says, 
"Fresh fruit!" and then later during the Westminster part, the voices 
are "'Ello!  Mornin', Gov!" and sounded like Micahel Palin... Oh well, 
whatever.

Has anyone else noticed the talking/mumbling at the end of Tai Shan too?  
It's very hard to make out, but it's there!  I think it was a mistake.  
I don't have the remaster yet of HYF though, maybe they corrected it?  

I also have several "imports" I can copy on CD-R to trade for others.  
I'm looking for either Mirrors or Russian Roulette '92 (or anything 
else) like Cygnus for several others.  Just e-mail your trade list to 
mikecronis@hotmail.com  Thanks ALL!

Oh, one last thing.  I'm stuck here in Misawa, Japan in the AF and I'm 
trying to form a Rush cover band.  I am pretty decent at guitar and can 
play just about all Alex's riffs (except that dreaded Analog Kid solo!  
Damn it!)  and was wondering if anyone could either hook up with me here 
or suggest DigiTech RP12 settings for various albums.  
All praise the rush.mgr in excellsior!  Thanks easter bunny!  Bok BOK!

I've been reading some posts on the least favorite Rush album(s) or song(s)
and it really 
got me thinking..
See I have alot of non Rush fans who always ask me "If I were to buy a Rush
disc, what would
it be?" I always tell them either Retrospective 1-2 or Chronicles, that way
they can get a pretty good
picture of what Rush is all about.But I have never been asked what my least
favorite is...
THIS IS VERY TOUGH!!!!!
When I think of what my favorite studio release is I guess it all depends
on what mood I'm in..
For the most part I would say Moving Pictures, '2112', Roll the Bones,
Grace Under Pressure, but
even that can change because I'll get into a COS, HYF, PeW, PW mood or
whatever...
Least Favorite: Counterparts...Why????....Just because.....
I guess when it comes to Rush I am very wishy washy when it comes to
favorites or
least favorites.........I LOVE THIS BAND..........

Jason,

where they were saying that the solo in "Stick It Out" was very Hendrixy. He
said that it was the other memebers of the band told him to leave that solo
in. They were the ones who reminded him that they were a guitar driven rock n

Subject: Re: Neil and Phil Collins

I'd have to think Neil has paid some attention to Phil Collins,
especially during the early 70's. He was a great drummer back then,
before Gabriel left Genesis and he became a front man. Phil also had a
side project during that time frame called Brand X that taxed his
drumming abilities even more than Genesis. There are spots here and
there in some of Neil's playing that you can hear "influenced riffs",
but I don't think Neil has ever ripped a lick from anyone. He's always
embelished, and re-created to make a riff his own. On the other hand, I
can't count the number of drummers who've ripped Neil's stuff off.
What's the saying, "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery". I
think Neil's been flattered enough for several lifetimes ;-)

John

Subject: Live album & remasters

Hello All,
     On my way home this evening, I had a vision. The title of the new live
album!
As you probably know, the live album titles tend to have a performance
theme...
ATWAS - On stage
E...SL - End of the set
ASOH - The roar of the crowd
AND NOW THE NEW ALBUM 
CURTAIN CALL - Back for an encore
Hey, it sounds good to me!
     Now, as far as the remasters are concerned, I always thought that the
RUSH catalouge always had superior sound, but there are a few albums that NOW
sound INCREDABLE!!!
COS - Much richer sound overall, and the annoying distant half second cymbal
sound during Necromancer has been removed (during the second part of Under The
Shadow)
SIGNALS - A TRUE remaster! Much better sound, less mids, more highs!
GUP - Just the reverse, less highs, more mids, and the bass slapping in the
middle of Red Lenses (right before "and the mercury is rising") doesn't sound
like a skip in the record anymore! 
HYF - Same as Signals

     Well, that should do it for now. Thanks for reading my BS!
 Keith (WHO6489@aol.com) Hoping Natural Science, Analog Kid, and Bravado with
the "improved" ending will be on "Curtian Call" NYUK, NYUK, NYUK

OK, how about this one?  Maybe a bit narrow, but appropriate I think.

Post relatively brief descriptions of your first beginning-to-end listening
experience of 2112, side 1.  I know I can't be alone in having a
recollection of listening to the music & reading the lyrics and story on
the inside of one of my first double-albums, and basically being blown away
by such quality music and concept.

Perhaps our kind & benevolent rush-mgr could post complete lyrics & story
notes from the original release for those few NMS'ers cursed with only the
early CD release that included neither - just so we're all on the same
page.

Subsequently, issue #2112 would be comprised entirely of 2112 content, from
people who know best... all us sick bastards who, drawn further into the
twisted web of Rush by this album, are now subconsciuosly forced to use
2112 as PIN numbers & access codes....

Whadyathink?

Subject: WHAT WE SHOULD DO FOR ISSUE 2112!

Here are my thoughts:  We should compile a list of questions we'd most like
answered by the band and vote on 25 or 50 of them, or whatever is an
acceptable number.  Then, we should submit them to the band and the reponses
should constitute #2112.  

Someone should speak to SRO or Anthem or whoever handles this stuff and
prearrange this.  And if this were to be turned down by Geddy, Alex, and Neil,
then they really suck!  During an off period, I find it hard to believe that 1
of them wouldn't submit to answering some questions from several thousand of
their biggest and most loyal fans for the 2,112th issue of a Rush digest.  As
a 1 time thing, if they couldn't dictate 25 or 50 answers at their leisure,
something is seriously wrong with their priorites.  What would it take, a half
hour?  Many bigger music groups than Rush  post to their newsgroups, bulletin
boards, and web sites.  Rush fans don't ask for very much from them, and have
been so loyal during all the off periods over the past few years.  This would
be a nice way to give something back to several thousand of the biggest fans
at once.

The questions could be on any topic from set list considerations, to their
future, to why they don't improvise at all during their shows, to what's
playing in their CD players now!  And we wouldn't have to deal with "what is
said during the censored part of La Villa?"

What do you guys think?

Just a weird Rush sighting..
I was watching the Milwaukee Brewers get spanked by the San Diego Padres
(bummer), but if you ever see the Brewers play you'll notice that every time 
a Brewer comes up to bat over the loud speaker they play the beginning of a 
song.  When Jeromy Burnitz came up to bat they would play either the beginning
part of
"The Spirit Of Radio", or "Anagram"
Oh Well....I thought it was kinda cool.....       (he must be a Rush fan.....
go Brewers)

Gary has reminded me of a post I've been meaning to make since LAST summer, 
so here goes:
I work the audio board for the local minor lge baseball team (Tulsa Drillers 
AA Texas League) and as such have an opportunity that many on tnms would die 
to have: I can force-feed Rush to 2-10,000 people a night.
I'm playing at least 1 rush song every game this year.
The most played list consists mainly newer stuff
leave that thing alone, cut to the chase, dreamline, the big wheel
I've played spirit of radio, tom sawyer, freewill, anthem, limelight, the 
camera eye, subdivisions, countdown, grand designs - so many that I can't 
remember all that i've played.
BUT
playing music at a ballpark isn't all fun and games, and it definitely can't 
be wall to wall Rush no matter how much I'd like to do like the guy at Maple 
Leaf Garden does during hockey intermissions - just pop Moving Pictures on.
The earlier stuff has too much guitar - too heavy a sound overall.
The thread is - What would you play if you were me??
What Rush have you heard at arenas/sporting events??
Post 'em or email me privately.
even though this is self-serving, i think it's a better thread than fav 
non-rush and secsoc.
no long intros or you have to edit it.
and remember: this is the GENERAL PUBLIC! they don't like good music! they 
like to listen to Gary Glitter over and over and over and over...
and dance club crap
but I try to educate them a bit
and I've been hoping for a tnmser from around Tulsa to post: "I went to the 
Drillers game last night and they played RUSH!"

  I have been a fan since the Moving pictures album came out in 1981 and 
over the years have managed to catch Rush live on 12 different occasions. 
Despite my good fortune there is still several songs that I wish I could 
see played live. Some of the songs are from older material and so the odds 
get worse with each passing tour that I will ever get to see these songs 
played live. Anyways I thought I would offer my list of the top ten songs I 
would like to see played live and then ask anyone else who would like to 
post with their list.

Here is my top ten in no particular order:

1. Working Man
2. A Pasage to Bangkok
3. La Villa Stangiato
4. Cut to the Chase
5. Presto
6. Available Light
7. By Tor and the Snow Dog

Subject: A True Vintage Rush Sighting (aka Close Encounter)

A buddy of mine recently relayed the following Rush sighting to me.  It's
more of a close encounter, really.  So, from John in Michigan, enjoy:

"Well, the story starts out when I was a student at Central Michigan
University. I was working for the program board ( the student activities
commitee resposible for booking concerts). The show was supposed to be
ZZ Top and The Baker-Gurvitz Army (with Ginger Baker), but they had
pulled out of the tour. I went to the arena expecting this combination,
with 5 other guys to do stage set-up. Then we found out Baker wasn't
coming. ZZ Top was a trip (...and a whole other story), but no one
seemed to know who was opening...until they walked through the back
door.
	I thought Neil was about 7 ft tall! He walked in with Ian Grandy and
Howard Ungerleider, followed shortly by Alex and Geddy. ZZ Top must have
soundchecked for at least an hour, and during that time I got to know
Ian, Howard and Liam Birt. They were setting up Neil's kit on a piece of
plywood and anchoring it, so they could just lift the whole thing up and
move it as one piece. I got to know them rather well that afternoon.
	After a while Alex and Geddy came back in and we all talked about
everything from the weather, to the NHL, to their new album "Fly By
Night". When it got down to showtime, I was standing offstage (...next
to Geddy) when the opening riff of "Finding My Way" started blasting. I
had seen them play before, but never with Neil. Then I got tapped on the
shoulder by ZZ Top's crew chief, who told me they needed me to drive
them to the hotel. I was bummed.
	I didn't get back until after Rush had finished their set, but Ian told
me they would be back at a club a month later. I helped them load their
truck, and then sat behind Frank Beard for ZZ Top's set (...their road
manager was really nice, and he knew I really wanted to see Rush, so he
tried to make it up by giving me that seat).
	A month goes by, and Rush comes back to town. My roomate and I went
down early so we could help them unload and set up. We got there about
the same time their truck did, and Ian was really happy to see us ( he
was the only one there at the time). We started to unload their gear,
and the other guys showed up. There was no PA set up in the club, so
that was the first question everyone was asking. The club owner totally
blew-off Rush's rider contract, and the PA specifications. He had some
local band coming in to be the opening act, and they were bringing their
PA. Ian and Howard blew a fuse. Alex, Geddy and Neil just shook their
heads and laughed. The other band finally showed up with stuff that was
not even close to what they needed, so we packed them back up. Needless
to say, they didn't play.
	Fast forward another 8 months to the Brewrey, in East Lansing. They
were just starting to tour for "Caress of Steel". I went over early in
the afternoon and hung out with Ian and the crew. We had everything set
up, and I was just hanging out by the stage. Geddy came in and walked
over to me, shook hands with me and said "Nice to see ya John, maybe
this time you'll see us play, eh?" I couldn't believe he remembered me,
let alone my name. That was the first night I actually saw Neil play a
whole set. Later, after the show, a couple of the guys I was playing
with and I hung out with the guys in their (so-called) dressing room
(...it was more like a large closet). Two of the guys I was with ended
up playing with me in Armada, many years later.
	I had one other opportunity to work with them, at the IMA Arena in
Flint, MI. That was the "2112" tour. I was actually sitting in the
audience, and saw Ian at the soundboard after the first act. I yelled at
him, he called me a "hood" (...I was wearing a black leather jacket at
the time) and motioned for me to come down. I stayed at the board for
the show, and then helped them load up (...if you can believe it, Rare
Earth was the headliner). I saw Ian several other times at various shows
(...I've seen them about 20 times) throughout the 70's and 80's.
	These guys were the only "rock stars" that acted like regular guys, and
treated people like they should be treated. I worked for many people
during the 70's, and Rush is the only band that I look back at the
experience fondly. Their crew was great, it was just a lot of fun. I'll
never forget Geddy remembering me after 8 months, that was just unreal
(I'm sure Ian probably told him who I was, but I just refuse to remember
it that way ;-) This way is cooler!).
	Anyway, that's my Rush story. Consider yourself indulged ;-)"
