Just a couple of announcements to make here today.

First of all, the address I gave out for the Pink Floyd mailing list
was incorrect.  Apparently that address is no longer valid, and support
for the list is now carried by a user at another site.  There is a post
in today's digest which gives the correct address (thanks!).  Does any-
body know if the 'semi-official list-of-mailing-lists' has been updated
with this yet?  My copy seems to be getting out of date.

Secondly, as I shall be spending the entirety of next week in (hopefully)
sunny southern California, I can make no guarantees on the frequency of
mailings during this time.  I have access here from S.D. thanks to the 
well-connected Jimmy L., so will probably be able to get in here a couple
of times, but no assurances.  There's always the possibility that Jimmy
might do a couple of issues, if I can talk him into it (so I can go site-
seeing :-).  Its up in the air at this point.

That's all for now; I'll try to get one more NMS out this week before I
take off.  Ciao!

Subject: Wow! and a Moving Pictures question...

First thing, I hope this is going to the right place!  This is a bit confusing.

I mean, I knew there were RUSH fans, and I thought I was one of them,
but whoa!  Heavy duty stuff here dudes, I am heavily impressed.  On one
note, I could not *imagine* owning an autographed CD!  Aaaaaa!

Anyway, the question.  I have looked everywhere here (and the avaliable
book collections of the city of Pittsburgh, including The Carnegie and
the University of Pittsburgh is not something to be scoffed at),
including every refernce concerning short stories (that would not be
published and be able to be found as a volume) to find "A Nice Morning
Drive" by Richard S. Foster.  You know, the story on which Red Barchetta
is based.  So I turn to you awesome RUSH fans for an answer.  Help?

As far as getting the images from paper to shirt is concerned, I have
no problem with that (we have the technology...). I'm more worried
about cost--generally, ya gotta have all the money up front on these
things, and it's the paperwork involved there that has me concerned.

But I'll be glad to do the art side of things if someone local to here
could work with me on the money side.

I doubt that Rush will win the award on the grounds that
THE SPIRIT OF RADIO kind of takes the proverbial out of
this kind of thing.

Especially if theres any glittering prizes involved !!!

Does anybody know where I can get the compilation 'RUSH THROUGH TIME'
It has now been deleted in the UK and is therefore impossible to get hold of

[ It used to pop up in regular record stores until the early to mid-80's.
  I haven't seen it at any place but a record show for a good five years
  or more.                                                    :rush-mgr ]

&gt; 	Monday night, the show began at 12:45 a.m. and ended at 3:30a.m.
&gt; The official story was "equipment problems". I decided that this might be
&gt; possible, and reserved judgement for the second show (no, I didn't go---
&gt; I saw the REAL Aerosmith in 1975---Don't need third rate wannabes).
&gt; 	Tuesday night, the show began at 11:45.  THANX FOR THE BIG
&gt; IMPROVEMENT GUYS!!!

G-n-R pulled the same thing here in Worcestor... there was a 3 hour
intermission after Soundgarden got off stage, what a joke... Luckily,
I didn't go.... And after I heard all the local radio stations trash
the band's performance, I felt much better about not making myself
poorer by buying the tix...

&gt; 	I have seen Rush at least once a tour since 1978. They have never
&gt; pulled this kind of crap.  Anyway, I just wanted to pass this along as a

When I saw Rush in Worcestor, they were on stage about 30 minutes
after Vinnie Moore got off stage... _THAT'S_ fast!  and to top it off,
the two hour performance is the best I've ever seen from anyone, even Rush!

&gt; refund if you want to leave. You see, they don't care about 25,000 people
&gt; that paid 25.00 each to see them, so what makes you think that you will be
&gt; different?

Here's my only gripe about the Rush concert....  Why are the t-shirts
of such poor quality, but high price? My Extra-Large shirt shrunk down
to a large and became mis-formed...  I mean, the shirt looks nice, but
I expected much better quality....

Subject: Lakeside Location

	Last summer I drove to Toronto from Baltimore with a friend
of mine hoping to find Lakeside Park and just see the city. Using our
copy of Visions and the clues from the tapes, we found it to be in
St. Catherine's. Although there was no sign (we didn't really look),
the park did contain several of the clues. It had a long peir out
onto the lake and a lighthouse at the end of the beach. The beach was
about 500 yard long and about 100 feet wide with two places that has
obviously been used for fires. Their was also a large grassy area
(suitable for people to sit and watch fireworks) that contained a
large picnic pavillion and an old-looking merry-go-round (5 cents per
ride) that was temporarily closed.

	Previous letters to TMS indicated that the park was closer to
Toronto and that a sign posted (Oakville). I think that Lakeside
Parks are as common up there as 'main streets' are all over the
world. Every community on the lake has a park. The park we found was
at the end Lakeshore Drive (I think).
	While up there, we also found the house that Alex grew up in
and the jr. high school they went to.

	I saw the band play in Illonois on Nov.9 and was able to meet
Alex at his hotel before the soundcheck. He was cool and I got to
shake his hand. Brush with greatness? You bet.

Hello all I just dethawed (it's all of 6 degrees in the Burgh today) so please
excuse any typos that may occur.  I have noticed that people on this list like
to point out peculiar little mistakes or irregularities on Rush paraphanalia.
For example, the tour shirts say "A fact's a fact from Rome to Nome" instead of
Nome to Rome, Xanadu is spelled "Zanadu" on ESL, etc. etc. etc.  Well here is
my latest discovery.  On the last page of the tourbook where it lists the album
covers and songs on the albums, there is a song on Presto untitled Anagram
(for MAngo).  OOPS!!!  Just a little piece of meaningless trivia.

Subject: those damn Grammies

To DougO....

	I could care less if Slaughter plays a different style of music than
Slayer, I did not list these groups as "cookie cutter" (all the same)
They are what the public wants to see. I like Guns n' Roses too, I think
they have done something to rock n' roll. I don't want to know about
Slayer, or Megadeth, or that cheesy Glam-rock. I give all music a
chance, but the simple fact is that music today is, and I'm gonna use
that stupid cliche, "It's not what you know, It's who you know" If a
band happens to stumble upon a good producer, cover artist and makeup
and fashion crew, they make it on MTV and all the wasted youth of
America sit at home and listen to trash coming out of mondo effect
driven guitars. That's not music, or what I, myself as a musician for 12
years considers to be music. I don't think many subscribers here
consider it to be music either. In ten years in anyone goingo to
remember Poison .... maybe you.... is anyone going to remember
Slaughter.... nahhh.... is anyone going to remember Trixter.... nahhh. I
put it to you, DougO, I have seen a band that I have enjoyed since it's
inception in the early seventies beat the system and withstand all the
politics-of-rock-n-roll bullshit for over 15 years. Not many bands can
say that. And practically every band that MTV throws in our faces today
most likely will not be able to say that. Now, I know that taste in
music is all opinion, but there are some facts to be aware of. I don't
think Rush would win at the Grammies even if they deserved to. The
Grammies are put on TV for one reason... to stimulate the public and get
ratings the news is on for 1 reason... to get ratings.... it's all
bullshit. Having Geddy Lee accept the award via satellite... nobody in
the general public wants to see that... People want MTV and Top 40, Rap,
and those bands that I mentioned earlier. As far as I am concerned, they
can have them....

    Just a few things to get off my chest.

    Forget the grammies. I agree with a previous poster. A grammy for
    Rush is not an honor IMO. However, I heard a rumour that Peter
    Buck is supposed to jam with Nirvana on the show. That would be
    interesting.

    The shirt idea is a good one. I'd buy it. Unfortunately I have no
    artistic skills to donate.

    **** end of Rush content ****

    Any of you Marillion fans out there want to send me  a list of
    your favourite albums, in order.

    Anyone gone to see Van Halen? What's your opinion? Please reply to
    me directly, don't clutter the NMS.

&gt; Maybe the best way to do this would be for anyone with ideas to send them
&gt; to me, and I can come up with a design and send it to everyone who sent
&gt; ideas (in EPS or PICT or GIF format or something...let me know). What do
&gt; you think, Mr. Rush-Mgr?
&gt; [ I like the idea, for what that's worth.  Do we have people out there who
&gt;   can get an image from paper onto a t-shirt?  Can you, Cheryl?  Are you
&gt;   willing to coordinate this?  Hmm, kind of like the "Net-Head" shirts from
&gt;   GDead shows...                                                 :rush-mgr ]

	I've done consignment work for a local t-shirt-printing
	company here for years, which has included following shirts
	from the beginning to end of production dozens of times.  I've
	done the artwork for plenty of the projects, and though I'm no
	Michelangelo, I understand the process of going from paper-to-
	shirt quite well.

	While I've never truly found ANYONE who can match the
	combination of quality and price that this local place can
	provide, I can at least also offer knowledge of what goes
	into the clothing printing process just out of sheer good
	will :-)

	So, Cheryl -- and anyone else who may be interested -- if
	this this project becomes any more substantial, please drop
	me an email message.  At worst, I can keep you from getting
	a bad deal from someone else...at best, we can do business
