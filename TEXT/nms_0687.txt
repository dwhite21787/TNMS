Hello Rush followers,

Since everybody is writing on how they started liking Rush, I'll put mine in.
I had really only heard the "accessible" hits (i.e. Tom Sawyer, TSOR,
etc...) but a friend of mind suggested that I join a computer e-mail Rush
digest called none other then "The National Midnight Star".  So I subscribed
and my interest in Rush increased exponentially!  So I have all of you to
thank for getting me addicted to Rush!

Hey,
I saw the post in yesterday's NMS about weather report. GET SOME. Heavy
Weather is the album. The have some of the coolest songs I've ever heard
on that album, esp Birdland. This is a tribute to Charlie Parker, one of
the best sax players ever. And, no they are not still around. As any
bassist can tell you Jaco died. Well, not much else to say. Just get some
weather report. You won't be disappointed.

Subject: RTB rap, etc.

Before the subject gets weary and everyone gets annoyed, I have two
questions about RTB.  Please forgive me if they've been asked before...

1) I don't pay as much attention to the pictures and stuff inside the CD
   booklets (and album liners) as some people do, so I just noticed this.
   What's the deal with the elephant's ass on the first page of the RTB CD
   booklet?  Is this the "gluteus max" to be kicked?

2) I still don't like the rap (yes it's a rap, not a "spoken section" - a
   "rose" by any other name still stinks).  But why didn't they print the
   lyrics?  The reason I'm curious is, do they read "better run homeboy" or
  "better run home boy"?  It makes a difference you know ;-)  If it IS
  "home boy" it lends something to the whole argument that they may have been
   more interested in poking fun than in exploring the current "music"al style.
   Also, I agree with the idea that the voice distortion is poking fun too.
   Not printing the lyrics could be all part of the subtle but vicious
   stab at the rap "culture", as most rap lyrics are so shallow and
   meaningless, that they are unfit for print (IMNSHO).

I guess it still bewilders me that Rush even recorded something like this.  I
have trouble believing that it is anything but a joke.  But for me, it wasn't
funny.

Subject: RTB rap part live

&gt;  My only complaint is that they did not perform the rap *LIVE* in
&gt;concert.  The band really wimped out on that one.  That was the biggest
&gt;disappointment of the last tour.

It would be terribly difficult for Geddy to keep in sync with the video
of the bouncing skull mouthing the words.

Speaking of the bouncing skull, was it computer generated, and if so
does anyone know what kind of system was used to make it?

	I would like to point out that Bird Land (Weather Report's version)
was played before rush came on stage this year at the Grate Woods RTB
concert.  I do not know if RUSH selects this music or not, but it was
cool indeed.

I am curious as to how many people who subscribe to this news letter
uses words relating to RUSH as their passwords?  DOn't you think this is
a large security risk if you do?  Anyone with some brains could go
through the list of people subscribing to the nms trying album and
musician names as passwords.

With the new album coming up, I was wondering if anyone knows
what the time frame has been from the album release to the
band being interviewed on Rockline?  Do you suppose that we
will get to hear such an interview this fall?  I have always
enjoied hearing Alex, Geddy, and Neil do the live interview.

Picked up the Rush boot "Over the Europe" this weekend in NYC.  It's
a double-CD recording of an entire show from the RTB tour (where, I'm
not sure).  The sound quality is very good, especially if it's an
audience recording.  Cost was $38.  :-}

Subject: Re: Worst Guitar Solo

Well, I've always enjoyed the end of Necro, but that's just me..
hmmm... let's see. The only guitar solo by Alex that I can think
of right now that doesn't seem to fit the song (and in that is what
I mean by worst) is from High Water.. I've just never liked it,
and thought it didn't work with the song.

Now if you meant technically, well.... I know he's a little sloppy
on some of the earlier songs, but that maybe was what he was trying
to achieve, ala the Jimmy Page style (who to me, along with Vernon
Reid, are the King and Prince of sloppiness).

This is just one man's opinion...

Subject: HYF, etc...

I'm posting my first message to this board.  Bear with me, fans!

I'm mostly concerned about the impending war about HYF.  Someone made
some disparaging remarks about the album and the first few responses seem
to be pointing towards all out war.

I'll say that I didn't care for HYF when it came out.  At the time I owned
Signals and MP (I was just starting to listen to Rush).  Its "tinny" quality
turned me and a bunch of other Rush fans I knew away.  Over time the songs
grew on me.  Most of the songs are OK or great, but the best way to judge
them is to hear them LIVE.

Besides, I had to deal with Presto.  Sorry, I really don't think that it's a
good album.  The tour was great but the songs on the album aren't anything
spectacular.

RTB is probably the best album since PW.  "Dreamline" is definitely the best
song released since "The Big Money."

I realize that many of you will disagree with my opinions, and that's OK.
I think that the common denominator is that we all like Rush, for some reason
or another, for some album or another.  That's what's important.  Rush fans
are truly hard to find (at least, for me they have been).

Subject: New Album

Greets.
I just looked at alt.music.progressive and found an article that was going on
about the new album.  I don't know if this is true or not, but it said that
Peter Collins was producing it, that it would be along similar lines to PW and
that the band has dumped Critical Mass as the title.  Is this news?  I hope
that they don't, IMHO it's a good title.  Can anybody enlighten me as to
whether these are true or not?
Feel free to contact me on e-mail if it doesn't warrant a post to the NMS.
