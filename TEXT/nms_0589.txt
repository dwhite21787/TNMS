The original MP CD made in West Germany had the first two seconds
cut-off as was noted earlier, but this has been corrected for several
years now in a newer version (made in the US). A few years ago, you
could call Polygram and tell them you had a defective CD and they
would mail you a new one FOR FREE. I got one a few years ago, but I'm
not sure this offer still exists.

As for the Ultradisc MP, I did notice that the drums on _Limelight_
don't come in until 8.5 seconds on the Polygram version, and 9 seconds
on the Ultradisc version, but it looks like less than 1/2 a second
difference. It may have to do with the way the song cues up. I can't
tell that much difference when playing along on guitar. The difference
is probably due to re-mastering techniques which are very different
for MFSL.

&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure if this has been mentioned or not, so forgive me if
&gt; this has.  I just got the MP Ultradisc (not for Christmas, alas!)
&gt; and noticed a couple of errors on it.
&gt;
&gt; 	2) Alex suddenly loses his ability to play with
&gt; 	     a metronome in the beginning of 'Limelight'

I, too, came across this CD just a few days ago.  However, as I just
dropped $60 on 'Mardi Gras'  I couldn't justify another $30 for a new
copy of MP... :-(

Anyway, I was reading on the label that Ultradiscs are made from the
original tapes made in the studio, "In order to play the closest
possible rendition from what was actually played in the studio" (quoted
from memory).

This suggests to me that the error in Limelight was actually there in
the original recording, and they edited it out during the mastering
process...

Subject: Power Windows lyrics and Richard Feynman

Greetings Rushians,

I can't say that I think that Neil quoted or paraphrased Feynman (or his
biographer), but if _Genius_ is anywhere near as good as _Surely You're
Joking, Mr. Feynman_ (may have that title a bit off) or _What Do You Care
What Other People Think?_, I would recommend it highly.  I would dare to
say that Feynman and Peart are kindred souls in that they are intense,
curious, and disciplined without taking themselves seriously.  The two
titles I mentioned are largely humorous anecdotes from Feynman's life.
Well worth the $10 for the pair.

Apologies for the marginal Rush content.

Regards,

David Drum

Subject: Re: Rush as a Unit

Rush isn't a band known for incredible guitar solos, or crunching power
chords.  If you want something like that, you listen to Van Halen or
Metallica (and I do).  Lifeson's guitar playing isn't nearly as showy or
overpowering as those.  There's no doubt that Rush plays rock, but it's
not traditional guitar-driven rock.  With Rush, all the instruments get
the same amount of "respect." Alex's guitar fits into this overall theme.
I'd say all three members of Rush are talented musicians, but as Alex
Slotkin's brother (?) said, it's the unit that is great.  These three
musicians work together like few others in the music industry - that's why
they've been turning out great stuff for all these years.  I suspect that
if any of The Boyz ever came out with a solo album (and let us pray they
don't) it wouldn't get close to measuring up to anything Rush has ever
done.  Rush's greatest strength isn't its incredible musicians (though
there's no doubt they're there), it is instead how those three musicians
work together to make music.

Jello All You Wonderful Rush Fanatics!

I'm in need of your help, guys.  This probably isn't the best time
to ask this since everyone's on vacation, but I'll ask again
later on when everyone's back.  I'm trying to start a petition
to get Rush down here on their next tour.  I've called the local
rock station DJ's asking about what the h*ll I should do, and
I've been directed to the programming director (whom I shall try
to contact this week).  I've figured the station's got all the
contacts so they could help get them down here.

But what I need to know is, is there anything ELSE I can do to
"persuade" Rush to come down?  Is there anything DIFFERENT I
should do?  Am I going about it the wrong way???  If anyone's got
any experience, advice, ideas, *anything* on how I can get this
thing rolling, PLEASE let me know (e-mail, of course).  I'd
really like to get them down here, again.

I know it's way too early for it, but I'd at least like to start
working on it.  So, again, if anyone's got ANY ideas at all, or
know someone who's done this before, or anyone I should talk to,
PLEASE let me know.  Thanx!!  :-)

here's hoping 1993 treats you well!  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!

Hi,

	I own Run From The Fans.  I HIGHLY recommend it. It is my best
CD bootleg.  My only complaint is that it is too short.  Don't pay more
than $30 for it.  Also worth looking for is a 2 CD set called Pensacola.
Both are very clear recordings... although RFTF is better.  Pensacola
should run you $60-70.  I have a copy of Pensacola for sale BTW if you
know anyone who is interested.

Subject: Alex The Musician and Meg the Magnificent/NMS 588

Hello all, and hope you all had a good break!

I WILL NOT FLAME Matt Slotkin, although I am sure many of us are turning
up the gas. However, I will strongly disagree in his assessment of Mr.
Lifeson's musicianship. First, I think there is an unfortunate tendency to
judge a musician by HOW FAST he/she plays or how many obscure chord
patterns are used. These are two sides of the same coin: musical snobbery
(any flame here is truly not meant personally). Having played in several
bands in multiple genres, as well as done some conducting, it is MHO that
musicianship includes technique, feel, creativity, and if you are in a group,
most intangibly (probably part of "feel"), the ability to spark and to
work well with other musicians.

As far as technique: Tho some of us hate the album, Alex's work on
RUSH, particularly Working Man, is a great example of metal guitar
playing. I mention this because the skill with which his later work is
done (La Villa Strangiato, the whole RTB album, etc.) is to me self-evident.

Feel: This is the trendy one to point to, but Alex's solo and fills in
Ghost of a Chance is as in touch as it gets.

CREATIVITY: DON'T FORGET THAT THE MUSIC OF RUSH IS CO-WRITTEN BY LEE AND
LIFESON. Listening to GL and AL on interviews, it seems that most Rush
music comes from the two of them jamming. (I am removing lyrics from the
equation for the sake of argument).

Finally, judging from how tight the band is on the road (musically), and
from how much fun they usually seem to have onstage, it looks like all
three are fine musicians.

While writing this, I just realized another point...Alex has tremendous
respect from the working guitar community. Certainly every musician has
their faults, but it really seems to me that most of the serious knocks
against Lifeson come from (prepare for mild flame) those who are most
easily impressed by glitz. By the way, given that Neil and Geddy are
outsanding musicians, it would not make sense for them to play with
someone who is not their calibre. E'nuff said!

Whew! Thanks for putting up with my pompous post! I guess I had had it
with Alex-bashing for a while.

How many NMS readers in the UK have ordered these t-shirts? If none
of you have yet, wouldn't it be cheaper to bulk order? I'm assuming
that there are some left, of course! I'll be interested in getting
one, but the cost of trans-atlantic shipping is a little high for
a small order (I have experience of this )-: )

  [ There is a flat rate of $18 US dollars for shipping to the UK (that's per
    shirt ordered. See message below.				   : rush-mgr ]

So far response has been great towards the shirts, and I still have about
