Subject: more Boot nonsense

	I agree that "The Gangster of Boots" is the best title with
  "Glittering Prizes" being a distant second.

	Anyhow...

	As far as the cover art is concerned, I was thinking that people
  could make a gif file of what they thought was the best cover and place
  it at the ftp site syrinx.umd.edu.  That way many of us could get the
  file via anonymous ftp and vote on it.

	Or maybe not!

Hello Everyone...
   I haven't read TNMS for awhile as we just returned from break
not too long ago.  I have to agree with everyone and say that the
title, "The Gangster of Boots" is a great title!  I think that it
is appropriate and only a true fan would understand it.  Has anyone
suggested a version of "Lakeside Park" for the disc?  I just like
that song for some reason.  It just popped into my head.  Oh well,
I was just checking in and can't wait for the disc!

Subject: one more cd opinion

        after reading through the last NMS, i had a few thoughts on the cd.
 someone mentioned giving any profits to the band.  not that this is an
awful idea, but i really don't think their going to take to well to getting
a one hundred and fifty dollar check from the profits on an unauthorized
record.  i think a better idea is to donate the profits to the bands
favorite charity.  i personally don't know what this charity would be, but
i'm sure someone on the list could find out.  we may also mant to consider
tacking on an additional buck or two for each cd for this charity.  it
would give a better image to the whole project.  it would be for a worthy
cause.
        someone else brought up the fact that some actual released material
was being considered for the cd.  i don't know if this is true, unless the
stuff is out of print or next to imposible to find, it just shouldn't be
included.  it's just wrong to include anything thats legally available.
        my impression is that most of the people on this list have A LOT of
rush stuff (records, cd's, concert shirts).  most of the people have
everything the band has offered, and they just want a little more.  if we
make a sort of best of the bootlegs, we would satisfy this need and benefit
a worthy charity.  let's face it, the bootleg companies are pocketing their
profits and Rush isn't seeing a dime.  i think the cd is a great idea, but
only if it's a sort of robin hood thing (i.e. steal form the evil bootleg
companies, give to ourselves and some charity)
        oh, "The Gangster of Boots" is by far the best title.

   Hello fellow Rush fans! I'm fairly new but I've been reading daily to get
caught up.  I think Mike hit the Daily Double with "Gangster of Boots".  If
we're going to do it, that's my vote.  I also cast my ballot for any version
of "Middletown Dreams".  I love that song!
   Am I wrong in thinking that I read that The Boyz have given contributions
to charities as gifts to each other??  If I'm not, might that be a better idea 
of where to send any proceeds??  Maybe split it in thirds, one third for the
charitiy each has given to in the past.  If I'm wrong, I still think it's a
good idea.  Remember "People are basically decent, Conventional wisdom would
say".
   But, if Chris Micheal is correct, and RUSH would find MAKING a boot
insulting, might they also find GIVING proceeds to charity in their name even
more insulting??  Then again, who said it had to be in their name??  In the
end, can you do anything more than what you feel is right?? (We've gone
philosophical, folks)  I don't think so.  I believe in the freedom of GIVING!

Thankx for the space!!

I think a video collection of live stuff is a great Idea...I can
contribute many shows to it...Would specially like to see more
from the Power Windows tour (since I only have two shows from
that era, and only one of them is of good quality!)  I also
would like to see a good recording from Grace Under Pressure tour..
As far as HYF, Presto, and RTB there are some memorable moments, but
they are not as rare....A good signals show would also be welcome..

I KNOW someone out there took their film camera of the early tour...
they have just not been distributed yet....so c'mon and release
them (even if the quality is poor!)

Subject: Neil's Book(ie)

	That book that Neil supposedly has written is called
(supposedly again) "Rain Dance Through the Rockies" and was (supposedly)
read and therefore witnessed by a member of alt.music.rush a few months
ago.  However, the assertion that U of Toronto Press or some such
press had published it turned out to be false, and no one at that time
could track down the publisher.  It turns out the books were personally
numbered by Neil, I guess -- limited edition -- and not for the consumption
of the general public.  That's the last I heard on a.m.r since I stopped
reading it due to what I considered outlandish signal/noise ratio.

Subject:      Uncommon CDs

   I've been reading all the postings recently about bootleg CDs (such a
nasty word that) and their varying quality.  So, I was wondering what
everyone would think of a survey of sorts that rates the quality of the
sound and any other variables that you may be interested in.  For instance,
quality of cover, correctness of syntax, titles, etc. and anything else
you can think of.  Let me know either here or via e-mail and I'll try to
arrange something.  Then I can post an official questionairre for this on
these "uncommon" (much nicer) CDs and all interested parties can mail their
votes to me.  Sound good?  If this has already been done than let me know,
but I would like to know a more accurate rating of sound quality such as
a scale from 1 to 10 as well as any comments.  I could then post the results
here or elsewhere after a designated time period.  Let me know!  Later....

Subject: Posters / Bootlegs

Somebody mentioned in last night's NMS that the only Rush posters they
have seen are GUP, PeW, and RTB.  Well, I have a couple other...a giant
subway poster from the RTB tour, from England, a Presto promotional
poster, and most intriugingly, a poster from 1980 that shows the band
in 2112 style, with long hair, "Man-in-Star" drum set, etc. There are
also various posters simply showing the band members. I have one from the
Power Windows tour and the Hold Your Fire tour.  One of my friends also
has a Hemispheres and Hold Your Fire "theme" posters.

Now, in response to the long dissertation about the immorality of booting
Rush, I have a couple quick replies:

1. If Rush is so against bootlegs, they would have released more live
albums, at least one for every other tour. Since they haven't, fans
have the right to aquire bootlegs, as long as it isn't done for profit.
(The CD *isn't* for profit)

2. If enough precuations are taken, no one can ever connect the CD to
the NMS. By proper precautions, I mean a low number of copies, and no
indication anywhere on the CD of contributors or the NMS.

	[ Well, since you are posting this to the NMS and discussing
	  it here, hmm.. it would tend to reason that the connection
	  is *already* made!!  The NMS *is publicly* available, it
	  wouldn't take one much time to see the connection.  Your post
	  is one good such indication :)		:rush-mgr]

Would anyone like to see a Rush "Beat the boots" set (re: zappa)?
I'm sure this would never happen, because Rush is simply to anally-
retentive when it comes to live albums.

Fellow Rushians!

I posted a while back, that I have a copy of Rush's first singles
		"Not Fade Away" and
		"You Can't Fight It"

Hardly anyone contacted me about this.  I am willing to trade, as I do not
have a great deal of bootleg stuff of my own.  I was suprised!  I guess
these songs aren't as rare as I thought!  Contact me!!

Also, has anyone really looked closely at the photo on the inside of the RTB
CD?  It looks at first like an elephant's tail, but is it really?  Look
closely, you'll see what I mean.  And--- in the liner notes, it says:

		"Brought to you by the letter 'b'".

To me, the "b" might stand for Bones, but what do you think?

Hey all!
            I just thought I'd cast my vote on the current CD issue:

1) Gangster of Boots is a really cool title.

2) Chris' argument about the integrity (or lack thereof) in making our bootleg
   is a good point.  I think the idea of donating any profits to the band (or
   a charitable cause) would be an acceptable compromise.

3) I've said this before, but I'll say it again.  A rarities video (not even
   necessarily sponsored by TNMS) would be great too!  Plus I AM *DYING* to get
   a copy of the ESL video.  *PLEASE* e-mail me if you can help me!!!

   That's Michael Anthony's bass in the intro to You're No Good put through

In reply to (and in support of) chris@netcom.com

I remember hearing Geddy say somewhere that home recording upset him, because
it didn't allow the performer their rightful share, so I'd hazard a guess that
they probably feel much the same about boots.

So what is the prospect, does any one think, of getting Rush to agree to such a
proposal - like Hi Ged, we'd like to make a CD of some of your rarer material
and perhaps a few live performances and the like, is there any possibility of
doing this ?

&gt;&gt;    I don't want to burst anybodys hemespheres, but whatever song it
&gt;&gt;was that is at a slightly higher pitch, is probably that way because
&gt;&gt;they decided it was too slow and simply sped  up the multi-track
&gt;&gt;recorder when they mixed it down to the master.
&gt;
&gt;  I seriously doubt highly skilled musicians and recording engineers
&gt;would adjust the tape speed to "fix" the tempo. My theories:
&gt;
&gt;-Some lunk-head bumped the switch that enabled the speed control.
&gt;
&gt;-They tuned everything higher to mess with our minds.
&gt;
&gt;-They mastered it at a higher speed so crazed fans on mailing lists would talk
&gt; endlessly about it, forming theories and thinking they have an inside
&gt; brotherhood with the three they affectionately call The Boyz.

and I'm inclined to agree with idea 2.

One possbible way to get a better feel for whether the tape speed was
adjusted (vs. tuning up higher) would be to listen closely to hear whether
Geddy's voice sounds `different' from the other tracks--not just his pitch,
but also any tonal qualities, etc.

It always frustrated me as an amateur Geddy-copier to have to re-tune
everything after AFTK and again before CTTH; if I had real smarts I
would've played X first...

Also, someone can settle this for me:  Is Geddy related to Eugene Levy?

Subject: possible future song theme

Howdy!!

I've been thinking about a question which was recently asked, namely, what do
you think might be a good theme for Neil to write about in his lyrics.  I've
been thinking about both Manhattan Project and Natural Science (and Richard
Fenymann) and have come up with the following.
After WWII, those scientist who worked on the bomb seemed to follow two very
opposite paths.  On one path was the Oppenheimer/Einstein group which was
vociferously dovish (Einstein conducted a serious letter writing campaign to
both Truman and the UN, and Oppenheimer was even called before Joesph Mcarthy
and the HUAC).  The other group, men such as Edward Teller, went great gonzo
into promoting the arms race and the cold war mentality of mutually assured
destruction for either side in a war.  (Does this sound like the dichotomy in
Hemishperes perhaps?)

In any case, the quick end of WWII after Hiroshima/Nagaski perhaps could have
justified the work that the scientist in the Manhattan Project did.  What were
the scientist who, for the next 45 years, advocated sinking enormous amounts of
resources into finding ways to destroy the earth thinking??  I don't know, and
I'd like to hear what Neil, and ya'll, think.

Subject: Rush/Zep guitar similarities

When I first heard Beneath, Between & Behind, the main riff sounded
VERY much like the middle part of Heartbreaker ( just after the first
solo and before the main jam ). So, when I picked up my fiddle to
figure out the Rush tune, and already knowing how Heartbreaker went,
sure enough. They're the same riff, in the same key.

Someone posted that Bring It Home had the same riff, but I think they
maybe confusing it with Heartbreaker.

Also, the first time I ever heard What You're Doing, I instantly said,
" Hey, that's the beginning of Heartbreaker in E !!" But, who cares.
I mean, they're all blues riffs, and I really can't imagine a blues
lick, progression, or whatnot not sounding similar to another recorded
somewhere in time.

It's pretty apparent that Rush in the beginning was very influenced by
Zeppelin, but look at the progression since !

You can't readily coin Rush another Kingdom Come !! Now that's a Zep
rip-off band and a half.

Subject: Run from the Fans

Yesterday I purchased a bootleg CD of the boys entitled "Run from the
Fans" here in Omaha, NE.  The sound quality is wonderful for a boot, but I
was confused by just one thing...  the entire recording seems to be lower
and slower than normal.  I was wondering for those of you who know about
this album if you could tell me whether or not they intentionally slowed
it down for ample playing time.  It's a bit on the annoying side although
there is some powerful stuff on there.

Subject: Info on Neil's book

Here is the article I mentioned yesterday from alt.music.rush:

&gt;Article 4236 (110 more) in alt.music.rush:
&gt;From: "david goulden" &lt;david.goulden@canrem.com&gt;
&gt;Subject: neil's raindance
&gt;Organization: Canada Remote Systems
&gt;Distribution: alt

&gt;Lines: 31
&gt;
&gt;I thought that I would point out that Neil has published at least one
&gt;book, I know because I read it.  It's called 'Raindance Over The
&gt;Rockies' and is about a bicycle trip he took from Calgary to Vancouver.
&gt;It's a good read and since it's probably one of the longest pieces of
&gt;prose he's published it gives a good insight into the way he thinks
&gt;about people, places, music, etc.  It's full of his dry humour too.
&gt;
&gt;The book was published by the University of Toronto Press.  I believe
&gt;the trip took place in the summer of 1991 and the book was published in
&gt;the spring of 1992 but I'm by no means sure of those dates as it's been
&gt;about a month since I read it.  I borrowed it from a friend who borrowed
&gt;it from someone else so I had to read it in two days, which wasn't too
&gt;difficult as the book is only 75 pages long.  The copy I had was a large
&gt;softcover (8 1/2" x 11"?) with high quality heavy paper.  The book was
&gt;signed and numbered on the inside front cover so it MAY have been a
&gt;limited edition.
&gt;
&gt;THIS IS ALL I KNOW ABOUT THE BOOK so please don't email me asking where
&gt;you can get a copy, ask your library or contact the U of T Press.

Chris, Your points are well taken, but the unreleased material is what *real*
fans yearn for - we want new stuff, as we've heard all the rest.  And, unlike
people who wouldn't want a compilation of unreleased material, people who get
TNMS love RUSH and want to hear new sounds, even if they aren't the best sounds
according to the band members.  The unreleased material that might turn off a
casual RUSH fan will not have the same effect on TNMS'ers.

BTW, I agree with Aaron - the Bruins rule.
