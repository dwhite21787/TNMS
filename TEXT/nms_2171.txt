Sorry for the lack of digests last week, I was in Denver all last week!
So expect a couple over the next two days to catch up.

In other news, the NEW syrinx machine is up and running! Now we begin the
long process of moving files over, we now have 10gigs of space to fill!
I should be reenabling the realvideo files shortly, and putting up some
brand new audio and video files that I didn't have space for.

I'll even try to get the TNMS page and web digests back up (they took up

In the last TNMS somebody found out that www.neilpeart.com is a site of a
band called 'Helmet'.
I did a little research, and found an interview from www.neilpeart.com
that explains everything... 

(JS is John Stainer of Helmet and KM is Ken Micallef. This interview was
in Modern Drummer, October 1994)

KM: And yet your biggest influence is...?

JS: Neil Peart. I don't care what anybody says and I don't care how
unfashionable it is. People say they hear a lot of
Bonham in my playing - and I loved Zeppelin - but I think Peart took
drumming to another level that no one else has
matched yet. But on the other hand, I hate double-bass; it's corny.

That's All!

I think it would be more appropriate to compare Neil Peart to an 
international sports star like Ronaldo, rather than someone who
plays a sport which is really only popular in one country.

But actually this illustrates a strange tendency that Rock music 
fans have to compare particular musicians as if it was a contest - 
last time I checked, drumming was not an olympic sport.  It's not
really possible to say that one musician is better than another
in my opinion.  It's fun to slag off John Petrucci though ;)

"I was a little bored so, I was checking out domain names for rush.  I
typed in http://www.neilpeart.com and it took me to the Helmet home
page.  What is up with that?   Is Helmet Rush fans?"

Absolutely. The drummer of Helmet has stated in interviews that he is a
big Neil Peart fan. It's funny, I used to check out the very page you
specified, Ralph, for tour info (it used to be helmet.com). Helmet was a
force to be reckoned with, but, alas, they have parted ways. I think
it's hilarious that a Helmet homepage is called neilpeart.com (maybe
this says more about the maintainer of the page than the ex-band, but I
don't know). I've said it before, but I'll say it again: if Rush chooses
to do another studio album, they would be wise to try out Dave Sardy as
producer/engineer. He did Helmet's last record, and all of the
instruments come across crisp, clear & heavy as all hell.

Fastest guitarist thread? Tee hee. Please, this is just an opinion. You
don't have to agree, but be gentle with me. Isn't the act of trying to
squeeze as many notes/second as possible into a guitar solo a LITTLE
juvenile. I'm 26. If anyone tells me, "You gotta check out this
guitarist. He plays solos so FAST", I run away. As fast as I can. What
about purely talented guitarists? Does anyone listen to Leo Kottke?
Billy MacLaughlin? Michael Hedges (sadly, dead)? These are all largely
acoustic players that are, indeed, fast at times, but sometimes they are
incredibly slow. They simply ooze emotion & talent (especially Leo IMO).
I think that when you take into account all of the guitar textures,
moods, speeds & styles Mr. Lifeson plays with, he fits into the same
category with Leo, Billy & Michael; only Alex is largely electric. Just
as impressive.

Rockline put me to sleep. There were some good questions, though. For
instance, the very first question was something like (paraphrase), "You
have done so much in your careers, what do you think you have left to
accomplish in music?" I feel that one was very thoughful, and it
seeminly took Geddy & Alex by surprise. They talked about musical
evolution or something, but that caller asked a good question if you ask
me.

Subject: Dumb interview questions solution

Here is the final solution to those dumb interview
questions!

Person calls in.. a pre-recorded message asks for
the guy to state his question and stay on the line.

Some person (rush fan brought in by the station)
listens to the answer.. then weeds out the dumb ones
that would waste time (does peart have cancer, etc).

And answers the common ones.  Letting in the occasional
relavent question.

This way the boys only get the good questions.

Subject: Phil / Peart

Hello Rushdom.

   Wow.  What a firestorm we have here. I'm not sure if drawing a
comparison between Peart and Collins is fair to either man. There styles
are so divergent, it seems pointless to me.

   I  too have seen both guys play live, obviously Neil many more times
than Phil. Both are impressive behind the kit, but I won't compare the
two in a "who's better" scenario, it's as pointless as it is subjective.

  Suffice to say,  I am impressed with both guys. When I saw Phil
Collins ( 2X -1  with Genisis and 1 without) live, he was great on both
times. He is rock solid as a performer,  I had a great time at the shows
and was thouroughly impressed with his playing, singing, and
showmanship, and when the show was over it was far to soon. He is a,
like Neil Peart, a consumate professional, and worthy of my respect.

   Neil seems to be the busier drummer - most of the time, and I would
go see Neil before Phil if I could not manage to see both. However I
highly recommend checking out Phil Collins should he be in your town.

   Further I must say that bashing any musician on a list devoted to a
band whose members obvioisly respect other musicians greatly, is simply
rediculous. I find it hard to imagine any drummer bashing another, let
alone a drummer as succesful and talented as PC. Neil even invited Phil
to play on the first BFB tribute, but Phil's commitments kept him away,
or so I read in Modern Drummer.

<<Neil Peart is the Michael Jordan of drums.>>

Oh, come on.....Neil is *FAR* from being an over-rated has-been.  *grin*

I definitely have to agree with the sentiment that Neil kicks Phil's
butt, though.  I just wanna toss some more names into the list of
drummers being mentioned:

Yuri Ruley, from MxPx.  Let's just call this guy the Neil of the punk
realm.  He's actually that good.  He's got speed, talent, and can just
flow effortlessly from the fastest, hardest punk you've ever heard in
your life, to the most laid-back, yet creative, swing you ever thought a
non-big band drummer could do.

Paul Roraback, formerly of Grammatrain.  (Grammatrain fans...need I say
more about this guy?  BTW, his new band's name is Gideon's Press, and
according to Paul himself, they're going to be *WAY* more progressive
than Grammatrain was.  :) )

Phil Ehart, of Kansas.  He hasn't done anything to terribly interesting
lately, apart from stealing Neil's "Fly By Night" fill, but you still
gotta respect his 70s stuff.

Aaron Smith, formerly of both 77's, and Rich Mullins' Ragamuffin Band.  A
good, solid rudimental drummer.  Never gets too funky with the beat
usually (unfortunately), but his solos are always awesome.

I also gotta throw in another mention of Stewart Copeland.  And let's not
forget some of the revolutionary stuff that Ginger Baker played in the
days of Cream and Blind Faith.

And let's not forget the father of all drum gods -- Buddy Rich.

That's my list, though.

Ryan/Stimpy

Oh, and, by the way, I'm pretty sure the "Fish Islands" thing was a joke.
 But what about Geddy singing "Call me a Commie" in Analog Kid?  *grin*

I checked the FAQ, and didn't see anything about this, so here goes.  On the
Power Windows cover, doesn't it look like our freakish friend is holding the
television remote control backwards?  Usually the large empty spot is the place
for your hand to rest and the batteries to go, not the top. Maybe someone with
the LP can see better, I've just got the CD.  If he is, I wonder what it
means....

People have been complaining about the inherent stupidity of some of the
questions asked to Rush on Rockline.  How about this: next time we know of a
live Q&A type event, all of us on the NMS decide on one or two of the best
questions we'd like to ask.  Then, if we all have the same question, there's
more chance of just one of us getting through to ask it.  Just a thought.  BTW,
did anyone here ask a question on last week's Rockline?

With all this discussion about the best guitarist alive, I'm surprised no

I just got back from seeing him in Dayton, Ohio, and he is just amazing.  He

I was a little bored so, I was checking out domain names for rush.  I 
typed in http://www.neilpeart.com and it took me to the Helmet home 
page.  What is up with that?   Is Helmet Rush fans?
_________________________________________________________________
I looked at the website and found this in one of the interviews.
"John Stanier's (Helmet Drummer) staccato drumming is a Helmet mainstay. His
style is the result of his combined love of punk, hip hop, and Neil Peart."
I haven't heard any of his drumming.  Has anyone else?  Does he honor Neil's
name or not?
This same site has a different name also http://www.helmet.org.  Same IP
different domain name, Virtual domain.  So there could also be a site named
http://www.geddylee.com or http://www.alexlifeson.com and they could
probably be part of that virtual domain.

Subject: Collins V Peart cont.

Well let me continue on this controversial debate.  Some people (namely
Frank - issue 2166) have mentioned that Collins has sold out with songs such
as Sussudio.  OK fair comment - but it doesn't detract from the fact that he
is regarded as a top-class percussionist who tries his hand at all
percussive challenges (and I don't mean holding the bleedin' sticks
differently!).  I mean Collins is diverse yet can adjust with the type of
music he plays.  He's drummed with Clapton, Page et al, BB King and various
concerts featuring a multitude of musicians - namely The Prince's Trust
concert's & Nelson Mandella concert (in England).  Collins can simplify his
set up and playing - you only have to listen to Genesis live to hear how
good he is.  Could Neil do this and Relax ?
(if the argument is that Neil has to concentrate due to nature of Rush's
music)
Somehow I think not!

Subject: Favourite Album Side

     I just had an idea for discussion, since I get the feeling most TNMS 
     subscribers enjoy threads on favourite this & that....
     
     This thread may only appeal to those Rush fans who knew Rush firstly 
     by lp albums.  In today's age of CD's, we hear a Rush album from track 
     1 through to track 7, 8, 9 or whatever.  No breaks to turn the CD 
     over!  However, if you started listening to Rush on vinyl, you may 
     have defined Rush albums by "side A" and "side B", beacause you'd know 
     that "2112" was side A of the album of the same name, and that "Tom 
     Sawyer" -> "Limelight" was side A of MP.
     
     -> What is your favourite Rush album side?
     
     I've always been partial to side B of MP.  IMO, "Camera Eye", "Witch 
     Hunt", and "Vital Signs" are just incredible examples of Rush at their 
     creative and artistic best.  I'd enjoy hearing what other Rush 
     (vinyl-era) fans think.
     
     Cheers,

Hey Everyone!

How's things?  I hope well.

My spare time, what little of it there is, has been taken up
by a great computer game, Baldur's Gate.  It's an AD&D
adventure game.  You can create whatever kind of character
you want and then run around solving mysteries and killing
things.  It's pretty damn incredible.

Anyway, to the point of this post.  One thing that you can
do in Baldur's Gate is create your own .wav files so you can
be the voice of your character at certain points in the
game.  For example, when it gets dark, my character says "It
was a dark and stormy night".  Well, being the good li'l
Rushians that we are, my hub and I had to include a couple
of Rush quotes.  Here they are:

Night:  "The night is black without a moon"
City:  "The focus is sharp in the city" and "Drawn like
moths, we drift into the city"
Forest:  "There is unrest in the forest" and "There is
trouble with the trees"

My fondness for MST3K led me to have "Hi-Keeba!" as my
battlecry.  We have a couple of Simpsons quotes and just
some phrases we like of our own.  It makes the game more
interesting.

Anyone else playing BG?

Well, I looked it up.  The DNS names neilpeart.com and helmet.org refer
to the same IP address, they're interchangeable.  On the credits page
for helmet.org, the webmaster makes this comment:

	I would like to thank the following:

	Neil Peart of Rush for sparking and fueling my interest in drumming.

So, apparently this is the webmasters little way of saying thanks.  But
why register the domain for neilpeart.com unless you're going to use

just hasn't gotten around to it.

CSmock, this is genius!  Just perfect.  Does it occur to anyone that
Rush/Neil ought not be categorized politically because they cover the
spectrum from The Trees (anti-union--republican) to Nobody's Hero
(pro-gay--democrat)?  From 2112 (pro-individual--republican) to Subdivisions
(anti-white-flight--democrat)?  From Anthem (me, me, me!--republican) to
Alien Shore (us, us, us--democrat)?  Please pardon my sweeping
generalizations; I'm just trying to illustrate the point that there's a Rush
lyric for most every political issue, and that paints a much more complex
picture than left vs. right.

What surprises me even more is the gall that some people have in assuming
that the band *must* share a particular view because they're
smart/sensible/caring/understanding.  Rational romantic people are capable
of arriving at different and even opposing stances.

Comments? Info?

I'm an infrequent poster but thought I might chime in on this issue.  I
work for my college radio station both as a DJ and music reviewer so get 
my hands on lots of CDs (like Different Stages early, and all the promos 
etc..) anyway The Great Kat (as I recall) is this woman who basically
plays really strange classical music.  She is not a technical Guitar
Player or anything like that.  In my opinion her music is terrible..
but hey  who am I to judge for others
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey Rush soulmates-

There's been a lot of talk lately about guitarists, and I noticed an
interesting post about Steve Vai and Eddie Van Halen last time.  Here are
some thoughts, what does everyone think?

First, I'm informed; I've been playing guitar for 16 years and have been in
three bands.  I'm not a 15-year old kid with an Electra Les Paul copy in the
closet and a Gorilla amp by the bed.  :)

I used to spend a lot of time comparing and contrasting guitarists, because,
like most Rush fans I suspect, I'm a digger and analytical about stuff.  I
grew up on Townsend, Hendrix, Skynard's guys and all the 80s metal guys.  I
fell in love with Eddie for life when I heard "Dreams" in 1986 and saw VH at
the Worcester Centrum.  I then ran out and bought all of Van Halen's albums
from 1978-84 and absorbed them.  When I went to college I was exposed to

Sabbath, Cream, Maiden, AC/DC, ELP, Fripp, Steve Vai, Satriani, et. al.  I
patiently listened to Yngwie when all my buddies were raving over him but
just was not moved.  Impressed, oh yes; but not moved.  "Crazy Train",
now THAT moved me.

There are millions of phenomenal guitarists out there who I have not listened
to and could never judge anyway.  How can I compare the playing of two
people?  It would be like saying the Soft Watches are better than the Last
Supper, or comparing Grieg's Concerto in A minor to Beethoven's Ninth.

All artistry is unique, even if you are copying somebody.  I can play the
solo to "Limelight" note for note.  Every time I play it, I play it like

ME, not Alex.  But I didn't write it!  So we have to put creativity into the
formula.  And when Alex wrote it, he had others helping him.  Page, Hendrix,
Clapton, Beck, and everyone else he loved growing up.

So...all guitarists are extensions of the other players they have learned
from.  And some guitarists have exceptional creativity.  Those with that 
creativity inspire others.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

When you combine great creativity with great intellectual working knowledge
of music theory and technique, you have virtuosos.  Joe Satriani, Robert 
Fripp, Al DiMeola and Les Paul come to mind.

But does this make these guys 'the best ever?'  That's like saying Jim Brown
was better than Walter Payton or Barry Sanders, or Neil Peart is better than
Buddy Rich or Keith Moon.  All artistry is unique, even when copied from 
somebody else.  Sure, Peart could play the Overture from "Tommy" note for
note.  But it was Moon's own personal creativity and orchestral style that
made it beautiful, just as it's Peart's own creativity and intensity that
makes the three sharp tom blasts in "A Farewell to Kings" special, right 
before the second verse ("the hypocrites are slandering...")

So, what I'm saying is this: while comparing and judging guitarist is fun and
interesting, it's basically pointless.  I love "Stopping by woods on a snowy
evening" for what it IS, not because it reminds me of "Do not go gentle into
that good night."  I love "A Tale of Two Cities" for what it IS, not because
it reminds me of "The Red Badge of Courage".  When I listen to guitarists
play, the beauty of each artist becomes a separate entity to me.  I don't
WANT the solo from "Johnny B. Goode" to remind me of "Crazy Train." Each is
beautiful when left alone.  Even more beautiful is how artists give to each
other.  The very fact that Randy was a rock guitarist means that a little
spark of "Johnny B. Goode" was with him when he wrote that magnificent solo,
which blends rock, metal and classical styles in a lovely frenzy.  Just as
Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and BB King were with Berry when he wrote
"Johnny B. Goode."

If you want to rate guitarists, I suppose you could rate them for how much
influence they had on their genre.  On this basis and this basis alone, I
would put Hendrix at the top of the rock list.  But is Hendrix better than
Steve Vai or Eric Johnson?  Come on.

Each solo is a painting.  Some are just haberdash, filled with a thousand
notes that don't really say much; most are forgettable and redundant (like
mine!) :)  But there are solos out there that have inspired and lifted others
to copy them- the sincerest form of flattery.  When a solo reaches a huge
audience, you have a Mona Lisa, a "Henry V", a 55-10 blowout of the Broncos.
 A master work.  My choice for that solo: "Jessica", by the Allman Brothers.
 Three men playing as one, and smooth as a silk prom dress on the floor of a
'67 Mustang.  :)

By the way, here are my top ten favorite solos of all time: you'll find that
some of these guys are in the "Where are they now file".  But I like these
solos for how they make ME feel, not because they're the fastest or the
smoothest or because they did 'point A = point C divided by point B" on some
musical theory chart in a Berkeley classroom.  Music is not calculus.

In no particular order:

Eddie Van Halen- "Jump"
George Lynch- "Burning Like a Flame" (first solo)
Andy Taylor- "Some Like it Hot"
Allman Bros.- "Jessica"
Alex Lifeson- "A Farewell to Kings"
Neil Schon- "Who's Cryin' Now"
Chris Hayes (from Huey Lewis & the News)- "Walking on a Thin Line"
Robert Fripp (on the Roche Sisters' 1st album)- "Hammond Song"
Randy Rhoads- "Crazy Train"
Tom Scholz- "More Than a Feeling"

and on and on..."Sultans of Swing," "Comfortably Numb", "Celebration Day",
"Machine Gun".........................(this was like choosing the ten best
diamonds from a DeBeers catalog...)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok.  How long did it take you to scroll through all of that?  Imagine
that every single time you read TNMS.  Oh, that's right, you don't have
to imagine that, because it happens entirely too much, in every single
issue.
I'm asking each and every one of you.  Who's the fastest guitarist?  Who
gives a damn?  Who's your favorite Dream Theater keyboardist?  Who gives
a damn?  What's your favorite flavor of jam? I think you all get my
point.
Let's all think about what we have typed before we hit the send button.
Does this have anything to do with Rush, their music, their bandmembers,
stagecrew, production crew?  If the answer to all of these questions is
no, then hit the delete key, not the send key.

Thanks for reading, if you did.  I hope this works.
