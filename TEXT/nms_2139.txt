Thanks to Ryan Park, Mark Graham, Russ Karlberg, Carl Kolek, Alan Parrott,
Kevin Kitchens, Jason Bryer & Cary Hall, I now have all the original RV
files BACK UP on the NMS web page! Thanks to everyone else who also offered
their copies! :-)  

The fancast was last night, and *I* thought it was great! It was not quite
what I expected, the main interview was on Realvideo, with the questions
and (very short) answers typed in the chat room. The only thing the chat 
room was really good for was to submit questions. Atlantic's web site claims
they will reshow the interview, if I find out when I'll post the info here.
My video & audio were completely fine once the interview started, I didn't
get disconnected once (which was a miracle considering my connection at home
is crap). Nothing earth-shattering was discussed, but just to see Alex attack
Geddy was worth it! (the transcriber in the chat room described it as "Alex
attacks Geddy and begins to hump madly" (he was answering the question how
they've managed to get along so well for so long). 

They were on for over an hour. The sound was a bit muffled at times, and it
was REALLY hard to hear if more than one person was talking at the same time,
but overall I'd have to give it two thumbs WAY WAY up. The questions were 
mostly OK, nothing too blatantly stupid (what does yyz stand for? what is the
trees about?). And Geddy did say that he is going through lots of videos 
from the TFE tour and would like to release a DVD to accompany DS.

When they reair it I'll tape the audio (if anyone has had success with saving
a streaming RV file lemme know) and at least transcribe it. And yes, I'm
still working on the album premiere :-)

Subject: DS is wonderful

I just got my hands on DS and it rocks! I couldn't stop listening to it
(even though it does take quite a chunk of time to get through all three
cd). It was cool to sort of rediscover songs like Stick it Out and Show
Don't Tell. I tend to listen to Hemispheres and Moving Pictures the most
often, so some of these later songs don't get lots of play around here.
Hearing the crowd throughout the cd was great too, it really had a great
effect on the energy of the music. I also have to say that I like this
live album better than ASOH in many ways--it seems more "live" somehow.
One final note: Geddy's playing is stunning on this cd. Not that I ever
doubted before, but he just seems to be all over this recording and I
love it! Makes me want to stop practicing the guitar and get into the
bass.

Subject: DS packaging

Hello fellow Rush fans,

I've read plenty of complaints about the packaging already.  Why 
don't you people pick up 3 empty jewel cases?  They only cost around 
a dollar.  That's what I've done with my boxed sets. 
(including Genesis: Archive, which is the best set ever)  
Three discs is pretty close to a boxset, anyway, so do what I do.  
Also, someone was wondering what Geddy said at the end of 2112.  I'm 
pretty sure it's "We'll be back in 20 minutes, afer some brain 
surgery."  Another thing--what the hell was that guy thinking who 
said that all these reviews are one-sided.  DS kicks ass!  A fact's a 
fact from Nome to Rome, boy!

Subject: Ditto...

To Mike Lowe who said "Anyway, I really enjoyed this...it certainly
brought back some warm memories for me.  I hope we have the opportunity
for 4 more studio
albums and another live album around 10 years from now."  Ditto, all the way.

And, to Adrianne Bosco, I too was at that Great Woods show with my
husband.  We were Texans transplanted to Rhode Island for a wee while,
and did we ever luck out!  10 rows back from Geddy, aghghghghgghh!!!
So, we have heard alot from Chicago and Great Woods.  Where are the
folks hollering from Dallas (where I live now), Toronto, Detroit and
Miami?  I think maybe that by my good fortune, the shows in Mass and
Chicago were shows of the century.  I'll tell ya,  when they had
intermission, I accidentally spilled my newly purchased shoes on some
guys shoes.  He said "That's ok, you really got into 2112 didn't you?"
I replied that I had nearly had a heart attack.  What I was thinking was
much more personal and sexual in nature, but I didn't want to blurt that
out to a stranger in front of my husband!  It was true, of about 8 shows
that I have seen in Texas, the show at Great Woods was the rockinest by
far.  I'll count my blessings!

And one last quicky note:  Has anyone noticed before Resist on DS that
Geddy says it is influenced by the country of Scotland (in a pretty good
accent, I might add)?  We were living in Scotland when T4E was released,
and that brings back great memories for me!!

Subject: Tinker Toys

I have to agree with whoever said the tinker toys have many meanings to
the cd:

Jackie and Selena page, probably Neil, Jackie and Selena.

   [ Nope.                                                   : rush-mgr ]

Back cover:  lends itself to AFTK, and then two later tours.

Big Totem pole thing:  all praise the priests of Rush, gods to us all,
no matter what other gods we may worship!! (take this one lightly ok, I
am not cultish or any freakier than the rest of you, except Julienne
Daigle.  whatever happened to him...)

Also, I agree that the guy's shirt who is hauling Alex away in front of
Odeon says "Jolly Teabag Body Guard"  Don't ask me why, my eyes suck!,
But I don't think Neil is flipping us off, I think it's pointer we see
there!

Enough of that!!  Later, Lara

ok, ps Spell check wanted to use "dangle" for Daigle.  Those of you who
remember Julienne will laugh!

Hi everybody-

Just thought I'd share some reviews I heard through my various
connections.

"I really like it. Really..." - Cindy Crawford
"This album is almost as good as Snapple (beeelch)..." - Howard Stern
"I was busy listening to this album when I killed my-I mean, when my
wife was killed..." - O.J. Simpson
"This is very definitely a live Rush album..." - Al Gore
"Jo Robinson's got some nice jugs..." - Bill Clinton
"I haven't heard this album yet but I know it's not good..." - my
brother
"Well worth a day off..." - Cal Ripken Jr.
"These guys made my name known!!" - Rush Limbaugh
"D-ff-r--t Sta--s is great!" - Vanna White
"I sure wish I could play as well as Alex Lifeson..." - Eddie Van Halen
"It clearly says Rush, and 'live' on the cover..." - Al Gore
"New Rush release? Abort! Abort!" - John Glenn
"Maybe Rush do Beatle song, I get new cow!" - Yoko Ono
"Neil says it better than I could..." - Carl Jung
"A bonus CD? Why didn't I think of that? I could be 1/3 richer!" - David
Gilmour
"Can I buy this album with my Visa card?" - Paul McCartney
"You can hear people cheering in the background..." - Al Gore
"Rush was our biggest inspiration..." - Eddie Vedder
"Four-and-a-half stars..." - Rolling Stone (wow!)
"Two Thumbs Up!" - Siskel & Ebert
"Me. I. Me. Me. I. Myself. Me." - Phil Collins
"Now you know the real reason for the lockout..." - David Stern
"If your husband continues listening to this CD, it's time to dump
him..." - Ann Landers
"Sorry, we're closed. New Rush album out..." - Denny's Restaurants
"The lead singer says 'Thank you' a lot and you can hear people
cheering..." - Al Gore

As for meself, I'm still digesting it all. Can you believe this
thrill-packed package was only $20?!? I tapes the whole thing, been
listening to it in my car since Wednesday morning, just now finished
Round 1. I'll just start by exclaiming how generous Rush is. Wow. This
is a lot of great, great music.

I particularly am blown away by the bass solo in Driven, the Discovery
portion of 2112, Natural Science as a whole (drum fills followed to the
letter!), and the heavy sound of Roll The Bones. That's just from one
listen! This is a fantastic set, I don't know how to keep it from
consuming my life for the next few weeks.

Rush is the greatest rock band in the universe!

RUSHED!,
Kurt

Hi All,

Has anyone had any luck with the Enhanced CD portion of the new album.

No matter what disc I put into my computer, it only comes up as an audio CD.

Other than that, it is an incredible album. I'm quite pleased with the
results, and I wish I could find a poster-sized image of the back of the
Hammersmith CD holder.

verse twice or did Geddy screw it up???

*snip*

When I saw 'em in Milwaukee on the TFE tour, Geddy sang NS that way here as
well, so I think they planned it that way.  Maybe just to give an old song
a different feeling when they performed it live.  Just a thought  :-)

Subject: The packaging controversy

Okay...since practically everyone is sayin' how much they hate the
packaging, let me be the first to say that I *love* the packaging!  It's
different, nothing like anything else out there, which is what Rush has
always been and done, so why should they stop now just to satisfy the fans?
 As you all know, they've never done anything to satisfy anyone else but
Rush, themselves!  So, I say again, why should they stop now?

Also, this could very well be the last LIVE album Rush releases.  I know it
sounds painful to hear (believe me, I hate thinking, "the last Rush..."
ANYTHING!), but more than likely, it's true.  So, I think we should all
appreciate what Rush have given us.  Hey...they coulda made you pay the
extra $10 or $15 for that third disc ya know! ;-)

Cheers all,

Subject: Cinderella Man - Suprise !!!

What the funk is up with Geddy's voice on DS: Cinderella Man.

Crank up your stereo (or headphones) to Disc3 - Track 11.

Pay attention starting at time=2:19 where Geddy sings "... Manic
depressive who walks in the rain ..."  then get ready --- at 2:19 Geddy
turns into one of the chipmunks when he shouts "MAKE IT FUNKY ...."
right before the jam portion of the tune.

I don't know what special effects device he has on his voice - - but I
just about crapped my pants.
It is now the high point of that particular song.

There are a couple other strange noises occurring in that song providing
some extra audio-titilation !

DS Rules !!!!  And I don't even mind the packaging - ha -ha,

To all BASS player fanatics.  This is one of my favorite albums
featuring bass.  Chris Squire's bass is really aggresive and way up in
the mix.  Actually his sound (from that era) is really close to Geddy's
70's bass sound.  Squire was also a Rickenbacker player !

Anyway, I would highly recommend this album.

I was shocked to see Geddy's answer at first - - but it makes sense when
I give it some thought.

check it out -

No, it wasn't!  I remember it very well from the AFTK tour 
concerts I attended (at Newcastle City Hall).

Geddy says "Get Funky!" (through a pitch shifter I think).  Come 
to think of it I still have a home-made bootleg from 14/2/78, it
will be interesting to compare it with the Hammersmith show from
DS recorded six days later.

Also, it's not really a bass solo, is it .. ?  More an 
instrumental section played by the whole band.

Actually although it's great that live material from way back when 
has been made available, I'm a little disappointed that it's from 
the AFTK tour which remains my least favourite live Rush memory.  
They seemed to be going through the motions a little.  I remember 
that the Hemispheres tour a year later was *much* better, the 
group had come through the slightly awkward (IMO) transitional
AFTK phase, and everything gelled together a lot better.

Subject: A few thoughts about DS

1.  The Hammersmith cover: For some reason I assumed it was Geddy's son
standing next to him.

2.  The main cd jacket, "In loving memory...": The three tinker toys
represent Neil (on top) separated from his loved ones, Selena and Jackie
(on bottom).

3.  Solution to bonus cd falling to the floor upon opening: Get a virgin
jewel case and re-release the cd and put it in order with your other Rush
cds, that is, between "A Farewell to Kings" and "Hemispheres" albums.  

4.  Just can't pry Set 3 from the walkman.  That performance could have
stood very well on its own merit, had they chosen to release it any time
before hand.  

5.  I've never gotten so much for so little money.  Rush isn't in it for
the money, or the fame.  They're about music.  That is what sets them
apart from the MTV mindset.  Do we really want them to be popular in the
mainstream?  Do we care if Rolling Stone fails to acknowledge one of the
greatest rock bands in history?  Rush is special to me precisely because
they are free from worldly contamination of unrestrained commercialism.

Subject: Geddy Lee loves RELAYER!

One of the coolest pieces of information about Rush I have heard all year
is that Geddy Lee would save Relayer from a fire if he could save only
one.  Relayer is one of my alltime favorite albums, period.  I never would
have guessed that Geddy has the same appreciation for it.  I have never
heard him mention Yes as being one of his favorite bands or Chris Squire
as being one of his favorite bass players.  Heck, I figured Geddy Lee had
never even HEARD Relayer.  That just made my day.  Now I love the album
even more.

 I can't believe it either, especially with some of the wild theories
being thrown around about the tinkertoys.
 According to the scematic on the back of the case, Tinkertoy #1 (yellow)
is Stage 1, #2 (red) is stage 2, and #3 (blue) is stage 3. Also on the
back, there are colored dots pertaining to each disk next to the track
listings; the dots are yellow (disk 1), red (disk 2), and blue (disk 3).
 Thus, the tinkertoys correspond to the disks.
 Do the colors mean anything? Doubtful, at least to me. Just primaries, an
attarctive design concept. What really got me speculating was the *space*
between the tinkertoys.
  It seemed to me that Rush has *four* (maybe five) stages, and that the
space represented a stage not represented in the CDs: the 80s. Consider
the albums recorded in the 80s (PW was recorded in 79, released in 1980,
so it doesn't count) and the songs from them on DS: MP: 2, Signals: 1,
GUP: 0, PW: 0, HYF: 0. So the missing space, almost exactly a tinkertoy in
height, represented the 80s stuff (perhaps chronicled satisfactorly on
ASOH to them).
 This made sense until I studied the scematic. Unforuntately for my
theory, the tinkertoys are labeled 1-2-3, not 1-3-4. Doh! Also, there's
the problem of the pre-2112 period, which is stage naught (0), or one,
whatever, and also the problem that disk 3 is stage 1, chronologically.
Oops. So I guess the artwork is mostly just artwork. Shucks. :)
 (Whatever it is, it's definitely not about Neil's tragedy. I think that's
a completely wacked (and inappropriate) suggestion. IMHO)

I found a couple things out regarding Clusterworks:

1) If you start your CD player and _then_ start
ClusterWorks, you can watch a light show while listening to
any CD.  You can turn off the built-in ClusterWorks music on
the menu.  It doesn't appear the music has any effect on the
show, just move your mouse to the music :)

2) There are a number of very cool settings if you move your
mouse to the bottom of the screen.  The settings bar scrolls
left and right, also.

Wouldn't you think they'd have included some instruction for
using the program?? 8^)

At the risk of pissing some people off for starting a new thread this
soon after the DS release --

My best friend (and a former TNMS list member) and I went out and saw
Pleasantville this evening, and after the movie, we started discussing
it, and parallels with Rush songs.  (This, while listening to DS...the
conversation was intersperced with comments such as, "I'm gonna crap my
pants, it sounds so good!!")  Anyway, he saw quite a few parallels with
2112, which he explained to me (somehow, I missed most of them), and I
saw quite a few....well, not exactly parallels, but "Witch Hunt" kept
popping up in my head the whole movie.

My question -- has anyone else who's seen this movie thought of any other
Rush songs that might somehow be related to it?

Heard the entire DS version of 2112 on the radio today!  I couldn't
believe it!  Quite a commercial "classic rock" station, too.  Maybe it
was a "rogue DJ."  Hopefully he's not out of a job.

Natural Science is simply incredible.  I have always loved it, and now
love it even more.  For me, witnessing it live was the greatest concert
moment ever, seconded only by the Hemispheres Prelude during the CP tour.

Is it jus me, or does YYZ sound *so* heavy?

Cygnus X-1 live?  Are you kidding me?  Anyone who complains about this CD
should be shot.

Resist is just plain beautiful.  I don't understand why this song wasn't
played 24 hours a day on the radio.  It comes off better on DS than I
thought possible. (Speaking of hits, does anybody care to speculate as to
why Half the World didn't make the cut?)  Also, according to Geddy,
Resist was inspired by a Scottish what?

I was jamming right along with By-tor and the Snowdog when they stopped
right in the middle?  Was this the way the song was performed all those
years ago?  It just seems strange to me that Rush would start a song and
not finish it.

DS favs: Natural Science, Resist, Analog Kid, Roll the Bones (comes off
so well), LTTA, RM (Is it really physically possible to do all this with
just two hands and two feet?  Are any sampling, or
recording-layers-as-you-go-techniques employed?  I watched it on the
screen-saw it with my own eyes-but still can't believe it.), Farewell to
Kings, Cygnus X-1, Cinderella Man.

And The Tinker Toy Award goes to (Song most drastically better live than
studio): Nobody's Hero

Subject: CTTH on DS Controversy

  I have been a RUSH fan for 15 years and seen several shows.  My wife
works long hours and inevitably our four year old son is subjected to
RUSH nightly as I complete household chores or office work.  One evening
when preparing the CD player for my usual routine he quoted a line from
CTTH and requested to hear it.  Needless to say, I was thrilled.  Now,
(among other RUSH tunes) he regularly requests CTTH and with help can
recite the lyrics.

My point is CTTH may be an old friend to most of us but the new/younger
fans may find CTTH or TS a turning point in their appreciation for
RUSH.  So, let it be.  If Geddy wants CTTH on DS;  I say Thank You!

I remember riding in my father's car listening to Buddy Holly on 8 track
when I was a kid and will always be a Holly fan.  I appreciate the
opportunity to do the same for my son.

Subject: Geddy's cold during AFTK tour

Hi folks,

Just reading the TNMS and there seemed be a couple of observations made with
regards to Geddy's voice during the show that appears on disk 3 of the new
release (BTW, incredible ... that's all I gotta say).

If you caught the broadcast a couple of weeks ago before the album (can I say
album still? does that date me?) was released, you will recall Geddy and
Alex's account of what happened that particular night they recorded the
show. Geddy had a cold and his voice was givin him trouble, so, he ended up
phrasing things a bit differently. Yes, his voice does sound scratchy, a bit
rough. But,
also as they both said, the quality of the musicianship on that particular
take was just right ... right enough to make on to this last release. Someone
mentioned that they thought they heard Geddy sneeze in the background during
Xanadu. That *could* very well be the case, considering Ged's state of health.

Just my $0.02 worth.

Fucking awesome collection of songs and performances!!!!! And fucking

be an honest band even with 24 years on the road! I must say, I can't

Throw it on the high-end system of your choice, and you will be 
surprised at the sound stage.   They've done an asesome job picking
up the venue ambiance, with the crowd coming from all over and 
really adding to a "you are there" experience.

There's also the bass impact that you can't get on head phones.

I've got it running at 80dB, and can't wait until daylight when
I can crank it.

>I love the sound of this CD, it's raw but so clean and crisp.  

The performances are exceptional, the recording and production 
is excellent (presumably Geddy had a lot to do with this), 
and what they've done with the crowd is unique.

Two thumbs up.

KEN DEE'S QUESTIONS (some answered)

Neil on the second floor isn't holding anything except the bar on the window
he is poking his head through. Why the second floor ???

Good call on the sneeze in AFTK. LOL
Take it off Alex !! LOL

Ditto on Bravado. I heard that live as it is on this tape at that Philadelphia
show. AWESOME !!!

The device upper left collage is a Wah Wah pedal by Morley.
Gives the guitar sound in Cinderella solo.
Crybaby is another type.

Other questions...don't have answers.

Why the turtle on the lower left collage (and again above Neils "chimes").
Conventional wisdom might say "PRESTO" however...this would not be
cronological. The same turtle appears in the correct spot later in the
collage. 

Anyone notice the tinkertoys in the crate in the picture of Neil reading a
book just below and left of those same chimes?

Misspelled band name in the "SPRO" ad clipping near the "shudder" 8-track. N A
Z A R A T H ???

Who is on the GUP access pass (Near the chimes again) ? and why is it out of
sequence ?

   [ This is a baseball player, but damn if I remember his name. I think it
     lists Rush on the back of his baseball card... someone will post his
     name I'm sure.                                             : rush-mgr ]

Curious...nothing from FBN or CoS ??? or AtWaS or ESL yet SoH gets mentioned???

What is so interesting in the picture on the Technical credits page ? Al
pointing, Neil looking (stoned ?) (what is in his hand ?) Ged looking at
Camera?  Pehaps the answer lies in the reflection in Als glasses.

Does Al own any other stage clothes ? Every picture (current) Has him in the
same shirt & pants (sometimes shirt is open with another underneath. Geddy at
least changes to flannel in one shot. I saw them 3 times this tour. Philly
twice and Phoenix once. Again Al in black. Now I have a question. I am an
amateur musician. I have played in small clubs for years. IT GETS HOT UNDER
THOSE LIGHTS !!! And we only used 30 at most.  They use 3-4-5 times that.
BLACK LEATHER PANTS with a BLACK VELOUR or is it velvet SHIRT ??? WOW !!!

Monolith pic.
The guy in the white t-shirt has no right hand.
His hand re-appears to the right over the head of the slightly grey haired 
gentleman.
There are a bunch of midgets at the same place. Or fans standing in a hole.
There is an Afro American near the foreground. Is this to be politically
correct ? I am not racist at all I just have observed over the years that Rush
does not appeal to this nationality. Don't flame me for that one.

One last observation...

Lets see how many Tinker toys we can find in the MONOLITH picture.
1. shaved into the back of dudes head
2. silkscreen on back of jean jacket
3. Earring on shaved head dude
4. white t-shirt

Subject: Problem with Clusterworks Program

Hi,

I haven't posted in a long time, or even kept up with the digest, but I
wondered if someone out there could help me with a technical problem.  I
just got DS, of course, and installed the Clusterworks program on my
Windows 95 computer.  It installed okay, but, when I try to run it, the
program crashes.  I've tried to launch it from the Program menu and from
the Control Panel, and I've tried to use it as a screen saver.  Each
time it crashes, and I get the message "Clusterworks STUPA caused an
invalid page fault in module CLUSTERWORKS STUPA.SCR at 0137:004152fl"
from screen saver mode OR "Clusterworks STUPA caused an invalid page
fault in module <unknown> at 0000:0b75fc5d" from the regular start menu.

The helpful fatal crash menu suggests contacting your software
manufacturer!  So I tried to contact the WonderLab web site, only to
find it was still under construction.  There were no instructions how to
e-mail or otherwise contact technical support.  If you have any insights
or ideas about how to solve this technical problem, please let me know. 
I'm dying to see it!  BTW, has anyone else had this problem?

Other than that, I love DS!  I also enjoyed reading the transcript of
the interview with Geddy Lee.  I like Live at Leeds and Relayer, too. 
Thanks for posting it.

Thanks for your help,
Gail

It's funny how things work out...

I went with 2 friends on a lengthy road trip from Winnipeg, MB, Canada
to Minneapolis (8 hour drive) then the next day to Aurora Ill, where we
crashed at my sister's place. We attended the show at the New World
Music Theatre. Funny, this was our first time seeing Rush (although we
are long-time fans, they have soemthing against Winnipeg, I guess!!). My
buddy FREAKED when I told him that most of the DS material (excluding
the bonus disc) were from that show!! He got excited because he was sick
during the show and couldn't really enjoy it.

Hopefully if there is going to be a live video package, it would be from
this show. I don't know if they videoed the whole thing or what.

On a side note, it's funny the non-musical things you remember from the
show: A guy beside my sick buddy eating an ENORMOUS slice of pizza which
almost made my buddy puke. Also a guy in front of us who got totally
drunk/stoned. His buddy kept having to support him and he kept reaching
for the stage like it was in 3D or something!! He also made a chilly
night much colder for himself by letting loose of his bladder half-way
through the 2nd set!!!

    Yes, but yellow, red, and blue are the three primary colors. I
think that's why they were chosen by both bands to represent the
members--only the three can create a full "palate" of colors when
mixed. It can't be a sign that Rush is breaking up because they used
the same three colors in the square-triangle-circle picture in the
1993 CP sleeve art.

    I have a point to raise about the photos in the DS packaging,
though I'm going to raise it carefully to avoid being threatened by
the "bitch-slap" guy from the last digest. While I think pasting the
tinker-toy logos into all those photos suits the band's quirky sense
of humor, and it makes the packaging somewhat more interesting and
challenging to look at, I would have rather that Hugh Syme hadn't
doctored photos of the band. Rush can do whatever they like, of
course, but it seems to me that pasting a contemporary logo into a
photo from 1978 is like drawing a mustache on a cave painting, in
magic marker. In the case of the long memorabilia photo--which is
super cool (I had forgotten what the label on the 2112 LP looks
like!)--it cheapens all of those great artifacts to know that some in
the collection have been manipulated.

    One final note, I really miss NP's wonderful prose. Geddy's liner
notes are heartfelt, but IMHO his words lack NP's wit and grace,
almost painfully so.

Jay "I'll never complain about CD's" Roberts recently waxed nostalgic when
he stated:

>>Even more nostalgic is the 8 track!  I remember that the 2112 8-track used to
click over to the next track right as Grand Finale got going!!   For those of
you who don't know about those dinosaur days,  an 8 track was engineered so
that the music slowly faded out, the track clicked (there were actually 4
tracks), and the song faded back up.  They tried to arrange things so that a
track's end was a song's end but it was not always possible.  Torture it was
for 2112 and definitely a different stage!<<

Man, how I hated those 8-tracks!!  For a couple of years after buying
"Hemispheres" on 8-track, I always thought that there was a 'break' during
the title-track after 'Dionysus' going into 'Armageddon'...that is where
the track clicked over.  I never heard the unadulterated version until a
couple years later when I saw the boys on the PeW tour.  Also, at the
beginning of "La Villa...", the track clicked over after 'Buenos Nochas...'
 Boy, those things sucked big time.

Which brings us exactly 20 years later...

I cannot help myself not to listen to this new live album *completely
cranked up*!!!!  I've heard alot of live albums in my day, and I simply
can't think of one that matches the production value of "Different Stages".
 And while some may complain about the packaging from a practical
standpoint (the loose Hammersmith disc, cardboard sleeves, etc), you can't
tell me
that the artwork and layout isn't anything less than stellar!!  Hugh Syme
just gets better with age.  I will ask this, though:  if any of our
graphically inclined Rushians out there come up with some nice scans
suitable for jewel cases, please let us know...I'd be interested.

And finally, since I don't have a CD player in the car, I had to make up a
90-minute tape of some of my personal faves from DS.  So for those who may
need to follow suit, here's the set of songs I used:

    It wasn't directly into the mic, but off to the side, the mic just
picked it up. In all of the recent interviews posted here, GL has said
that the reason this show was never released until now was that he
wasn't satisfied with his vocal performance. He said that he was
suffering from a cold that night, and that he had to adjust his vocal
phrasing to compensate. 

    It's amazing to me what high standards Rush have for their
performances. Although sometimes I hear the odd mistake at their
concerts, I really have a hard time distinguishing the subtle nuances
between performances that Rush trouble themselves with. But then,
that's why they're the musical gods they are.

Subject: Problem solved - three discs and a cardboard sleeve

I love the packaging - although it will be put in a protective sleeve
and the discs will be put into two jewel cases -

email: paulsstore@aol.com
(or maybe it's paulsstores@aol.com)
he has clear double slimline jewel cases for 2 cds (like the new marillion
remasters) and order one from him for the first 2 discs and then put the 
1978 show in a single case.

problem solved.

Subject: Ged's Voice at the HO

In regard to Chris Anderson's comments about Ged's voice - if I recall 
correctly Ged said in the premier show that he had a cold.

Cheers,
