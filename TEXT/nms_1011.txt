Actually, (and this comes from a Classical Mythology class I took several years
ago) they are accurate.  If I remember right (my books are packed in
preparation for the move, so I can't look any of this up...I will later if
you're interested...send me e-mail) there were competing philosophies of life,
or religions at some point.

The Apollonions were great believers of the dictates "All Things in
Moderation."  The followers (getting their notions, they believed, from
Apollo) felt that knowledge and understanding were the best ways to proceed, so
wisdom was kind of a goal.

The other side was symbolized by Dionysus, god of wine, partying, and sort of
in general goofing off.  The difference between the two is similar to the story
of the ant and the grasshopper...the ants worked all the time so they'd have
food for the winter, while the grasshoper played.  The two philosophies were
similar to that, and this is reflected in the song.  When Apollo ruled, the
people did lots of neat things (built cities, etc), but everything was empty,
emotionally.  When Dionysus ruled, everyone had a great ol' time, but no one
was keeping things going so that when winter came....duh, you know the story.

I think Neil was just trying to simplify by calling Apollo the God of Wisdom
and Dionysus the God of Love.  (Although he probably was the god of physical
love after reading about some of their parties!!)  We should also remember that
the Greek Gods/Goddesses were different from location to location around
Greece.  What we now know as Apollo, Athena, Zeus, etc., are really
compilations and generalizations from the myths that have been translated.

Anyone with other info (or corrections, as I'm sure there are at least a few
things wrong with this explanation :) please e-mail me...this is one of my fave
subjects (and one of my fave albums too :)

Subject: Greek Gods in Hemispheres

Gary, you're absolutely right on this one.  In Greek mythology,
Apollo was NOT the Bringer of Wisdom any more than Dionysus
was the bringer of love.  They should be Athena and Aphrodite
(or possibly Cupid?) respectively.

I think, however, that Neil isn't drawing directly from Greek
mythology here.  I've heard that Nietzsche in one of his works
discussed two distinct components of the human psyche, the
rational and the emotional, which he represented by Apollo
and Dionysus.  I'm afraid I can't give a citation here.  But that
would explain the discrepancy.  Perish the thought that Neil
would actually...MAKE A MISTAKE!

Hoping this post doesn't get swamped in a host of identical
responses the way the Golden Rule query did,

Subject: Sick and Tired!

All right, I've read enough of this crap and I can't take anymore.  I'm
getting sick and tired of reading posts complaining about the content of
posts to the NMS.  What's even worse is the people bitching about long
posts or posts that lack Rush content, because it costs them an extra
couple of pennies.

I've only been getting TNMS for about 3 months now and I love it!  Kudos
Rush-mgr!!  I enjoy reading what other Rush Fans feel about other issues
besides Rush once in a while.  So what if someone mentions something about
Yes or Primus or what Rush song they heard in their Mother's car two years
ago!  Life still goes on, the NMS still goes on and no one is any worse for
the wear.

And to the people who complain about paying for receiving TNMS.  Too
bad!  You knew what you were getting into when you subscribed to the
pay service.  Nothing angers me more than this!  ARGH!!!!!  In fact, I
hope that more people send in agonizingly long posts about their first
Rush experience (sorry Rush-mgr, I'm just trying to prove a point), what
songs they heard on the radio, who they'd have for dinner on a desert
island and their shoe sizes!  Shoe sizes?

   [ Ah yes, the shoe size question, my favorite one.. :-) : rush-mgr ]

The bottom line is that we are fortunate to even have TNMS and we should
enjoy it, no matter what!  If you don't like a post, skip it!  If it
pisses you off that much, un-subscribe, it is only YOUR loss.  I'm pretty
sure that *most* readers share my opinions, if not flame away!  But flame
here, long and hard! :)

Greeting fellow NMSers. I just wanted to post and say happy 41st birthday to
Alex. Hey Al, If you are reading this by some strange chance, quit the band
and turn golf pro. Only kidding! Any one else out there with AOL having a
problem receiving the NMS? Each edition is being sent to me incomplete and it
is really pissing me off especially since that article by Neil got cut off.
If anyone on AOL has any good Rush gif files, please upload them. Also, if
anyone out there would be willing to make me a copy of Geddy singing the
Canadian National Anthem at last years all-star game, I would be more than
happy to send you a video tape and pay the postage. Finally, I just want to
extoll the virtues of the NMS. I just think this forum is the greatest thing
in the world, except for Cindy Crawford. See ya, nelsonrx@aol.com

Subject: Hey,love songs are cool too.

 Hydee Ho Campers,

   After a long summer of working at a ham store, I am finally back at
school (anyone know the difference between a butt and a shank? I do).
To whomever was dogging the number of "love" songs on CP-HELLO?!? Are
you listening to the same albbum I am? A love song is something slow,
upbeat, and nauseating, like anything by Michael Bolton or Mariah
Carey. The Speed of Love is a "love song" in the sense that the topic
of the song is love. SOL is not sappy in the leastIf anything, it's
about how difficult love really is, as opposed to the "oh baby I was
meant for you" theme of real love songs. And Cold Fire is an Anti-love
song. What's so bad about love being the topic of a song? Yes, you
need to be very careful with a song about love, cause it's easy to
lapse into cliched sappiness (sappyness, whatever). But this *is* Mr.
Peart we're talking about, so rest assured he won't be doing any bad
remakes of "When a Man Loves a Woman". And that's all I have to say
about that.  ****Forrest Gumpism alert*****

     Call me old fashioned, but I believe in one God.

The first time I heard "Stick it Out", i was working in the back of an Italien
restaraunt, washing dishes.  I was actually a cook, but I had to throw suds
that night because of a manpower shortage(as usual).  We didn't have a radio up
front on the makeline, so I was lucky.  I was just listening to the radio, and
suddenly the announcer said "here's the new one from Rush", and then i heard
the big heavy riff.  I completly stopped work, blew off everything, and
listened until the song was over, and it was great.  Then,, acouple days later,
a local station played the whole album in its entirety before it came out(I
won't say where I'm from, because it will give away a trivia question ;), and
that was really cool too.  The day that Counterparts came out however, was a
monday morning, and I had school.  So, I skipped my first class and got a copy
for me and my friend(He did the same for Yes tickets ;).  Also, on another
topic, i just moved in to college and i already found two other Rush fans.  I
was walking outside of my hall and I heard "La Villa Strangiato" blaring from a
stereo on the 2nd floor, so of course, i went up and found him.  Later, someone
down the hall from me was blasting ASOH, so I went in there too.  He said he
was glad because there wern't any Rush fans on his floor last year.  Oh yeah,
and try playing CP through a subwoofer--Very cool.

Yes, "handle with kid gloves" does mean "handle with care", however,
a kid's gloves can be boxing gloves. My point is that Neil is playing

"PAUL  the party is in full swing . Come down"
"I'm coming", Damn there's only one thing for it. I'll have to tape The
Old Grey Whistle Test. (By tape I mean casstte not the futuristic video
stuff). I placed the mic next to the T.V. speaker and off to the ball I went.
It was a particularily poignant New Years celebration. In March that year I
had said goodbye to Deep Purple at the Manchester Apollo and I faced
entering 1975 with a big hole in my heart.
My New Years day coma was dragging me down for the third time as I
listened to the previous nights scratchy tape recording. Then it just
jumped out at me, shook me by the throat and screamed LISTEN to this, it
IS the FUTURE!!!!
I rewound & listened again, then again,again, again. Who is it? What is it?
(It's difficult to appreciate now but in 1974/75 there was nothing quite
like it). The problem was that I didn't know the song title or the band.
Frantic, I spent the next 3 months humming the tune to every music store
guru & every jock I knew... No luck. I resigned myself to wearing out the
tape and never knowing if it was just a visitation until...
A Canadian friend of a friend came over for the summer holidays. We got
talking, we like the same music, he says "you'll like this" and lends me
an album called RUSH by RUSH. No big deal I'll check it out....
I placed the vinyl on the table...Hiissss.. crack..hisss BANG!!!!!

         Finding my Way

p.s. I have recently migrated to Australia has Rush ever toured here or
plan to in the future?
Counterparts is the first tour I've missed since 2112 and I had to have
the album imported

   [ Rush has never toured Australia, and to my knowledge (from what I 
     remember of interviews) they never plan to.  : rush-mgr ]

Does anybody have a precise rundown of Alex Lifeson's current
equipment?  I know he's using PRS guitars, but I'm interested in
knowing the specifics -- like what kind, etc. Is it the CE or EG
bolt-ons and is he using the standard PRS pickups or has he replaced
them with active single-coils like the Evans he used to use in the
Signatures? I also know he's switched to Marshall and Peavey 5150
amps, but what about the effects rack he used to have with the
Gallien-Krueger amps? Any info would be appreciated. Thanks!

Subject: Apollo & Dionysius

   On reading the recent 'Apollo & Dionysius in Hemispheres' thread, I
remembered a section in one of Ayn Rand's books ('A New Left; The
Anti-Industrial Revolution' - a collection of essays that seem to have
been written in the Sixties).
   This particular essay basically divides contemporary culture into
rational (ie objectivist, signified by Apollo) and emotional (ie everyone
else, signified by Dionysius) and proceeding to show how (in her opinion)
the objectivists are best [not 'better' - that would be too relative a
term ;-)  ]
   Bearing in mind how much of Rand's work our Neil read in Rush's early
days, he MUST have been aware of this, which would suggest that the plot
of Hemispheres is symbolic of either his own personal moving away from a
strictly objectivist PoV, or of his hopes for this partisan, bi-polar
society we live in learning to live with itself.

Subject: Rush area in MUD...

I posted this idea in a.m.r. last night, and I want to know what ya'll
think.  I have begun programming in a MUD, I was tossing around the idea
of having a Rush domain, sort of a Rushland.  What do you think?  If you
were playing a MUD and you saw this, would you pass it off as cheesy, or
would you try it and see what it's like?

My general thoughts are that it pretty much should be a collection of
puns relating to Rush, not necessarily players trying to recreate the
acension to godliness in Hemispheres.  Just in case you don't read
a.m.r., here's a few ideas to get the ball rolling...

How about a lake (between sun and moon?) where one of the goals is to
reach the alien shore, or find the Red Tide?  and there could be a small
park next to it (Lakeside Park).

How about a mountain Pass?  And if there's rivers nearby, the sound of
running water could set the stage for finding a strange device.  When you
touch it, it gives forth a sound...   or maybe the sound of Permanent Waves?

something with YYZ as the secret knock into a clubhouse...?

Since I am not familiar with the first 3 albums, if anybody has any ideas
regarding those, I'll need some explanation behind the songs as well.
Hell, I could always use different points of views on any song, so fire away!

I look forward to seeing some replies, either e-mail or here (so long as
they don't clutter the newsletter.

in general, not just love.

"K. M. Fritzsche" also sayeth:

>>...When it came to Counterparts, a lot of the songs just reminded me of
>>the ones from PeW.....It seems like a waste of the power trio's talent to be
writing stuff (love songs)like that....              ^^^^^  ^^^^

>> ...my favorite RUSH album is Hold  Your Fire.
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For you the best display of Rush's talent as a power trio is HYF ??  I guess
I better compare other power trios against these three efforts by rush.

    BTO: Guitar, bass and drums
    Green day: Guitar, bass and drums
    Nirvana:Gutiar, bass, drums and a stiff

    HYF: lots of sequenced keyboard parts, sampled vocals, a string section
         as well as guitar, bass and drums
    CP and PEW: minimal synths usually played by someones feet, guitar, bass
                and drums.

Seems like of these three rush albums, HYF is the one that least resembles the
work of a power trio's work.

Hey.

I missed a few issues there, so I don't know if this was
mentioned, but I thought I heard somewhere that Kid Gloves
dealt with the ending of the relationship between Rush and
Terry Brown.

Also, what is the line 'disclose the myth, repeal the fifth'
from?  I don't think it's Rush, but does anyone recognize these
lyrics.  It's been bugging me.

Thanks,

 Hi people...just thought I'd give another misc. respone-thang...

Jim Heuser sez:

 ---
In response to Gary Barnette on Neil's interpretation of Apollo and Dionysus:
My handy "Cliffs Notes book of Mythology" does list Apollo as being (among
other things) the god of intelligence.  The same book says Dionysus "served
to liberate the emotions and to inspire men with joy."  I think these would
support the gods as written in Hemispheres.  Besides, Neil did not limit his
idea of Dionysus and Apollo to the strict Classical version, per se; he was
inspired by the book _Powers of Mind_ by Adam Smith.  Check it out!
 ---

 This I think is quite right.  Apollo is also the patron god of the
Delphic Oracle, where many received inspiration and guidance; it's mentioned
in Sophocles' OEDIPUS plays, as well as briefly in Shakespeare's THE WINTERS'
TALE.  There is also another useful distinction: Euripedes' THE BACCHAE makes
a general distinction, I believe, between the CIVITAS (i.e.
"culture"/"civilization") and the WILDERNESS (I don't know the Greek word, so
shoot me :) ) embodied in the Bacchanalia (passionate drinking/orgies) or
Dionysius.  Gestaly psychology also places Reason (generally) on the left
side of the brain, and Emotion (in general) on the right.  Which makes sense
on the cover of Hemispheres, at least to me..that's the way the brain seems
to be looking!

 Tom Lockwood (yo Tom) sez:
 ---
    I can't believe this Gord,  I'm talking  to a lame-ass here man!
    I made it clear that I was one of those  people who got internet
    access free through my place of employment.  And I also though I
    made it clear that I was becoming sensitive to those  net  users
    who had to pay for lists like these. Jump in here anytime Laura!

    Here's the real question: How many "N.M.S." subscribers would be
    willing to pay for each issue of the star?  Jimmy can take a bow
    because some obviously were faced with the decision and  decided
    go through with it.
 ---

 Well, personally I find a lot of the messages (i.e. the Golden Rule
stuff) repetitive.  On the other hand, some people read TNMS later than
others, and give their perfectly viable contributions whenever they can, so
that's cool.  On the other hand, I don't pay for this either, so I can see
how the small talk might get irritating (i.e. non-Rush content, etc).  On the
other hand, it seems to be more of a "voluntary assumption of risk" thing.
Or I'm on drugs.

 Upon re-reading this I find I have too many hands.  Alas.

Subject: First listen.

Hey all you in NMS land!

        The recent issue of when you heard your first Rush song just came
up.  To quote, "Here's my $.02."
        I was a sophmore in high school (I'm a freshman at Penn State now).
A bunch of my friends were seniors, and they were all into Rush.  This was
that time in my life when I wanted to be a musician, as I'm sure all of you
once felt.  I couldn't play the bass for my life, but I figured I could be
as good as Geddy in no time <g>.
        Anyway, I'm in the music room with my friends, and they put on
"Closer to the Heart" of of ASOH.  I don't remember the song, but that bass
solo drew me in faster than you can imagine.  After that I considered myself
a Arush fan.
        But it wasn't until the summer that I really began to appreciate
them.  I was on a cross-country teen tour (USY on Wheels, for those who
care), and the only tape I had was Chronicles.  "Freewill," "Tom Sawyer,"
and "Spirit" are the ones that really hooked me.  I bought "Archives," yet I
didn't really like it.
        Only recently have I begun to really get a taste for it.  "The
Fountain of Lamneth" is one of my favorites, but I can't stand "Going Bald."
        When I first heard "Counterparts," I was very disappointed.  I
didn't like their new harder sound, Although I thought "Animate" was
brilliant.  Where were the different bass lines I had come to know so well?
The bass was actually playing the same thing as the guitar!  After I saw the
video for sitck it out, however, I changed my mind.  Watchng Geddy scream
"Don't swallow the poison" made me appreciate the song and their new sound.
        Well, I guess I've said about $.12 worth.  Happy listening!

Helloooo Nurse! (the nurse, of course, being a big ol' hunky man)

    Why, pray tell, do we as humans, fanticize and wonder about being
stranded on deserted islands? Must be some sort of Gilligan's Island

favorite CD's with me that day, in case of such an emergency, this
would be my selection:
          Tori Amos-Under the Pink (because we were separated at birth)
          Rush-Roll the Bones (because it was my 1st Rush album)
                              (and it ROCKS!)

                                        Toupee)

 The first Rush song I ever heard was Distant Early Warning. I
remember hearing it because I remember the video-they played it all
the time on MTV. Those were the days of Legs and Let's Go Crazy.
I remember also that I hated it. I thought the little kid riding
around on the rocket was stupid (yeah, I know, ZZ Top's video was *so
much better*. Hey, I was only 10. Give me a break!). I did think
Geddy's bass was cool-that black trapeziod-shaped one. Needless to
say, I aquired better taste in my maturity. I recently saw Through the
Camera Eye, and it was a HOOT! I jumped up and screamed when DEW came
on. I have to say, 80's videos are entertaining-cheesy, bad effects,
cute little storyline!  Well this is much too long as it is, so I'll

 Sure!  GUP is my absolutely favorite album, because of the
meaning of the songs you have listed (it always gives me the chills)...

1.)  Red Sector A (named after a site at Kennedy Space Center) is about a
     futuristic (I think of a Nazi) concentration camp.  The main character
     has lived through hell, but his hell is not over, as he has no idea
     what the fray at the gate is.  I have thought of some wider-reality
     meanings to the song, but can't recall them :)

2.)  Between the Wheels (awesome) is about life and the feeling of being
     just shuffled through at an uncomfortable pace.  People who just can't
     seem to adjust to the pressures of life with grace (pun)...check these

First Rush exposure:  I was sitting in 10th grade English class listening to
an N.W.A. album (Straight Outta Compton) on my walkman, and my friend Daryl
who was a big Aerosmith fan had Exit... Stage Left in his walkman.
(we didn't get much English done in there).  Anyhow, he wanted to hear
N.W.A. so I took his tape and listened to "Xanadu" (that's where he stopped
listening to it) I thought the beginning was alright, but not great.  I took
the tape home and listened from the beginning and it changed everything.
The transitions and Geddy's little comments were really neat.  Needless to
say Daryl didn't get his tape back (it was near the end of the school year)
and I went out and bought it along with a few other albums (namely GUP and
Signals).  Now everytime I get a chance to buy Rush stuff I get it (Just got
my Rush Keychain in the mail from BMG!) except that velvety-black Rush cap
from the CP concert.  I think it's too 'pretty'.  But hey, to each his (or
her) own...

The Albums on the island:
1. Exit... Stage Left (it 'deflowered' me)
2. The soundtrack to "The Seventh Guest" CD-ROM game (Really cool)

2. Chuck Yeager - Has balls the size of the sun
3. Alex Lifeson - Really good sense of humor (and great guitarist)
   (ok, so I'd invite all three, but who wouldn't?)
4. Purple Motion (Jonne Valtonen) - Makes incredible music on the computer
5. Traci Lords (the porno star) - For reasons I cannot detail

 Boy, this is great... a lot of your First Rush experience stories
are really something. Mostly because I wish mine could have been like
those, instead, it was really STRANGE!

 I was 10 and the current Rush album was p/g, though I could not
have known that. I had heard NO Rush, ever.

 It came to pass that I was to go on a camping trip, and next
thing we knew, I was hiking along with some friends and our families
along a trail in northeastern Arizona, near the Mogollon rim. A friend my
age, Tom, was there and his older brother had brought a boombox and
tunes. So this older bro, Mike, throws on "Moving Pictures". I could not
believe how damn AWESOME Tom Sawyer sounded. We began jumping around and
having a whale of a good time, and the album played through. Red
Barchetta was incredible. YYZ was mind-blowing. I didn't even understand
Limelight, TCE, WH, and VS until later that night when the shock of those
first three songs wore down.

 Later, with a fire crackling and the stars above us, the music
was cranked, and The Camera Eye was particularly emotional... the "Are
they oblivious? To this soft spring rain, like an English rain, so light
yet endless in a leaden sky... YEAH!" just as the clouds gathered and the
rainy mist began to descend. It was my first RushMoment(Tm). Then, with
the lightning blaring around our tentlike pavilion (hey, we were
youngsters, okay?) and the deck of cards out and the lantern lit, Vital
Signs cranked a tight, powerful strain of rock music into the forest
night. We were having a blast.

 The next day (after having heard all of MP about 8 times) Mike
threw in A Farewell to Kings, and the title track, Xanadu, and especially
Closer to the Heart were almost too much to handle. I was drinking the
milk of paradise, mentally. After the trip ended they let me borrow
Exit... Stage Left, which was the only Rush album I had for over a year.
(hey, I was ten, okay? I had no money and no clue.) The first album that
came out while I was a fan was Power Windows, and by the time Hold Your
Fire came out, I was a diehard, pounding on the Tower Records doors. :)

 Another camping trip with the same families ensued when HYF was
new. This time we spent two weeks on the Highline Trail in n.AZ. Rain was
plentiful, and "High Water" and "Second Nature" became the group
favourites. They still stand as my two highlights off HYF. It was great
to see Tom and Mike again, this time with me armed with a cassette
carry-along full of Rush albums! :)

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR RUSH PLAY ON THEIR NEXT TOUR???

I know about 6-7 new songs, probably.
I'd say also count on Dreamline, Animate, Stick It Out, Cold Fire, The
Pass (possibly), Force Ten (maybe), YYZ, Limelight, The Trees, and La Villa.

I would like to see them give Sawyer, Spirit, and CTTH a REST.

I would be in ecstasy to see included in the setlist: Making Memories, No
One At The Bridge (yeah like they'd play it!), Something for Nothing,
Cinderella Man, a bit of Natural Science, Vital Signs, Losing It, Grand
Designs, Second Nature, High Water, Red Tide, The Big Wheel, and/or CTTC.

Subject: Lakeside Park Adventure

After having read Peart's article "A Port Boy's Story" in NMS#1007, I jumped
at an invitation to find Lakeside Park in St.Catherine's, Ontario.  With the
sad story of the Southern Californian whose Lakeside Park adventure was
aborted at the border, I wondered why I hadn't thought of the trip before.

I jumped into my freshly waxed Miata, my own little Red Barchetta.  I stuffed
the trunk with my camera bag, loaded up the CD player with Chronicles and I
was off. "Finding My Way!"

I picked up a fellow Rush fan, and the instigator of this journey and hit the
401 West, picked up the Queen Elizabeth Way and headed south towards Niagra.
The lack of St. Catherine's distance signs caused some anxiety, but in about
half an hour there were signs for St.Catherine's, 40km!

Since we didn't exactly know where the park was, we headed to downtown
St.Kit's and picked up a map at what seemed to be the only gas station in
town.  I guess the cheaper gas across the border in Buffalo, kept gas
stations from proliferating there.

The map showed it all... Lakeport Avenue, Peart's home in St. Catherine's was
just minutes away from Lakeside Park.

Surprisingly, there was some night life around the park.  The parking lot was
even full! When we finally parked across the street and made it to the park,
it was satisfying to find all the landmarks mentioned in the song.  To the
west there is a merry-go-round for only 5 cents, a lighthouse to the east, a
pier and one prominent willow tree.

We had a few beer at a bar that overlooks the park.  Luckily, Chronicles was
in the jukebox, so I couldn't resist playing LSP... I'm sure they've probably
heard it thousands of times, but I had to satisfy myself.  My selections
ended with La Villa Strangiato; the somewhat older crowd on the patio didn't
seem to appreciate the ten odd minutes of their time that I took up.

Of course, Peart was right, the magic had faded.  What's left of Lakeside
Park appeared to me to be nothing more than a yuppy hangout.  (Someone was
having wedding pictures taken there!)  There's no more midway, no games, not
even a sign to consider stealing.  I tried to imagine a young Peart,
operating one of the games at the midway, wondering of the greatness that he
would come into.

There really is nothing else to do in St.Catherine's.  I almost felt sorry
for Peart, who had to grow up in this sleepy town.  I can't imagine what they
do for fun here! (I guess we all know, hey beer stores were open past 9:00 on
a Saturday there!)  I guess that's why he took up drumming, and I guess we
can all be thankful for that.

I hope that didn't take up too much of your time.

Hey hey Rushfns....any guitarists out there?
I play drums(I love trying to keep up with Neil), but I also dabble in
guitar. I got into guitar because of Rush and I love playing along with
Alex. Counterparts is filled with heavy distortion and power
chords(Yes!!!). I was wondering if anyone has figured out the riff for
Between Sun & Moon. It's really killer and I haven't been able to
duplicate it. I don't know if it's in an alternate tuning or what. Can
anyone help me out?

In one of last weeks issues, someone was asking people(other drummers)
what they like about Neil's style etc. Precision is the first thing that
stands out to me. He's able to perform complex patterns and such with
such exactness that it's truly frightening. I'm really blown away by his
drumming on early albums such as FlyBN/FareTK/Hem. He throwns in awesome
fills just when I think he has settled into a pattern.
I love how his drumming had enhanced Alex's solos(LaVilla,Losing It{the
electric violin solo by BM})

Have to agree there--anybody paying Prodigy or Compuserve or eWorld prices is

This is obviously coming from somebody who hasn't priced out dial-up
university sites lately.  I got the InterNIC list, and the cheapest rates I
saw were in the $20-$30/month range, plus long distance fees.  In addition,
the software requirements for a PC or Mac are a royal pain in the ass.

You know, it's _real_ easy to say something like that when you don't have to
pay for your service.  I ought to know, I was either in college or on a .com

From: krostenk@uclink.berkeley.edu (Brian A. Krostenko)
Subject: Apollo and Dionysus

Hail Rushmates,

In response to Gary Barnette's question (NMS 1009),  I think that in
composing "Hemispheres" Neil had in mind not only the ancient gods
themselves, but those gods as they are used by Friedrich Nietzsche in "The
Birth of Tragedy".  Nietzsche developed the opposition between Apollo and
Dionysus that does appear in Greek culture into metaphors for various
psychological forces and realms, -- such as (respectively) vision vs.
music, dream vs. intoxication, poise vs. revel, the individual vs. the
collective-- that spur each other to greater  heights, specifically
artistic or creative heights, by their 'constant conflicts and periodic
acts of reconciliation'.  Nietzsche sees the splendor of classical Greek
tragedy as the result of the union between these opposing forces.  I don't
know Nietzsche enough to know if he also saw this opposition as the driving
force for the creation of *all* human culture (any help out there?), but
that certainly is the use to which Neil has put it, each opposing force
driving incipient human culture into extreme situations that it can only
remedy by appealing to the other force (with disaster eventually ensuing,
until Cygnus fixes things, ideally at least).  The image of hemispheres
might then be Peart's combination of Nietzsche's opposition with more
recent thinking about left brain-right brain differences (or maybe it's
just Hugh Syme's [he did that one, no?] interpretation of Neil's
interpretation of Nietzsche's interpretation of the Greek gods.  Mmm.  I
have a headache.).  I imagine that the emphasis on balance is also Peart's
addition, the 'love of truth' being Apollonian and the 'truth of love'
Dionysian, and both being necessary for a well-rounded, dare I say
spherical, life.  I've always enjoyed how the music at the end fits into
such a vision, becoming so gentle and soothing after the tension, energy,
and drive of the preceding parts.

Oh, one more thing, if I recall from FAQ rightly, Alex's original last name
was 'Zijonovic' or the like.  I thought you might like to know that
'Lifeson' must be his sly translation thereof.  The '-ovic' (pronounced
-oh-vitch) suffix in the Slavic languages is a patronymic, indicating the
father (hence good old Gorby was Mikhail Sergeyevich "Mike, son of Serge").
 One might reasonably turn this in English as "-son", as in "Johnson" etc.
As for the "life" part, the Slavic languages share a similar word for
'life', Pol. zycie, Russ. zizn, Serbo-Cr. zivot, etc.  Hence 'Zijonovic'
could, quite literally, be "Life's son".  Sly bugger, ain't he?

AH-OOGA AH-OOGA AH-OOGA!

Zounds!  Sorry, gang, that's my optional 'Rambling-on-Line Alert Horn'
feature, which I installed to protect my friends and readers like you!  I
have to go now.

Hi All.

I assume you all know this already, but Stick It Out is transcribed in the
latest issue of modern drummer.

I thought this was the Rush Network, not the Yes Network.

I heard ENTRE NOUS on Big Daddy's 4-play the other day on 101.1 WRIF in Detroit
and almost drove off the road because of the shock.

I thought the RED STAR represented communism, not satanism.

Do any drummers out there know what size or different sizes of drum sticks NP
uses? (I've never seen him use non ProMark wood tip)

My 3 desert island CD's:

The 3 live ones.
