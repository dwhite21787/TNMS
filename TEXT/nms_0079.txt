[ This post is a service from David Datta, a fellow list-member and 
  discography maven.  This is a first draft, so if you have corrections,
  *please* don't post back - mail him directly.  According to him, just
  about anything goes; that includes things like _RUSH Through Time_, etc.
  As you might notice, the date on the mail is a bit old; I guess I'm 
  getting senile...                                            :rush-mgr ]

Abbreviations Key:

Album
          Full album release.

7" Single
          7" Vinyl release, usually a single from an album.

2X7" Double 7" Pack
          2 7" Vinyl discs packaged together.

CS
          Cassette Single Release

12" Single
          12" Vinyl release

CD Video
          5" CD Video release

CD5 Single
          5" CD Single release (ok, 4.77 inches)

(CD) Collection Album
          A collection of songs that are released on various albums and the
          total collection is too large to be called a single. The collection
          albums do not necessarily have the exact same versions that are
          included on the album or 12" releases.

Compilation Album
          A collection album that has various tracks from other albums. These
          tracks are the same as the tracks found on the Singles and Album
          releases.

Live Album
          A collection of new and previously released songs recorded live.

Notes:
          The times listed on the albums and collections are from the CD
          releases unless otherwise noted.

          Most CD track times were found using a Sony Discman D555 CD player and
          the time on your CD player may vary slightly (+- 5-8 seconds) due to
          the way different machines calculate track times.

          Additional information is welcomed, especially Singles, videos,
          bootlegs and instrumentation information on the albums.

          I KNOW the tracks for the CDs of the live albums are different from
          those on the LP/2LP releases. I do not know where the missing tracks
          are on the albums, please help.
