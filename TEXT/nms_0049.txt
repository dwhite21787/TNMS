Subject: Administrivia

Ok folks, there's a couple of things I need to say, then I'll get out
of your way.  First of all, there was no Digest for Wednesday, 9/11.
I was flat on my back from this #$%^& ankle and didn't make it to work.

Secondly, let me say (much to my chagrin) that the duplication problem
that has plagued this list is still with us.  For those new to the list,
let me reiterate (the rest of you can yawn, stretch, get coffee, whatever):
This list is being run from a DECstation 3100 running Ultrix, a flavour of
UNIX.  Due to the large size of the list (about 350 people, I haven't 
counted recently), the mail sits in the outbound queue for an extraordinarily
long time.  This confuses the mail daemon, which for some unfathomable
reason, decides to send a second copy.  It happens just about every time,
and always only two copies (not three or four).  I have tried different
things to fix this, including two system upgrades, but to no avail.  I 
could split the outbound list into two or more sub-lists, but that would
require time I don't have right now, and would make administration more 
tricky.  Unfortunately, I'm faced with a deadline at work, so there will
be no change until at least October.  Please bear with us, and just delete
that second copy.  NOTE:  Check that issue number!  There may be multiple
issues on any given day.  This brings me to my next point:

Long postings.  I'm talking about tourbook transcriptions, source stories
for songs, etc.  These are wonderful submissions, and we're all grateful
for them.  Unfortunately, they are also LARGE.  I have at least one site
which rejects mail that's too large, and I probably shouldn't distribute
such large postings in one chunk anyway.  So here's my solution:  if you
have something large to post (over 100 lines) that's a special item, not
just a reply to the Digest, please send it to the administrative address.
This way, I'll distribute them as special editions of the Digest (Extra!
Extra!  Read all about it!), and we can make things easier all the way 
'round.

Remember, any pertinant addresses for mail are at the end of every Digest.
Please don't send subscription/cancellation mail to the posting address,
and vice versa.  This makes life easier for me in general.

One more thing: Once again, PLEASE keep your postings down to 70 char-
acters/line.  There are still people who are posting with lines from 
85-200 characters.  Apparently your systems are making you think the 
lines are being broken when they really aren't.  The solution to this 
is to manually break the lines; if you leave about an inch between the 
end of the line and the right side of your screen/window, that should 
take care of the problem.

Well, enough of me.  Onto the interesting stuff!

Subject: Rush on the radio

     I have a question and a comment to make about Rush's airtime. First, I
am located at the University of Illinois (central Illinois), and there
actually is a pretty decent college station here called WPGU. Every week day
at lunch the station plays songs from a single group, a year, or a genre of
rock music. As luck would have it today was Lunch with Rush. I got a full
hour of Rush plus two songs for dessert, an hour and 10 minutes total time.
This station typically gets in two or three Rush tunes a day which I can
live with so all in all the radio is an enjoyable diversion.
    Now for my question. This in mainly for any subscribers in or from the
Chicago area. I frequently travel through the Chicago area on my way to
Wisconsin, and when driving through I listen to WCKG. CKG touts itself as
playing all the classics from the '60's, '70's, and '80's. I've logged up
some pretty heavy listening hours on CKG and I've yet to here one Rush tune.
What's there problem?? I have heard plenty of Led Zepplin (of course), Yes,
Kansas, ELP, etc. (bands with a progressive image). In general, I enjoy all
of these bands but I fail to understand why Rush is not on their playlist.
Any suggestions?

Subject: Who says radio sucks?

I had quite a pleasant ride home last night from my fiance's house...

I flip to some station in Worcester, and I hear the beginning of "Tom Sawyer",
when that's over I flip to a Providence station... "Show Don't Tell" is
playing, and right after that, they play "Limelight"... flip again... to a
Boston staion I think..."New World Man" is just starting....

WOW!  4 Rush songs, rapid fire, on 3 different stations.  What a great drive!

If you were wondering why I'm listening to the radio instead of Rush tapes in
my car... my tape deck ate half of them.... 8^(

I just had to tell you all that...

Subject: Resume the Final Count

	RADIO AIRPLAY:  In Washington, D.C, Rush gets very little
airplay.  When they are played, it's usually "Spirit of Radio".

	This miserable state of affairs brings up a question: does
anybody have any figures on the sales of Rush albums and/or singles?
What is their biggest seller?  How does this compare to the sales of
the artists that get constant airplay?

	SPEAKING OF NUMBERS:  While we're playing the numbers game,
here's some tables you might find interesting.  Then again, maybe not.
Here they are anyway.

STAGE         ALBUM           Word Count
----- --------------------- -------------
 (4)   Presto                  2240
 (3)   Hold Your Fire          1946
 (3)   Power Windows           1512
 (1)   RUSH                    1447
 (3)   Signals                 1427
 (1)   Caress of Steel         1349
 (1)   2112                    1188
 (3)   Grace Under Pressure    1182
 (2)   Moving Pictures         1049
 (1)   Fly By Night            1125
 (2)   Hemispheres              958
 (2)   Permanent Waves          879
 (1)   A Farewell to Kings      848

STAGE         ALBUM         Number of I's
----- --------------------- --------------
 (1)   RUSH                     114
 (4)   Presto                    57
 (3)   Hold Your Fire            51
 (1)   Caress of Steel           45
 (1)   Fly By Night              33
 (1)   2112                      28
 (3)   Grace Under Pressure      22
 (2)   Hemispheres               17
 (2)   A Farewell to Kings       11
 (2)   Moving Pictures           10
 (2)   Permanent Waves            5
 (3)   Power Windows              5
 (3)   Signals                    4

	The first table is a word count of just the lyrics for each
album.  This count excludes titles and extra text, like the story text
in 2112.  The second table is a count of the number of times the word
"I" appears in the lyrics.

	I thought this analysis might lend some insight into the
evolution of Rush and maybe reveal why I liked certain albums more
than others ** just from the lyrical perspective **.  For example,
would songs with the first person "I" actually feel more personal?
(The string 1-0-0-1-0-0-1 was not counted as an "I").

	It turned out that this kind of analysis didn't provide me
with much insight into how I respond to the various albums.  I like
them all so much it's hard to put any kind of preferential order to
them!  I also realize it's the music that seems to have more of an
overall affect; but while one brain hemisphere gets entranced by the
music, the other hemisphere is busily processing the words.

	However, there are a couple of interesting items to notice in
the above two tables.  Stage 1 and 2 definitely dominate the lower
half of the Word Count table, while the later Stages dominate the top
half.  Neil is getting wordier as he matures.  This seems to be a
characteristic of most writers.

	I don't know how to interpret the Number of I's table.  The
first album, RUSH, had exactly twice as many I's as the next
contender, their latest album.  Does this mean that the first album
was twice as "personal" as Presto?  Not for me; in fact, the reverse
is probably true.  Oh well, enough blathering for now.

	What?  Get a life, you say?  Ha ha ha.  Rush *is* life!

Subject: Victoria Day

	Alright, alright already, so I can't see past the nose on my face!
All the time I was looking for the holiday on the 24th of May, I did not
bother to look at the adjacent days for other holidays. Victoria Day is not
that popular in Quebec as it refers to the ENGLISH monarchy. Here we have
an alternative holiday called Dollards Des Ormeaux (some guy in some war
not sure which, I don't celebrate this either). It hadn't occurred to me
that Victoria Day was not on a specific DATE instead of DAY.

	Anyways, see you later.
