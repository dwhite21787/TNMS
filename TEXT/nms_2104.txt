Subject: New Producers for Rush

I might be behind the times when I list these people, since I have their
work from a couple of years ago, but here goes:

1. Rick Parashar (Pearl Jam, 'Ten') 
   Before Brendan O'Brien started doing Pearl Jam's albums (who
   coincidentally looks like a younger Alex Lifeson), Rick produced the
   album that established Pearl Jam in the realm of rock.  He was the
   right guy at the right time- and the results show; 'Ten' is an instant
   classic. 

2. Ron Saint Germain (Living Colour, 'Stain')  
   'Stain' is very much an overlooked album.  The cool thing about the
   sound on this album is that it sounds 'live' as opposed to studio
   produced.  You can hear every instrument clearly and _loudly_.

3. Flemming Rasmussen (Metallica, 'Ride the Lightning,' 'Master of
	Puppets,' and '...And Justice For All')
   'Master of Puppets' is the most solid Metallica album, and Flemming
   knew how to capture the sounds.  However, he's best suited for analog
   recording, since the digitally recorded '...And Justice For All' came
   out a bit too dry for my liking.

4. David Hentschel (Genesis, '...and then there were three')
   While Genesis definitely lost something when Steve Hackett left, the
   remaining three members were able to create a sonically expansive album
   with the help of Dave.

I would have suggested getting the tag team of Steve Lillywhite and Tom
Lord-Alge, who did wonders for Dave Matthews Band's 'Crash,' but I
consider Steve to be out of the picture since he wussed out on working on
GUP.  

Those are my thoughts on the matter... thanks for reading

Subject: A Work In Progress

Wow! I just finished watching Neil's incredible video project showcasing
his drumming skills.  I know this is not new, but it's worth repeating.
>From the very beginning Neil captures your attention with his soft
spoken voice and articulate, intelligent delivery.  If a person did not
know who Neil was, he could easily be mistaken for some college music
professor.  He talks about his drumming/music history and leads into the
change of style and technique in preparation for their most recent cd.
Even as a non-drummer I enjoyed listening to his approach to creating
the appropriate drum routine for each song.  I can only imagine how much
more enjoyable this video would be for a seasoned drummer to watch.

Between songs we get a more in-depth view of this talented yet humble
man as he shares his thoughts about music and writing songs.  Then we
get a step by step demonstration of how he plays the songs on TFE. Also
he tells us WHY he chooses certain routines ("I do this to build
suspense" {thump, thump, thump}"then I do that to release"{thump, crash,
crash, thump}"which compliments the lyrics and the other guys").  Then,
of course, we get to watch him drum along with all of the songs on the
album, a nice treat.

One of the amusing parts of the video for me was to hear him briefly
mention the music piece on 'Moving Pictures'.  I had never really
thought about how it was pronounced to him, but for us Americans YYZ
sounds like Y-Y-ZEE, while  north of the border it is pronounced
Y-Y-ZED.  

I highly recommend this video to any avid Rush fan, and especially to
the drummers.  Now if we can only get Alex to do one!

>>LOL!!!!! I gotta tell you, after I read that, I kept hearing the two most

>>"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!!!"
>>And, of course, the greatest of all:
>>"Oh, my nose!"

>>"Mom always said "Don't play ball in the house.""

OK, since we know Eve Plumb reads these and I religiously watch the Brady
Bunch, I have to correct DigitlMn, it is "Mom always SAYS (present tense),
don't play ball in the house.

Also, the person who was quoting Jan as saying "Oh, my nose", I don't remember
that episode.  The episode with the nose was when Marcia was nailed by a
football and subsequently had her date cancel on her because "something came
up".

Subject: First NMS posting

Hey all!

I've been reading the NMS for a few weeks now.  I've enjoyed reading the
postings--although a few of them make me wonder. . . 
Anyway--I've been a Rush fan since my brother (who is an excellent drummer)
started listening to MP in the early 80's.  I've purchased every CD from MP
on.  I also have a copy of Permanent Waves.  I was excited when I purchased
Chronicles because I would be introduced to the earlier Rush material that I
really hadn't heard before.  What did I think?  Well--I wasn't that
impressed.  You have to understand that I've never been a big fan of the
vocal approach taken by Geddy in the early years.  It almost sounds like
"screeching" to me.  (Again--my opinion)
I've also been disappointed by Rush's latest efforts.  The "in your face"
big loud sound that Rush has done on CP and TFE almost seem a cop out
compared to the work they did on MP-HYF.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that
Rush is "progressive" (although some might argue that point).  They are
constantly re-inventing there style of music.  However--I, for one, don't
really care for the direction they have taken.  Does anyone else agree with
me?  Again--all this is my opinion.  I'm sure some bozo out there is going
to slam my opinion. I say its OK to agree to disagree, but don't slam (or
flame) me because your opinion doesn't match mine.

Thanks for listening.

Hi Everybody, 
     I was just watching "Coming Attractions" on E! and they showed the
trailer for the new Adam Sandler Movie "The Waterboy." This is the other movie
that has TS on the soundtrack.
     This movie looks really funny! It's about a guy who doesn't really have
any social skills and is always being picked on. Finally, he can't take it
anymore and starts to fight back, by joining the college football team that he
is the waterboy for.
     Since he's only really a fan of pro wrestling, he uses wrestling moves to
tackle the opposition.
     The movie comes out Nov. 6. Just 2 weeks before DS! This movie could be a
good boost for sales of the album. I see why the band decided to put TS on it!
     If your a fan of Adam Sandler, I really suggest you go see this movie. It
looks like another hit!
       That is all,
         Keith

Subject: Bela Fleck and the Flecktones...

>>Continuing on the other favorite groups idea - are there any Flecktones fans
out there?  Don't let the fact that Bela Fleck plays banjo throw you.  It's 
not at all Beverly Hillbillies (although he sometimes plays it in solos).  The
bass player for the Flecktones is Victor Lamonte Wooten.  A remarkable 
musician.  <<

Interestingly, a fellow work-mate of mine (who also, it turned out, is a Rush
fan) were discussing bands, and he also brought up this group.   While I've
heard of the band, I've never gone to check them out (and he comes around the
area fairly regularly).  I just found it incredibly coincidental that the two
should come up so close in proximity!

Recently ordered the Catherine Wheel disc "Like Cats and Dogs" basically, just
because I really dig the "Spirit of Radio" cover that they have as a hidden
track (it is very cool).  Can you tell that the music scene is in the middle
of a dry spell when you'll check out a disc JUST because it's got a rush cover
on it?  uh-boy...

Subject: rush (sort of) sighting

I was driving on the Trans-Canada Highway a couple of weeks ago,heading  
west from Winnipeg to Calgary.  There's a place in Saskatchewan a couple 
of hours west of Regina called Rush Lake.  I, being the huge Rush fan 
that I am, had to take a picture of the road sign.  My non-Rush friends 
all thought that that was really lame, of course.  But hey, screw them, 
eh?  Still waiting with baited breath for the new live album.

Subject: rush 'moment'

This is a rather lame rush sighting, but i thought i'd offer it anyway. =
on saturday, sept. 12 (Neil's 46th b-day), I was rolling along I-55 in =
Illinois, when a local DJ offered a happy b-day to Neil, and then =
proceeded to spin 'tom sawyer". As TS
was playing, a car buzzed by me doing about 90, and it sported the =
Illinois license
plate 'BYTOR 97'. He must have been listening to! (I told you it was =
lame!) Something to think about--Rush WILL return, better and stronger =
than ever!
When the chips were down after COS, they produced 2112. After P/G, when
there were breakup rumblings, they produced PoW. After a long break, and = the
band shrouded in uncertainty, they produced T4E. They create music = because
they WANT to. (not to mention it's their job). IMHO they will be back in =
1999, not
2000. I also think they will produce the album themselves, for a change. =
Just my thoughts, and my 2 cents worth. Rush On!!!

Subject: Radio City Sept. '83

In response to a post a few weeks back, I'd like to offer some memories
of the Rush show I saw back on Sept. 20, 1983 at Radio City Music Hall
in New York City. I had become a big fan the previous year (at the ripe
old age of 13) and was fortunate enough to catch their show in December
of '82 at Madison Square Garden (Signals Tour). Therefore when I got
word of the five shows Rush had scheduled for Radio City, I was really
excited. No new studio or live album to tour in support of, just five
gigs in downtown Manhattan. My friend (another big Rush fan) scored us
tickets for the third show, up in the balcony but in the first row. 
	For those who have never been there, Radio City is a beautiful hall
with a classy 1930's architectural look. As we took our seats, Marillion
was already playing. They were pretty much unknown at the time, so we
didn't pay too much attention to them. People were very fired up for
Rush of course, the energy level was really high. When the lights went
out, a huge cheer went up, and my friend hit the record button on the
Walkman he managed to sneak into the hall. Because he made a tape of the
show, I am able to recall a lot of what went down that night. The Three
Stooges theme was first, followed by The Spirit of Radio into Tom
Sawyer. These tunes were big crowd pleasers, this was back when Rush was
at their peak in popularity. Then Geddy stepped to the mic and told us
how great it was to be back in New York City. He then said they had a
lot of songs to play for us that evening "from albums of the past and of
the future". But first something from their Signals album, Digital Man.
Great tune of course, but I have to mention the first reaction we had
when they hit the stage that night...Geddy's hair! Or the lack of it! On
the tape I hear this dialogue: 

Me: He got a HAIRCUT!
My friend: Who? 
Me: GEDDY!
My friend: WHERE'S YOUR HAIR?!? HE'S FUC%!NG BALD!!

	Yes, Geddy had shorn his locks, ridding himself of the classic Geddy
look. It turned out to be a precursor to the GUP look (see the video for
Distant Early Warning). He was also playing his new Steinberger bass,
having ditched the trusty Rickenbacker. All told a rather big surprise
for us youngsters. There was a real lack of special effects that night,
it was a real stripped-down version of the band. I remember this quality
the most, and in retrospect these shows were remarkable because of it. 
	The first new tune they played was Red Sector A. These shows were the
debut of Neil's new synth drums. We all know how Neil's kit rotates
during his drum solos, but at that time Neil had to actually turn his
back to the crowd to play them. The headphones providing him with a
click track were new as well. Rush was clearly experimenting with new
sounds and technology. We also were treated to Broon's Bane into The
Trees. These were the last shows Broon's Bane was ever played at,
although we didn't know it at the time. 
	The other two new songs we heard that night were The Body Electric and
Kid Gloves. Again, they wouldn't be released officially until the
following April, so all we had until then were the versions on our tape.
Each song had different solos, my favorite was definitely the one on Red
Sector A. Serious Alex whammy bar action on that one, although Kid
Gloves was a real Lerxst-fest as well.
	They basically stuck to Signals material that night, but dropped
Chemistry from the previous tour. They did play Countdown however, with
the benefit of the NASA video behind the stage. No lasers, no flash
pots- they would make their appearance only in 1984. Then came the big
medley, 2112 Overture>Temples>Xanadu>La Villa>In The Mood. The tape
reveals that Geddy said "Hey LONG ISLAND" not "Hey Cookie" or "Hey
Mookie" or somesuch. And we were in Manhattan. Very strange... 
	Anyway we were really pumped up for the encore, which was YYZ with the
big drum solo. Unfortunately the batteries in my friend's Walkman ran
out just as YYZ was starting. What a bummer! But we only found out after
the show, so it made no difference for our memories of that special
night.

If I remember correctly, there used to be a bit of a debate on here about 
whether Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park) are Rush 
fans.  Well, I was watching the MuchMusic program FAX tonight, and the 
main story was the MTV Music Awards.  The VJ went over to Matt Stone and 
introduced herself as being from MuchMusic in Canada.  To which Matt went, 
"Oh, Canada, I love Canada, I love everything Canadian; maple syrup, Celine 
Dion, and Geddy Lee.  I *love* Geddy Lee."  Thought that was cool :-)

Subject: Sweet Memories

Dear all
Good old HMV over here have one of their periodic "3 for £22" mid-price CD
sales on at the moment and so on Saturday I indulged and picked up both
2112 and Hemispheres. Being a committed "new Rush" fan I'd sold my album
versions of these quite a while back and I kept promising myself that I
would get some of the old stuff on CD, especially when they were all
treated to a remaster job.
I got home and put on 2112, going straight to what was side 2. Now, I'd say
that I've probably not heard any of these tracks for about 10 years, and it
was a _real_ treat to be able to appreciate that stuff all over again. I
still know all the lyrics, all the drumming, all the guitar bits,
everything, and the same for Hemispheres, which was the first Rush album I
ever bought, back when it was new out. These are such excellent records and
I realised again why I spent endless hours and hours listening to those LPs
when I first had them - no wonder my O Level results suffered ! Listening
to them really brought up memories of the time - school, old friends - good
times.  Sweet memories indeed. And how good do theese CDs sound ? Bloody
marvellous. Absolutely crystal (and not one bit of crackle or pop in the "I
have memory and awareness" bit ! ).  Great.
I'm going back this week to see if they have CoS, AFTK and FBN.as I know
that they'll do the exactly same for when I put them on. Can't wait.
(In case anyone was wondering what the 3rd CD was that I bought on Saturday
it was The Crossing by Big Country, and almost the same goes for that as
regards nostalgia value!)

Cheers

Dear All,

I may be jumping the gun here, but so far the live albums thred has 
not provoked a flame!  Blimey.

As to misheard lyrics, I would swear that at one of the London 
dates in the late seventies/early eighties (probably Hammersmith, 
since Wembley scarcely lends itself to humour) Geddy said 
"Here's a song about my lunchbreak - this is Twenty Past Twelve."  
He then proceeded to launch into "We are the Plumbers who've 
come to mend your sinks".  Of course these are only memories, 
but that's all we have... sniff.

Clinton's Ladder (to Jacob's Ladder, by Rush)

The House prepares for battle...
Impeachment is in question...
Bruised and sullen liberals,
Have the light of Truth obscured.

Charges vile and treacherous,
The President did perjure...
Bleeding hearts are circling
To prevent...his...departure...

All at once, the report is published
Facts stream down in bright unbroken beams...

Sounds the trumpet of his end

On the Rush newsgroup...I saw someone found out Geddy's screename(I won't
tell..) If this is true....we now know why/how they changed the setlist on DS
around by having one of them to spy on us I'm guessing. Anyhow...I doubt his

I don't know if any NMS'ers have seen the preview for The Waterboy (with
Adam Sandler) but they play Tom Sawyer during the entire extended preview.
I hope they actually use it in the movie.  I can't remember the last time a
Rush song made it into a major motion picture.  If anyone can, please email

Subject: More stuff on live albums

Dear fellow Rushians,

Contributing to the latest thread of great live albums, allow  me to 
throw this one out:

Black Sabbath:  Live Evil.  Now I take it there aren't many Black 
Sabbath fans out in Rush land, but this is a great show. A lot of the 
classics are performed (though Dio is the lead vocalist in Ozzy's place; 
I think he was a lot better than Ozzy) as well as some of their newer 
stuff which blows you away.  Of course, you have to be in the right mood 
to listen to it, but I encourage all of you to give it at least one 
listen.

Second, it's football season and I know that there are fans of the 
Chargers, the Broncos and the Steelers.  Well, I"m a Chiefs fan and 
though they lost this week (it was pretty bad), I 'm waiting for all of 
your teams to come to arrowhead for the annual ass-kicking they deserve.  
Oh sure you may have the good quarterbacks in Elway, Stewart and Lief, 
but my defense is going to eat them for lunch.  Wanna bet on it?

Greetings,

I went to see The Slums of Beverly Hills over the weekend
(I recommend it highly) and before the show they played a 
preview of the New Adam Sandler (sp?) flick Waterboy.

Through half of the trailer they played Tom Sawyer as
the background music. Cool huh? Too bad the movie looks
lousy, though it does have Henry (the Fonz) Winkler in it.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

MCGWIRE'S H-R A RUSH FOR GEDDY

One member of the rock community who has his eye
on baseball's home run race is Rush vocalist and bass-
ist Geddy Lee.  He even has a theory on why Mark
McGwire broke the record before Sammy Sosa.  "I
think Sammy is largely responsible for cooling Mc-
Gwire out.  I think McGwire was just blown away by
what a cool guy Sammy Sosa was.  He started hitting
again after that."  Rush's live album, _Different Stages_,
will be released November 10th.

Hi all,

There's been a lot of great live albums listed here (particularly, 
Genesis - Seconds Outs, Gentle Giant - Playing the Fool, and Jethro Tull 
  Bursting Out).  However, one live album I love that I haven't seen 
anyone mention is Pat Travers - Go For What You Know.  Pat Travers and 
Pat Thrall do some great dual guitar work on that one.  Check it out.

Subject: More Rush Producers

Choosing producers for Rush(or anyone) is one of my favorite pasttimes, =
so I thought I'd toss out some names for the next Rush release.  Some =
are simply unlikely, but I'm sure they can spark some discussion.

Trevor Horn - I've heard Rush say that they prefer their producers to be =
artists, not engineers and I think Trevor fits in that sense, but he =
might have a tendency to overdo it a little bit.  Not to diminish his =
work on "90125" or Seal's fine albums.  I just think he wouldn't fit =
with Rush.

Sam Taylor - King's X and Galactic Cowboys.  He could certainly help =
them rediscover that hard edge without forgetting MELODY as many bands =
do these days.

Nick Davis - I love everything about Marillion's "Season's End" and this =
gentleman worked on it.  He really achieved a fine balance between edgy =
guitar and effective keyboards.  I believe he also worked with Genesis =
(or, as I liked to call them at the time: Phil and Mike & some guy named =
Tony who is not a mechanic) on one of their later albums.  (Or this durn =
concussion is screwing with my memory again)

Kevin Shirley - Hmmm, he worked on CP (my favorite since the early =
eighties) and with Dream Theater on "Falling Into Infinity" and I think =
those are fine credentials.  (Yes, I'm aware that this fine band is, for =
reasons unknown to me, a whipping boy on TNMS, but I enjoy them and =
their work. I suppose they are disliked because they may be considered =
Rush wannabe's, but I think that's unfair when one recalls Rush's early =
years when they were little more than Led Zeppelin wannabes)=20

Alan Parsons - Ok, no he doesn't produce anybody's stuff but his own =
anymore and he is an engineer in his roots, but I think you have to =
admit, it would be interesting.  Imagine if Alan, not Peter Collins had =
produced "Power Windows"

Some other newspapers may have screwed up, but here's what the Washington

13th issue:

>...Expect live albums from the Rollings Stones (from the group's ongoing
"Bridges to Babylon" tour), the Bee Gees, Garth Brooks, Aerosmith, Hanson,
the reunited Black Sabbath, Michael Crawford, the Mighty, Mighty Bosstones,
Portishead, Patti LaBelle, Rush and, from the vaults, the Clash.  The Clash
will also be the subject of a tribute album, as will the late Tammy Wynette
(with Elton John delivering "Stand by Your Man"), Kate Wolf, Ozzy Osbourne
and N.W.A. on the 10th anniversary of "Straight Outta Compton."

Hanson album-- what a sad thought!

Subject: Producers

Two obvious suggestions that no one has brought up are Robert Fripp and
Trevor Horn.

They both carry heavy credentials as members of other progressive bands.
(King Crimson and Yes.)  

Robert is as bizarre and extreme as any other musician/producer on earth.
I think he may be the only man who could push the boys to do things that
they never dreamed of.  Imagine what that collaberation would sound like.

Trevor would probably make them sound more modern and polished.  But as the
producer of Yes's 90125 album I think that it would still work out.
Imagine what the bass and drums would sound like!  As for his treatment of
Alex's guitars...  I bet they would be a lot more etherial and moody.  But
not bright like the 80's stuff.

I'd kill to get the boys working with either of these two geniuses.  But
I'll be really happy if they record another studio album at all.  I couldnt
care if it was recorded on a victrola!

Till later,

Hello fellow RUSH fans,

     I have been reading the latest postings about misheard lyrics and would
like to add one of my own.  Tom Sawyer came out when I was a freshman in high
school, and I swear that I heard Geddy sing "And the spacey invaders get by on
you"......Yes, I did spend a lot of time in the arcade......Well,..Ya know.
Also during all four years in high school my locker number was (I did not
request it) 2112!  After several weeks of people prying off my number plate,
and the janitors having to replace it, I wrote the number in with a marker. 

Thanks for your time,

Lance didn't say that there weren't any overdubs on ATWAS, 
he just implied that it was unspoiled by them, and I agree. 
They were essentially 'repair' overdubs, the later live 
albums on the other hand have any potential live atmosphere
ruined by studio tampering IMO.

Firstly his drumming is not that bad, secondly - even if he 
isn't particularly highly talented - so what?  Is that an 
excuse to engage in personal attacks about the guy for the 
next 24 years?

Secondly, he didn't have a crystal ball, and even if he 
did, it's highly possible that Rush would never have been 
that successful without Neil Peart.  He made the right move 
based on his personal conviction.  But even an unfortunate
career move doesn't give anyone the right to the kind of 
personal attacks I see here, week after week.

I'd like to know how talented -you- are, cfogel.  The 
general tone of your post suggests "not very".

Subject: I had one, too

Greetings, fellow lemmings,
     (this way, please)
   So, last night, before bed, I had this great idea that "the Boys"; if they
are giving up music (or even if they're not);  should go and get their own
Talk Radio show, like on WABC here in New York.  Talk politics, morals, offer
advice, incite riots, whatever. They might not be able to call it "The Rush
Show" because of Limbaugh ya' know,  but we could have a contest in the TNMS,
and post the results in issue #2112,  and then let they guys pick a name,
okay? 
    Neil would, of course, be the brooding front man (that's a switch),
provide biting commentary and deep thoughts (hey, whatever happened to "Deep
(Rush) Thoughts"?  I couldn't find it), while Geddy and Alex would do
something else.  I don't know what.  Humourous banter?  
    Well, I was so pleased with my idea that I couldn't wait to write to ya'll
about it, but then I went to sleep and -OH NO!!- I had a dream.   Nothing too
concrete; just something about Neil doing a racing bike commercial, and I was
trying to catch up with him (which is funny, because, aside from other things,
I have not straddled a bike seat in a while, either).   Then, some news people
were lined up at banquet tables in the backyard of my childhood, and because
*I* was such a fan of Rush, they wanted me to do something.  Find them?  Ask
them something?  I don't know....I just woke up to another foggy dawn and had
a good chuckle at myself.  (hmmm.........maybe it had something to do with
that authentic Canadian beer I had before retiring.....)
    So, that's it, and in mass answer to some queries, Yes, I am accepting
donations for a nose jobbie. And no, I do not have a scanner.  Scare less
people that way.  The one guy who proposed marriage- please forward a copy of
your bank statement and most recent medical results.
