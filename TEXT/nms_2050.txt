Subject: Rush bitching ,nms trader,radio,vh-1 again

well i would like to say a few words concerning this pop up Rush thing.yes it
will be airing again on saturday morning at 9:30 am on vh-1,but here is the
thing.alot of people whom i talk to about Rush either dont know about them
never heard of them or etc... you get the picture.i would like to say i take
extreme pride in knowing i have introduced just this year 3 people to Rush in
which they have bought a combined 12 cds of thiers, and thats just this
year.if you all complain so much about Rush and the credit they deserve then
surely you wont mind making a simple phone call to the local radio station and
request to hear Rush.request any Rush it doesnt matter.let me let you in on a
little secret,program directors of radio stations are more then willing to
play Rush any Rush as for that matter,but the problem is no one calls and
requests them.so in turn they say well since no requests are called in or
emailed or faxed and check this out here in miami,florida the 2 radio stations
that play Rush at all have huge Rush fans on staff but Rush tested horribly in
this market.why?well because lack of exposure,sick of same songs,and just dont
know them and think they are old.well i for one who works in this industry
knows that phone calls to request your fave band does still get you somewhere
in this world today,just like anything in life you need to scream your head
off until you get what you want.

Rush are a classic example of this sheer laziness and brutal arrogance from
its fans.i hear nothing but bitching from all of you and some on the streets
and phones about how much test for echo sucks and how geddy needs to go back
to the stienberger,or how Rush was great in the moving pictures days or how
neil hasnt played anything worthwhile since hold your fire ,etc.... but god
forbid we get something moving people,i mean god forbid there is enough people
on this mailing list that could change our stations format alone with phone
calls but you know what?it wont happen.why?well the album will come out and
there you have it.you no longer need us.you got to hear your song before the
album came out and now it is at your disposal.so why do you bitch at radio?why
do you bitch at vh-1?mtv?please!!!!!! people,wake up!!it is your own doing.you
wonder why when Rush plays the coral sky ampitheater here in west palm beach
that out of almost 20,000 available seats the boys only sell 14,000?or in
tampa a possible 19,000 only gets 10,300?well yes it is true the promoting
isnt that great but why should it be?no one calls to hear Rush after the album
is released ,no one writes mtv,or vh-1 and when there is a petition to do so
you all bitch and moan about how it is just filling up your email.why is it
that a Rush album can enter the top 5 in its last 3 studio releases and sell
shows but yet fall out of the top 200 within 12 weeks?no radio,no tv.its a
chain reaction.you need to wake up and realize that a few minutes every week
or other week will make a huge difference in radio and tv.drop a line get the
word out and you will see what happens.

trust me on this.if you can take the time to sit and write posts on the nms
bitching about low crowds and lack of sales and no exposure ,well look at
yourself and you will see what needs to be done. as for issue #2112 of the nms
i think we all should call our radio stations and ask them to play Rush on
that day.i guarntee if you continued to call and ask for different songs every
so often there would be a change.

my little thing here on the trader in the nms website-please dont waste my
time people,if you truly are going to order Rush stickers or Rush videos from
me dont waste my time.send the money or the tape in trade,instaed of me
holding it and telling someone ive sold it when nothing has come via-mail.we
arent 4 yrs old here.i have plenty of stickers and rare vids for sale,stickers
from 2112 to tfe for sale email me for list and order today and i have tons of
videos.

i'll stop the bantering,but folks remember what neil said:"what kind of
difference can one person make?''

Subject: Rush, Maiden and latest news.

As a former "big-time fan" of Iron Maiden, I'm getting a kick out of all
the comparisons between Rush and Maiden. So I guess I'll toss my hat
into this one:

It's obvious that Maiden is definitely "heavier" than Rush. Rush (on
certain albums) are far more technical in their instrumentation than
Maiden. So I don't think you can compare them as they don't play similar
styles of music.

Where I _do_ think the similiarities can be found are in the way that
Iron Maiden's music, just like Rush's, takes the listener on somewhat of
a "journey". While some of their songs are pretty straight forward, I
think it's songs like "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", "Flight of Icarus"
and other "longer running songs" that remind me of certain earlier Rush
material. Also, both bands use different time signatures in their songs.
Lastly, I think the fact that Maiden uses a lot of fiction in their
lyrics is sililiar to some early Rush tunes.

(regarding the latest news printed at the Grand Designs Rush Site...
true, some of it has been mentioned here before, but there are also some
new additional tidbits mentioned there that have not been heard of, such
as the inclusion of memorabilia, follow-up video, and the "A Farewell to
Kings" era material as the bonus. As for the validity of the source...
I, for one, buy it.)

Subject: Geddy in Wichita in '84

I can corroborate the Geddy & baseball experience of Bryan Costello in
Wichita back in '84.  My experience was at Lawrence-Dumont Stadium the
same night before the concert. I had called a friend of mine and
questioned where the members of Rush might be that night.  Neil was
probably biking but I remembered Geddy liked baseball.  We went to the
Wichita Aeros to enjoy a game and as luck had it he was there with
roadies.  Geddy was a few rows back of the Aeros dugout (3rd base
side).  Our seats happened to be in the same row as his but over one
section.

>From what I remember Brad Leslie "The Animal" saw Geddy before the
game and went absolutely nuts and sent up a box of balls for Geddy to
sign for the whole team. I think Geddy also got a ball signed by the
team.

I also remember I made him laugh during the seventh inning stretch (or
so I'd like to believe).  They had one of those contests where you
throw a ball through a "strike zone".  This boy kept throwing
underhanded and missing so I yelled out "Throw it like a man" a rather
sexist remark looking back on it.  The kid threw it overhanded and got
the ball through the hole.  I looked at Geddy and he was laughing. I
probably watched Geddy that night more than the game.  He had an ice
cream cone.  For all of you baseball mavens, Geddy keeps score. 

That night I tried to be as polite as possible after the game and
asked for an autograph on my baseball ticket stub.  I wouldn't do it
now but had to back then.  I can't read his signature but I know it's
his anyway.  Fun times…

Questions:
1.  What is wrong with country music?  I have not read one reasonable 
post on this digest that addresses this.

I can answer this with only an opinion but then what would be the point?

Let's face it folks.  Everyone has their own idea of what good music
is.  While I don't like country music, I certainly wouldn't tell my own
kids not to listen to it (if I had any, that is).  But, I've learned the
very hardest way that you cannot tell parents how to raise their
children.  They get very defensive; angry even.  Having said this, I
believe that censorship (or deprogramming, as it was put) is one of the
very things our favorite band members detest.  

2.  More importantly, why are you trying to smother your son's
interests?!  
He's found something that he likes, that is harmless.  Why are you
trying 
to tell him that it's bad?  Someone else responded with:

> Don't know of any personally, but you had better find one quick.  You're
> son's future is at stake.

Heaven forbid!  He might learn to think for himself and form his own 
opinion.  We wouldn't want that!

Please exercise the open-mindedness that this digest promotes and 
encourages.

Subject: Re: Sound systems

My brother has 7" dual voice coil woofers made by Focal.  The
cone material is kevlar.  The voice coils are crossed over so
that one covers frequencies down to about 80Hz and the other
covers low bass.  We made the boxes out of 1" fiberboard and
"nailed" them together with liquid nails and screwed them tighter
together with more screws than you'd want to count (luckily we
had an electric driver).  They've got a 3/4" open port at the
bottoms and padding material inside so the sound comes out in
phase with the outbound sound from the speakers.  The sound is
excellent.  Upon completion we popped in PeW, Hemispheres,
Signals, and some other CDs I can't remember.

Anyway, in Subdivisions, we could clearly hear temple (or wood)
blocks all through the song.  The most pronounced occurs at 1:21
on Signals-- right on "in" in OpINions ("Opinions are provided").
It lasts only for a split second, so listen carefully!  Then if
you can hear that one, there are several more series of them
peppered throughout the song.  It's really quite weird.

In issue 2048      "Costello, Bryan" <Bryan.Costello@sea.siemens.com> Issues a
warning to the "girls"

4) Iron Maiden....here, here my friend. I could not agree with you more.
I always liked Maiden, ALOT, not only for the edge they had to their
music, but for the progressive nature of the music as well. I highly
recommend "Piece of Mind", "Number of the Beast" & "Killers" as well.
Loud & aggressive...and progressive, just like Rush on gems like
"Bastille Day" & "Anthem" to name 2. Metallica's "...and Justice for
All" is very similar in its approach & execution. 
WARNING....you girls might not dig this stuff, you see, it's a boy
thing, you wouldn't understand. Girls have "Ally McBeal" & "Melrose
Place" and us guys have Professional Wrestling (it's a soap opera for
Men).

I'm putting my 2 cents in on this.  I am female, ok not a girl, anymore, but I
don't watch Ally McBeal, or Melrose Place, or Wrestling, BUT..  I do like both
Rush and Iron Maiden and a few other "guy" bands that get mentioned here from
time to time.
The fact of the matter is, there is no such thing as a "guy" band or a "girl"
band.  As an example, just last night I was talking to some guy that likes Air
Supply (oh no!).

Subject: Admitting I'm wrong (is that allowed?)

Re my insistence that the guitar solo on "In the End" is being doubled by a 
violin: Sean Mallone made a valid point that if there was a guest artist on 
FBN, he would have been credited.  That leaves us with two possibilities:

  One of the boys has an additional, little-publicized instrumental skill; 
or That is NOT a violin

The second seems more likely, especially since I've thought of an alternate 
answer myself.  The additional track could be a very trebly, staticky 
electric guitar.  The absence of an audible pick attack still concerns me, 
but when I get my home studio back I intend to test that theory...

Also, SM was right in that the riff in question is NOT pentatonic.  The 
major pentatonic does not include the 4th scale degree (and the minor 
pentatonic scale obviously doesn't include the _major_ third...).

However, for future reference BIK that I _do_ play guitar and _have_ done 
some home recording (and have been studying rock music in an aficionadic 
fashion for years), so I am not ignorant of the mechanics of sound 
recording, or its possibilities.

I think this whole "sound on 'In the End'" thread is kinda hopeless, a bit 
like the triangle/crotale thing, since none of us were at the 
recording sessions and there isn't a publicly available, exhaustive record 
of the sessions.  I for one am going to drop it, except for two parting 
shots:

  Again, I'll need to experiment, but I doubt if playing a conventional 
guitar line by _scraping_ the strings with the pick (as opposed to normal 
picking) is a very useful technique (might be a cool effect, tho).
(I'm _not_ thinking of a conventional pick scrape like on "Something for 
Nothing")
and
  I'm sorry, but it WAS a crotale!  :-D  (or the bell-tree)

Subject: underrated album and rand

oh what the hell:

most underrated rush album:
DEFINITELY Caress of Steel! man, what a workout! i love CoS (then again I
love every Rush album unconditionally except for GuP, aSoH, and
RtB--although it has some kick-ass songs) and every song on it... i think
i'm going bald is funny and the extended suites are very underrated. granted
the whole enterprise is crude compared to 2112/aFtK/Hemispheres, but so is
Rush compared to FbN and I love both....

Ayn Rand:

Songs inspired by Rand:
Anthem
2112
Something for Nothing
Hemispheres (albeit indirectly)
Freewill
Entre Nous
Tom Sawyer

after PWaves or so Neil deviates from Rand somewhat; he gets more
"animistic," etc (ref. Mystic Rhythms)

I don't like Rand anyway... She is interesting because she was able to go
from ardent libertarianism :-) to quasi-fascism :-(. She started to get too
much in the idea of a "superman" who could stomp all over others to achieve
what they "deserved." basically, she took Nietzsche (sp?) to an extreme,
and, in the process, created such a strong form of individualism that it
became almost fascist... ironic, ain't it!

individualism is extremely important, but not to a fanatical degree that
others suffer.

As a not so aspiring scientist...I shall attempt to disect the highly
evolutionary and yet
still creative notionary peaces of mind made by King Lerxst and Edward
"Eddie" The Longshanks...

Stay awake now, and have a Monty Python sense of sensibility on all of
this....right???....RIGHT!!!

Well all right then...I believe we owe Elvis, the Beatles, Cream, and Led
Zep a large tip of the hat,
but ultimately...they'd owe a bigger one to "The Big Omega"....and to those
that went before...

That said, I think RUSH picked up sticks and ran with that creative sense
that Cream & Zep originally
possesed....and I think creativity is what makes RUSH the most excellent
bands that they are, today, well
over 25 years since their inception.

Funny thing happened to the poet on his way to English class one day....he
spyed some cool poetry
written by Samuel Taylor Colridge and noticed it was extremely similar to
both a RUSH and IM song....
but that's another story altogeather...but if you give both songs a chance
to live and breath...you'll say
that they are incredibly well done....

I think lyrically....Steve Harris has done more studies on war and the like,
and it obviously has always dominated
Maidens sound....and I think you gotta see that's fine...we are comparing
apples and oranges here.

Dave Murray stacks up very well one on one against Alex...in fact I think
Daves solo in Powerslave is the most
compelling in ALL of rock music save La Villa...save La Villa....but Dave is
more of Jimi Hendrix prototype
whereas I see Alex as much more of an artist...with a slant towards Jimmy
Page...

Both Dave and Alex possess a great stage presence and a comical sense of
humor....very funny to see live!!!

Steve Harris & Geddy Lee are for the most part the leaders of their bands,
and very tallented....Steve has more
of a driven sense of bringing a point home both lyrically and on
stage....where as Geddy is much like a college
professor nowadays....extremely talented....

The drummers...well no question Neil is the professor...but some of Niko's
coolest work is on Somewhere In Time, Seventh Son,
Powerslave, and Piece of Mind.

Neil is the best lyricst without a doubt, yet his gifted proposition is to
let the listener, think about the subject matter with no clear cut
answer in place all of the time....but Maiden tends to reach into some areas
where we'd almost rather ignore...be it
spirituality, war, or day to day grind....yet somehow they make it
compelling...something worth thinking about...in a unique way...

Now I'm not a scientist .....but I can see a problem in "Zee theory of
rockin' relativity!!!"

The original theory was stated as:

RUSH = IRON MAIDEN

I think the proof is in da puddin'

3 != 5

SHOCKING!!!!   AMAZING!!!!!  I KNOW...PLEASE HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE.....

MOREOVER......

1 guitarist != 2 guitarist

parts != parts

jazz != jazz

You see you could almost chase a wave back fifty years to the big band era,
and hear RUSH in there....sort of....
And you could go back to the 50-60's and hear Maiden in "cool jazz" ....sort
of....

But you see what it's all about is reaching the Alien Shore
musically....both Maiden & RUSH have always been heading there...
Sometimes intensely, sometimes funkadellicly, sometimes most comicly.....and
sometimes most cosmicly!!!!

So, I herby Proclaim Maiden & RUSH the Cosmic Jazz founding fathers.....

And yes I recommend checking out Maidens Virtual XI, it really is good...you
gotta let it speak for itself but the tracks
Futureal, Clans Man, Educated Fool, and Como Estais Amios?  are all sound
musically....and I really dig Lightning Strikes Twice
but if you're not familiar with how talented Maiden really is...listen to
Somewhere In Time....the whole disc rocks!!!!

Cheers Mates

Subject: Underrated Rush album 

Friends, countrymen, Rushians:
lend me your ears,

As far as I am concerned the most underrated Rush album is RTB.  I know 
from reading this digest that most of you out there really only care for 
the first three tracks and then are so-so about the rest.  RTB is not my 
all time favorite but I love it and I play it through start to finish 
almost every time.  I vote p/g for second most underrated album.

Here's a little story for you.  I work with about seven other people and 
we have a radio always playing.  Well, finally, I get to hear a Rush 
song (it was Limelight).  I said, "Thank God, they're playing something 
good."  One of the women I work with replied with,"F%$#ing Satanists!"  
She is considerably older than I and very very opinionated.  ANyways, I 
turned to her and asked, "What makes you say that?"  To which she 
replies, "Have you seen their album covers?  Pentagrams and naked 
people."  I almost started to laugh.  There was no use in trying to 
convince her otherwise, but this just goes to show how much ignorance 
there is about the band.

Gotta go!  Go Sabres!  Go Jazz!

Subject: Rush...Omaha...Live

In my life I have only seen Rush live twice (I am only 18), Once on June 20th
1990, and the second time on November 5th 1991. Both in Omaha. They played
excellent both times.  I was in awe when the bunnies came out on the Presto
tour...I was only in sixth grade. That night they played Working Man with the
member's of Mr. Big, it was cool.  The second time, on the Roll the Bones tour
Eric Johnson opened and just blew my mind, I was a seventh grader at the time.
Later that night as the guy's we're playing "Where's My Thing (Part IV.
Gangster of Boat's Trilogy), there was a loud noise...Feedback. Geddy actually
stopped for a moment, so I don't think it was staged. He just shrugged, then
rejoined Alex and Neil, who didn't even hesitate for a moment. Later, after
the concert I got to touch Neil's drums...they were incredible...I knew then
what I wanted to do for a living....Drum. Well that's all I have to say, I
hope everyone has a "burgeriffic" day.

Subject: New Rush studio album already released?

Sean Carrol l<xamolleh@ix.netcom.com> said on Wed, 03
Jun 1998:

"Rush has *already* recorded and released their latest studio
effort. They just did it like Alex did with Victor, different name
and little hype, and no I'm not going to tell you what it is. You'll
just have to search the bins. As for touring, to cut costs and
increase profit margins, they are touring separately with
local pickup bands."

A little late for April Fools, eh?  Since you make it sound like Rush
is extremely concerned about profit margins, using a pseudonym
with minimal marketing doesn't make sense.  Are you telling me
an unsupported album release is making more money than one
with support?  The band *may* have released new material as
you claim, but their ultimate goal cannot be profit with this type
of marketing strategy.

By the way, why not be a kind and generous Rush fan and turn
the rest of us onto this "new" group?  I certainly don't have all
week to spend rummaging through CD bins reading and scanning
album covers.

After reading the 2112 posts about what to do for issue 2112, I think we
should all send in posts discussing the music of Rush.  This discussion can
revolve around the band, the lyrics, music, the album art, (I hope we get the
point).

The issue following 2112 should be 2113.  This would save the Holy Bitch one
heck of a lot of work.  Issue 2113 should contain discussion of the music of
Rush, the band....

     I just had to respond to this thread!  As far as Red Barchettas go, I 
     am the proud driver of a 1988 Ruby Red Corvette customized with a 
     Shinoda/Williams ~ Rick Mears Special edition body kit (and a few 
     engine modifications), WA vanity license plate reads "MMCXII" (that's 
     2112 for you roman numeral illiterates).  I do intend to scan the 
     plate to submit it to the "Fan's licence plates" section of the NMS 
     website, someday...  Nothing is as exhilarating as hitting 100+ mph as 
     the song *Red Barchetta* or *Driven* blasts through the speakers!
     
     While I'm De~Lurking, I would like to throw a name into the "Guest 
     Vocalist" hat:  Kate Bush.  Fans of Kate's music (like myself) would 
     agree that her voice would blend with Geddy's quite nicely, IMHO.

I've seen Power Windows on a few occasions and they are very good.  They
are a 4 person band...when they are on, you can mistake them for Rush.  I
only remember them having an off night once, that night they decided to
break into Led Zep's "Immigrant Song".  A funny coincidence happened once
when i actually saw the lead singer of Power Windows at a Pizza Hut in
Cooperstown, NY...and i had picked a Rush song to play on the jukebox :)
If you get a chance to see them, please do.  They have a website where you
can check where they are playing locally, mostly around New York and New
Jersey area and points north, and also some info about the band:

Sir, on what are you basing this presumption?  Are they not, as we
speak, polishing up a live release?  To be followed by a studio
release?  Where do you get information that indicates Rush is through?
There seems to be a large contingnet out there, distraught over the
death of Neil's daughter, and actually HOPING the band breaks up so they
can have a cathartic release.  Someone (not the person above) even went
so far as to say, "I hope they DO break up.  It's only right, after all
they've been through."
I personally can't see Neil comitting careericide over this tragedy. 
And the evidence indicates he is not.
And unless you have FACTS to the contrary, STOP RUMORMONGERING!

This was a flame.  This was only a flame.  Had this been a thermonuclear

Subject: B-MAN CONFUSION!!

<<<From: "Teebagy, Steve, BMG - Boston" <Steve.Teebagy@bmge.com>

I'd just like to add my 5 cents on this whole B-Man confusion. A close
friend of mine is personal friends with Bill and through him I have met
Bill myself and the whole Hold Your Fire thing is a crock!! He never did
anything like that. It's a bad rumor. I've heard this sraight from Bill
himself. "Why would I do something foolish like that", Bill said. He had
a great relationship with Alex and Neil but more so with Geddy. They
were pretty close friends. Bill in short said the reason he & Rush no
longer communicate is something personal that he won't share with
anyone, and has nothing to do with some leaking of Hold Your Fire to
radio.>>>

Hm. I'll tell you, I happened to read the e-mail from the person claiming to
be B-Man, and it **was** pretty bad. The recipient happens to be a close
friend of mine and the mail was a cheap shot at her.
However, over the years I've heard from more than a few sources of the "B-Man
got booted because he leaked the tapes" rumor. OK, maybe it is a rumor, and
maybe it has some basis in fact. Either way, since B-Man has "spoken" on this
issue, as Steve suggests, then why not have B-Man address this himself. Bill,
come on down and start typing.
(And my opinion on Visions is much like AnneSpeare's----I look at it more as
"My LIfe with Geddy, Alex and Neil" rather than a proper biography. It was,
IMO, OK but not great....).

SHRUGGED itself (it's not the world's easiest book to read, although it's

could even be having a bit of fun with it, since Barbrady is far from
the sharpest tack in THAT town; maybe his dislike is their twisted way
of paying homage.  :)    (It doesn't take an Einstein to see that the
things Trey and Matt like are usually expressed through Stan and Kyle's

chances are it's something Trey and Matt Don't Like.)

>Rush/ Maiden:

Maiden, from "Iron Maiden" to "Seventh Son..." was
absolutely brilliant. I listened to them, alongside Rush,
for almost the entire 80's. They are not easily compared to Rush
due to style differences; however, like every truly great band they
were able to grow in every respect (musicianship, songwriting etc)
and every new album boldly explored new territory.

The demise started with the departure of Adrian Smith and,
subsequently, Bruce Dickinson.

Bollocks. Any of the first three albums blows "Clutching..." away.
And Marillion with Fish is way better than either IQ, Pendragon,
or Twelfth Night - by a very wide margin.

I am extremely upset at Mercury/ PolyGram for following
the latest mindless trend of not including recording/ mixdown/

Think about it - if you were picking up a copy of an old album
for the first time, wouldn't it drive you crazy to have basic
facts missing ? At one point, I remember it being obligatory
for labels to put the DDD ( or whatever ) on the disc AND on
the sleeve. Now nobody cares, or they don't want you to know.
And they (Mercury) are so self-satisfied, they didn't even answer my
inquiry into this matter.
Anyone know anything about this ?
