Maybe it was the idea from which the song grew, like an Oak Tree.  
Perhaps it's a cryptic way of telling us that Superconductor is

Subject: Rippingtons is NOT jazz and top ten

The Rippingtons, Fourplay, Spyro Gyra, Kenny G., Boney James and the ilk are
NOT jazz.  It should be illegal to call that over-synthesized putrid, rancid
mess jazz (this is merely my opinion). Jazz is: (among others) Miles, Coltrane,
Monk, Etta James, Sarah Vaughn, Louis Jordan, Ella, Billie Holiday, etc.

My top ten(ish):

1. Rush
2. Van "The Man" Morrison
3. Fates Warning
4. Frank Sinatra
5. Bjork
6-whatever (in no order)- Elvis, Radiohead, Stereolab, Bruce Springsteen,
Billie Holiday, Dio, Dream Theater, Tori Amos, Esquivel, Allman Brothers,
POrtishead, Moist, Pizzicato Five, Auditory Imagery, Jamiroquai, Dick Dale and
his fabulous Del-Tones, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Slayer, Megadeth,
Combustible Edison, Cranberries, Dean MArtin, Tony Bennet, etc....

Yes... our Most High rush.mgr has praised the likes of The Tragically Hip and
Our Lady Peace...and Ken McRae followed up with mentions of the ilk such as
Tea Party and  I Mother Earth...

There are a multitude of Canuck bands...most of them indie that DEMAND
American attention, they are that good...I'll throw another handful of stellar
groups up in The Great White North at y'all...

The Killjoys, Treble Charger, The Headstones, Gandharvas, Rusty, superGARAGE,
Moxy Fruvous; from Montreal, the  Doughboys; from Vancouver, there's Spirit of
the West, from Nova Scotia, there's Real Big Sea...and there are others, now
sadly defunct, such as the Lowest of the Low, and Sour Landslide...

My personal fave is a genleman formerly of Lowest of the Low named Ron Hawkins
and his backing band The Rusty Nails...their premiere CD, Greasing the Star
Machine is PHENOMENAL, however it's very likely only border towns which he
visits will get their grubby hands on this gem...

The Local radio station I listen to Wklc in St. Albans West Virginia is
having a win it before you can buy it week end for the Different stages cd.
So you know what I am going to be trying to get, dont you ... and as a
bonus they have been playing a major amount of Rush on the radio lately ,
some of it from Different Stages and some other stuff.  It helps that
several of the Rock Jocks happen to list Rush as some of thier favorites.

There is a new band out there that actually has TALENT in a big way.
INCUBUS!! Wow these guys kick ass. Their bigger in Europe, and gaining a
lot of momentum in Southern California. 
I strongly urge you all to check these guys out.

INCUBUS: Science is the name of the LP, go get it I promise you won't be
disappointed. They may be touring with Primus soon, Les is a big , big fan
of theirs.

I mention them on NMS because I was reading an article on them and they
remind me a lot (not musically) of Rush. They have toured for three years
straight, Europe twice, and all over N.America. They were approached to do
a "pop" CD with a catchy single and they animately refused-taking the road
less traveled these days.

These guys deserve a look, trust me.

Having had a basic design course in undergrad - sidenote: I am completely
incapaple of connecting in any way with art professors-they just don't like
me - I can confirm what youhave said about design following logic or
emotion.  I consider Hugh to be more graphic designer than artist when
designing album covers.  However, I might also be possible that the
arrangement of the tinker toys relates to 2 disks (recent tours) separated
from 1 disk ('78 tour) by time.  Why the hell does everyone feel the need to
connect every album cover with the band itself.  What about the material on
the recording.  That kind of logic would sugest that one of them must be the
naked guy on "Hemispheres"....Who's represented by the fire hydrant on
"Signals"...is Alex the geek on "Power Windows" or is he one of the TV's???
See what I mean?

Switching to a different set of brain cells...Finally heard TSoR on the
radio tonight.  WZZO in Allentown, PA played it by "request" (the biggest
myth in commercial radio).  Unfortunately, the reception was poor (I'm
closer to Phila) and I didn't get a good listen.  Then, by the grace of God,
I switched to WMMR (in the previously mentioned Phila) and they're playing a
double shot of Rush : Fly By Night and Limelight.  Three Rush tunes in
twenty minutes!  I could plotz!

Finally, burning up my reserve brain cells...just a silly little Rush
sighting.  Every day, I have to enter billing charges for the therapy
services we provide (yes, I'm currently a provider, not a recipient) to send
to the insurance companies for denial (cynical...yes!).  Anywho...every day
I enter "12" in field "21" which means I type: 21 <enter> 12 <enter>

As the live album release date comes closer. I would just like to remind 
everyone about all the negative comments that were made over the last 
year. We all should appreciate that its actually here and we get to hear 
it. We all love Rush and we should show them are appreciation, for being 
such a great band. As they themselves are humble, giving and appreciative. We 
all know how fast things can change as evidence, the tragedies this last 
year to Neil and family.  The CD is gonna be awesome, were all gonna love 
it. So just remember after you buy the CD and your sitting there jamming 
away like we all do: sit back for a minute, reflect and appreciate these 
great people and there music.

Subject: The Omega Concern

I believe "George of the tested echoes" is incorrect in his explanation 
of the omega concern.  According to WWW.NIMITZ.NET, the omega concern 

"As Alex realized that he had to play acoustic guitar for some Rush 
tunes and then quickly switch to his electric ("Closer to the Heart," 
etc.), he crafted a stand (actually an attachment to a Tama Titan cymbal 
stand) that holds his acoustic in an adjustable playing position.  He 
soon began to sell this as a product (1st to Music Emporium) under the 
company label "The Omega Concern." Apparently, Alex's "company" also 
made Geddy a light-up lyric stand and Neil got a newspaper/book holder 
so he could read while he eats breakfast."

Kids, don't open your gift before it is time.  I know the radio premier
will be useful, but only because RUSH will be interviewed at that time. 
It's too bad so many people will first hear the album on the radio.  I
choose not to.  I want that awesome cut to enter my ears from the
pureness of CD.

I liked this post a lot!!  I have never heard an audio clip from
the net because I've never had that desire.  I like getting
the actual CD and listening to it in the car - and hearing the
"new" album for the first time.  It's a very personally fulfilling
thing for me.

I will never forget the time when I drove home blasting
Moving Pictures for the first time back in 1989.....memories.
(I am 25 yrs. old - got into Rush in '89).

I couldn't care less about hearing any of DS on the Net.
To those that do care, that's great but the first listen
of the DS CD is spoiled IMHO.

I live in Austin TX, and I have my alarm set for a radio
station that has a rather annoying morning radio show 
in order to get me out of bed.  In general, I am awakened
by the pathetic whining of the hosts.  Lo and behold, on
the morning of October 23 at 0600, I awoke to the sounds
of 2112 live.  They played through the Overture and
Temples of Syrinx.  It wasn't a version I had heard before,
and I'm assuming it's from DS, since radio stations usually
don't play boots.

I guess you are...
Reznor used to play "everything" in the studio.  He doesn't
always do that anymore.
Check your liner notes for Downward Spiral.  I don't think
Belew would be given credit if he'd never been involved with
Trent.

My guess would be that they're using "acorn" as a synonym for
"seed."  After all, that's what an acorn is.

Subject: T4E Video

I just picked up a video copy of the Test For Echo concert. The show was
recorded in Toronto on June 30, 1997.  The video is 2 hrs. and 42 min. long on
standard play.  The view is from stage right, approx. 8-10 rows back.  The
quality of the video is very good. The quality of the sound is good, but not
great.  
I was first dissapointed in the beginning with the view, only Alex due to
obstructions, but by the third song, the view is improved and Geddy and Alex
are in good view. Neil is right behind Geddy so he is blocked out for most of
the video (bummer for us drummers).  
There are cameras at the concert for video taping for the official video.
Sometimes that camera boom is in the view.  Overall, the video is pretty good.
The song list is as follows:
2001 open/Dreamline, Limelight, Stick It Out, Driven(the view is much improved
at this point), Half the World, Red Barchetta, Animate, Limbo, The Trees,
Virtuality, Nobody's Hero, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Test for Echo, Freewill,
Red Sector A, Roll the Bones, Resist, Leave My Thing Alone, drum
solo(including Momo's Dance Party), Natural Science, Force 10,Spirit of Radio,
Tom Sawyer (complete with three dancing puppets on the amps!) , and YYZ for
the encore.

The title is of course Different Stages.  What do you with Tinker toys?  
You build with them, essentially creating and transforming, making 
things into other  more different things.  The basic unity of substance 
may be there, but different forms.  Rush is Rush.  They have remained 
true to one thing--the music they play.  It may take  on different forms 
in different places in differnt ages.  Hence, the title.  

I loved playing with Tinker toys when I was a kid.  I, though not 
consciously, meddled with bits and pieces here and there to create a 
different image of the same thought in my head.   I hope that in the 
liner notes, they expound upon the tinker toy phenomenon a little more.  
That could make what I say a little more understandable.

Can't wait to get DS.  Too bad I have no one to listen to it with.
Maybe I should move to Canada!

Love the countdown to DS on the NMS web page!  That's so cool.

Thanks to Will Collier for steering me (us) to CDnow.  I Advance-Ordered DS 
in time to partake of their $10-off special.  Total cost:  $14.96, delivered 
right to my office door.  Opted for the First Class mail option (i.e., 
snail-mail in computer geek-speak), so I should have it by Wednesday or 
Thursday at the latest.

Hey,

Mainly due to comments on TNMS about Spock's Beard, I purchased Beware of
Darkness - it rocks. Anyway, I just signed up to the Spock's Beard mailing
list mentioning Rush and TNMS. Amazing that a few SB fans have mailed me
privately asking how to get on TNMS.
So, Rush Mgr - if you get the odd e-mail from a Beard fan asking to be
subscribe here, it's my fault.

So, to the real Rush content - any of you good people know of a UK release
date for DS?

Oh yeah, here's my top 10 besides Rush in no particular order
1    Dream Theater
2    UFO
3    Blue Oyster Cult 
4    Max Webster/Kim Mitchell 
5    Wireless
6    Honeymoon Suite
7    Be Bop Deluxe
8    Spock's Beard
9    Wishbone Ash
10    Gong

Thanks.

I've been sitting here reading the NMS, listening to the Fox in Denver, hoping
to hear the new TSOR, when I hear that heavenly intro.  BUT, it was the studio
version (sigh...).  Has anyone in Denver heard it yet?

Someone asked: "could tinker toys distributed in Canada have had different
dimensions perhaps?"  Perhaps they were metric vs. english standard? :)

Subject: Different Stages in Chile and 2112

  This is my first post ever. I'm from Chile (a very well known place by 
these days, if you know what I mean).
    Just few lines to tell you that Rush is a much appreciated band 
here, with tribute band included (a real good one I've heard)
   This afternoon I was working when suddenly I recognized Geddy's voice 
in the radio, and guess what: it was DS version for 2112 and...
 It rocks!!!! it's is little more slow in tempo (wich gives it a more 
actual dark-grunge approach) and Geddy's voice is somehow lower, but it 
was incredible to listen to the full version live. "The master"'s ride 
sounds clearly and powerful in some passages and the recording is  a 
little bit "dirty" a caracteristic that I love in live recordings.
   I just can't wait to november 10th (yes! we get the cd's the same day 
here!!!)
    Just for the records.  My top ten:

1) Rush
2)  IQ   (british progresive)
3)  TOOL
4)  Genesis  ("Archives" rules)
5)  Renaissance
6)  Live
7)  Ben Folds Five
8) Hatfield and the North  
9) Emerson Lake and Palmer
10)  The Police

Fellow Rush Fans,
		
I work for Blockbuster Music and can confirm through promotional

to be on the "Waterboy" soundtrack.  Among other artists are E.L.O. and
Andrew Gold who had the one hit wonder "Lonely Boy" in the 70's.  I left

Subject: For the Spirit ever lingers

Hello eager DS waiters,

Isn't this the best and the worst? The last few weeks before the new
release. You can't wait to have it in your hands but at the same time
you don't want it to come too fast cuz your gonna have poor thing worn
out in a week!! Well 3 cd's should keep us occupied for quite awhile and
the enhanced disc will make it all the better.

I've only heard TSOR on Real Audio from the atlantic records site but it
wasn't in stereo so I didn't get the pan effect that we've been informed
about. Sounded rather bitching though!! I loved how Lifeson's low E
resonated a little sharp during the (almost) chromatic riffs. He's
slamming 'em!!!

I've been bugging the local radio stations but they are only
Rush-friendly after 6 pm and I rarely listen to radio at that time. They
haven't responded to my e-mails so I don't know if they'll play the
album premiere. They usually do, though.

Ya know, I'd really rather hear it first straight from the cd but I know
won't "learn to resist" listening to the radio, mostly for the
interviews and stuff. Does the NMS print the interviews? If I knew I
could read that, then I wouldn't be concerned about missing it.

Can't wait to here the new version of T4E. I've been really liking that
song a lot more lately. Neil's drumming is deceivingly complex in parts.
And Alex's solo has little blurb of notes that is too cool for words.

So here's to the new one,
Keep on Rushing,
Jon Lane

Subject: Waterboy Soundtrack Pt. II

Fellow Rush Fans,
	
I have some additional information about the "Waterboy" soundtrack
that features Rush's "Tom Sawyer."  In addition to Rush and E.L.O. you can
find artists like the Doors, C.C.R., Lenny Kravitz, Fastball, Earth, Wind
and Fire, John Mellancamp plus 7 more artists.  It comes out Nov. 3rd and
looks like a pretty good soundtrack.  How can a soundtrack that features
Rush not be good?

To the champion or champions who posted the link to the 105.3 The Rock out
of San Diego on TNMS.......THANKS!

   [ That was me :-)  I live in San Diego, and Rock 105 has been playing
     Rush for a while now (old and new). They play lots of different rock,
     old & new, and their RealAudio feed is mostly live (except for the
     Howard Stern show, read on their website why they don't play that
     live, it's pretty funny). I have heard Pumpkins, STP & Live on there
     as well, but that's about as "alternative" as they get.      : rush-mgr ]

I've just tuned in for the first time via Real Audio, and I heard Led Zep,
followed by a 3 Metallica tunes in a row....and after that to top it all
off....Limelight, Freewill and the Different Stages version of The Spirit of
Radio. (*drool* I must be dreaming)

I'm sure I wasn't the only one to hear it, so I guess The Priests were
smiling on us listening today. :)

Also a quick Rush sighting (that may have already been reported, but what
the hey).
Was watching an old Young Ones video recently. In the episode "Boring",
Vivian is wearing a Star/Man t-shirt. It's a little hard to see until the
gang comes back from the pub, and Viv is showing the gangs his "amazing
trick"...you can see it quite clearly during that scene. Oh well...I think
it's cool (it was recorded about 1982 I think.)

Cheers. BlueBro.

Good day.

Hey, I was wondering with the supposed DS advertising on VH1 once 
Novermber comes rolling around if there might be some live concert 
footage or what-not? Any ideas?

Oh!  Anyone from Dayton out there? Haven't heard the new stuff yet.  
104.7 sucks anyways. The only airplay is basically of 5 songs.
Anyways, anybody go to the fall 96 TFE tour at the NutterCenter. I 
was there and a couple of months back I was at a used CD store called 
Disc-Go-Round.  The store carries concert shots of bands that have 
toured the area and I picked up 3 upclose shots of all 3 boyz 
individually doin their thing on stage for $3. Pretty cool.  They're 
haggin on my wall at school (UD).  I've had them scanned, so if any 
body wants a look or knows where they should be send give me a mail.

Just think. I had my HS graduation ceremony there and when I went to 
receive my diploma, I was standing in the exact same place they were. 
 What a feeling and what a year!

Just one more quick question. I've noticed in a few of the albums 
towards the credits section a mention to "scooze ball."  What the 
hell is it?  A Canadian version of fooseball?

Hey everyone!

Hope you're all as anxious as I about the upcoming new release!
Something fun and Rush-related is happening at your local baseball park!

On Tuesday, October 27th, TGI Friday's will have the National Finals of
their World Bartending Competition.  The event will be held at the Front
Row Sports Bar in Arlington, TX.  One of my closet friends, Joe "The
Rocket" Pereira (one of four competitors out of 600 restaurants!), will
be showcasing his extreme bartending skills to the re-mix of Tom
Sawyer.  To those of you who have never been to such an event - you
don't know what you are missing!

I look forward to meeting any NMSers who can make it to the event.
Please come down and say "hi".  I won't be hard to find!  Wear your NMS
(or any Rush) shirt!

Subject: Anthem stocks? Cats & Rush on Dutch TV

Hi all,

some less than thrilling stuff from Europe, where radio stations are
prohibited by the EU to play Rush, or so it seems....

1: What is the ownership structure of Anthem Entertainment? I would love to
be able to own some stock, but is it traded? Does anyone know?

2: We just got 2 kittens, 10 weeks old, and I just had to name one Geddy.
Something made me do it.

3: Rush was mentioned on Dutch national TV last friday. In a music quiz the
lady answering the question confused Rush with Styx (Q. being who played
'Babe'). Hey, it's a start....

And the weather sucks as well!

Subject: Mr. Scovill-isms

Hi gang --

Wow, long time no chat!  Finally found you guys, too!  [thanx to Stuart for
forwarding the new tnms address!]  Seems strange not to type in
"rush@syrinx.umd.edu".....  :-D  Unfortunately, I'm not officially
subscribed,
yet (the Geds willing, in time), but thought I'd pass on these little
tidbits, dare anyone care to know.

For those who may be fans of the Rush CREW, here's some bits on Mr.
Scovill -- responsible for the live sound on tour (hope I spelled his
name right):

He recorded and mixed a CD for a Phoenix band called (if I recall this right),
Looking for Aldous Huxley.  Pretty good band -- generic rock band with bit
o' country twinge to it.  Good recording, too, what little I did hear of it.

And for those who may be losing sleeping over the fate of Alex's leather 
pants from the TFE tour, Mr. Scovill's wife is the proud owner of them!
[or at least one of the pairs....]  :-D

The most interesting thing (to me, anyway) was a videotape I saw of a
lecture he was giving to some students before the TFE Phoenix show at
Desert Sky Pavillion.  Most of it's all audio techno-whazziz.  But he did
say that even HE wasn't happy with the live sound on the tour.  Naturally,
whenever he was about to say a key reason for it, some huge bang
happened, so I couldn't accurately make out what he said (argh!!).  But
it sounded like it had something to do with the rear speakers and the
way they were set up to the front speakers.
    Again, I wish I could've heard what he said, but it had to do with the
delay times between the two sets of speakers.  In live sound, the
engineers will time-delay speakers so that the audience will hear the
sound from the far speaker at the same time as the closer speaker.
Failure to do that results in distortion and muddy sound.  From what I
could make out, it seemed as if the delay system between the rear and
front speakers was not flexible enough, or something.  Inferior to what
Scovill would have preferred, anyway.  He clearly wasn't happy with what 
he was stuck with.
    So for those who were upset about the sound on the TFE tour, take heart:
even the engineer wasn't happy!  :)

If you're in the Toronto area, or are planning a trip up there (yes, I know,
like someone's really going up there in *winter*) -- and you plan a trip 
to the Orbit Room, go on Wed. night.  Blast!  I forget their name (something
like LTC Connection), the band that plays Wed. nights is GREAT.  3 guys, 
and they can JAM.  But take heed -- if you head to the OR after 9 pm, the
cover charge is now $7 CAN...... Tho Tim Notter (owner, operator and
Pal O' Alex) is still the coolest guy around.....  :-D

Whew!  Well that more than made up for being out of the loop for 5
months.
Alright, I's outta hea......

Ho-hoo!
