Is it just me, or does anyone else interpret "in the can" to mean that any
video plans have been trashed?  However, I didn't hear the entire interview,
so I'll take your word for the context of the interview.

If they release a DVD, they don't need to release a box set with the
outtakes (assuming tracks not on the CD make the DVD cut).  The DVD will
sound as good as the CD (maybe better).  Of course, this wouldn't be of help
to people like myself that don't have DVD yet, but I would imagine any video
would most likely be released in VHS format as well.

If Rush were to do a box set, I think Metallica's live box set shows the
best way to do it.  Though there is a lot of redundancy in the set, it has 3
CDs and three videotapes.  The videotapes are taken from 2 different tours
(3 or 4 years seperating the two shows).  This would be a perfect way for
Rush to rerelease the ESL and/or GUP videos out of print.  Maybe they could
throw in mini tour books from ALL of their tours!  However, I hope any box
set (if it ever happens) is saved until Rush has stopped touring.

Subject: New Album / First Rush experience

Hi fellow Rushians,
	I recently heard a rumour that Rush will be heading back to the studio
to start recording an album before the end of the year. Maybe they will
be the first band to release an album in the next millenium. But this is
just a rumour. You know how Rush likes to keep secrets. 
	Anyway, I noticed people have been talking about their first Rush
experience. Here's mine: Back in the beginning of 97, my dad started
borrowing CDS from my Uncle because my uncle is a member of Columbia
House. We recently got a cd player. I had no interest in music. I used
to like sports but I couldn't join a baseball team because I was too
old. I was bored out of my mind. My dad borrowed A Farewell To Kings and
Hemispheres. My dad made tapes of them and he was always playing them in
his car. I though whoever the band was, it was some freaky, weird sc-fi
band. I later saw one of the Hemispheres cd and it said Rush on it. That
was when I found out there name. Then my dad borrowed 2112. When I saw
the album cover, I was convinced that Rush was a SATANIC band. I totally
hated satanic music. But then my dad told me that they weren't satanic
and I started listening to them more. I eventually started to like Rush
and I started memorizing their songs. When my dad got me a disc man for
my christmas, the only cds I owned were my dads Rush cds, so I listened
to them. My dads Rush collection later became mine and before I knew it
I knew way more about Rush than my dad did and I had every cd they
owned. They were sort of like the first band I was ever introduced to.

Hey all good Rush people.

Pop quiz:  "The time I like is the rush hour.  Because I like the rush".  Good
effort, but said by whom.....?

Anyway =>

>Zahid Hassan <zahid.hassan@bradford.gov.uk>
>Well I must confess that I was the instigator of the great Phil Collins vs
>Neil Peart debate in early January. 
   And I have to say Zahid, I thought it was a mighty fine thread.  Ok, so I
have probably said way too much on the topic, but I truly think that PC is
under-rated in the world of drumming [by drummers].  And, as someone who
listened to The Lamb Lies Down today, I for one stand by my comments.  Top
thread.  As for boxing:  sorry, no comment!  Well, other than as a
psychologist, boxing is pretty bad for one's brain.

>From: "Michael Melo" <mj_melo@hotmail.com>
>I'm sorry, but you mean to tell me (and everyone else) that you started
playing drums at age 3?
   Good point!  But, I must say, my eldest son started "playing percussion" at
about 14 months of age.  That was when he was able to stand up at the bottom
of his cot, and reach my congas.  Boy!  Could he make a BIG noise at 5am!
Needless to say, I moved the congas....but only because he played a Bembe
[excuse spelling please] better than I could....

>Simoa Drew <DrewSim@wcboe.k12.md.us>
   As for goose bumps.  Well, many many songs by Rush.  But, the first one
that came to mind was Middletown Dreams.  Straight after the guitar solo, and
the dynamic drops away, leaving a wonderful haunting keyboard....into "Day
dreaming Middletown".  That one takes some beating, and yup, had me crying
back in the mid 80s.

>Stuart Hodgetts <hodgetts@cyllene.uwa.edu.au>
>What is your ultimate Peart Lyric?
   Wow!  This would [of course] change almost every day.  But again, the first
one that sprang to mind, especially given the NATO/Serbia crisis, was this:
"Better the pride that resides, In a citizen of the world, Than the pride that
divides, When a colourful rag is unfurled.....".  On a lighter note, as time
rolls by, the one that seems to fit is: "I think I'm, I'm goin' bald...."

Final point is this =>  I have been unable to find anywhere in the UK that
sells/imports the Burning for Buddy video, or the Work in Progress videos.  I
am so keen to get these - does anyone [especially in the UK/Europe] have any
tips?  Many thanks.

Subject: first Rush concert

Hi-
Just thought I'd throw in my 2 cents worth about first Rush
experiences.  The first time I saw them live was as an opening act for
the James Gang and Aerosmith in 1975 (I was 18 at the time- don't remind
me how much that dates me)!  The featured song was By-Tor and the Snow
Dog.  As I recall, the band blew the other acts off the stage.  When
Aerosmith took the stage, I thought to myself, why didn't Rush headline-
It would have been a much better evening.  To be fair though, I think
this was a nadir period in Aerosmith's career.  Nevertheless, Rush made
such an impression on me that I've been an ardent fan ever since.  Has
anyone read Neil's new book on cycling in Africa?  It looks to be pretty
good.

I can't believe what I just saw!  On VH1's "The Rock Show" the second video
was the concert version of CTTH!  It started out with the TFE tour and then
intermixed footage from previous tours.  It must be off the new live vid
because it was the extended live track from DS!  Talk about your spine
tingling Rush moments....I just had a big one!  Did anyone know this was
coming?  I hadn't heard it mentioned anywhere.

I guess MTV and VH1 decided to split up viewers with eMpTV
 taking everyone under 25 (that's IQ, not age).  Everyone on the list should
write VH1 and give them a stamp of approval.  DAMN!!

Subject: The Ultimate Peart Lyric

Stuart Hodgetts writes: "... What is your ultimate Peart Lyric?"
(sorry for omitting and breaking the rules, Billy Oz)

Ah, fabulous question.

I have many favorite Peart lyrics.  Somedays it seems as though I love
Peart's writings more than any other poet or author including some of my
favorites: Harlan Ellison, Wallace Stevens, Phillip José Farmer.  I'm not
sure why.  I guess he says what I think more often than not....

Well, I can't pick a single favorite, but how about a few "best of"
categories:

Best Peart alliteration - from Enemy Within
Suspicious-looking stranger    Flashes you a dangerous grin
Shadows across your window    Was it only trees in the wind
Every breath a static charge    A tongue that tastes like tin
Steely eyed outside to hide the enemy within...
(This has got to be my all time favorite.  So fun to say)

Best Peart motivation - from Enemy Within
I'm not giving in to security under pressure
I'm not missing out on the promise of adventure
I'm not giving up on implausible dreams
Experience to extremes    Experience to extremes

Best Peart sensory - from Red Barchetta
Wind in my hair - Shifting and drifting
Mechanical music - Adrenaline surge
Well-weathered leather  Hot metal and oil  The scented country air
Sunlight on chrome  The blur of the landscape  Every nerve aware
(yes, there's many many more)

Best Peart lyric revisited - from Chain Lightning
Sundogs fire on the horizon    Metoer rains stars across the night
This moment may be brief    But it can be so bright
Reflected in another source of light    When the moment dies
The spark still flies    Reflected in another pair of eyes

Great Rush moment:  the true meanings of these lines in Chain Lightning came
to me while watching my young boys imitate the players on the field at a
Giants baseball game.  NO!!! They weren't spitting tobacco juice and
cursing.  They both want to be pro ball players now.  Or Pokémon Trainers.
Could go either way.   :)

Subject: Japanese vs. N. American version of Different Stages

Here's a question that I haven't seen addressed on the digest:

Why is the Japanese version of DS so much different than the North American
version?  
  Is it because there is a cultural need to add material for the Japanese
market to drive sales?
  Is it that the Japanese enjoy the song Force Ten the most?  (I doubt that's
it, but who knows)
  Is it that the pricing in Japan is such that in order to sell any, you need
to add value somehow?
  Why didn't the record company add ten bucks to the price in N. America and
sell us the same one?  I would have liked the extra song and the additional
literature that comes with the Japanese version.

Anyone have any theories?

I like this thread because it exposes lyrics out of context and sometimes
you find something new.  It's difficult to pick just one though.

They say there are strangers who threaten us, in our immigrants and
infidels.
They say there is strangeness, too dangerous
In our theatres and bookstore shelves, that those who know what's best for
us
Must rise and save us from ourselves.

YES IT'S TRUE!!!! Closer To The Heart from DS was on last night on VH1's new
show:Rock Show. If you missed it, it should be on again tonight or sometime
this week - 1 a.m. EST. The video opens on the crowd and focuces on a guy with
Rush(first album logo) tattooed on his arm. Then the music starts in. When
Neil plays the bells, the video cuts to the original promo in '77. The rest of
the video intercuts the DS footage with the versions from ESL, GUP, ASOH as
well as the original promo. This must be what Geddy meant by including
"history" in the upcoming DS DVD. My favorite part was the end when it shows
Neil throwing the stick in the air from ASOH and catching it perfectly in sync
with the DS footage. Whoever edited the video did one exceptional job!!!!!!!
This will make any Rush maniac more hungry for the live DS DVD to come
out!!!!! Let's hope it's within the next couple of weeks!!!!! Keep checking
the video stores!!! RUSH RULES!!!!!

Subject: Intro to Rush

Hello all,

This thread about remembering when we were first introduced to Rush is
great.

'Course I'm biased since I posted my experience WAY back in issue #1400.
I went back and found it:  (Look at the date!)

	From: "Shumaker, Matt" <mshumake@trsystems.com>
	Date: Fri, 2 Aug 1996 17:34:36 -0400
	Subject: Re:  Rush memories

	After reading Mike Stack's "Rush memory" in NMS-1390 (and several
others...)  I thought back to my first encounters with Rush.  There are
two...

One:  Middle school (8th grade).  My biggest musical influence was still my
parents and easy listening/pop (their radio stations).  (Later in high
school, I learned a lot of my friends listened to KISS and Steve Miller, etc
in middle school, but I guess I was a little late discovering rock music...)
 Anyway,  one of the guys who sat at my lunch table came in one day with a
"strange" T-shirt with a fire hydrant or something on the front.  I asked
him about it (we weren't really close - we really just had mutual friends)
and he replied "Its a concert T-shirt, I saw Rush last night."  Of course, I
was "sure, ok".  He proceeded to chide me because I did not know about the
"best group in the world"  Much later, I was to learn that the Signals tour
had passed through D.C. and the Cap Centre the previous night.
(It was the Capital Centre before becoming USAir Arena)

Two:  It wasn't until 10th grade when I decided that that song "Limelight"
was REALLY cool and I wanted to buy the album.  Unfortunately, I was
confused with the lyric "all the worlds indeed a stage" because I had
already been to a record store and found the album ATWAS.  Not wanting to
buy an album without Limelight on it;  I finally correctly decided the
song's title was indeed "Limelight" and bought Moving Pictures.  The rest
is, history.  Signals came less than a week later and over the next month or
two, Permanent Waves, 2112, Fly By Night, Hemispheres, Rush, Exit..., ATWAS,
COS.  AFTK was the last album I bought (of the released albums at the time).
 GUP came out soon thereafter.

And the lyric thing:

The three most inspiring sections of lyrics for me are:

1)  "Run to light from shadow, sun gives me no rest, promise offered in the
east, broken in the west"
2)  "Wandering the face of the earth, wondering what are dreams may be
worth, learning that we're only immortal for a limited time"
3)  "Each of us, a cell of awareness, imperfect and incomplete, genetic
blends with uncertain ends, on a fortune hunt thats far too fleet"

<sarcasm on>
Hey, has anybody ever noticed that the lyrics for Freewill in the PW jacket
aren't the same as what Geddy says?  hehehehe - sorry Rush Mgr....
<sarcasm off>

listened to a record from Rush, my shocking experience was about ten
years ago, I used to listen Sabbath, Zeppelin, Purple (the classic wave)
and the new rock-metal bands, but an uncle told me that I had to listen
more music, not just rock, he gave me the chance to view and listen his
collection of music, I listened music from all over the world... but
there was an album, in fact an LP (Long Play=oldie music format), the
cover had a girl and she seemed to be in the middle of a disaster, a
twister or something like that, I didn't think it twice, I listened the
complete album at least five times, then I thought "my uncle is wise, he
has a collection of music from all over the world and he chose RUSH'
Permanent Waves to represent rock music" . Bye and take care. The
force... I mean... Rush is with you.

Hey guess what I saw last night on VH1. Closer To the Heart From 
Different Stages. You know when your passing through radio stations in 
the car and you can recognize Rush even before you reconize the song? 
well when I was flipping through and landed on VH1 that happened and I 
couldn't believe it!!! I only caught the end of it but it showed old 
footage mixed with the regular performance. It Rocked they played the 
whole 

Anyway about Spock Beard: Good band. Me and A bunch of people are all 
going down to NEARFest where they will be playing.  If anyone else on 
the list is going give me an email. I'm really excited because a band 
(Crucible) from around where I live (S.E. CT.) is going to be playing 
there. They are awesome and they're basically the reason I'm going.

Subject: MY RUSH STORY!!!!!

Hey all!  I have been reading all the nms articles I have recieved and 
have to say what a cool bunch of people we are!  To bad we are the only 
ones who see the light!  Anyway, enough babble, heres my story:

When I was about 12 years old, my old man brought home A Show Of Hands, 
and I was in LOVE, its been a honeymoon ever since, I asked him if they 
had ever done any thing else, and he said that they had, but I wouldnt 
like any  of it.  So, about 3 years later, I heard a friend playing 
Farewell to Kings, and said,"I know that sound!" Any way, after I got 
done cussing my dad, I went out, emptied my small savings account and 
bought every album I could find.  I still buy trashed lps at garage 
sales for a buck I must have 10 or 12 2112 vinyls laying around, well 
thats all the air out of me, so....carve away the stone!!!!!!

Subject: Intro/first album

I don't remember the actual year that I heard Rush for the first time, but I'm
guessing this is 88 or 89.  My dad and I were on our way to Indianapolis Motor
Speedway for practice and the first day of qualifying.  He stuck in this tape,
and for the first time I heard Tom Sawyer.  I loved it.  Once I heard
Limelight, I was hooked forever.   For a year or two, I just called it "the
Indy tape."  I'd say "Dad, put in 'the indy tape'."  It wasn't until fourth
grade (91-92) that I actually cared enough to find out their name.  Once I
knew who Rush was, I went out and bought the RTB and Presto tapes.  My first
CD would be ESL.  Since then, I've collected all the albums, have two of the
videos, and have seen them twice (both times on T4E tour).

Subject: Rush experiences

After reading how many Rush fans became addicted in their early teens, I
had to send in my story.  My first Rush experience was with 2112 when I
was 6 years old.  Thanks to a really cool babysitter, a garage sale
transistor radio (who remembers those?), and KMET & KLOS, I was into
rock & roll at a tender young age.  In fact, my first album was given to
me for my 4th birthday.  I still have it - Aerosmith's self-titled
debut.  One night my babysitter brought over this record she had just
bought.  She put on 2112, and I was mesmerized.  5 car washes later, I
had enough money for my own copy (BTW I still have that one also).  From
then on, I was hooked.  "Ziggy Stardust", my fave at the time, couldn't
hold a candle to these guys!  So you see, by the time I reached my early
teens, I was already lost to the Rush cause.  14 years later, when I got
my first CD player, the first 2 CD's I bought were Ziggy Stardust and -
you guessed it - 2112. 

As for chilling Rush moments, I have just 2 off the top of my head, but
they were at major points in my life.  The first was on the CP tour -
02/03/94 @ the Great Western Forum to be exact.  Just 2 & a half weeks
after the devastating Northridge Earthquake, still living out of my car
& having no way to play a lot of my Rush music that I had salvaged (CD's
& albums), having attended 5 funerals, & with a lot of the San Fernando
Valley looking like WWII just ended, life was not good.  That night gave
me a much needed sense of normalcy & the feeling that things will
eventually get better.  The second happened just last August.  After 9
years in college, 2 Bachelor's Degrees, & a teaching credential, I was
finally staring my career.  Of course I was nervous on my way to school
the first day, flipping through boring morning talk on the radio.  I was
almost there when I caught the beginning of SoR coming through my
speakers.  Of course I turned it up & sang along.  The song ended as I
got to school, & I felt more confident about facing my students.  Once
again, Rush helped me through another turning point - thanks guys!

BTW, has anyone else notice that not only are Rush fans anal, we're
pretty long-winded, too.
Bye 4 Now.

Subject: My 1st experience with Rush...

Hello all!
Well, since I've been a NMS subscriber (about 3 years now) and fellow Rush
freak for many years -23 years to be exact! - I figured maybe I could share
some of my experiences about the band we all know and love.
In the spring of '76,I was in 9th grade, I had heard on the radio that there
was going to be a concert here in Sioux City IA.  REO Speedwagon was
headlining, Head East & Rush were the opening acts. I'd never heard of Rush at
this time, but the radio spot was interesting - they played a little snippet
of "Bastille Day", and for the life of me I couldn't figure out the lyrics!
"There's no bread, lemon eat cake".  Obviously, I was sick the day we learned
about French history in school (wondering what the hell "Lemon eat cake"
was!), so I went out and bought the album (yes-  album!) and absolutely fell
in love with it! The music was agressive and progressive and the lyrics
completely captivated me. The very next day I bought *Rush* and FBN as well
and began to learn all the bass parts (I'm a bass player - kinda-sorta) and
totally fell in love with the music.  Also, being an avid reader of Circus and
Creem (Boy-Howdy Beer!) magazines, I scoured the pages every month looking for
articles on Rush. (Boy, how I wish I'd saved some of those articles!) Even
then, the press didn't care much for Rush. Rush became my passion way back
then...funny how some things never change.
Well, Rush played here in Sioux City approximately 6 times over the next few
years-it seemed, at one time, they were here about every 4 or 5 months! -
opening up for bands like the above mentioned and finally headlining here for
various acts like Uriah Heep, Blue Oyster Cult, Molly Hatchet and 38 Special
(plus many more too numerous to mention).  I never missed one concert. They
played like mad men, they always put on a great show with passion and
enthusiam and they completely blew all the other bands away.  I took many pics
of them (when you could take pics at concerts!), but for the life of me, I
can't find them anywhere!  (sigh!)  I remember one time when Rush was here, I
kept screaming (from the front row, of course!) for them to play "By-Tor and
the SnowDog". Finally, after about the 4th or 5th song, Geddy looked at me and
said - "What are you saying?"  Well, I meekly said "Play By-Tor and the
SnowDog...pleeese???" - and he said, "It's coming up!"   < My brush with
greatness?   LOL   Anyhoo...
I remember Neil Peart taking a big swig of whiskey (?) after his solo and
throwing a stick,which I caught.
I can still see Alex Lifeson standing damn near motionless,with his legs
crossed (you try and do that for 5 minutes and see if you don't lose your
balance!) playing a solo that nearly tore my head off.
Choking from the dry ice at the beginning of Xanadu and thinking to myself -
these guys are soooo f*cking cool and this would be a weird way to die!
Thinking that Geddy and Alex's shoes  were waaay too cool ! (HEY!  It was
1977!  Forgive me!)
I talked to a gal who was working backstage security at that time, and she
said "Rush were PIGS! They didn't care if the catered food got all over the
floor! They didn't talk to anyone!"  <if you knew this gal, you wouldn't talk
much to her either.
Seeing Geddy Lee getting into their tour bus behind the Sioux City Auditorium
wearing a "Disco Sucks" t-shirt.
Remembering the feeling I had when I bought my first Rickenbacker 4001 bass
guitar (jet-glo black of course!)  To this day, I don't own a better (or
prettier) guitar.
Seeing my wifes face the day a new Rush CD is released, she's knowing full
well that the CD is all we will be listening to for the next 3 months!
Hearing my kids in the backseat of my car singing at the top of their lungs to
all the Rush CD's I continually play. (and still telling my youngest boy that
"No, thats not a woman, thats Geddy Lee!")
Talking to a friend who told me he didn't like Rush anymore, because their
lyrics were too "arrogant and self-righteous"!!!!!   I think he was listening
to Guns & Roses in his moms Ford Maverick at the time - ya know the "awesome"
lyrics of Paradise City ("take me down to Paradise City, where the grass is
green and the girls are pretty..." < now THERE'S some great masterful lyrics!
Huh?  LOL)  Too "arrogant"  -  sheeeeeesh!  Some people don't have a clue,
eh?
One more Rush story before I bore the shit out of all of you...
Early 80's - Omaha NE. (Rush got too big to play little towns like Sioux City)
  Geddy starts the bass solo to YYz and he blows it!  He completely flubs it
entirely!  He puts his hands on his hips, shrugs his shoulders, looks at Alex
and Neil, they both smiled - they just kept going! No big deal to them, but I
secretly said to myself..."YES!!!  He's human!!"  
To this day, I am still in awe of Geddy's bass playing ability, so it was
rather refreshing (I know I'm a sick puppy!) to see him blow it!  His bass
lines in so many songs are totally fantastic! ( I.E. -"Show-Don't Tell" - "Big
Money"  <the list goes on and on and on and...)   
Hopefully, Rush will be together soon to bring us many more years of fantastic
music and inspiring lyrics - and man oh man, I want a DVD released soon!!!
Well, there ya have it...my 2112 cents.
Thanks for your time. 
Bill

Subject: Intro to Rush and 1st album

  Seeing as this is my first post here, I thought that this would be 
good topic to start with.  The first Rush song I can remember hearing 
was "Limelight", I was on my way to the dump in a friends truck.  I 
really liked it, but didn't go after any Rush CD's.

  When I went to work for my current employer,  he talked about Rush 
being one of the best bands ever, and told me about some of their songs:  
"The Trees", and "La Villa Strangiato" (these remain my top two Rush 
songs).  I was in a CD shop with him one day and I picked up Hemispheres 
on a whim.  I really enjoyed it and I went out and got FBN (one of the 
songs was "Rivendell" and I am huge Tolkien fan.)  What finally hooked 
me was getting the Retrospective part I.  I was totally blown away by 
"2112", SOtR, "Xanadu" and the like.  Rush is definitly my favorite band 
and I spend way too much money on grabbing up their albums and bootlegs.

  By the way, the first album I ever bought was the "Best of Kansas".  
Awsome music, I almost like Kansas as much as Rush!

Subject: The boyz do no wrong to Raymond Scott

Here's another case of Rush's musical integrity:  I came across an official(?)
website dedicated to Raymond Scott, who as you know wrote "Powerhouse" which
inspired bits of "La Villa Strangiato".  The URL is
http://www.raymondscott.com

There is an FAQ, where I found this bit of Rush trivia:

Q: Did the rock band Rush get sued and have to pay royalties for their
unauthorized use of RAYMOND SCOTT's "Powerhouse" in their 1978 recording "La
Villa Strangiato"?

A: By the time RAYMOND SCOTT's publisher notified the band's management of the
infringement, the statute of limitations had expired on the challenge. But
Rush's management, out of deference to Mr. and Mrs. Scott (Raymond was still
alive at that point), offered a one-time "penance" payment, feeling it was the
ethical thing to do. All involved were happy with the resolution, and Rush has
no further financial obligations. Under the settlement, they were not required
to accord RS partial songwriting credit on the piece.

Subject: My Point, Exactly

As a response to my comments about the NP/PC thread, Keith wrote:
"Well, to me, PC just played different stuff.  Sure, less technical at 
times,
but I would say, no less interesting as a drummer....?  To say NP is the 
most
complex percussionist, I think would [a] need clarification, and [b] be
ultimatley futile, as there are LOADS of brilliant drummers out there.
WHO CARES WHO IS "BEST" ?? Just enjoy them all.
Keith"

My point was that "best" is a human construction, an arbitrary label. My 
thoughts were simply that, in my 
20-something-years-as-a-fan-but-also-a-general-music-loving-critical-listener, 
I have yet to see a percussionist with such a passion and pervasive 
talent for drumming of any kind.  That, my friend, is an arbitrary set 
of labels given from one perspective, my own.  I will not bother with 
bantering clarification by citing, labouriously, given songs.  I will 
say this; Are you a drummer?  Play "Driven" (wish that crackhead hadn't 
stolen my CD's so I could double check this, I hating getting flamed for 
silly errors, or I could play ANY of my cd's for that matter to find an 
example, but I digress)...be sure you can count mutiple time 
signatures...one for each hand and foot...and change them repeatedly.  
That is only my opinion, nothing more.
I agree there are some fantastic drummers out there, loads of 
talent...it's the passion to be better and more versatile that sets 
drummers like Peart, Ehart (he was my other point...No one remembers 
Phil Ehart of KANSAS, another technically complex, passionate player), 
Rockenfield of Queensryche (he's really pretty good in concert...the 
band kind of stunts him in the studio), Collins(I think he sold out), 
Alex Van Halen(before he sold out) etceterahh, etceteraahh, 
etceteraaahh.  No real argument can be constucted over who is "best", 
it's rather like comparing mangos...

"It's like a shot of B-12, Jerry...Somethin's moving down there...Yep, 
there's definitly some movin' goin' on"  Costanzaism concerning the 
"mango supercharger effect"

If he would have knocked on the door, I would have the crackhead a $20

I'm trying to figure out the rationale for 3 of the music selections.  =
Also I need to know if anyone knows where I can pick up 5440's first cd. =
 I need 2 of them actually.  I'm pretty sure that it has been =
discontinued but if any of the Canadian subscribers can give me some =
information I'd appreciate it.

Subject: Reader reviews for The Masked Rider 

Just out of curiosity, do people who submit reviews for Amazon read what
they've typed?  The Masked Rider reviews (some of them) are grammatical
and spelling abortions.  Please read what you type.
