Sorry Ben,
	A good portion of us have been ripped off by this piece of shit.  I sent
him $75 for Virtual Songs last August!  That's right, 15 months ago.  I
delt with all of his excuses and backlogs, always re-assured by his lines
like,"Every one of you will get your cd's even if I have to sell my
mother's soul to the devil."  I truly thought his business was legit.  I
guess it was at one point, and he had a huge business, but he decided to
drop off the face of the planet and rip off all those who were still
waiting.  If I ever saw this guy I would kill him.  I very nicely
corresponded with him several times over the lasy year and a half, and he
explained his circumstances.  Well as of this summer he's disappeared, and
isn't replying to any e-mail.  I guess the joke is on us.  Just try and
forget about it.

Sincerely,

Alvaro Graves <agraves@cec.uchile.cl> asked if there was any relation between
Digital Man and The Analog Kid.  

They are second-cousins-once removed.  :)

Actually, in the Signals tourbook Neil says: "I had written 'The Analog Kid'
as sort of a companion piece to "Digital Man".... He [Geddy] liked it, and we
discussed different ways it could be treated musically. As we often do, we
thought it would be interesting to take the opposite approach to what the
lyrics would suggest; make it a very up-tempo rocker, with some kind of a
dynamic contrast for the choruses."

Subject: GUP autographs and Feb. '78 Tour

My brother told me he bought an LP of Grace Under Pressure from someone
on eBay for $93, supposedly autographed by the entire band. When he
received it in the mail, he took it to a local sports/music memorabilia
dealer in Dallas, and was informed that it was a fake. The person he
bought it from said he will return his money (we'll see), but in any
event this should serve as a warning to others who are interested in
purchasing Rush autographed memorabilia on the net. Buyer beware! Note:
This warning is not intended to discourage anyone from participating in
the clearly legitimate Artists Against Racism auction, as adverstied on
the TNMS homepage. 
	Secondly, after pondering the choice of the Hammersmith show for
inclusion in DS, I began wondering why so many live tapes of that early
'78 British tour are floating around out there in traders' collections.
It seems as though most every date of that British tour is out and
circulating on traders' lists. I wonder if Geddy & Co. were aware of
this when coming to a decision regarding which show to release. In other
words, why the British tour? Why not Rochester '77? Was this Hammersmith
run the only shows that were taped that tour?

What do you mean BMG discs are inferior?  I'd heard this before, but I thought
it was determined that the CD's from the CD clubs (ie. BMG, Columbia House)
are of the same quality of those you buy in the store?

Subject: Quality of CD Club discs

Someone recently refuted Michael Williamson's (he of the orbital mind
control laser) assertion that music club discs, especially BMG, are of a
lower quality than direct-label produced discs.

It is obvious, first, that the discs one receives through BMG are not the
discs issued by the record company.  Just pull out any disc you've ever
ordered from BMG and you will see printed on the disc the phrase (along the
lines of) "Manufactured under license for BMG Music Service."  Historically,
though not as much anymore, I think, these discs also included inferior
packaging, often not including the booklets issued with the record company
release.  BMG manufactured discs did (do?) not contain any customized disc
painting, just plain discs with printed track lists.  I haven't bought from
BMG in years, so this may have changed.

Columbia trades only in direct-label releases.

The reason BMG can offer its discs at such a low price is that they are not
selling the, for example, Atlantic release of "Different Stages."  BMG has
purchased the license to manufacture that disc on it's own.  This must be
cheaper for BMG or they wouldn't do it.  This is also why BMG's catalog is
less extensive than Columbia House.  How the disc is manufactured, i.e. a
digital pressing of a digital copy of an original, I don't know, but I can
speculate it is not of the same quality as the direct-label release (again,
if it were, how could it be cheaper?).

Collectors have shunned BMG products as worthless because they are not
legitimate releases.  I had a friend describe it to me as trying to claim a
Memorex recording of the White Album is as valuable as the original LP in
its original packaging.

You guys can re-awaken the "1's and 0's are 1's and 0's" debate if you'd
like.  I'm just saying the customer should know that BMG did (does?) not
trade in "authentic" releases. 

Enough for now.

Howdy All!

Just got done watching the rebroadcast of Alex and Geddy on Atlantic's Digitil 
Arena.  Fantastic questions were posed by all participating.  I especially 
enjoyed "afterimage's" question concerning 'Caress of Steel'.
One question that wasn't asked that I would have loved to pose is "was any 
consideration or will there be future consideration in performing 
'Hemispheres' live?"
Seeing how 'Hemispheres' is "newer" and they seem to prefer playing more 
recent material I'm surprised this epic isn't played at all in concert.

The earliest rear projection screen show I witnessed was the Hem tour.  I

Subject: RE: I was there!/ Geddy's bass solo in Driven

Al Willig <aawillig@millcomm.com> was saying about Alex's feed dying
in Chicago and wondering why they'd have chosen that performance over 
others for the album.

Al, you're right...that REALLY makes me wonder.  Only solution I can
come up with is, if Alex's guitar went out right around the solo and
Geddy had to cover for him a little bit MORE than just for the length of
the bass solo, maybe they decided that the extra bit of "improv" gave
that performance a little extra ZING more than the others.  After all,
nothing seems to bring out the best in performers more than having
something unexpected happen...

It actually reminds me of an article I saw a few years ago around when
Presto came out.  They were asking Alex & Geddy why Geddy did a bass
solo in "Show Don't Tell" and he said it all started as a joke.  Alex
hadn't written the guitar solo yet for that part of the song, so
whenever they recorded, Alex just dropped out at that point.  After a
while Geddy got bored and just started fooling around doing his wacky
stuff in that part and they decided that they liked the feel of it
and they kept it in.

And I happen to think that Geddy's bass solo in Show Don't Tell is one
his funkier little bits.  So there it is:  another great performance
brought about by covering for someone else, although for a different
reason.

Just my  3.14159265359 cents....   :-)

 Famous People: McLachlan, Rush, R.E.M. and the music biz
 by Dennis Sellers, <dsellers@maccentral.com>
 December 10, 1998, 9:00 am ET
 
 As always, the Mac is very evident in the music industry.
 
 As we reported in our Famous People, Sarah McLachlan does indeed use a Mac, 
but she's very pragmatic about technology. Neil K. Guy says her PowerBook is 
just a tool she uses for email, and that the singer "probably doesn't get 
any more excited about the brand of her cellular phone."

 Guy is the desktop systems manager for Nettwerk Productions, McLachlan 's 
management firm and Canadian record label. Pragmatic or not, the company is 
heavily into Macs.
 
 "Aside from a number of UNIX servers used for Web and mail, and NT boxes used 
by accounting, all employees have a Mac or PowerBook on their desks," says 
Guy. "Many Nettwerk artists, including Tara MacLean, Moist and Rhys Fulber 
(formerly of Delerium), also use Macs for writing music. The annual Lilith 
Fair music festival is associated with Nettwerk, and during both tours we 
wired up a production bus with Ethernet and dialup lines so everyone on the 
road could hook up their PowerBooks and keep in touch. I wouldn't say it's a 
particularly big deal, though. We don't have a ton of obsessed Mac geeks. We 
just use the best tool for the job, which is often a Mac -- although the dark 
Apple death spiral days of 1996-97 were pretty trying - plus we like 'em."
 
 Does Rush use Macs? Seems likely. The new Rush Live CD, "Different Stages--
Live," is an enhanced CD that installs a program called "ClusterWorks" by 
Hasashi Hoda. ClusterWorks is a digital sculpting program that uses QuickTime 
as its underpinnings (the CD installs QuickTime on both Macs and PCs).
 
 Check the liner notes in many of Rush CDs and you'll see something to the 
effect of "Thanks to Saved by Technology." Saved By Technology is a Mac dealer 
in Toronto that specializes in the music industry. (Thanks to Colin of 
Galleon Software for the Rush info.)
 
 In the R.E.M. video documentary, "Behind the Music," the group's 
lawyer/business manager, Bertis Woods, has an iMac on his desk behind him 
in a couple of the interview shots.

So which coloured object from the DS artwork represents each of the band?
I could'nt help thinking that Neil would be the "yellow", as he works more

the music:-)

Subject: Survey results from The Rush Teacher Guy

        At long last!  I have finally stopped getting additions--believe
me, I loved them!  Seeing so many different selections for one theme made
me think of such a pertinent cliche:  "The eye of the beholder".  I'd also
like to say that your personal comments (especially from the students) were
a real boost at a time when work seems to eat you up.  Thank you--and thank
you to everyone who emailed me with your favs.
        At present, I have my student assistent typing up all the lyrics
from the winning songs so that I can share them with my students.  I've
added some personal favorites... my student assistent has also added her
own (she's fond of the new stuff only... I give her a month or two before
she's begging to hear something off of PW).  Bringing Rush into my
classroom has been a thrill for me.  And as many of you have stated, to
have had a teacher that liked what we liked would have been so cool!
        Enough gab.  Now for the results.  The number after the theme
denotes how many different response I got to that catagory.  The following

        I must say after all of that, The Fountain of Lamnath was suggested
often; it never made it into the running in any of the seven different
catagories it was nominated.   There were many songs I was surprised to see
and many that greeted me like an old friend.  Seeing everyone's point of
view makes me want to go back and listen to all of those songs again.  Some
suggestions I didn't quite see, but most hit as, "Oh yeah! Good one!"  I
love that we all see things differently.  The more we share, the more we
grow... the best kind of human garden!
        If you can think of any more songs let me know.  I could also use
songs from other artists.  I am very weak in rap and country.  I must,
however, try to find something that appeals to everyone.

If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Complaints are -let's face
it- annoying. Rush recorded it, Rush released it, if you don't like
it, don't listen to it. Just stop bitching.

P.S. Sorry if I come off as an asshole. I'm just sick of people
spending multiple issues about how awful it is that Alex didn't
sustain a note or how they didn't have a guitar solo in Natural
Science or how they shouldn't have put Neil's drum solo on it. This is
a Rush FAN list, not a Rush Criticism list. If you don't like DS, take
it to a used record store, get some money for it, and buy something
else.

Subject: A multitude of stuff

Well, i got a couple of things to say, but i'm not going to waste my =
time talking about half of the stupid stuff that has been mentioned =
before.

First: Rush Sighting- There is a building on Drexel University called =
the RUSH building... Every day i walk by it and forget to write that.

Second: Does anyone have any clue why they are only going to produce =
17,000 copies of Invisable Symphony? I would think there would be enough =
interest in the cd that they could print some more... i mean come on.

Third: DS- Different Stages is a RUSH album, ok! Rush is not a main =
stream band, they are a fan based band, and so i see no need for the =
record companies to spend lots of money on advertising because when rush =
releases an album, we the fans, know about i and are there to purchase =
the disc. If you think about it, what is advertising going to do for =
Rush? If 13 year old puff daddy want-a-be walks into a store and sees a =
poster on the wall for rush next to mase, i'm pretty sure they are going =
to get the mase *caugh* crap *caugh* disc rather than DS.
    I would also like to say that DS is absolutely amazing. It really =
takes you back to the show's and reminds me why Rush concerts are so =
special. I'm almost positive we all feel it, an energy, that is just =
unable to be recreated. This album does a damn fine job of capturing =
that energy and throwing it back at you.=20

Fourth: Anyone have any idea's on how to get the DS(+1) cause Force Ten =
is awsome... i need to have it.

Lastly: I have a forward from a friend that's from 1996 that's a game =
show fight between geddy and trent reznor. If you want it, then email me =
privately. If a lot of people are requesting it though, i'll just send =
it here... if that's ok with the rush-mgr

Thanks for reading my brain spew.

Subject: red Barchetta

<<<From: Tony Autrey <TAUTREY@STB.com>

Hey everyone! I found a site that has an actual red Barchetta. It's made by
Maserati. This car is newer than the song so I'm sure that there are more of
them (unless of course the car was named after the song). If I'm not
mistaken, Fiat made one too. If anyone knows of others or if the word
"Barchetta" has a specific meaning, post it or let me know privately. I know
this might seem like an ignorant pursuit to some of you. I'm just trying to
understand Neil's motivation in that song.>>>

Check the link I sent to Randy for the Rush FAQ dealing with the Barchetta. It
is a Ferrari 166MM Barchetta.
You're right---Maserati and Fiat both made "barchetta" models in the 80's,
("barchetta" in Italian means "little boat," and much like the old Porsche
"bathtub" Speedsters in the 50's, the name refers to the body style). However,
if you see the ESL video, there is the wee Ferrari displayed on the screen.
:)
If you go back and read "A Nice Morning Drive" on the NMS site, you'll
immediately recognize how the song lyrics fit with the story...and if you
should ever get a chance to see an original Ferrari Barchetta, do so. There
were 39 or so made, mostly all for racing, and most were damaged or destroyed
at the circuit. The ones left are worth seven-plus figures easily and rarely
are shown publicly.
(Someone could check----and don't hold me to this----but if you check the
Museum of Modern Art in New York or the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los
Angeles, I know that there are several Ferraris on display. Maybe one is
there. For those of you in the UK, Tom Wheatcroft has a great collection at
Donington. And, of course, when in Italy, there might be one still at the
factory in Maranello...)
Forza Ferrari and hold the Red Star proudly high in hand.    :)

Please, please, would those of you who so desperately want Rush in the R&R
HOF please just get a life (or a brain).  Your childish rantings are really
showing how far we still have to go to raise the average IQ of the NMS
subscriber list to above 50.  Chrissakes.......ribbons!!!!!!

Take a look at who is in the R&R HOF.  90% are losers who no one ever heard
of.  The other 10% were nothing but mainstream appealists who, in general,
never showed any type of innovation or exceptional musical talent.  This is
like expecting Rolling Stone or VH-1 to give equal time to Rush.  Why do
you want so much for Rush to be lumped in with this riff-raff?  

There's a reason why Celine Dion, Janet Jackson and the other mainstream
ilk sell the pants off Rush.  Because they offer braindead "music" for the
masses and the ignorant masses, with little else to stimulate their gray
matter, eat it up.  Rush's music is actually music.  It's challenging and
it's actually written and performed by Rush.  

I, for one, don't want to see Rush in the R&R HOF.  That would simply be a
denegration of everything they have accomplished to date.

By the time this gets posted, it may be old news, but this morning (12/11) I
heard on the radio that DS has gone Gold!
This was on 103.5 the Fox here in Denver.  You see Hanstones, once in a
while Rush does get on the air here.  However,  I haven't heard any songs
off of DS on any Denver station, yet.  In the mini-interview, sound byte
from Geddy, when asked about the future of the band he said he "... would go
with the flow."  He explained that if the RUSH were to just put out new
music and not tour, that would be ok, but if they decided to put out new
music and tour, he would be for that also.  He didn't mention breaking up,
or not putting out any new material at all, so I suppose this is a good
thing.

Does anyone know the actual sales numbers/figures for DS?

Later, ktj

Subject: DS review...

A short review of DS - from the Chicago suburbs' Daily Herald on 12/11/98:

<Rush's three-disc Different Stages (Anthem/Atlantic, ***1/2) comes on
schedule; it's been the customary four albums since the Canadian trio last
released a live chronicle. Most of the first two discs was recorded at Tinley
Park's World Music Theatre, while disc three contains an entire show from
1978's "A Farewell to Kings" tour.

Opening anthem "Dreamline" personifies '90s Rush, a bright and driving organic
mix of precision and technology. Disc three is a Rush fan's delight, the band
youthful and energetic on "Cygnus X-1" and "By-Tor and the Snow Dog," both
career highs.>

Hey kids, 

It's that time, time for me to give up the ol' Victor site.  ALthough I
will be graduating soon, I'll get to keep my web account for a whil, but
that's not what's at issue.

It's more the case that I haven't really been motivated to work on it
since the last presidential election, and I've decided today to gut my
websites and start afresh.

That's where you come in.  Although I don't want to work on the Victor
site anymore, I don't want it to just die and go away, and so I need
someone to take over for me.  It's really not that much work, since Victor
hasn't done anything since 1996.  You just need to update the bios and
keep up with modern technology (the current website is designed for use
with Netscape 2.0, it needs an update bad).  

I think that the Rush-Mgr's should get first crack at it, but if they
don't want it I'll take other offers.  Here's the deal: Email me if you
want the site.  I'll write back and let you know if you're the first to do
so.  Then, go to my site and steal every single file (it's not that hard
to do, really.  Just download everything).  Then email me with the nwe
address, so I can redirect people to its new happy home.  The only
stipulation I ask is that you keep my name up there somewhere (like
"origionally created by" or something)

There are benifits to the job, for example, everyone will think you're
cool as shit.  So email away, that I might fond a happy home for Victor.

 Ben

To whom it may concern:

Congratulations on a fantastic live album.  I am enjoying every song on
Different Stages.

I noticed a single for The Spirit of Radio was released.  However, as a
B-side, the same version of 2112 as appears on the album was released.

I recommend that future B-sides released be songs that didn't make the
cut.  This will help fans get more of the music they are looking for,
and will help drive sales, which will undoubtedly make Anthem/Atlantic
happy.  I for one do not buy singles when there is nothing accompanying
that I cannot get elsewhere or do not already have.  However, for the
bands I listen to (Rush, U2, Pink Floyd, David Wilcox) I do buy singles
that have previously unreleased material as B-sides.

Several songs performed on the past three tours have not been made
available to the public in live form.  I'd like to get copies of these
songs, and think B-sides are the logical approach: 

* Virtuality
* Half The World
* Cold Fire
* Time and Motion
* Limbo
* The Pass
* Double Agent
* Where's My Thing
* Ghost of a Chance
* Superconductor
* War Paint
* Scars
* Subdivisions
* Red Barchetta
* The Big Money
* Red Sector A
* Force Ten

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

Subject: Geddy Interview Info

Hey all, today on 103.5 FM, The FOX, in Denver they played a snippet 
from Geddy (which is probably circulating nationally), but he stated 
that basically everything that we probably could guess at this point, 
basically stating that if it's time for RUSH to not tour anymore, to do 
seprate projects, to move on...whatever...he was going to make some 
joint decisions with Alex and Neil...basically for the good of 
everyone's situations...Ged stressed that he was (like RUSH has always 
been...)leaving plenty of room to be flexable...even if that might bring 
about more eventual touring...so fingers crossed with hope for much more 
RUSH in the future...even if it means less touring!

Also, the did mention that Different Stages had just hit Gold status 
this week!!!

Now if we can all just find one other person to buy the RUSH set, they 
could hit platnum...and like "WE (WILL) HAVE ASSUMED CONTROL!"

Most encouraging thing to me though, is it's a live disc, only touching 
it's second month of release...so in the word of our beloved
Austin Powers "YEAH~BABY!"

I also picked up Pearl Jam's "Live On Two Legs", it is pretty good, but, 
it seriously pales in comparrison to Ged, Alex, and Neil.

HAIL TO THE UNDEFEATED BRONCOS!!!  I posted an article yesterday out on 
the USA~TODAY Opinions site, I had to re~but this stupid "journalist" 
who thinks he's an athority on the subject....

Final note...I know at the beginning of the year I said Ryan Leaf was 
the "real deal", someday he maybe, and I think with June Jones departure 
there is a good chance that San Diego will get Gary Kubiak, our very own 
offensive coordinator here in Denver...I think that may be THE THING 
Leaf would need to get him over the freshman blues...and of course 
letting the maturing process also helps out a great deal.

Take care RUSH heads, all around the world!!!

Peace
