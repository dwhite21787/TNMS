Subject: pentagrams and necromancers

Hey!

	First of all I'd like to address the issue of the pentagram and
satanism.  It had been to my reading and observations that the people who
accuse music and games for satanism do so without trying to understand the
music or game.  One issue that was hot years ago was the blaming of Dungeons
and Dragons of printing insanity curses and witchcraft in the books.  Hmm...
I have't found these, has anyone else? ;)   As for the pentagram, it symbol
was originally used to ward off demons... how in history it was twisted I don't
know...  but if these people want to accuse RUSH of satanism, wouldn't they
that the force and meaning of 2112 is fully against the oppression of the
red star?   it seems we have another witch hunt on our hands...

anyway...

 	Has anyone noticed the similarity between the Necromancer's story and
the reason Gandalf left the dwarves in _The Hobbit_?  Gandalf went south to
rid a land of a necromancer.... neat comparison anyway.  Rivendell has the
same feeling in that it came from The Hobbit also...
                                                  ....just an observation

Subject: broken string in YYZ

&gt;X-Mailer: Mail User's Shell (7.0.4 1/31/90)

	Several people have mentioned that they saw Alex Lifeson
break a string playing YYZ.  One part of the song requires bending
a string (the B, I think) one semitone sharp.  Could it be the B that is
consistently breaking?  With a locking nut and a sharp saddle, I
wouldn't be surprised if the string gave out when it's pulled this
tight.

	Also, someone mentioned that they could buy Chronicles for
$25.  It's selling for $23 Canadian here, which is worth maybe $5 US. :-)

Not only have I heard the cancer romours, I once heard a funny story on why
Geddy sings so high.  It goes something like this:
                When Geddy was a kid, his bike had no seat on
                it.  On day he was riding on a bumpy road and
                he damaged his manhood so bad that he spoke
                and sang with a high voice from then on.
I don't know.  I always thought Geddy sang in the high range, because it made
dogs stop and piss in their tracks.

                                        Enjoy

Subject: Just my $.02

O.K., folks!  Here it goes!  Yet another story about Alex breaking a string.

At the very end of the Presto concert at the Arena in Baltimore, MD, Alex
did it again.  I think that it was at the beginning of In The Mood (or whatever
their last song was), I was looking in Geddy's general direction, and heard
something peculiar.  Actually, it was what I didn't hear -- the guitar part.
It seems that the sixth string (lowest pitch, sorry to all you guitar virtuoso-
type people out there :-)  had snapped, and I saw him in the act of tossing
the one guitar off stage and grabbing another one, which he began playing with
little or no inturruption in the continuity of the song.  As is said in the
Subject line, just my 2/100 of $1...

Subject: Chronicles video, Cancer rumours

Hello all of you out there in RushLand...

I picked up the Chronicles video last week.  Unfortunately I paid a bit more
than everyone else seems to be paying -- $19.99 at Wall to Wall Sound & Video.
A friend (and fellow Rushian) and I had been checking the store ever since
Chronicles' release had been announced.  When I walked into the store and saw
several new copies sitting out I nearly tripped over myself in my haste to get
one!

The video isn't bad.  I wish they were a bit lighter on the concert pieces --
I would rather have seen the studio version to "Tom Sawyer" than the live one,
which I could easily see on _ESL_.  Also, I wish that there had been videos
from _Presto_.  I guess Polygram was to cheap (as usual) to buy the rights
to the Presto videos from Atlantic. Oh well.  All in all, a great vid.
The vintage clips of "Closer to the Heart" and "The Trees" made it worth the
price!

As far as the cancer/death/breakup rumors that have been discussed here, I
have another one.  Rush will not tour again after the Presto tour (I also
heard this for HYF) because he has incurable leukemia and wants to spend
his dying days with his children.  Whatever.  :) :)

[ Which "he"?  They all have children...  Also, check out Robyn Landers' 
  transcription of an interview below for album/touring info.    :rush-mgr ]

Have a happy Turkey Day, everyone.  Gobble gobble.

Subject: Rap music

&gt; Apparently, someone was taken our beloved "Tom
&gt; Sawyer" and put it to _RAP MUSIC_ (pardon the oxymoron).  I have yet to
&gt; hear this myself, but it appears to be true.
[ ... ]
&gt; 	Please, say it isn't so!  First there was the M.C. Hammernuts
&gt; ripoff of "Superfreak", then someone did a dance music bastardization of
&gt; Yes' "Owner Of A Lonely Heart", and now ... THIS?!?  Why?  Why RUSH???!

	You know, every ounce of your hate for rap music, multiplied
by five or six, is how much I used to *really really hate* Rush.

	I subsequently learned better, which is why I'm on this mailing
list.  So be a little more tolerant:  A lot of rap music is really good,
after you learn to hear it; it's just an acquired taste, is all.  As for
"Why RUSH???!", the answer is that the rap group liked it, and that Rush
okayed it.  Which says something about the rap group.

					eh

[ RUSH may or may not have OK'd it - Vanilla Ice didn't get Queen's or
  David Bowie's permission to use the line from "Under Pressure" for his
  "Ice Ice Baby" video.  When it was mentioned to one of the two (I 
   forget who), they said "Yeah, I guess we *could* sue..."  I have no
   major problem with sampling, as long as you GIVE CREDIT.    :rush-mgr ]

Subject: Alex interview at awards show

[ Normally these are special editions, but this is pretty short, as these
  things tend to go.                                            :rush-mgr ]

    The following is a transcription of an interview from Q-107's
Six O'clock Rock Report with John Derringer and Steve Warden with Alex on
Tuesday November 20 live from the Sheraton Centre in Toronto where Rush,
Bryan Adams, and k.d.lang were honoured for being group of the decade,
male vocalist of the decade, and female vocalist of the decade,
respectively.  I've left out all the ums and ahs and some of the
half-started sentences wherever possible without changing meaning.

John: How are things Alex?

Alex: Things are great.

John: Excellent.  Good to see you.

Alex: Good to see you too.

John: It's been ah, what a long strange decade it's been I guess, the 1980s.

Alex: Yeah, when we first heard about this we wondered which decade.
	It's been a few for us almost.

John: Actually that's one of the differences we noticed and mentioned
	to Bryan Adams is that when 1980 came around, both Bryan Adams and
	k.d.lang were unknown whereas by 1980 Rush was huge not only
	in Canada but in the rest of the world as well so as opposed to
	being found in this decade it must be nice to see that you've
	been able to carry on for another ten years and get this sort
	of recognition from the industry.

Alex: It certainly seems incredible to us.  I mean I don't think we ever
	expected to be around in 1990 still doing what we're doing.
	As a matter of fact we're in the studio now working on the
	new record, so it just keeps going on and on for us.

John: It must be even more strange in your situation with Rush in that
	when the band started out the critics slammed you, the industry
	itself wasn't really behind the band.  It was your fans that
	did it for you and it was your fans that you seem to have
	had the allegiance to all those years.  Yet it must be kind of
	strange to see that now the industry has embraced you the way
	they have.

Alex: Yes. I guess it's nice. But you're right.  For us, Rush was never
	a band that, you know, we're not really a very popular Top 40;
	we never had the hit singles that a lot of bands end up having.
	We had to work very hard touring and we work very hard on our music
	and we have a very good relationship with our audience that
	has developed over the last 15 or 16 years that we've been
	touring.  And that's always been the special thing.
	I mean, it's very nice to have this recognition certainly
	but I think the recognition you get from your fans is a lot
	more important.

[break, tunes, ads, summaries, introductions again, deleted]

John:  You guys are working, or I guess are in the preproduction stages
	or very early stages of putting together --

Alex: Very early stages.  We've been working for about two weeks now,
	we're working on the new record, we'll be working until
	probably the middle of December and take a break then,
	get back into it in the new year, start recording the
	end of February and hopefully finish by the end of
	June, take a few weeks off in the summer, and then possibly
	start touring some time in the fall next year.

John: You guys changed quite a bit over the years, 1980 through 1990 --

Alex:  -- Yeah, about 25 pounds.
    [laughter]
John: On the plus or minus side?

Alex:  Unfortunately on the plus side.

Steve: Well you still bowl a mean game Alex!

Alex:  Well, thanks.

John:  But with Moving Pictures in 1981, and now up to what you're doing
	in 1990, a couple of changes in between, a couple of live
	albums in there as well, and you guys have always kind of used the
	live album as the end of one stage I guess and the beginning
	of the next if I'm not mistaken.

Alex:  Right.  It gives us some breathing room.  At least you have
	something that's current and released and you can get away from it
	and I think that's important for us.   Before we recorded
	Presto we took seven months off, and for us, that was unheard of.
	By a factor of three,  I mean we never took more than a couple
	of months off between touring and recording. And we just really had
	to get away for a good length of time.  Really divorce ourselves
	from being in a band, from being musicians, from you know the
	whole thing.  And we came back very enthusiastic when we
	started working on Presto.  We were just really excited when we
	came back to work and it was like a breath of fresh air for
	us.  And it's carried over -- the tour was really great,
	we really enjoyed ourselves, really, for the first time since
	Moving Pictures or Signals tour.  It was a much better paced
	tour, we had a lot of fun, shows did really well, it was I
	think one of our better shows from a staging standpoint,
	and we had a great time.  We suddenly remembered how much
	we really enjoyed touring, and we had sort of lost a bit of that
	over the years.  And it's carried over into this record.  We've
	started working, we've got about four or five songs in fairly
	decent shape at a fairly early stage, and look forward to
	continuing that and going back out.

Steve:  If I could  -- sorry -- just something similar to what I asked
	Bryan Adams how has success affected Rush and your music?
	Has success had an impact?

Alex:  Well it depends on your definition of success.  We've always felt
	successful in that we've been able to play the music and write the
	music that we want to.  There was only really a brief period during
	Caress of Steel that there was kind of any problem with regard
	to support from the powers that be.  I mean management and
	the record company were very worried with Caress of Steel but
	for us that was a very transitional record and a very
	important record for us, but it certainly wasn't a very commercially
	successful record.   And then of course we went on and 2112
	came out after that and everything went great, everybody
	was happy and we've been free to do whatever we want, so
	we've had quite a great measure of success in those terms.
	If you mean does financial success change your music,
	then, well, it is always easier when your bills are paid
	to not have to worry about that aspect of your live.

Steve:  I was more concerned about the creative side of it.
	When you have a success behind you, does that influence the
	way you're going to go from there, or ---

Alex:   No, no, it doesn't.

Steve:  --- do you say ---

Alex:  No no no, no no.  We go out of our way to ---
    [simultaneously]
Alex/Steve:  to avoid repeating your/ourselves

Alex:  Yeah, it's ah, we don't ever have anything written in advance --
	very little written in advance -- we have a few ideas floating
	round, we don't have anything thematic in advance.
	We arrive at the studio and start writing and it goes wherever
	it goes.

John:  One of the things that separated Rush, Alex, from a lot of
	bands has been the fact that it seems like you guys aren't
	into the trappings of the rock'n'roll world.  And when you
	mentioned touring there, the question came to mind that,
	you guys haven't been the out partying all night, being nuts,
	the crazy, the women, the  ---

Alex:  Not lately anyway!

John: [laughs] okay, the ---

Steve:  They bowl late at night, I can tell you that!
    [more laughter]
John:  But that has been something that has separated you from a lot
	and I wonder if there had ever been a time when you guys
	considered packing it in because of that.   Packing in
	the touring part of things.  When you get on the road, and
	you don't want to be there, you have families, and children.
	I mean you guys seem to be really family oriented, really
	home oriented.

Alex:  Yes we are, and we've, I think we've grown to deal with that.
	I mean it's part of the job so you just learn to accept it.
	In the earlier days of course it was a little easier.
	It was all a very exciting thing, and the band was growing
	and developing from the live aspect.  It was quite exciting.
	I think we reached a point in the mid 80s where it was
	the same old thing almost.  I think probably the Hold Your
	Fire tour was the toughest tour.  Geddy was ill for a lot of
	the tour, I remember Neil having the flu for a few weeks,
	and we all had our own little problems, and it was very difficult
	coping on that tour.  I think that's why we really needed
	to have that break that we did.  I think that's probably the
	closest we've come to at least stopping touring.

Steve:  Are you surprised by the band's longevity?

Alex:  Yeah, of course!   I thought in 1974 when we signed our American
	deal and started touring, I thought that if we lasted five
	years, and had the chance to record another five or six records in
	that time, we were really really fortunate.
	But here we are, sixteen years later.

John:  Something that I mentioned to Bryan Adams just a few minutes
	ago when he was here, and I think it's a fair comparison
	to draw between the two of you, is that instead of deciding
	to play Canada, play the bars although you certainly did
	a lot of that here in Toronto when you were first starting
	out in the 70s, but you decided to really give it the big
	shot and go to the States, and really slog it out, and
	it worked for you.  But what would you recommend to a band
	who is in the situation, although the industry has changed
	so much --

Alex:   [something I can't make out] are so different

John:  They really are, but what would you say to a band who you
	thought really had it, in 1990, what route should they go?

Alex:  It's very difficult.  It's a whole different scene.  When we
	were coming up it was possible for a band to get on to a
	two, three, or four act show as an opener and play for
	20 minutes and do the whole run of dates, come back
	a few months later with another band maybe as a special
	guest, do the whole run, come back and start headlining
	small halls, work up to 5000 seats, 7000, and do the arenas,
	and that's what we did.  We just kept touring and touring the
	same places over and over around and around.   That doesn't
	really exist any more.  It's very tough for a young band
	to get on those types of tours.  I think the promoters are
	much more concerned with selling tickets so they end up
	getting two very strong bands, so that area of opening is very
	very tight and very difficult for a lot of bands.
	All you can do is persevere and practise and stick to your guns.

John:   Do you still practise?

Alex:  I don't practice as much as I used to when we're not working.
	I used to play all the time, I practice a lot less.
	Typically before we went into the studio I started playing
	on a regular basis a month before we went in for at least
	two to three hours a day.  Before a tour I practice about
	five or six hours a day for about a month before.

Steve:  The question that everybody really wants an answer to is
	will Rush be going back to that mid 70s image with
	the jumpsuits and the platform boots?

Alex:  Yes as a matter of fact we brought our housecoats tonight,
	and our scarves...
    [much laughter]
Steve:  That was one of the great looks.

John:  It certainly was!

Steve:  When you look back on stuff like that, and what you've done,
	and the different images and stuff like that, I mean do you
	sort of chuckle?

Alex:  Oh yeah, and I cry too.
    [laughter]
Steve: Alex, it's been a pleasure, thanks very much, congratulations.

John:  Thank you very much Alex.

Alex:  Thanks Steve, thanks John.

John:  Rush, one of the artists of the decade., the group of the
	decade in Canada.  Q-107....

Does anyone out there have a copy of "Rush -n- Roulette", a bootleg
of the MP tour?? I really would like a tape of it.  I have "Nassau
Coliseum '82", "Through Any Window" (PoW Tour), and "St. Louis '80"
if any one wants to trade tapes.

Also.... I may be a math major at MIT, but I'm NO GEEK...

I KNOW that I party MUCH more than many State School friends....

Also, is the new album due in Feb. or summer???

I've heard both.
