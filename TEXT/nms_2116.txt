Along with the new look of the website, I've added a new section at the
very bottom of the page, called "Horizons". It's meant to give you an 
opportunity to hear a clip from various artists, and perhaps get you interested
in something besides Rush :-)

I plan on updating it every day or two, so be sure to check back a LOT to
get all the new clips! If you have any suggestions for songs let me know!

Also, there's a new banner that was pulled from Atlantic's website that
is slightly different, it's now claiming the 1978 CD is an "enhanced" CD.
Is it true? Guess we'll all find out on November 10th!

Finally, I'm putting together a list of radio stations that you can bug
about getting the new Rush played. If you know of one in your area, send
me email with the station's web site, email address, phone number, and
cities it serves.

my paranoid sca colleague is quite correct.  the only 'official' organization
for stellar nomenclature recognized by star catalogues is a subcommittee of the
International Astronomers Union.  there is a committee for different
astronomical objects (stars, planets, moons, crates on planets/moons, stephen's
writings, etc.).  this according to carl sagan, perhaps you have heard of him?

the certificate is not worth the paper it is written on.  they have probably the
'sold' the visible stars (3000 or so) dozens of times over.  and really, who
COULD seriously try to lay legal claim to a star?  you'd be better off trying to
own Neil's dexterity (obligatory rush content) at doing a fast paradiddle.

OR...you could use a certificate template from your word processor...and send me
twenty bucks.  if one outa ten nms subscribers believe this, that could
mean...what, uh, what $200,000 bucks, huh?  AMERICAN FUNDS ONLY !  not moroccan

In celebration of reaching issue #2112, I thought some people might like
a copy of something I put together a while back. It's a collage I made
in honor of "The National Midnight Star". Offering it now, to some of
the newer members here on the list, is the best thing I can do to pay
homage to the list, its' members and the rush-mgr (s).

Well done Jimmy & Meg.

Subject: spiritual

Hello y'all,

Sorry for cross posting this, but I want to get it through.

I just saw the excellent movie "Pi" tonight, and it left me thinking. Are
there any other people on this list who believe--in a sense--that music can
be somehow a "window to God" or some sort of spiritual tool? Please, e-mail
me, I'm interested in some dialogue and perhaps setting up some sort of web
site or mailing list about "musical mysticism" or whatever you want to call
it. I personally find good music to be a higher force than anything but
true love, which is also, in my book, connected to God somehow. I believe
in God (or whatever one choses to call it/them) but I'm not a member of any
religion or cult or anything.

This could be interesting if anyone wants to talk about it.

Subject: Money for Nothing

Coupla quick items - BrianB, may I add to your point that other bands
would die without radio play, and add the words to radio play:  and a
cool video? I really think that it seems you just need a great video on
MTV, and then the airplay follows - the music doesn't actually have to
be good, just hip with kids. Especially with teenage girls - they seem
to be the ones record companies are appealing to nowadays.

A while back, in the Baltimore area I saw an ad in a local musicians
paper looking for a guitarist for a reunion of a Rush tribute band,
called Second Nature - does anyone know who they are, if they are
playing anywhere in Balt/DC/Philly region yet? Would love to see them in
the absence of a Rush tour. :-)

Hi fellow Rushians,
	Many of you have been wondering who assumed control in 2112. I'd say it
was the elder race of man. Check out the 2112 tour book at the tour book
sectionof syrinx.yyz.com. It says that the priests were murdered by the
people. They were ripped to shreds. It must of been the elder race of
man.

Subject: Rush on New Mexico Radio

So I'm driving back from New Mexico with my brother and we were listening to a
classic rock station (98.1 out of Santa Fe), when "Limelight" started.  My
bro, who has slowly emigrated into Country/Westernville, says "this is the
only song they ever play by Rush on the radio."  I didn't bother mentioning
that obviously he hadn't been tuned in lately to hear Tom Sawyer.

I was glistening with pleasure about an hour later when "Time Stand Still"
came on, and when it ended the DJ said something like, "there's Rush,
featuring probably the greatest drummer of all time Neil Peart."  Of course he
pronounced it "Pert."

Attention owners of laser disc players:

        Is one of the reasons you invested in a laser player so you could 
play all the Rush lasers previously available? Well I bought one for that 
reason & now after purchasing all the previous Rush lasers (except Through 
the Camera Eye) I find that they are abandoning us in favor of dvd! What the
hell? We have been loyal to the end with this band. If you are as upset as 
me, please give me contact numbers, e@mail, etc.. to protest this situation. 
Different Stages should be released on laser! We are still here! We still buy 
laser discs!

     "On a number of things. What Slim says about English pronunciation is 
     correct, but, by the same token, nobody here says Zed-Zed Top.  You do 
     not have to be consistent.  Part of the fun is knowing that letters 
     and combinations of letters have different values, even within the 
     same language.  But while we are at it, how do you pronounce Peart?
     Like Heart? Pert? Peert?  More to the point, how does he pronounce 
     it?"
     
     To Paul et al->  This pronunciation thing will always have its place 
     here on TNMS. :)  I just wanted to add that regarding "ZZ Top", I have 
     always pronounced it as "zee-zee top" (and that's the only way I've 
     heard it here in Canada).
     
     Now regarding dear Mr. Peart's name, I seem to recall an interview he 
     had on Toronto radio around the Signals era, when the DJ put the very 
     same question to him.  "How do you pronounce it?"  To which Neil 
     replied (and I may be paraphrasing here), "It's not 'part', 'pert' or 
     'purt', it's 'peert'."
     
     I agree that band names can frequently be open to interpretation, with 
     little harm done when in error.  However, a person's name should be 
     respected, and we should strive to use the correct pronunciation at 
     all times.

Subject: CTTH - ironical?

A rugged individualist, does Peart really mean for us to take his lyrics 
at face value in "Closer to the Heart?"

"And the men who hold high places must be the ones who start to MOLD
a new reality...."

Would Peart, a self-described "left-wing libertarian" want a "new reality"
orchaestrated from the TOP DOWN?  The "men who hold high places" line
seems to imply an ideal CENTRALISM.  The following lyrics, including the
examples of industrial and agricultural workers cannot help but conjure
visions of the old hammer and sickle....  Are not the priests of 2112 fame
simply men who held the high places and molded their own (albeit
deplorable) new reality?  

I think Peart is an incredible lyricist (and, of course, drummer), and I
think the lyrics of CTTH are both beautiful and brilliant, but I wonder -
are they meant to be ironical?  I'm actually very interested in this
question (I quoted the song in my graduation speech!) and I'd be
interested to know how others interpret this- please feel free to email me
about this personally (andrew.hung@yale.edu).  I'd love to hear your
insight. 

Peace out-

Subject: Rush fans other faves:

I forgot who came up with this thread, but I like the idea of listing =
our other favorite bands.  Especially because most Rush fans I know have =
quite varied tastes.  I feel the need to make two lists: one for =
all-time faves and one for more current faves.  Many of my all-timers =
have stopped recording.  I hope that isn't a reflection on my musical =
tastes.

ALL TIME:
    1.    Rush  (if you hadn't guessed this one, DUH!)
    2.    Billy Squier    (this guy just made some great tunes for about =
5 year, still love them all)
    3.    The Fixx**    (actually have returned with a solid new CD, but =
I'm not sure anyone else knows)
    4.    Robert Plant (solo)   =20
    5.    tie: Alan Parsons Project (always quality, intriguing music, =
if not always great) and Pink Floyd

CURRENT:
    1.    Rush=20
    2.    Dream Theater    (arouses passion in me like no one else =
currently)
    3.    Jeff Buckley     (oh shit, he's dead)
    4.    Del Amitri    (these guys write some great, almost visual =
lyrics)
    5.    Sarah McLachlan    (beautiful voice, wonderful songs)

I'll even go one farther and list my top albums of the 90's (a little =
early, I know, but I'm not feeling optimistic about 1999, considering I =
am buying fewer and fewr albums every year)
1.Rush -Counterparts    - gets better everytime I hear it
2.Sting - The Soul Cages     - his best=20
3.Sarah McLachlan- Fumbling Towards Ecstasy    -
4.Jeff Buckley - Grace     - Billy Joel was right, the good die young
5.Dream Theater - Awake    - nicely varied
6.Robert Plant - Fate of Nations    - his triumph, the cumination of a =
solo career
7.Del Amitri - Change Everything    - great lyrics, great music, their =
best
8.Dreams So Real: Gloryline - how in God's name was this so overlooked??
9.Van Morrison- Enlightenment    - excellent from start to finish
10.Rush-Test For Echo    - hard to top Counterparts
11.Dream Theater- Falling into Infinity    - these guys keep improving
12.Sting - Ten Summoners Tales    - same quality as Soul Cages but =
lighter-hearted
13.Victor    - Alex flexing the muscles!
14.Duran Duran    - I'm not nuts!  Listen to it!
15.Plant - Manic Nirvana    - a relief after Now and Zen and its =
Coke-mania
Honorable mention goes to Saga for Generation 13 (impressive, perhaps =
their best!) and King of Fools (self-titled).  Don't bother looking for =
the second one, I got it from working in radio and probably no one will =
ever see another one, but I played it over and over for two months =
straight!

I'm really curious to hear from other folks. =20

polite and friendly, but rest assured there were lots of places off
limits to all military personnel because of very high incidents of crime
against them, which NCIS tells us about all the time.

Hi,
Could anyone give me info on how to get a copy to the TS cover by DeathOrgan?

Also, I think there may be a few psychodots fans on this list.  You'll be
interested to know that they just release a live "Official Bootleg" 2CD set.
Check the website for details, you can order it there.

Here's another pre-release sighting on the web... cduniverse.com is
offering Different Stages for $19.97, the lowest price I've seen yet
(they show the list price as $24.97).  Still no cover image to go with
the ad.  CD Universe is also calling this a "2 CD Set".

Music Boulevard (musicblvd.com) is listing the album, but no price is up
yet.  They also have a rather bizarre track listing that mixes up tracks
from all three discs...

and yes there are many, of BUZZARD radio. For the next month, we'll hear
from Kid Leo, Dia Stein, the legendary "Boss" concert from the Cleveland

treasures and world class rock that were only heard on 100.7 WMMS.

Subject: No Rush in the Car

Hi all!
I just got a new car.  The 89 Geo Metro with 171,000 miles on it finally
gave up and died.  So I got a 97 Mercury Tracer.  The only bad part about
it is it has no tape deck.  It is tragic to not be able to play Rush tapes
at will.  Usually I go through my 6 pre-sets on the radio, and when I find
nothing more entertaining than Rush, I push in whatever Rush tape is in my
cassett deck.  Now I have to rely on the radio to play Rush for me, and
they just don't do it often enough for my tastes.

Yes, the obvious thing to do would be to buy a cassett deck, but
unfortunately buying the car has tapped me out of money at present.  So
what to do in the interim?  I got a lighter adapter and hooked my Walkman
up to it and bought some little speakers for it.  But the speakers are
really pathetic.  My big question is, can you hook a walkman up to the
car's stereo system, the speakers of which are quite good?  Or is some
there some sort of electronic differential that can't be easily fixed?

I'm going through sever withdrawl.  It's horrible.  Although a few days ago
the local rock station played the one song that I can't have in the car:
Red Barchetta.  I've had to be strict with keeping that song out of the car
because I speed horribly when I drive and listen to it.  And now I've got a
bigger engine.  Luckily there were no cops to catch me:)  And that same
radio station, the very next morning played Spirit of Radio.  The DJ was
supposed to say, "This is 98 Rock with Rush," but the DJ said, "98 Rush",
and after initial teasing the other DJ's decided that 98 Rush was a great
name:)

I'm sorry, but this is an idiotic argument frankly.  You are 
paying for an album of music, not a container of music like a 
litre of bottled water or something.   The fact that it is 
physically possible to fit more music onto a CD does not imply 
that there's an obligation to do so; why should it?  They wanted 
to release a specific set of tracks and they used the minimum 
quantity of CDs per album necessary to achieve that.

When you buy  music you are paying for production costs, artistic
creativity and performance, studio time, not CD capacity.

I work for a major electronics firm in Dallas Tx. and I supervise the set-up
and tear-down of our booth that we use at trade shows all across the
country. Recently I was setting up our stuff at a trade show for stock
traders in New York City when I confirmed something that I had been told
years ago. After all of the companies set up, they stack their empty crates
in the aisles to be removed until the show is finished. There was one
company that had "YYZ" stickers all over their crates and sure enough - they
were a Canadian company. Of course I could not make this trip complete
without snagging one (they get torn off anyway). I had always heard that
"YYZ" had something to do with Canadian shipments and now I know that it's
true. If someone can tell me EXACTLY what it stands for, let me know or post
it on TNMS for other fans that don't know.

Hey Y'all,

First off, howdy to newcomer Annette Parks, John Spiers & Peter
Coblentz...welcome aboard. I met them all at a charity carwash 2 weekends
ago here in Atlanta, all the proceeds went to end Class Struggle. John won
the $50 Tommy Hilfiger gift certificate they raffled off!!!

Anyway, besides the live Rush offering that comes out on Nov. 10th, the 4 CD
Bruce Springsteen box set of ALL unreleased material (something Rush would
never do) comes out, as does the new Metallica double CD (1 disc of out of
print/import rarities and 1 disc of brand new music...Metallica interpreting
songs by those that inspired them.....something else Rush would never do).

So... unless I sell a couple of the Glock 9mm Police Issues (still in the
box), I may have to make a decision someone won't like. Why do all my faves
have to put something out on the SAME day? All I have to say is, "Thank You,

Subject: Different track order from CDnow, Atlantic web site

The tracklisting on CDnow follows a slightly different order that what
we've seen until now.  It is as follows:

Disc 1
01. Dreamline 
02. Limelight 
03. Driven 
04. Bravado 
05. Animate 
06. Show Don't Tell 
07. Trees, The 
08. Nobody's Hero 
09. Closer To The Heart 
10. Overture {a} 
11. Temples Of Syrinx {a} 
12. Discovery {a} 
13. Presentation {a} 
14. Soliloquy {a} 
15. Grand Finale {a} 

Disc 2
01. Test For Echo 
02. Analog Kid 
03. Freewill 
04. Roll The Bones 
05. Stick It Out 
06. Resist 
07. Leave That Thing Alone 
08. Rhythm Method, The 
09. Natural Science 
10. Spirit Of Radio, The 
11. Tom Sawyer 
12. YYZ 

The only problem I see is the "The Oracle" is not listed on disc 1. 
However, "The Oracle" IS listed in the tracklisting on Atlantic's web site.
 "Bravado," "Nobody's Hero," and "Closer to the Heart" all have been moved
around

The differences on disc 2 is that "The Analog Kid" is now listed as track 2
instead of track 4, and that LTTA, The Rhythm Method, and NS are in the
order that they were played in on the TFE tour.  The Atlantic web site also
lists those three songs in the same order that CDnow does (although they
forgot to list "The Analog Kid" and "Show Don't Tell" from disc 1).  I
personally am much happier with this order.  Although it's the same songs,
the order they played LTTA, The Rhythm Method, and NS was perfect on the
tour.

The pizzas will arrive at 11:00pm.
