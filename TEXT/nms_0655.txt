Hi Guys.  I know that I posted about Rush on the Radio a few days
ago, but since then I have found something new.  There is a Pirate
Radio Station near here that started up the other day.  I have had
them play Rush six times in the past two days!!  They will play anything
that they have.  I am going to talk to them, and maybe do a Rush
radio show on there.  Something like the RushHour and start with
the intro from ASOH.  Just stopping in.

-Waldo

ps.  Greg (Bluto), email me if you think the show is a good idea
and want to help.  We can talk to the guys, I think they'll give
us a slot.

Subject: Metallica and Repeat Posts

&gt;As I have mentioned here before, "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" from
&gt;Metallica's "Master of Puppets" features the bass riff from Rush's
&gt;"Tom Sawyer".  This is probably why M. thanked Rush in their liner
&gt;notes.

   This may be true, but its the first time I've ever heard it.  In any
event, I don't think that Metallica would thank them just because they
ripped a riff off from Rush.  I think (and this is just speculation
rush-mgr) that Metallica may have opened up for Rush at one point.
   The rumor about Geddy producing a Metallica album may be true, but I
think that Geddy was supposed to produce the ...And Justice For All
album.  He couldn't because the band was working on Hold Your Fire.

   [ Still, an interview or some concrete information source would be
     nice.  I still can't recall that this is true.  Anyone know if it's
     true Geddy was to produced Metallica? 		:rush-mgr ]

   Geddy also mentioned a bunch of times that he digs Metallica.  I have
an article at home (from GW) where he says that he thinks the only other
band trying to achieve that "hard rocking sound" is Metallica.  I think
he's talking about the technical aspect of both bands music.
   Also Lars Ulrich (drummer of Metallica) went to Neil to get some help
with his playing.  I think this was right before AJFA.  Lars went for a
more laid back, Phil Rudd type sound on the controversial black album which
was the most recent album.
  And finally, in some interview, when asked which band they thought they
were most like, Metallica responded Rush.
  And finally finally, when Eddie said he didn't listen to new music he was
full of #$%@.  He just has to big an ego (maybe not as big as Sammy) to
admit that he does.  (rush-mgr: I like VH; really I do!)

&gt;And does anyone think it to be just a TAD BIT wierd for them to open
&gt;with Bastille Day on AtWaS?  I love the song but can't figure it as an
&gt;opener!

One thing I've noticed (and I'm almost positive it's not in the FAQ;
I haven't checked in a while, but this is such a mundane topic, that
I can't imagine it being listed) is that on all 3 live albums, the
opening song is the opener from the next-to-last album.  Also, has
anyone noticed the pattern of four studio albums followed by one
double live album?  It'll be interesting to see if they follow suit
by reaching another plateau on the album after "Critical Mass" (they
also describe 2112, MP, and HYF as plateaus) and then release live
album #4....

Lessee...the 1st was a quote from Shakespeare, the 2nd was the title
of a Huckleberry Hound cartoon, and the 3rd was a lyric from "Prime
Mover."  Any guesses as to the source for number 4?

   [ Actually "Exit... Stage Left" is not a cartoon itself; it is spoken by
     a Huckleberry Hound cartoon character, the pink mountain lion 
     (Snagglepuss?).						: rush-mgr ]

&gt;'Northern Stars' was the name of the Canadian answer to USA for Africa,
&gt;and the song 'Tears are not Enough' was included on the We Are The World album
&gt;(and yes, Geddy DOES have a line or two in the song.) Hear n' Aid, on the
&gt;other hand, was worldwide.

Actually, it was Northern Lights.  I listened to the song over break
(my mom got guilt-tripped into buying the album) just to hear Ged.
The song itself made me nauseous, but I got a kick out of hearing Mr.
Lee screech, "Oh, you know we'll be there!!!"

I don't know if anybody mentioned this already, but none other
than Hugh Syme is credited for Art Direction & Design on the
new Coverdale-Page album.  It's a good album, but some parts
maybe are a bit *too* Zeppelinesque (if that's possible for
Jimmy Page).

BTW, if anybody knows who this Coverdale guy is, please send
me email and save me from my ignorance!

Subject: Tull & Such

Yo, folkes...a few thangs:
    This Ian Anderson collaboration rumor was a vicious, nasty
bit of laugh which required hours of expanding my personal conscious-
ness to forgive. Downright blasphemous hoax] Some things you just don't
joke about. It WOULD be an interesting interaction, however. Someone
call 'em...and yes, Mssr. Anderson did indeed do a song called "Fly by
Night" on his "Walk Into Light" album. I thought I was the only one
who owned one, and regarded it a fossible pigment of my imagination.
The respective songs don't have much in common beyond the title, but
there is another song which...probably should be discussed on the Tull
list (if there is one; anybody know?).
    Wish I could make the convocation up in Otronto, if only to help
it happen, but-alas-'tis-not-to-be. Next year, perhaps, if I start
saving $$$ now...hope it gets off the ground anyway. Sounds like a
time. Luck to all, and the effort IS appreciated, even if we can't
make it]
      A final thing which was of interest to me, since I lack ftp
abilities so far as I can discover, is an ftpmail server, which will
process all those ftp requests you wish you could make. The address is
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com and I think we sent a message with just "help"
as text to get started on it.  You send all your commands in a mail
message, it ftp's them for you and sends back the result. A bit on the
roundabout side, perhaps, but for some of us the roundabout is the only
bout about...?

(Tapes, really, not boots &lt;no Coleman hipwaders, please&gt;. The only
one I ever got my hands on was a radio show done right after Neil
joined the band. Mostly stuff off the first album, but included was a
Beatles tune--"This Boy", it seems. Copy recorder moved too slow; Geddy
could REALLY hit those high notes] It's currently floating somewhere in
Arkansas with a friend of mine, so I don't know if I can land it again
or not. I do have access to lots of other stuff besides Rush, if anyone
wants to swap a few....something off the Hemispheres tour would be
marvelous, being MY first Rush concert.  I deemed "Rush" a most
appropriate moniker after THAT one....)

     refering to is "Bad Boy" from Beatles VI.		:rush-mgr ]

Subject: Re: Anthem Record's phone # -- Prime Mover
Date: Sun, 4 Apr 1993 01:39:12 -0500 (EST)

G'day folks,

I have a question, and an answer.
The question:
  Does anybody have the Phone number to Anthem Records?  I am working on
  a preview to Critical Mass for our university's last printing of the
  newspaper this year.  Respond via E-mail please.

And the answer...concerning "Prime Mover" and what it means:
(First off, remember poetry and lyrics can be interpreted many ways.

Prime Mover is one of the names given to the supreme being by the Deists
during the era around the mid-to-late 1700's known as "the
enlightenment."  Another popular title is the "Clock Maker."

The Deists were the forerunners of the Unitarians, who take a scientific
approach to religion.  Basically they say if it cannot be seen, it
cannot be proven...but that does not mean it does not exist.  Are you
with me so far?

I do not know what Neil had in mind exactly when he was writing the
words to "Prime Mover," but they strike me as talking about the creation
of such a movement which bucks the system.
  "ALTERNATING CURRENTS
   IN A TIDEWATER SURGE
   RATIONAL RESISTANCE
   TO AN UNWISE URGE
   anything can happen"
That is my first clue.  The other line about "ALTERNATING CURRENTS" (you
look it up) is along the same lines.

The last two stanzas sound as if the Prime Mover is talking itself:
 "I set the wheels in motion
  turn up all the machines
  activate the programs
  and run behind the scenes

  I set the clouds in motion
  turn up light and sound
  activate the window
  and watch the world go 'round--"

The belief is that the Prime Mover created the world and then detached
itself from the world, to watch its creation, or move on to other
things.

Oh, and the stanza about "FILTERS ON OUR EYES..." I think it is about
how we tend to not see the views of others clearly because of our own
views, which tend to obstruct what we see...to darken our lenses.

One last thing:  The most well known Deists were Thomas Paine, Thomas
Jefferson, and Ben Franklin.  Hence the Separation of Church and State.

--Clator (officially L. Clator Butler, Jr.)
--lbutler@hubcap.clemson.edu

p.s.  How many of you think Tori Amos should open for Rush?  I think she
would be perfect.  She is Canadian, she has incredible music, she is
incredible live, and her words are the only thing that can move me as
much as Neil's (And Roger Waters, for that matter).

   [ Roger Waters...ah an excellent choice! :)		:rush-mgr ]

Thoughts, anybody?

Hi all:

To Michael Miller (I think):  Well, the way I use my .sig (possibly not
the best way) is to (1) create a file called ".sig" or whatever, and (2)
whenver you want to put it in a file, use the "insert file" command in whatever
editor you are using (M-x insert-file in gnuemacs) to put it in there.  This
probably isn't the most elegant way to do it, but it works for me.

To Floyd F: The band, Golden Earring, (of "Radar Love" fame) wrote a song
called "Twilight Zone" in the early eighties.  It has almost no similarities,
save for the title, to the version on 2112.

Subject: Rush a) The Band b) L*mba(ugh) and Clinton/New World Man

    [ Folks let's keep the political stuff to email pupleeezee? :rush-mgr ]

I've had the same problem with these two Rush options. It really puts me
in a bind now. If I say "I like Rush", I get these looks from people like
I'm off my tree, and then I have to explain, "No, not Limbaugh, the band!"
and those looks oftentimes STILL don't go away, *sigh* Oh well...

BTW, don't think that liberals have the corner on the market in hating Rush
(Limbaugh! Not the group! :)  ). I count myself as a conservative (for the
most part!) and can't really stand the guy. He's an egomaniac. If you've
got a good AM receiver, try Mike McConnell's Midday show, 10am - 2pm EDT,
at 700 WLW, Cincinnati. He should be receivable within 400 or so miles at
that time.He speaks far more profoundly for conservative views than Rush
ever did.

On the Clinton/New World Man issue:

"Is this a joke?" - David St. Hubbins

No, actually it is what Neil Had in mind when he wrote those lyrics in the
early 80s.... He was SOOOO scared that he hopped in his time machine and
had a conversation with himself to write this song "in code" of course.
Neil's next stop: The delivery of a coded message to the 1st Century A.D.
IT's working title is "Revelations". Come on! Neil would be ashamed.

On another note, I like the cover concept for the new album. Pity it's an
April Fool's. You had me going until the Ian Anderson part. It just seems
like to much of a good thing to be true. Perhaps I should have figured it
out with the baseball song, but with the boys, you never know! (That's part
of why I love Rush! [No, no... not Limbaugh, let me explain...])

Here's some of the song.  It should be pretty accurate, but don't

Hello Rush fans!
        Has anyone ever figured out what happened to the second
verse of Beneath, Between and, Behind found on FBN?  I have never
heard the verse, save the original.  I have RUSH COMPLETE VOL.I
and DELUXE ANTHOLOGY, neither of which have the "missing" lyrics.
I was just wondering if anyone knew the deal.
        I also would like to agree that Rush and a good buzz make
for a wonderful time.

Re: Jeremy S. says, "Why conjecture about an album until it happens?"
	Because it's fun to anticipate, perhaps?
	I bet Critical Mass has to do with an environmental theme.  That
we're wasting the planet with no care until we're in an emergency state
and have no air/fuel/water et cetera left.
	Or maybe it will deal with the importance of reaching out to

minimums and maximums of what we need in our daily lives?

Here are the favorite band poll resluts, tabulated in several different
ways.  A couple notes on how I counted the votes (1,2,3... :) ).  If you
wrote "These are my favorite bands _other_ than Rush...," I assumed you
meant Rush was your #1.  If you said two or more groups were "tied", at
one spot on your list, I "untied" them and put them in the order you
listed.  When I refer to "Total Votes", that means any group listed, from
#1 to #5, got 1 "vote".  "Total Points" were counted by giving a #1 choice
5 points, #2 choice 4 points, etc.  The total number of responses I got
were 63.

Drum roll please, Neil.
And the results were...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Subject: Prime Mover

	Just some thoughts on the "what does Prime Mover mean" question.
While I don't really know, it's really abstract I think, I may be able
to shed some light on it.
	In Greek cosmology (crystalline spheres that held the planets) the
Prime Mobile (Prime Mover) was the entity responsible for turning the spheres.
He turned the outermost sphere (a sphere of fire) and this motion
was in turn carried to all the inner spheres: the sphere of fixed stars and
then the spheres of the planets Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the
Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. The Earth was motionless at the center
of the universe.
	This cosmology comes mainly from Aristotle. He thought that all
motions in the heavens were "natural." Thus the prime mover was _the_
source of all natural motion.
	So I think the song might be about some modernistic type of "Prime
Mover" perhaps some kind of quantum mechanical energy? All of our energy,
our motion, is of course based on the energies and motions of atoms and
molecules. These are composed of the "basic elemental" quantum particles.
	...so consider life in terms of quanta... the Sun fuses nuclei
creating photons and neutrinoes, the photons make there way out of the sun
in about a million years, eight minutes later they arrive at earth, get
filtered by the atmosphere, the photons that are filtered the least are
the most useful to plants, certain molecules in plants use this energy to
build other molecules, ones that are essential to our life, storing energy
and then converting it into our motion in the macroscopic world.
	...and as to how the mind is structured in terms of quanta nobody
really knows...
	does any of this help? I would be most glad to hear other thoughts
on the subject of "Prime Mover" because it's still kind of above my head.

Greetings Rusheads --

First post, etc.  After seeing the numerous polls come and go in the single
month I've been a subscriber, I figured I'd hop on the bandwagon and offer
you a poll that will at least make somethin' happen.  Seems as though I'm
getting married this November, and I've already started a list of music
that _will_ be played at some point.  Rush being part of that list is a
given, but I figured I'd let the NMSers decide exactly what the songs would
be.  If the wedding string has not grown completely tiresome, e-mail me
what you think the most _appropriate_ Rush tune would be for my nuptials.
I'll post the results in a week or so, and the winner(s) will be played
Nov. 20!  So, if you already took the plunge and wish you'd played (insert
fav tune here), plan to play (ditto) at your ceremony, or just think (song
X) is the greatest thing since seedless grapes, lemme know about it!

And, no, I'm not Catholic, so I can't entitle the whole shindig _Critical
Mass_.  :/

Look forward to hearing from _you_,

&gt; musical inferiority complex. And nearly 14 years later, there aren't
&gt; any punk bands left intact from that time, and the title "Permanent
&gt; Waves" was indeed prophetic.

The Ramones are certainly still around.  Henry Rollins of Black Flag is
a bigger force now than he was then.  I saw the Buzzcocks tour 1.5 years
ago.  Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys is still his Jelloy self.

You're seeing the punk ethic through the eyes of what many call now
dinosaur rock, and discounting the ideal of "live fast, die young, and
leave a beautiful corpse".

What was left behind is what matters, not where they are now.  "Spirit
of Radio" is no greater an achievement simply because Rush trot out the
old warhorse every year or two in concert halls around the world.
Similarly, "California Uber Alles" is no less a classic just because the
Dead Kennedys broke up.

For that matter, some may see "California Uber Alles" as a greater
achivement because of the effect that the DKs have had. Disposable
Heroes of Hiphoprisy do a great version of it on _Hiphoprisy Is The
Greatest Luxury_, as well as a different mix on _Virus 100_, the DK's
cover comp.  Other than Primus snagging on some of "YYZ", I don't know
of anyone else who has felt the same way about Rush.

None of this discounts Alex, Geddy and Neil's influences on me, the
readership of NMS, or the world in general.  Rush was my first Favorite
Band, and will always be up there.  But, oh, to have seen the Buzzcocks
in their heyday back then, or the Ramones or Agent Orange or Dead
Kennedys or... the list goes on...

In response to Mike Silverman.

I think the reason that Rush don't release more live material is that their own
standards require them to make it good quality and therefore value for money,
but they really do not enjoy making live albums. They have to spend about a
month going over old stuff - they may have played it several thousand times and
they just get bored - they want to get on with writing. In this situation I
think the ratio 4:1 is good. We can still gripe about it, but we ought to
consider them as well when griping.

   Last NMS Benjamin Radford asked about the cover of Roll the Bones

   That makes Roll the Bonnes have quite a few other interpreations,

Opening songs other than Big Money/Spirit of Radio/Force Ten..
hmmm...

I thought of a couple interesting openers.

I think Overture and Temples of Syrinx from 2112 would be a cool opener as
well as YYZ... It would be cool to have them start the show off with something
instrumental and powerful... (this is why La Villa Strangiato didn't get the
vote -- it starts kind of slow).

Other possibilities could be Anthem or Limelight (which they used to follow
up Force Ten on the RTB tour, which was excellent).

Hello,

jarmone@kenyon.edu posted in the last TNMS asking for an
explanation of the song Prime Mover. Here are my thoughts.

I think the line that best describes the meaning of the song
is "The point of the journey is not to arrive." It's a song
about what an individual can do with one's life. "Anything
can happen" if you want it and work for it. It's a song
about celebrating life as an individual.

And yes, the name "Prime Mover" has been used to describe
God. But I think the meaning in the song is closer
to the Prime Movers in Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand.

Do we all agree? Does anyone agree? Is anyone out there?

Will:
	I believe you are right.  I don't remember when I first heard it, but I
am certain that Geddy Lee almost ended up producing Master of Puppets.
I was beginning to think I was the only person who ever heard this.

	On the subject of screwed up song titles, I remember when WZZO in
Allentown/Bethlehem PA first played dreamline.  All day, they promoted the 
song as "Desert Highway."  They didn't actually get it right until just before 
they played the song.

	As for the Moody Blues. Please!!!  The day Rush plays with the Moody 
Blues is the day I throw myself off a cliff. (Just my opinion, of course.)

P.S. Michigan by three.  GO WOLVERINES!!!
