And the rush-mgr speaks...

&gt;   Also, listen to the beginning of "Tom
&gt;   Sawyer"; if it sounds like the first 1/2 second is chopped off, then
&gt;   you probably have the bad pressing.  There's an address you can send
&gt;   it back to for a replacement; somewhere in Illinois or Indiana, if I
&gt;   remember correctly.  I did it, and got the new one back in about two
&gt;   weeks.  Anybody have that address?  I'll look for it... it's in the
&gt;   old issues somewhere, but waaayyy back in early '90 or late '89.

  Please PLEASE post this address, someone!  I know I have the bad pressing,
and I have been thinking about trading it in on a new one.  Unfortunately,
at the local CD stores, you get only $4 or $5.  If I can get a new MP
for trading my old one, excellent!

  BTW, some readers were asking about CD availability at stores, some
Rush discs were hard to find.  Everyone, do yourself a favor and get the
Noteworthy CD catalog (call them at (800) 648-7972 to order CDs, call them
at (603) 881-5729 to get a catalog only).  The selection is excellent for
all musical types and genres, the service is quick, and you won't beat the
prices unless you buy used CDs or join a record club.  Record clubs have
pretty limited selections once you get all you want, so give Noteworthy
a try.  Disclaimer:  I'm only a satisfied customer, I have no other ties
with Noteworthy.

  Good luck!  (And get that address to us soon, oh rush-mgr...)

Subject: Limited edition CD

In TNMS #138, Ronald L Chrisley &lt;chrisley@ws.oxford.ac.uk&gt; said:

&gt;I have my first RUSH CD single: Prime mover.  It says on the front:
&gt;"Stictly limited edition single".  It has the same tracks as the 12",
&gt;so that means I have a CD version of New World Man live, as well as
&gt;another CD version of DEW (with a great extended intro)!  Tai Shan is
&gt;also included.

I also picked this CD up at a record show.  I was wondering myself though
about the "Strictly limited edition single"...  how many of these babies
were pressed???  Anyone have any clues???  It would just be neat to know
how many of these CD's are floating around.  I paid $13.00 for it, which I
thought was a hell of a deal.

Hi there,
	In response to Robert Whitehead's posting,
I am a RUSH inspired poet/lyricist.  I think it would
be an excellent idea to compile writing of the list members.

Watch out for the Neil impersonator though!

Subject: Poetry

Actually, I suppose the poem can also be in answer to David J. Kenney's
post about people being fanatical about Rush, too, since that's the
real subject of the poem.

Never shown my poetry to 500 people at once before...scary...

  In Awe

What friends they are
I long to meet
Yet fear the meeting
When awe loses its filter
And humanity reigns again

Admiration--
The ultimate optimism
Mists my senses
As I read and listen from afar
Analysis reveals ever deeper meaning
Ever increasing talent
How much is imagined?

Where is the thinning line
Between admiration
And fanaticism?
Between mere pedestal
And Mount Olympus?

There is lies--
In ability to criticize.

From: David Sandberg &lt;dts@quad.sialis.com&gt;

Jason Bold correctly points out that the intro riff of
"Free Will" is best described as being in F Lydian, but
I have one small adjustment to make:

&gt;   The notes he plays for the F part are:
&gt;
&gt;   F - F - C - C - B - A - G - F - F - C - C - E - D - C - D - G
                                                        ^^^^^

For the benefit of any guitarists out there trying to
learn this riff, the two notes I have marked above should
be B and C, rather than C and D.  (This does not change
anything about the modal discussion, BTW.)

For everyone who is really interested in the music of Freewill:

In the May 1990 issue of Guitar School, there is an excellent transcription
of the song(it also includes the music to Show Don't Tell).

The music is also in tablature form...If you cant find the issue write to
me, I will see if I can find additional copies...

                                     ...UNTIL LATER...

   I saw Laser Rush at Gates Planetarium here in Denver last night, and
it was a pretty cool show. All of the songs were from the 80s except
for 2112 [overture, temples of syrinx]. Other songs on the playlist
included Red Lenses, The Weapon, Tom Sawyer, YYZ, The Body Electric,
Show Don't Tell, Spirit of Radio, etc. There weren't any songs off
of Hold Your Fire, Power Windows, or Pre Permanent Waves albums.
[except 2112]
   Any word on the new Rush album?  I hope the boyz get a little heavier
sound and get less cliche...

So many people have sent me mail asking for the source code for
doing anagrams that I thought I would make it *very* short and
post it here, since it is only 33 lines long now.  Here it is:

/*  perms.c - Donald Cross, January 1991

#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

char it [30], out[30], used[30];

void perm ( char *s, int k, int n )
{
   if ( k == n )
      printf ( "%s\n", out );
   else
   {  int i;
      for ( i=0; i&lt;n; i++ ) if ( !used[i] )
      {  out[i] = s[k];
         used[i] = 1;
         perm (s, k+1, n);
         used[i] = 0;
      }
   }
}

void main (void)
{
   printf ( "Enter a string: " );
   scanf ( "%29s", it );
   perm ( it, 0, strlen(it) );
}
