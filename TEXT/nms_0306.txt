From: Michael J. Konopik &lt;zzz@erg.sri.com&gt;

In TNMS #303, Ian asked about the meaning of "The River" in the lyrics for
"Tom Sawyer".  When we read the book in English class, our teacher discussed
its meaning in the book.  It supposedly represented the detachment of the
main characters (riding the raft) from the rest of the crazy world through
which they were floating.  The river was a kind of buffer.  In the song, this
line comes right after the verse that describes his strong-mindedness in the
same terms ("..a quiet defense, riding out the day's events").  It would be
nice if those words were included to strengthen the metaphor.

If you take out those words, none of the meaning gets lost; but what's left
musically sounds somewhat thin.  So maybe "The River" serves the same purpose
as those "mister"s that Springsteen sprinkles in his songs - just some filler
to make the music sound better.  What do you think?  IHNO (I have no opinion.)

You asked about KC, Cam?  Some similarities with Rush are easy to spot,
especially the strange time signatures and lengthy instrumental breaks.  King
Crimson got back together around '80 and made 3 studio albums - "Discipline",
"Three Of A Perfect Pair", and "Beat".  All three are pretty similar, and
each one is just a little better than the one that comes after it.  So if
you're going to audition some KC, you're better off starting with "Discipline".
Or maybe the one before that - wasn't it "In The Court Of The Crimson King"?

One really cool thing about "Discipline" is the track called "Indiscipline".
Not only is the title opposite from that of the title track, but the melody
is also opposite - it's the same as the title track's, but BACKWARDS!  Like,
opposite songs, eh?

Happy listening.  Lately, my non-Rush has been:

 1) Eric Johnson:	Ah Via Musicom
 2) Van Halen:		For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge
 3) Queensryche:	Empire
 4) Living Colour:	Time's Up
 5) McLaughlin/DiMeola/DeLucia:
			A Friday Night In San Francisco
 6) Van Halen:		II
 7) Oingo Boingo:	Dark At The End Of The Tunnel
 8) Ted Nugent:		Free For All
 9) Leo Kottke:		Guitar Music
10) Steve Vai:		Passion And Warfare

Subject: Dreamline..

&gt;..is out, for those of you living in a cave, with poor radio reception, or
in an area with a dearth of decent radio stations.

It seems to be in wide release, as I've heard it on two stations in
the Boston area so far (WHJY - Providence, and WBCN-Boston).

Anyway, the a number of the articles in the Digest I just received
stated, it's an adequate song. :-)

I suppose one way to analyze is to call it _Presto_ with more
keyboards.  Or alternatively, _Signals_ with more bass. ;-)

It's got an excellent bass line, along with some nice work on guitar.
The drums aren't overly complex (*sigh*), but as typical, fit nicely
with the music.  My only (limited) gripe is that the vocals are mixed
to be what sounds like in back of the bass and keyboards.  By no means
is it synth-heavy, however.

I'm sure it'll be analyzed to death (which is par for the course), but
hey, I've already picked out my favorite-lyric-which-will-fit-in-a-signature.

I suppose I could feed it to my Sun, if there were enough requests.
I'm not to thrilled with the idea, but since I expect everyone who
would grab it will buy the album anyway.. :-)

Maybe I'll stop by Atlantic this weekend and grovel for a copy of the
CD..

&gt; Just a question that has been gnawing away at my gut, for sometime now.
&gt; Does anybody see a "contradiction" here?
&gt;      "All puffed up with vanity
&gt;       We see what we want to see
&gt;       To the powerful and the wise

&gt; What's so wise about fooling oneself?  I would think the wise would not

I've always interpreted it as:

	To the 'powerful' and the 'wise'

Basically, powerful and wise only in their own eyes.

For interests sake, I would like to submit my top five listened to (favorite)
Rush and Non-Rush albums:

Rush:

1.2112
2.Moving Pictures
3.Power Windows
4.Hemispheres
5.A Farewell to Kings

Non-Rush:

1.Mahler's "3rd symphony"
2.Stravinky's "Rite of Spring"
3.Wagner's "Parsifal"
4.David Sandstrom's "Drums"
5.Beethoven's "6th symphony"

(These lists change periodically, though, just as Rush's music has and will
continue to do.)

Diersity among Rush fans is one of our greatest attributes.

Subject: English Mission

Hello,

To Atthe: Please simply space by this.

David wrote in the last issue:

:One last short comment about the Mission lyrics:
:
:About the lyric "if their lives were exotic and strange", the
:Neck Romancer writes:
:&gt; Neil wrote "If" as the first word, inferring that their lives
:&gt; *aren't* exotic and strange.
:
:I don't happen to agree for a number of reasons; for one thing,
:that implies a change of tense halfway through the sentence,
:which is bad form and certainly unlike Neil.  As I see it, the
:usage of "if" here is another common literary device; substitute
:"allowing that" for the if and you'll read what I believe was
:intended.

I'm not trying to get on David's back here, but his point about
the English is simply wrong. There is no change of tense; Neil
is simply using the form of the verb `to be' which is appropriate
for an hypothetical of this kind. That's my last word on 'Mission'
lyrics.

You know, it really sucks to know that people are hearing new rush and I
can't do a damn thing about it, except wait and hope it will be played on
a local station. Dreamline! All this talk about people hearing it is
making me crazy! It's like, I'm trapped in this glass room, and there is
a bunch of Penthouse centerfolds babes outside, beconing me to come
hither. And I can't do a damn thing about it!!!!AAAHHHHH!!
I'm going to call up KOME right now and demand Dreamline!
Also, how about a Rush party in the bay area?! C'mon, there are so many
Rushheads out here! Let's do it! I WAS going to tell about the Bass
Player magazine thing but I noticed a couple of people beat me to it.
Well Nyaa, Nyaa, Nyaa to you anyways!

Y'know, There's a line in the song the weapon that I just can't figure
out. It makes my brain hurt to try to figure out what Neil Means. Maybe
one of you can shed some light. Here's the line:

And those who push us down that they might climb-
Is any killer worth more than his crime?

Does this mean that he is for or against capitol punishment? Does it mean
that a murderer's life is worth more than his crime, therefore he should
be spared, or does it mean that his life is worth more and he should pay
for his crime with his (or hers, for all of you femenist freaks) own
life? AHHHHH! My brain is strting to itch! Please shed!
Hey, That recent photo of Pee-Wee Herman, he's lookin' stylish eh?
Well, I'm going to ambush all of the local radio stations with requests
for the new Rush song. Later All!

Oh, to the person who posted and said that he subscribes to a Marrilion
BBS, please, I need to know how I can get into it too! Marillion is one
of my faves! (how about that song "No One Can" off of Holidays In Eden!)
Please let me know how to get the Marrilion reading list or whatever you
call it. Thanks, in advance.

I haven't heard anything else since I taped it.  I transcribed it on

Anyways, here it is to the best of my ability:

He's got a road map to Jupitor
Radar fix on the stars
All along the highway
She's got a liquid crystal compass
Picture book of the rivers
Under the Sahara

They travel in the time of the prophets
On a dessert highway straight to the heart of the sun
Like lovers and heroes
And the restless part of everyone
We're only at home when we're on the run

He's got a star map of Hollywood
A list of cheap motels
All along the freeway
She's got a sister out in Vegas
A promise of a decent job
Far away from her hometown

They travel on the road to redemtion
A highway out of yesterday
That tomorrow will bring
Like lovers and heroes
Burning the last days of Spring
We're only at home when we're on the wing

We are young
Wandering the face of the earth
Wondering what our dreams might be worth
Learning that we're only immortal
For a limited time

Time is a gypsy caravan
Steals away in the night
To leave you stranded in dreamland
Distance is a long range filter
Memory of flickering light
Left behind in the heartland

We travel in the dark of the new moon
A stary highway traced from the map of the sky
Like lovers and heroes
Lonely as the eagles cry
We're only at home when we're on the fly

We travel on the road to adventure
On the desert highway straight to the heart of the sun
Like lovers and heroes
And the restless part of everyone
We're only at home when we're on the run

hope this is correct.  ENJOY

You know you're a RUSH fan when you start entering the numerous checks

\begin{jealousy-mode}
Am I going to be forced to stop listening to my CD's in the car?  Must
I face that alternative of RADIO just to listen to _Dreamline_?  I
shall, but I don't like it at all!  I mean, I am so jealous of all of you
that has heard it already.  I feel left out.
\end{jealousy-mode}

And on another note, thanks for bringing me up to speed on Queensryche.
I bought _Empire_ and feel in love with it instantly, I seriously thought
that I had a favorite non-RUSH album on my hand, that is atleast until
I heard _Operation Mindcrime_!

P.S.  I wasn't going to say anything about this, but, if you are planning
to flame-n-flee, DON'T!  People really belittle themselve when they do
stuff like that.  I mean, cast the stone of arguement and then run away.
Besides, I have yet to see our illustrious rush-mgr editting out anything
negative about him, so stop accusing him of doing such.  I almost wish
he would get rid of the dribble (I mean flame-n-flee stuff) out of the
NMS, as this stuff has no interest to me, but I guess it has meaning to
someone, so leave it in.

P.P.S.  Thanks rush-mgr, just for being you!  (and of course, managing
such a great newsletter!) :-)

Hello out there.  I'm new to computing in general and this newsletter in
particular.  I am extremely excited and pleased to see that there are some
hardcore fans out there who put this together.  (What a great time to
discover NMS-- a month before a new album!)

Anyway-- I've only seen one issue (08/05/91) and would like to ask a couple of
questions.  Please cut me some slack; I don't know what questions may seem
infantile or what topics have been beaten firmly into the ground in past
issues.

About bootlegs and rare recordings-  I have obtained a (very) modest collection
of out-of-the-ordinary Rush stuff over the past few months by picking through
second-hand stores:  a mint condition Japanese import copy of the Hemispheres
LP (with the lyrics in Japanese, no less!), a mint condition LP of "Rush
Through Time" which I understand to be a legitimate German release (am I
right?), a very good radio "promotional use only- not for sale" 2112 LP,
a two-LP bootleg by Stellar Dynamics (?) from a 1974 performance during which
the guys play "Fly by Night" live on stage for the first time ever (this set
is of amazingly good quality, considering the age of the recording), a
Hemispheres picture disc LP (which I think is Canadian), and finally, a three
LP bootleg of a Chicago date on the Moving Pictures tour, which is pressed
onto swirled, multicolored vinyl, so the sound quality is a little bit lower
than on regular, boring ol' black vinyl, but it looks cool.  :-)

So.  Can anyone tell me more about these recordings?  Are they rare? Are they
valuable?  Did I get screwed?  Or (dare I hope?) is there any sort of
comprehensive discography of rare and bootlegged Rush that is available and
would tell me what these are and what they're worth?  Help.

Another question:  I saw Rush in Minneapolis last June.  My best friend and I
left our house at six in the morning to be first in line to buy tickets for
the show the morning they went on sale.  We ended up stuck about halfway back
and halfway up in the arena; not bad, but not anywhere close to great.
Meanwhile, a friend of mine who lived in upstate New York at the time (who
likes Rush but is not a _fan_), decides the day before the concert that he
would like to go see them.  So he heads over to his friendly neighborhood
Ticketron outlet and says, "Gee, do you have any tickets for Rush left?"
To which they reply, "Gosh, is the ninth row in front of Geddy Lee okay?"
Ninth Row!!  What am I doing wrong?  Some friends of mine are considering
traveling to at least three or four shows this tour, and I would like to see
then up close and personal.  Does anyone out there know how to get the good
seats?  Who do you have to know?  What do you have to do?  I really would
give an arm or leg or worse to see them from the first ten rows.  Anyone
have any advice?  (I wrote to the B-Man about this, but got no answer.  Does
he answer his mail?)

I guess that's all I can think of for now.  I'd appreciate anyone's input
and am ready to contribute any knowledge I might have to this think tank.
Thanks.  :-)

You know you're a Rush Fan when...

You hear 'the morning after' that you kept hollering, "Just make sure that
there's Rush playing when I pass out!!"

In case some of you don't get Bass Player magazine--Ged has been voted
