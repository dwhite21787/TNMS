Subject: Stupid Radio Announcers

Hello y'all...

On the radio this weekend, one of our local stations is doing a "Top 500
Classic Rock" countdown -- in alphabetical order (strange).  This station
plays hardly no Rush, but I caught "The Spirit of Radio" this morning and
"Tom Sawyer" this afternoon.  Well, after Tom Sawyer, the announcer came on
the radio and basically said the following (paraphrased):

"That was 'Tom Sawyer' by Rush.  Rush features Neil Peart, who's probably
the best drummer in all of rock music [cool!], and he writes their lyrics
too.  Well, he came down with a form of cancer, but he's doing better now..."

D'oh.  It's sad that *radio announcers* carry on rumors such as this... so
let's all pray for Neil and hope he can make it through his chemo, or
something like that <g>.

I bet there's a plastic surgeon in Toronto who's laughing his head off
every time he remembers the Yiddish kid with the funny name who actually
believed that crap he told him about "the bigger your nose is, the better
you'll sing".
 -- David Malan

So there I was, surrounded by thousands of screaming Rush fans, wondering
to myself when this loud rock band would lave the stage so I can hear what
he has to say about Newt Gingrich.
 -- Ruth Goodman

I fell sorry for the poor girl in the "Time Stands Still" video. She was
trying so hard to film the boys and they just wouldn't let her. When she
showed her boss the tape, she probably got fired. It probably ruined her
career.
 -- Donald Dintaman

Think these are funny?  There's a whole collection of Saturday Night
Live-style "Deep Rush Thoughts" online at
http://www.space-dye.com/humor/drt.html -- check it out!  They were
compiled about two years ago from posts here on The National Midnight Star.
 It's been about 2 years, so I'm guessing most of you weren't around back
then.  Let me know what you think, and if you've got any new submissions,

A wee lil' Rush sighting for ye!

WHile working (? kind of) this Memorial Day...  I surfed onto the CNN web
site, and eventually got to a message board asking the question, "what do
you like to read while on vacation?"  When what did I see before my very
eyes...  someone mentioned the Masked Rider!  "Peart's prose is as
eloquent, clever, and inspiring as are his lyrics, and his world view is a
breath of fresh air.  I can't wait for his next one...?"  

G. Gerig, if you're out there...  THANKS for yet another attempt to
enlighten the world.  I was pleasantly surprised!

Subject: re: 2 words, 2112, M. Gibbs, and M. Denney

This is in reference to a thread asking to describe Rush in 2 words.  Even
many, many, many words will never describe Rush, but with thanks to Martin
Gibbs' 4/24 posting (Emotional Rush), I think we all (IMHO) can use these 2
words he said to describe our feelings of Rush.

       "Baptize Me!"

We'll have one big *** concert, (it'll have to be months long, the boyz will
be very tired) and one by one we can all climb Jacob's Ladder (metaphorically
of course) to study the Natural Sciences during our Lessons of the way Neil's
world has taught us it should be.  He is a wonder, ain't he?  If you want to
put words to it, go ahead,  but for me they're just this feeling that's always
with you, always making you think, always picking you up when you need it, or
letting you feel it's ok when you're not, and always making you just f###'g
smile real big!!    CRANK IT UP!!  (way up, if you want to)  Excellent insight
and excellent jams!!  There are never just 2 words for these guys to me except
as I  have noted.  Mr. Martin (don't want to be too formal, but he does
deserve a title after what he wrote so eloquently! Yes, I know it was a long
time ago as postings go, but it was excellent!)(imho) Anyway, Mr. Martin could
not have said it better.  

I  have been a fan since '77 and 2112 was quite an eyeopener for me as a
teenager.  
Here's to that thread of "where were u when..." with 2112!  I think I was 15.
(go ahead, figure out my age) :"Who is this band?"  "God, are they good!", and
"This is a really cool f###'g story!" were all some of my first responses.  My
dad's however were quite the opposite after reading the album jacket, and I
quote: "That's it!  #### society, kill yourself, and smoke pot!  Is this what
this world's coming to?!!"  And with that said, the album went flying across
the room, crashing, unharmed (thankfully), into the wall. (Sigh-he'll just
never understand.)  Those were the days, eh?  And as "Driven's" lyrics now
voice on the cd player..."the road unwinds before me, and I go riding
on..."...thru Rush's continual words, worlds, energy, insight and fantasy...as
long as I am..."I see the work of gifted hands, grace this strange and
wondrous land..."  Geddy's voice is "home"...wherever that may be or is...and
Neil's work is (to quote another great artist) "a sensation". No Alex flaming
here please, I don't mean to leave him out of this.  ((Hey, on YYZ does any
one else picture them running thru the airport (like they have to) on certain
sections of it?)) There's my tribute to Alex: a thread:  the pictures he draws
in your mind with his chords and riffs related to the song topic. Yes, No?
(Can't you just see the characters fighting in By-Tor?)  Or was this done
already?

As for the #2112 issue, I sure do hope the band will provide the content for
the issue, it just wouldn't be right any other way.  It should be a tribute
(personal letter) to the fans from their hearts and minds because that is
where they live in us, imho, "with the heart and mind united in a single,
perfect sphere."
Otherwise, my vote is for a blank page... just hold our own jam sessions in
our own way.  

"Peace of mind and sanctuary by loud waters flow..." Peart
"Quickly fading into the stones and the shadows (that's me now) the grey-
cloaked people of Lorien rode towards the mountains, and those who were going
to Rivendell sat on the hill and watched, until there came out of the
gathering mist a flash..."  Tolkien   (he musta been talking about the boyz
there!)  ;)

P.S.  Here's to Mike Denney's post that had me rotflmao!!!! Side splitting
entry there, dude!!  He wrote:
"That's it!  I was trying to think of a way to represent the trio in web-ese, 
and thought of this:

Subject: couple things

This is very kool...

I have been a Rush fan since 1980.. Seen them 19 times from GUP on, own
all their records, yadda yadda yadda....

What is kool is that today, for the first time ever, I noticed, in the
Dalmations back spots from the Signals cover, the word Rush.. Its a
negative image and is clear as day...

I'm sure this has been talked about before and is really nothing more
that a kool tidbit.. Its just very kool  to be a fan for so long and not
catch something like that. That happens with their music sometimes
too... After hearing a tune hundreds of times, you happen to hear
something totally new that has been buried  in the mix  to your ears all
these years, if even only one chord, or note or fill.....  This is one
of the marks a truly great band, IMO. 

One other thing.. I recently was given a copy of an album that I was
very reluctant to listen too, but was blown away by when I finally did.
The album is the debut self titled album by the band Ambrosia.. YES
Ambrosia.. That Air Supply-like cheesy love song band...  Well let me
tell you, their first album is anything but cheesy..  Its heavily
Yes-like, with undertones of the Beatles, Rush, Steely Dan and Billy
Joel all thrown in there, and quite progressive.. Don't be turned off by
the name.. Definitely check it out! Especially if you like Yes!

I watched Alex pretty closely during the last few tours
because his voice was getting better and sounding more
and more like Geds.  He appears to be 'triggering' the
vocal part with his Midi Pedals ... probably a sample
of Geds voice.  Mind you this is merely speculation,
but the timing was too perfect and there was no other
sound made apparent at the step of his foot.

And before anyone says it ... yes, he 'said' Subdivisions,
in his own voice, during the Signals tour.  Which could
explain why he now samples Geds voice.  :-)

Are you absolutely sure on this?

"Take Off!" was one of the reasons I started listening to Rush, and 
that didn't happen until late 1983, early 1984 (My senior year).  I 
was a long time Bob and Doug fan (from SCTV), so I sure that 
album didn't come out until 83 or 84.

Perhaps 2113 should be called 2112+1, then 2112+2, 2112+3. :)

Or just Volume II, Issue 1 :)

To be pedantic he used a flanger on the first album - certainly not
overdubs - to achieve the effect as evident on (eg) In the Mood.

Sorry Rush-mgr(for the mild political content..but this must be
straigtened out for once and all!!), but if anybody thinks that the guys
in Rush actually want anything to do with Limbaugh, and finally realize
the guys actually think he is a big goof, check out Alex's oppinion of
him on the T4E album premiere!!<flamer off!:)>

I've always disliked how the explosion at the end of the

Geddy was asked this question on a radio show some years back.  He
responded that he was very careful to sing the correct lyrics and did
not sing them incorrectly.  He stressed the part about being careful
to sing the correct lyrics.  So does Geddy know what lyrics are on
Permanent Waves?  Of course he does.  He probably sang them a hundered
times in the recording studio.  IMHO, he changed the lyrics to make
a point about the song Freewill.  Free will (the concept) deals with
us having the power to change our destiny, if their is destiny.  Free-
will's (the song) destiny is written on the lyric sheet.  But Geddy
changes its destiny.  I realize this is a major stretch, but it fits
and it's a good explanation.

Now for a tougher question: on PeW, the first song is The Spirit Of
Radio.  On ESL, the first song is Spirit Of Radio (no The).  Which is
the correct title?

Gov (or guv) is short for Governer, which I believe would be the British
equivalant of a very formal "Sir."  Whatever it's used for, it definitely is not
Doug.

My 7 year old son listens to his CD player every night as he goes to sleep.
The current CD he plays is Grace Under Pressure.  His favorite song is
probably The Body Electric (he dances around singing "one zero zero...).
Before that, he used to listen to Moving Pictures. Red Barchetta was his
favorite on that one. He even saw a model of a Ferrari Barchetta at some
store and had to point it out to me..."Look, dad, just like on Moving
Pictures..it's a Red Barchetta."

Subject: Rush are just freat guys

I,'ve listening to Rush for some 23 or so years and have loved there
music since I first heard them.  And that was during the 2112 tour in I
think 1977  See I won a back stage pass to the two day show in San
Anotnio, Tx. where I lived at the time.  I can't begin to tell you how
thrilled I was. Before the show I got a chance to meet the guys and they
were great!!! Alex even spent a few minutes showing me how to play a few
licks "Something for Nothing" and They were more than happy to answer
any question that I ask.  Beside being the best musicians I've ever
heard they are just fantastic people!!!

     Hi fellow Rush-heads:
     
     I've been a dedicated fan since 1980.  I've collected all the 
     remasters, some videocassettes and some boots.
     
     Last Friday night, my wife and I saw Van Halen at Madison Sq. Garden 
     in New York City.  We were amazed at how many "old songs" they played. 
     The thirty-something audience was on their feet for practically the 
     entire show.  
     
     On the way home on the No. 1 subway we wondered what it would be like 
     to hear By-Tor and the Snowdog, Bastille Day, or Passage to Bangkok 
     one more time again.
     
     Although we respect Neil, Alex and Geddy's musical preferences or 
     taste in deciding which songs to play, we can't help wanting to hear 
     the songs that got us hooked into Rush in the first place.

Hey gang..
I'm in a pissy mood today, so watch out......
I'm glad Rush gets a little exposure now and then from the TV, ie: game show
answers, etc.. I'm even glad David Spade mentioned them in his act. It does
bother me, however, that no matter how long has passed since Rush could be
conceivably identified with the long haired idiot, pot smoking crowd,
they're always remembered for that, not their excellent current sound..I'm
sure the band gets a little miffed when they hear stuff like that. Their
music goes way beyond some idiots passing the pipe around at a show. The
only good thing the smoke was for was making the lasers look cool.. Uh oh,
Tornado warning for my city.. Better shut down.. If you don't hear from me
again.. Send me your prayers...

Subject: 2 live titles

Hey  Y'all!

Just a note to pass on. I picked up 2 live cd's from an individual
selling them on the net. They were both killer!

The 1st is a triple disc, complete show from the Camden, New Jersey stop
on the second leg of the T4E tour....June of 1997. This is by far the
best quality disc I have yet to hear from that tour... 1st or 2nd leg.
It is from an Audience DAT, and it truly captures the spirit of the
evening, it is all there!. The package is just as awesome. It has a
color cover, and instead of numbering the discs 1, 2 & 3...there  are
pix of our 3 faves on each disc. If you see it listed, I highly
recommend it! It is just called "Camden, NJ".

The other disc is a double Dream Theatre from their Atlanta show in Dec.
1997. It is two discs, complete show, audience DAT from the Masquerade
ballroom in Atlanta, GA. The sound is awesome & as with the Rush
show...it is all there! It has a color cover & nice color discs as well,
another top notch production. I also highly recommend this as well. It
is simply titled "Atlanta 12/97".

In this day & age, it is very easy to get burned by crappy boots, but
for the record, these two are awesome! Get these titles!!!

yours in allegiance,

I am always looking for other good titles, anyone no where I can turn
for some fresh Metallica?

Talking about wounderful rush experiences, mine was seeing them in 
boston, nov. '96.
            My very first rush experience was with my cousin introducing 
me to 2112. I had just started playing drums, and i was about 11 or 12 
yrs. old. Now although i can't say Neil introduced me to drums, he DID 
introduce me to percussion MUSICALLY, instead of notes on a page, 
showing just what could be done on the instrament. Ever seince then, i 
have been listening to rush nonstop. I still get into other bands, but 
none could replace rush. When i got to see them, i went with my same 
cousin and our friend. On our way into the Fleetcenter, we ran into a 
roadie, or someone with a setlist. When we saw "2112," we freaked out. 
When that song started, I had to pinch myself to make sure i wasn't 
dreaming, and during neil's solo, i actually had goosebumps. In fact, 
just thinking about it is starting to bring them back. After the 
concert, i thought " If anything happens to me on the way home, it's 
alright."
     That's my rush experience, how about yours, everyone?

Well I finally did after lurking for years I going to send a real
message. Someone mentioned they had a son who liked rush. Well I have
a 4 yr. old daughter who I have been able to enlighten (or corrupt as
my wife would have it) with "rushness". I recall as a teenager that
myself and some friends would go into the basement and blast the
stereo and air band to rush for hours. ( I was always geddy btw) Well
now I'm 33 and we have gone our seperate ways, but a few years ago
when she was two (I will still air band when my wife is out) the music
was cranked and I was jamming away and I noticed it..she was joining
me.. i was 14 again and not alone..now it is a ritual for us, wife
goes out and we rock! btw i'm still geddy and she's alex.anyway her
favourite song beyond a shadow of a doubt is....roll the bones..don't
know why but she'll grab the cd and tell me to put it on....
anyway i just want to add i've been a rush fan since i was 12 (closer
to the heart was the first album i ever bought) and at 33 there is no
sign of it wearing off..The guys have been with me through thick and
thin always reminding me that this was my life to make something of,
our screw up, no one else to blame ("all of us do time in the gutter,
dreamers learn to steer by the stars...)  with each album they get
better and better like few bands do, never resting on their laurels,
always breaking new ground (something for the rolling stones to learn
in this btw). I just want to thank them for making such great music
and for providing some inspiration for a "misfit"(probably like many
of you I was that kid in subdivisions) who's been able to make
somthing of himself..."now get out there and rock and roll the bones" 

Jim Gibbs
ps I recommend another canuck band for when you want to give those
rush cd's time to cool off..the tragically hip..many see them as the
heir apparent to rush as canada's serious, noncommercial kick ass rock
band(they like rush as well btw)

   [ The Hip is a great band, they remind me of Rush (not that they SOUND
     like Rush by any means) -- each CD of theirs is completely unique.
     It ain't the same old shit different picture crap that some bands are
     known for (anyone say Oasis???) I highly recommend them, either "Day For
     Night" or "Trouble in the Henhouse" are both excellent.      : rush-mgr ]

Michael Denney brought up Dreams in Rush tunes.  I agree, but first must point
out that "Courageous convictions will drag our dreams into existence" is from
Vital Signs, not The Camera Eye.  Also, Xanadu and Rivendell make no reference
to dreams, but I get what you were aiming at.

Probably one of my most favorite underlying themes in the music of Rush is
dreams.  Sure they mention dreams in many of their tunes, but, I find they
repeatly sing of how our lives begin with our dreams, and need only act upon
them to be succesful.  I'm not talking about just having a dream, as in Double
Agent, but dreams as mentioned in Jacob's Ladder and Vital Signs, as pointed
out by Michael previously.  In these songs, dreams only need a flame.  One of
my favs, this one from TFOL is similar to Mission:

"Life is just a candle
And a dream must give it flame"
 
which is similar to 

Middletown Dreams
"Dreams flow across the heartland
Feeding on the fires"

And how about Losing It:
"Some are born to move the world-
To live their fantasies
But most of us just dream about
The things we'd like to be"

Or Everyday Glory
"In the city where nobody smiles
And nobody dreams
In the city where desperation 
Drives the bored to extremes"

Whenever I read a posting on the NMS about a parent introducing their child
to Rush, I am totally delighted...........

>spectacular child!  Of course I am thrilled (we conspire against the rest

What a unique experience.........sharing Rush with your own son or daughter!

Being a Mom of a son and daughter (who are now adults), as well as a
passionate music lover, I have always believed that the appreciation of
music is one of the greatest gifts a parent could pass on to their
children.  When my children were both under the age of 4, I clearly
remember setting them in front of the stereo and playing "All In A Mouse's
Night" by Genesis.  They loved it!

I became a Rush fan around 1977 when AFTK was released.  One day, when my
son, Brian was in high school, he brought home"Signals" which he and a
friend had been listening to and said; "Wow, this is really great music!"
and I said; "Oh yeah, Rush!"  Soon, Brian became a devoted Rush fan and my
love of Rush grew during that time.  We are now BOTH total Rush fanatics.

On the Rush "Test For Echo" tour, I was thrilled to attend 5 concerts.  I
live in Arizona and son Brian lives in  Maryland.  So we combined visits to
see each other with Rush concerts in Phoenix and Bristow, Virginia.

I think it would be interesting to know if there are more mom/dad and
daughter/son
Rush families out there.  If there are, let's hear from you!

And BTW, I would like to add my 2 cents about females and their musical
preferences.
Being female has nothing to do with the type of music one enjoys.  I
believe it has more to do with one's  levels of:  creativity, intellect,
curiousity, nonconformity, sense of humor and passion for life.  Anyone who
does not allow the constraints that society uses to define what are male or
female behaviors, thought patterns, or preferences is the type of
individual that one often finds among the ranks of Rush fans.

That would work for at home, when I"m dinkin around here, but if I play

thinking and eight voice chorus, I haven't had time to play with it
latley, but I think I'll try that...  But I got a message about
overdriven tone so I'll run distortion through my pre-amp and then use
the tube distortion as well. and see what kind of overdriven tone I can
get... BTW I came up with this wicked tone for Beneath, Between, Behind,
use your typical distortion, and then use a two or four voice chorus,
and you'll get that nice warm feel, kick it off for the chorus (The D
major [XX0232} and G Major [3X0033] chords, use a Flange for the small
guitar run at the end (C, B, A, G, F# E / C, B, A, G, F#, G / A, G, F#,
E, F#, E)
I was listening to Leave That Thing Alone!!! and is that the 1/4 inch

sometime back in the early 80's, the same way it (radio) could lead many
to believe Jethro Tull made Aqualung and called it quits. But has a
truly daring, open-minded approach to radio music programming
even        *existed* anywhere, let alone thrived? That would require
integrity on a par with Rush themselves, something the broadcasting
media are not famous for. 

Personally, I like the idea of a radio station that would never play the
same song twice. Ever. *That's* entertainment.
