                         The National Midnight Star
                                Present:

                            THE BEST OF RUSH  

                               1973 - 1992



         

     This compilation was compiled and produced by Douglas Schwabe during     
     November 1991 thru March 1992 at the University of Pittsburgh and
     at Stately Dawson Manor, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

                   And now a few words from the producer:


                         HELLO, MCFLY, HELLO? :)




    Ladies and Gentlemen, the results are in!!!  Your cassette lists have
    been compiled into a boxset format.  I have enjoyed your selections 
    immensely.  I thought they were interesting.  However, the toughest
    part was trying was putting this thing together (AGONY, A-GO-KNEE!!).
    It was tough to decide what songs to put in and to leave out (especially
    to leave out) but there were alot of great material chosen by you that
    I decided to leave in most of it in.  Plus, since this is a boxset,
    I decided to throw in some unreleased material to make things interesting.
    All 'n all, the 60+ songs should be a good representation of Rush's 
    20 year history.

    I compiled the songs based on the number of votes each song received.
    5 votes was the cutoff so if you favorite song had less than 5, sorry.
    I didn't have much live material so I put in songs which had the most
    votes for live material.
                         
    Before I present the list I would like to thank all of you who 
    participated in the poll, The NMS Rush Manager, Jimmy Lang who 
    had the vision of creating the NMS, The Dave Datta discography
    (folks, try saying that 3 times fast after 12 beers :) The wonderful 
    city of Toronto for giving the world a rock n roll legend, and the
    National Midnight Star and it's many readers across the world.  Enjoy!!
