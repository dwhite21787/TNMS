Subject: Video and foolishness

I was very distressed to hear the rumor that the Chronicles video has been
scrapped, but now I've received word from an EXTREMELY reliable source that
it will be out sometime this week...  This person caught a quick glimpse of
the packaging and noticed the video for A Farewell Kings is definitley on there.

[ Hmmm, I don't think I'll be buying the CD, but video, now that's a 
  different question.  A clean version of AFTK?  Where's my wallet?

Also, this is totally stupid, but I have noticed that the song High Water is
synchronized perfectly with the time counter on my CD player (ie. 2 beats per
second).  Any other songs like this???

Subject: Bytor, the Snowdog and the Necromancer

        Why is Bytor an evil character in Bytor and the Snowdog and a
 "evil character in Bytor and the Snowdog and a "good"
character in the Necromancer?  Is Neil playing around with the idea of relative
"good" and "evil" ?  I have been confused on this matter for about six years.

                                                Thanks

&gt;	La Villa Strantiato (does this mean "the village of Strantiato" ?)
&gt;
&gt;[ This should be La Villa Strangiato.  Possibly means "the house of
&gt;  Strangiato"?                                                 :rush-mgr ]

Actually, its sort-of pidgin Spanish for "Weird City". At least I'm pretty sure
that's what the guys said about it....

Regarding the FBN + COS pressings: FBN has lyrics and stuff, so I assume
its original. I didn't check COS but it's a gatefold; was the later COS
also a gatefold?

[ I believe so, but you can't hold me to it.  I bought it long after it was
  released, and it's this way, with the lyrics inside.            :rush-mgr ]

&gt; will never play Sac'to again.  Is this true?  When did it happen?

I was at the '90 Sacramento shows at the ARCO and Cal Expo.  I didn't see
Geddy getting bonked by a rock, but there sure were a lot of shoes and
miscellaneous crap flying around.  WHY DO PEOPLE THROW STUFF AT THE STAGE???
Its enough to make me stop going to concerts.

I do know that the band was disappointed with the Cal Expo show, partly
because of technical difficulties, and partly because of the crowd.  There
was a swarm of (yes, I'll say it..) STUPID people looking for their various
belongings in front of the stage after the show.  The stage was littered
with shoes, keys, and stuff.

Evidently the Cal Expo organizers promised to have seating for the general
admission audience in the field, but it turned out to be just a standing
crush of humanity.  The people closest to the stage must have been really
squished.  Luckily, I had reserved seating in the stands.  I would be very
surprised if Rush ever plays Cal Expo again.

Macon&gt; to do one myself. So, I am announcing the existance of a Marillion
Macon&gt; list which can be posted to by 'mail csc8mnp@oliver.vcu.edu'. I
Macon&gt; realize I don't have a neat alias at the present, and am using my
Macon&gt; drab account address, but I am working on creating one with my friendly
Macon&gt; local guru - I am tentatively thinking of using 'fishnet' as the addr.

Macon-

You might like to know that there is already a Marillion mailing list.
I just found out about it the other day.  (I, too, had thought of
starting one myself, but never got around to it).  You may want to
defer to it, I dunno.  Traffic's pretty heavy lately.

You can sign up at:

    go09+@andrew.cmu.edu (this is the guy who runs it)

(Posts to: go09+freaks@andrew.cmu.edu)

If you choose to run another, let me know so's I can sign up to
both... :-)

Subject: Beaten to the Punch (and Judy?)

Once again this not a Rush related posting, rather a followup to the
announcement I postwed yesterday, concerning the Marillion mailing list.

Fist of all, I want to thank all the people who mailed to me, expressing
their interest in such a list. The response was overwhelming! I have
never received so much mail in so short a time. This confirms my
belief that there is a vast horde of Marillion fans out there,
unsuspected by the public general! Yea, verily, we are of a mighty number!
I am glad so many people are interested.

I did, however, receive a number of messages informing that I was not
the only one who had this idea; that there is already a Marillion
list up and running. So let direct all of you (like myself) who
were unaware of this list to its address. It is -

FREAKS : go09+@andrew.cmu.edu

So all of you who posted to me, you can post to this instead. I am
informed that it has already a large number of active subscribers.
Thanks much to all the people who informed me of the existance of
this already-existing list (but why didn't you say anything before?!?)
and if I have spelled the address wrong - please post a correction.
I could have quite an angry mob on my hands otherwise! And I wouldn't
be surprised if a lot of postings in today's Signals (is it offical
yet?) state the information I have just given. And Steve can add it to
his list...

Now, after this I have been wondering; if I was to try and start up
a list for yet another group, would I get mail telling me that
groupX already has a list? It's happened once? So, if any of the
following groups have lists, let me know, please?
(I know about Rush, Tull, Genesis, Yes and Marillion) how about
Kansas? ELP? King Crimson? A general progessive (as you can see
'I know what I like') list? Any feedback would be appreciated...

[ There is a unofficial list of mailing lists which periodically gets
  posted on Usenet, in rec.music.misc and alt.rock-n-roll (possibly
  others).  As a matter of fact, I believe the originator lives in
  this list also.  Could he re-post the list?  Thanks!   :rush-mgr ]

Oh well, see you all on 'Freaks', as well as here and St. Cleve
(but I did so like the pun of 'fishnet'. *sigh*) Until my next
brainstorm for a list...

PS. Anybody be interested in a Dream Theater (America's answer
    to progressive rock in the '90's) list? Anybody?

Good day, eh.

Well, today will begin the new column, DUMB COMMENTS.  This column will
include comments, thoughts, feelings, observations, statements,
questions, etc. that have absolutely NOTHING to do with anything --
things that make pepole say, "Have you ever noticed...?" (as recited by
a local newscaster at the end of the nightly newscast!), or things that
make you say, "Hmmmmm..."

And now for today's DUMB COMMENT:
	*Doesn't Neil remind you of Carl Sagan?  They're the only two
people in the world who could use the terms "persona" and "stuff" in
the same sentence.

Allright, enough nonsense.  Ron Chrisley (chrisely@csli.stanford.edu)
asked about Geddy getting hit in the head with a rock at their concert
at the ARCO in Sacramento.  Were you referring to the Presto concert
this past March?  If so, I must admit, I didn't see him getting hit on
the head with anything.  In fact, I don't recall ever seeing anything
being thrown onto the stage.  I was sitting on the stage left side, but
up behind the stage (on the same level with the rear screen), so I got
a great view of Neil and the back of Geddy and Alex.  I got a good view
of the front of the audience and those on stage left, and I hadn't
witnessed anyone throwing things.  I must confess, however, that I
spent about half the evening watching Neil, so I didn't see Geddy the
whole time.  But whenever I looked up at him, he seemed fine (not that
he'd have a fit on stage).  Anyway, as far as I know, the concert was
fine, the band was fine, all was fine and dandy.  At any rate, I
_hope_ Geddy wasn't being used for target practice.  Did anyone see
different?

By the way, Todd, great story!  Write more!

Subject: A wonderful idea!

In reading today's digest, BJENKINS suggests that we (or one of us)
compile a list of bands out there that do Rush songs, where they
are, and what songs they do. I believe this to be a marvelous
suggestion! In the time that I have been reading the net I have
seen many mentions of bands of this nature (I believe 'Limelight'
was one of them), and I have been trying to keep track of them
all. So indeed, if you are in a band or know of one we'ed be interested in,
tell all, giving us the above facts. I'll keep a list of all the
bands mentioned (easier that pouring over old digests, eh?) and
can post them upon request. Having said that, I have to mention
a band from RI called Anthem, which is a three piece. No actual
Rush covers that I know of, but they are heavily influenced by
the band and you would be hard-pressed to find anyone who looks,
sounds or plays the same as the Geddster, as their bass player/
keyboard player/signer Scott King.  I kid you not! They
have a tape out with 12 songs which is quite worth listening to,
I'll post the name of the tape and the address of the band
soon. I do know that they are planning a small tour of the east
coast (I should know, I booking them some dates!) so I can post
the dates when confirmed. This should be in the first part of
Dec. If they are in your area, go see them, and 'get the ball rolling'.

Anyway, let's hear from all the Rush-influenced bands out there!

Subject: Of Songs, Smoke, And Magic

Hmmm...bands that do Rush cover tunes?  I'm currently in a band called
Windsor (formerly Phoenix, formerly Savage Grace) that is heavily Rush-
influenced.  As part of the actual song list, we have The Spirit Of Radio,
YYZ, Freewill, La Villa Strangiato (we're toying with this one as a per-
manent addition), Subdivisions, and What You're Doing, although we do
know (and often play at rehearsals) many others, such as the rest of Moving
Pictures, Finding My Way, Show Don't Tell, and some others.  Up until
recently, we had the drummer from hell...he could play just about any Rush
tune out there.  Unfortunately, he kinda walked out on us, so we're looking
for another Peart maniac out there.  Once we get our line-up together, we
plan to gig locally.  Also, as we're unfortunately very green as far
as gigs go (while still being strong on musicianship), we would appreciate
any tips from folks who are more experienced in the field.

[ Well, I can air-drum just about everything through _Moving Pictures_;
  does that count?  :-)                                       :rush-mgr ]

Now, on to more mundane stuff...

Has anyone out there seen/heard the recording of "Smoke On The Water,"
done for the "Live Aid For Armenia" project a while ago, and featuring,
among other guitar luminaries, one Alex Lifeson?  No one here in sunny Florida
seems to know -- if you have any info, please reply here or send me mail.
Thank you very much.
Also, a new goodie to look out for -- the "Presto" songbook in guitar (but,
alas, not bass) tab.  Check it out -- it seems pretty accurate.
