Subject: Re: Rush attention

&gt;  Yes, Rush is not getting enough attention from the American music
&gt;listeners.  So let's put out minds together and come up with a solution to
&gt;make others listen to the band and be blessed by their visions.  To bring
&gt;Rush into the media and re-introduce them to the non-Rush-fanatic public.
&gt;This should make a better enviornment for us to satisfy our passion to listen
&gt;to Rush and learn their ways.

Unfortunately, it has little to do with the listeners.  It has to do
with radio stations and the music media.

Rolling Stone, SPIN, MTV, VH1 and anything else you can think of
basically completely ignore Rush.  Personally, I think those in
charge of Rolling Stone and MTV have a personal vendetta against Rush
because they're not "hip" enough.

Don't laugh.  The "progressives" on our campus, who run the radio
station and the entertainment section in the campus newspaper think
that Rush is old news.  If you ask them, they'll say "Yeah, they've
got some talent, but they're not half as cool as Jane's Addiction."
Rolling Stone, MTV and the rest are the same way.

Look how MTV has gone downhill over the past few years.  It now has a
bunch of losers for VJ's playing "GlamRock" for 14-year-olds.
Surprisingly, VH1 is becoming a good channel, playing the kind of
videos MTV used to show - but, they still don't realize Rush exists.

If we ever want Rush to gain wide acceptance, the music media will
have to somehow discover them again.  If they ever do discover Rush
again, they'll be full of fanfare telling us what a great group it is
- how it has had two hit albums, Moving Pictures and whatever happens
to be the current rage at the time.  They'll be no mention of the
other 15+ albums or 100+ songs.

Even as inaccurate and distasteful as that would be, I'll take *any*
recognition Rush can get.

I just can't picture a bunch of grandmothers hopping around to Rush.
(Bimbos with flamethrowers, however, ... :)
I mention this, because the other day the thought occurred to me that Vital
Signs has almost a Police-like sound to it : that sparse, minimalist sound.
Compare V.S. to Tom Sawyer or Limelight, even, and you'll hear what I mean.
Has anybody else got this feeling?
I seem to remeber that V.S. was one of those "wait till we're in the studio
and under pressure" songs. Maybe that's one reason for that type of sound.
(Maybe Rush digs the Police. They ripped off "Message in a Bottle" for
 "Red Tide", right?  :)

  I'm with whoever mentioned that Neil's headgear should not be discussed anymo

for probably 2 years now. Neil has been wearing the bandanna since -Presto

has a head of hair. nuff said!

such dumb things.

Subject: Bringing Rush to the masses

In TNMS #461, someone asked how we could bring Rush to the general populace.
Easy:
--Hire Mutt Lange to produce the next album
--Have Desmond Child and Diane Warren write a few tunes for it
--Have Slash do a guest guitar solo
--Get Patti LaBelle to do a duet with Geddy on one track
--More ballads!!!!
--Talk Jason Priestly into joining the band
--Give the band its own Saturday morning cartoon, a line of Rush action
  figures, and a feature story in _Tiger_Beat_
--Force Alex to play a flying-V rather than those wimpy PRS guitars
--In concert, have Neil swing onstage on a giant rope and leap into his kit

See?  Nothing to it!

Subject: Vote on a film of 2112 (And other stuff too)

Hi.

  I enjoyed reading the interesting article posted on NMS 461 about the count
of the words in all the Rush lyrics.  Very interesting David.  I like the
count of the words "baby" and "yeah".  I thought that was really funny.
  I think that Rush should play their older songs such as 2112, and By-Tor and
the Snow Dog.  These songs are really timeless and ageless.  They are just
epics, and a story is told from generation to generation.  Look at Huckleberry
Finn, that story is still known as the best American novel.
  Also regarding to same message, the discussion about the Live Xanandu and
the original version, I think that the studio (original) version is much
better.  First of all, you can't hear all the instruments very well on that
whole album, which I have on CD.  The recording is bad overall.  I like the
studio version.  Secondly, when Mr. Lifeson is playing the part at the end
when he leads, there are no background guitars to fill in which makes the
song weak.  I think that background guitar is just as important as the lead.
  I took the chance and wrote Mr. Peart care of Rush's management company,
S.R.O.  I wonder if I'll ever get a reply from Mr. Peart.  I doubt it.
  I'd like to know more about Mr. Lee's six hours of time spent with Mr.
Claypool of Primus (Yuk).  So Ron, if know anymore on this matter, fill us in.
  I think eventually Rush will do a boxed set to satisfy us all.  But I think
that they should do a 4-6 hour concert, a one time only event, and release a
boxed set from that concert.  Of course, this would happen at the end of their
career.  Right now I'm discussing the possibilities of Rush doing a film of
2112.  Being a mini-Rock-opera, I can see it heppening.  I have a lot of ideas
in my head concerning this short film.  For one I think it should contain lots
of special effects to represent the year 2112 the best as possible.  Also the
film should start with a history of earth until the year 2112, along with the
quote of the anonymous passage on the inside cover of the album.  Those who
agree such film should be produced, send me a yes or no vote at my Internet
address.

Well, that's all for now.  I'll put in my two cents on later issues of NMS.
Thank you for reading.

Hi hi hi there, me little Droogies!

	I haven't posted in a while, but I thought I'd supply you all with a
bit of blab. . .
	Firstly, whoever said Neil's lyrics are IMPROVING in terms of
Political Correctness is completely missing everything they (see Ayn Rand)
stand for!  I don't mean this as a personal flame, I just feel quite strongly
about this.  Read the lyrics to some songs like 2112 and Freewill; they are
the epitome of Neil's philosophy(I think) and are most definitely anti-P.C.
	On a less philosophical note. . .Someone mentioned the Olivia
Newton-John album Xanadu in Tuesday's issue.  If you want a good laugh at
some REAllY cheesy 70's stuff, strap some roller skates to your platform
shoes and roll on down to the video store to rent the movie(which also
features Ol' Blue Eyes himself(Frank Sinatra, for those who are culturally
deprived))!
	I will now discuss Neil's bandana, but NOT WHY HE WEARS IT!!!  I was
told by someone I spoke to at the New Haven show that he doesn't wear the same
bandana every night.  Also, the skull and crossbones bandana that he has is NOt
the same as the one they sell at the t-shirt stands.  It is just skulls and
crossbones, no words RUSH or anything.  I have a very similar one, which I got
in a shop on St. Mark's Place in the East Village of New York, for those who
are interested.  They wanted $10 the first night I went there, but when I went
back a few days later, they only wanted $3!!!  For those who are interested, I
have also seen Johnny Depp wearing the same one.
	Next on the agenda is the Buddy Rich Memorial Concert video.  I have
seen this in a local Mass/Conn. music chain called Falcetti's, and while I
don't remember how much it was, I know it was less than $88.  Good luck to
those who are looking for it.
	Finally, on a non-Rushian note, I want to inform the ELP fans out there
that Emerson, Lake and Palmer have re-formed(even though Carl Palmer is
supposedly still in Asia, which is also supposedly active, with Steve "God"
Howe again) and have a new album coming out very soon.  They (ELP themselves)
said in a recent radio interview that they will be touring later this summer.
If anyone knows when the album is coming out or has any information on the
tour, PLEASE let me know!!!
	One more thing. . .does anyone have information on the upcoming Tap
tour?

				Until Later,

				Aaron Silverman

P.S.  I fart in P.C.'s general direction!

Greetings, my new friends at TNMS...

I'd like to express my agreement with the person who spoke out against
a Rush boxed set... although I did enjoy Chronicles (the first CD I
ever bought), I have found that when I buy a Rush album, my favorite
track from said album invariably turns out to be one of the lesser
known tracks... examples for me include Prime Mover, No One at the
Bridge, Digital Man, and Hemispheres. Thus, by buying a greatest hits
collection from Rush (or any other band for that matter), one tends to
miss out on some real gems...

On a flattering note, I work at WRUC in Schenectady, NY (Wireless
Radio Union College)... on one particular day, I and a couple of other
DJs that happened to have shows in a row decided to put on a
Rush-a-Thon. Although the first DJ played mostly the tried-and-true
material (Tom Sawyer, Time Stand Still, etc.), we managed to play all
sorts of interesting Rush stuff (including all of Hemispheres, uncut).
We were truly psyched when we received a call from a listener
off-campus who said, "Do you guys do this every Friday? This is
awesome!"

But who can argue with that viewpoint, right?

enough, but it would be nice if they had their biography _Visions_

$55 US)

Subject: Box Set / Instrumentals

     	Alright... here's my opinion on the box set concept (not that mine
means anything...:)  For those who don't have EVERY Rush cd, but want a
decent compilation, you can just get _Chronicles_.  Granted, it's not great or
anything, but it works to hold you over until you can pick up the rest.  The
only reason I can see for Rush to release a box set is for unreleased material,
or for other times the band memebers have appeared in different recordings
(like Geddy's appearance in "Take Off").  Other than this, there's not really a
reason for ANYONE to release a box set....

Here's an interesting question someone brought up the other day... what t
is Rush's best instrumental piece?  Personally, I think it's the overture to
2112, but most everyone else picked YYZ as the best... any other opinions??

RUSH enthusiasts,
 A friend and I were talking about Lakeside Park, we could not figure out
the significance of the date ' the 24th of May '. So can anyone shed some
light on this. Also does Lakeside park exist and where? It's a definite
roadtrip if it exits.

          Thanks

Well, I just heard an announcement on WIYY 98 Rock out of Baltimore that
someone (can't remember who, but it was a solo-type male performer) is playing
Merriweather Post on JUNE 15!!

Does that mean that the supposed Rush date on JUNE 16th is screwed??

I hope us Baltimorons arent passed over again.... :(

Well, I could only stand by so long with all the Mozart bashing.
Mozart is the only artist I have more discs of than Rush!
Far from being dated or boring, his best music offers the type of intricacy,
emotional sensitivity, and extraordinary rhythm changes that I think
would appeal to many Rush fans.  Or am I the only one?

Subject: A NEW POLL-CONTEST KINDA THINGY!?
Date: Fri, 10 Apr 92 0:59:54 CDT

 A fine how-do-ya-do to all my fellow Rush friends out there...
 The hand of inspiration has either slapped me on the back or punched me
 square in the eyes...whatever it's done, it's given me an idea.

 Now that all the hoopla for _Roll The bones_ is pretty much over with, it's
 time to start thinking about what their next album will be like.  "It's too
 soon", you say.  Not so, if the boyz are as psyched as we are to believe
 they are, it should be less than a year before they're ready to let another
 album loose.  But now, in this time of unknowing, is where we can have a
 little insight as to what they might think to call an album.

 So, with that in mind, those of you who think they have a cool name for
 the next Rush album, send it to my email address (at the bottom), along
 with an explanation on what the album is about (like RTB is about taking
 chances, etc...).  I'll compile all the entries and present all of them
 in a special issue or something like that.  P.

 (Oops..)  Also, if it's any real trouble, when I do that big presentation
 when all this is said and done, please let me know if it's a real problem
 if I use your name and/or email address to denote that the submission was
 yours.  I don't wanna invade anyone's privacy if I can help it.

 So, start sending your thoughts (whenever you get them) to me at:

                 cook@donald.cs.umn.edu

 You have until April 24 to send in your entries.  Please, no matter how
 dumb you think your thoughts are, send them in, you never know, someone
 may be very impressed....

  Thanks for your time.

Date: Fri, 10 Apr 92 11:56:20 BST

HI, fellow rush fan types.

Ghost of a chance was released in the uk and europe this week.
It features dreamline as a B side on the 7" vinyl version
The CD has dreamline,red tide & chain lightning.

The good news is that this track has also made the radio
luxembourg day-time play list. So even if you've got the album
go out and buy the single and it will enter the charts.

Also any uk readers should listen to the friday/saturday rock
shows on radio one.  It has a more than good chance of being
played on there.  If it isn't played write in an request it,
they can't ignore all of us.

I'm also thinking of requesting it on MTV europe, the trouble
is it will take a lot of doing. So if you want to help rush
get played on MTV (even if you haven't got MTV)  email me and
we can discuss some kind of arrangement for a mass request.

Cheers and keep rolling.

	Tickets for the May 21 show at the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, TN
go on sale tomorrow (Saturday, April 11), at 10:00 a.m.  The ticket price is
$20.50.
Thanks to jalhart for the announcement of the date.  I might have missed
the start of ticket sales otherwise.  I am SO relieved Rush is coming to the
Mid-South.  Having missed the New Orleans show, I was getting very depressed
that I wasn't going to get another chance to catch them this time around.
	By the way, are there any readers from this area?  I thought I saw one
poster from Miss. State (my alma mater).  Drop me some mail if you're out
there.

Subject: Summer tour dates; Ghost of a Chance single

I just got off the phone with SRO/Anthem in Toronto. I called to see if a
Chicago-area date was known for the summer tour. I was told that it was
being considered, but was not yet confirmed.

Here are the dates that are confirmed:

May 21-Memphis
May 27-Denver
June 3-Los Angeles
June 12-St. Louis
June 23-Dayton
June 24-Indianapolis

Obviously, there are some big gaps in this schedule, so I think it's safe
to assume that more dates will be added. I don't know why they didn't list
the June 13-Nashville show mentioned in NMS #461.

Regarding the Ghost Of A Chance cassingle, does anyone know if there will
also be a CD single?

Subject:      Mystic Rhythms, Lamneth

Hello Fellow RUSHians,
     First off, could someone tell me how to access the summer tour dates,
PRETTY PLEASE?  Secondly, I have two pieces of information to impart:

  1)  When I was in Germany last year, I showed the lyrics from the Fountain of
Lamneth to one of my professors there.  He found them very interesting.  I
asked him if he knew what "Lamneth" meant, and he said he he thought it might
have something to do with the aquisition of wisdom in some kind of religious
ritual involving a drug (opium?).  He was pretty vague.  I tried to find some
reference to it in the library at UVM, but it wasn't mentioned in any of the
umpteen sources that I checked, so I can't confirm or disconfirm this...

  2)  Listen to Mystic Rhythms and watch the counter about a third of the way
through.  Notice how the third downbeat of each bar of that main drum pattern
(that soft crash sound which is immediately echoed to the left channel) is in
sync with the odd second numbers on the counter.  It stays in sync for the rest
of the song.  Sort of an interesting little diversion, a mystic rhythm in
itself...
                                     "Death is a red herring." -D.Christensen
                                             "Remember Death." -N.Peart
                                               "Catch a Fish!" -G.Lee

                                                          --Hans Gruenig.

Subject: Neil & Women

Buenos noches, mein froinds!

An interesting note:

I was reading my campus newspaper, and they had an issue
about pornography.  After reading it and remembering Issue
#461, I realized that women are not often mentioned directly
in a Rush song, except for the very first album.

IMHO, Neil Peart didn't intend to leave out women (except
for _Witch Hunt_, _Middletown_, and a few others) but he found other
subjects to write about.  I feel that he should write about
the advancements of women (eg sufferage, Christa
MacAullife).

Any responses, flames, etc....you know the procedure.
