Subject: Administrivia

A few things to post about.
First, I went to the Atlantic web site today, and found they have a NEW banner
for DS! I put it on the NMS website already... but it mentions that Geddy &
Alex will be participating in a LIVE INTERNET fancast from New York City
on November 15th @ 7pm. SonicNet will be sponsoring the event, but as of yet
they have no information on their web page about it. I assume that they'll
have an interview with someone that's broadcast via realvideo about the
new album. They might even take questions that we submit, kind of like a 
mini-Rockline.  

I will post more information about it as I find more out, so PLEASE do not 
mail me right now asking where the site is, how do I see it, etc... we have
PLENTY of time to figure this out.

Next, be sure to check out the Artists Against Racism online auction going
on now! There's some neat Rush stuff on there, wish I could afford some of
it! :-)  They're at "http://www.vrx.net/aar/" (They'd make great gifts for
that hard-to-please Rush fan)

I've also added some info on DS to the NMS page, all text & images were
taken from the Atlantic website (because I know not EVERYONE can use
Javascript). Some tidbits... 70% of DS came from the show in Chicago (I 
know someone asked about that in the last digest or two)... EVERY show on
the TFE tour was recorded (footware people can now begin drooling)... and
the Hammersmith show was originally recorded for a radio broadcast (that 
never happened).

And finally, I need a bit of help. My radio station isn't broadcasting the
premiere until November 8th, and I'll be out of town. So I need someone who
will be getting the show Nov 3 or 4, who can make either a DAT copy of it
or send me the original cassette (or DAT tape), to FEDEX it to me. I would 
like to put it up on the website before I leave on the 8th (won't be back 
until the 11th). Now I know FEDEX is expensive, it'll probably run $10-12 
to send it. I will send the tape back, and in return I will send one of the 
new NMS shirts as compensation (once we get them printed). Any takers?

1. Pink Floyd

6. Counting Crows
7. Radiohead
8. Live

10.Nirvana

If we'd opened the ball up to include singer/songwriters, you woulda had 
a large helping of Sheryl Crow, Tori Amos, Alanis Morissette, Shawn

First off, I just bought Moving Pictures *cheer*, but when i was
listening to Vital Signs i noticed a slight imperfection in Geddy's
vocals at about 4:10. im positive he says "everybody's got to evelate
from the norm." anyone else catch this?

and tnms t-shirts? black, definitely black. but i was thinking maybe
tie-dye :) i wear all black every day but I'm not a goth. to goths
listen to Rush religiously like I do? i don't really think so. 

best Rush CD is either PermWavs or MP.  

whoever put up the add for the $5 off thing at www.theonion.com for
CDnow i thank.   

and anyone know if there's a station in Western Massachusetts that'll
play some sort of premiere? 107.3 has it out of Boston but I can't get
it on my radio *bummer*

and if someone does tape that rockline show advertise it i'd like a copy
:)

well im done

I would ONLY buy it if it sounded like "Monster". That was the first R.E.M.
album that actually rocked. Isn't music great? It can be appreciated
in so many ways by so many people.

Subject: Did Geddy EVER played with a pick ?

Greeting all, 

I was wondering if Geddy ever played with a pick ?  Consider this :

Back in 1991, a girlfriend of mine went to see a Rush concert in Ottawa.
She didn't knew a lot about the band but his brother offered her a ticket
in second or third row.  She knew I was a fan.  At this time, I was not a
big fan (owned only two albums : Presto and Roll the Bones).  Anyway, she
asked me : Could you borrow me the latest Rush album so at least, I will
recognize a couple of tunes ?  I said no problemo.

The day after the show, we were in this French class when I asked her :
What about the show ?  She said : Well it was great and oh..I have a
little "souvenir" for you.  Then she gave me this blue Fender "heavy"
pick ans said : It's Geddy Lee's pick.  My brother pick up one of Alex's
pick but here's for you the bassist's pick.  I was completely blown up.

Since that, I have this blue Fender pick framed on my wall with all my
ticket stubs.  When someone comes to my apartment, I can say : Here's my
own Geddy Lee's pick.  Actually, I pretend it's from Geddy.  

I know this subject has been disscuted but...Can I still believe it's a
Geddy Lee pick ?  If somebody in this forum prove me wrong, I would just
say Here's my Alex Lifeson's pick.  But until that...I'll consider the
first option.

I bought OiaL today and I'm giving it a spin right now. I've only gotten to
track 5 ("Voices"), but so far it kicks ass. This band is one of the few
that could bring the Rush rock gospel to a new generation. Wow, the opening
of "Voices" reminds me of "Xanadu" a lot.... Killer!

I also bought REM's brand new album "Up". It's very cool and sounds nothing
like the typical "REM sound". Next week new U2 collection comes out, then
Different Stages on the 10th, then the Metallica cover album... supposedly.
The remaster of Marillion's "Misplaced Childhood" has come out too--I have
to check that out.

Subject: Pleasentville/2112

       With the release of "Different Stages" the movie "Pleasentville" 
was also released.  If anyone has seen it, does it not slightly resemble 
the story of 2112 (by a stretch? nonetheless)?  Think about it, The 
movie is about someone who has discovered something "wondrus" and brings 
it to the town "the preists". they reject it, though some people decide 
to follow it (the elders).  And so everything turns to crap and the 
elder race end's up beating the preists and taking over.  Same basic 
idea, but shoot me in the head with that quad shotgun if you want 
rush-mgr, i still think there is a similarity.
            and now for something completely different
       The album cover for different stages could mean concert stages, 
but also it could mean developemental stages.  Think about it, this live 
album has music from every major era of rush.  From the heavy 
distorion/overdriven guitar sound on their first album, through the 
heavy syth use in the 80's and on to the sophisticated sounds heard on 
RTB and CP, then to the last "Stage" TFE.  I think that it actualy is a 
representation of these stages, them saying, here's where we were, are, 
and are-going-to.  The tinker toys on the other hand, are a childs toy.  
Thus they represent childhood, and regardless of form, or even if the 
band had them or not, they all have memories of our early lives 
associated with them, unless you didn't have them as a child, but then 
again society still associates them with chilhood, telling someone to 
"go play with your tinker toys" is a refrence to them being a child.  
Now, this childhood refrence merely overstates the point of early stages 
of development in their music. "these are the toys we had", This is the 
music that has lead us to where we are 
today................................. ok I'm done over-analysing...  
for now.

Subject: All Rush Radio Station

I would like to thank everyone (especially Seth and Joe who e-mailed me
directly - I read that long before I get to the NMS:) who told me about the
FM transmitter that fits into your headphone jack.  It worked wonders and
now I can play all the Rush I want through my radio, through a fabulous
soundsystem.  Much better than in my old car!!  It's great and I really
appreciate the info.

One thing I found, being blocked from riding in the car singing along with
my favorite songs, is how much Rush's music affects my life, in a postive
way.  Everything that could go wrong, was going wrong and I was falling
into a deep depression.  Then Friday I got my ability to listen to Rush in
the car again, and POW!  Nothing seemed so terrible anymore.  Nothing had
changed, just my attitude.  It seems that it's important to my state of
mind to be able to sing the songs.  No other band has that affect on me or
my psyche.

Anyway, now I have a radio station that plays ALl Rush All The Time!  It's
just a shame that no one else can recieve it.

Thanks Again,
 Crystal

Surfing the Atlantic Records Web Page, I found a few things that I don't
think have been mentioned before.

Go to Instavids-You can view or download a video of Driven. My Mac is
too slow to do
this, So I didn't get a chance to view it.

You can order Different Stages from them and they say it will be in your
mailbox on November 10th. $24.99 I believe, no mention of shipping
charges.

Tried to find soundclip of TSOR, but all it did was take me to the promo
page of DS, with no links.

And Finally:

November 15th! 7pm est  Atlantic is hosting a Fancast. On camera, Live
Chat & Album Release event from NYC. Alex and Getty Live on camera.
Pretty cool.

Hi all,

Chaz wrote about a meeting with Queensryche.. I have to second that..

I met them 10 years ago when they opened for BON Jovi in Arnhem, my
hometown. I showed Geoff Tate the backstage entrance and subsequently was
invited in. After the show (great, although I had no idea who they were at
the time) i went backstage again and chattted with Michael Wilton, Eddie
jackson and Scott Rockenfield. Chris DeGarmo came in with beer etc etc. I
remember talking to Scott R and asking him whether he was influenced by
Neil.. His eyes started shining, he shook my hand & we went on to discuss
Rush for a couple of minutes.. Really cool.

About Neil, any news on injuries or anything from that bike crash?

     1. Recent issues have taken a turn to the bizarre & borderline 
     irritating: Some guy from Iowa reporting that "Whatever" just opened 
     (a joke?)? Neil mountain climbing? A motorcycle accident? And (cue the 
     ominous music), Religion makes its dreaded return along with its 
     bastard cousin, Doomsday! Let's not forget about the blatant Rush 
     worship & the lengthy South Park installments. JESUS! We're weirder 
     than other music fans.... This much I know.
     
     2. I just saw PJ Harvey last night. For the unitiated, I'm sorry, but 
     I really can't describe her style; except to say it's spooky. Whenever 
     I see a show that I like, I generally post it here to recommend it to 
     others. I don't know what the rest of you listen to, but, yes, if PJ 
     comes to your town, I recommend you go see her. Why bring these 
     concerts up at all? Why post our OTHER favorite bands (see below)? 
     Maybe, just maybe, someone will be turned onto something else. I have 
     another reason for bringing up PJ, though. She would be a great 
     addition to Victor II. No one's mentioned her yet, but after seeing 
     her, I know that she would be a great vocalist (plays guiffar, too) 
     for Alex's next project. Now, someone just has to tell Alex....

     P.S. My other favorite bands and/or musicians? Funny you should ask:
          Replacements
          Rocket From the Crypt
          Helmet
          Fugazi
          Sleater-Kinney
          U2
          Police
          Rolling Stones
          Beatles
          Garbage
          Jayhawks
          Down By Law
          Radiohead
          Public Enemy
          Beach Boys
          etc., etc., etc.....

Subject: JACK KLUGMAN??!!??!!

>From:	Jose Ramos <jose.ramos@digital.com>

 "If there was a movie made about Rush, who would play the band members?"
IMHO, I think Neil should be played by Jack Klugman.  Remember the Odd
Couple episode when he had to fill in as the drummer for Felix's band.  He
had some real talent on the skins, don't ya think?

Response:
I'm still doing the virtual ROFL !  "Ladies and Gentlemen, The Coroner on
the drum kit!" Oh gosh!  Or imagine Oscar Madison munching on donuts as he
bikes across Africa, being chased by a couple of ostriches trying to peck it
out of his hand.  Let's see, Felix would have to play Geddy and then who are
you going to get for Alex?  I guess we could bring in Leonardo di Caprio for
the youth audience appeal.  Hah!

Actually - - - I was thinking of the following cast for Rush the Movie:
Tom Hanks as Neil Peart (kinda serious, quirky)
Robin Williams as Geddy Lee (give him a pony tail and set him loose)
Mike Meyers as Alex Lifeson (blonde wig)
Also Starring:
Martin Short as Hugh Syme  "I envision a naked guy and a big red star"
Chris Elliot as the Naked Guy with the Big Red Star  "Could uh, we get a
little heat in here please?"

Or as an alternate cast, we could have the X-File's Lone Gunmen trio to star
as the Rush Boys.
They could be hard at work deciphering the meaning to their own songs when
the black helicopters come for them.  Chase ensues...

Ah, so many possibilities...

Subject: Neil very look alike.

Hi u all,

Just briefly. 
Has anyone noticed the similarity between the Chicago Bears Quarterback Erik
Kramer and Neil.
I think it's amazing.
Check it out on Sunday.

>And it would have made a better basis for a song than "Dog Years."  I'm
glad Neil admitted to being hung over.  I'd hate to think he
wrote that garbage sober<

Hey Michael, just because Neil said he was hung over when he wrote those 
lyrics, doesn't mean that they weren't up to par. I wrote some of my 
best papers back in school (3.88 GPA) when I was hung over. Besides, if 
they thought the lyrics sucked, why would they use them on the album, 
knowing what kind of perfectionists they are? If you are wondering, yes, 
I like that song. Now if you really want to wonder, "what the hell were 
they thinking?", go listen to Rivendell.

Subject: U2 Best Of

I know there are a lot of U2 fans on this list, so I'd thought you may be
interested in this...

On November 3rd, U2 is releasing their "Best of 80-90", featuring yet another
"boy" on the cover.  Whats great is that there is none of that new crap
they've been passing off as music the last couple of albums (sorry, just had
to put that in and start some fires with all of you diehard U2 fans).
Actually, before I became baptized at the Temple of Syrinx, I was a died in
the wool U2 fan defending Bono with all the assholes I new, before he got too
weird/political.  Too bad it doesn't cover "Actung Baby", the last decent U2
album.

Anyway, for the first week only (Nov. 3-9), it will be a two disk set, and
after that the second disk will be unavailble.  The first disk is a greatest
hits with a new version of "October", and the second bonus disk is the B-
sides.  I've got most of the B-sides on cassette or duped, but most of them
were never on CD.  What sucks is that not all of the B-sides are on this album
(predictably).

The first song on disk 2 is "The Three Sunrises", a killer song from the "Wide
Awake in America" four song disk, from the Edge's finer days of background
vocals.  The last song on Disk 2 looks like the studio version of "Party Girl"
which was on "Live Under a Blood Red Sky".  Too bad the second disk won't be
sold by itself, because I could pass on Disk 1 (almost predicatably, one could
compare it to Rush's Chronicles, i.e. I'd trade a few of the tunes for others,
ya know?).

Disk 1:
Pride (In the Name of Love)/New Year's Day/With or Without You/I Still Haven't
Found What I'm Looking For/Sunday Bloody Sunday/Bad/Where the Streets Have No
Name/I Will Follow/The Unforgettable Fire/Sweetest Thing/Desire/When Love
Comes to Town/Angel of Harlem/All I want is you/October (Hidden Track) 

Disk 2 - Bonus CD/The B-sides:
The Three Sunrises/Spanish Eyes/Sweetest Thing (Original)/Love Comes
Tumbling/Bass Trap/Dancing Barefoot/Everlasting Love/Unchained Melody/Walk to
The Water/Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)/Hallelujah, Here She Comes/Silver
and Gold/Endless Deep/A Room at the Heartbreak Hotel/Trash, Trampoline and the
Party Girl

Is the 3rd disk of Different Stages a limited edition disk?  Is Different
Stages going to cut to 2CD's only after the initial pressing?
