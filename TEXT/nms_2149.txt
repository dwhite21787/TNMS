The CNN interview did indeed happen, it just hasn't aired yet. I will still
be keeping an eye on the showbiz page. And I heard that there was an interview
aired on CHUM-FM in Canada this past weekend, did anyone get it on tape?

Oh, one thing I've been meaning to mention... some songs from the older
tours may not have been included because they didn't "feel" like the rest
of the album! Several people have already mentioned AK as "feeling" like it
didn't belong, so perhaps The Pass, Scars, Double Agent, etc. just didn't
seem to fit with the rest of the songs. Think about it.

Subject: Fave live albums

I know this thread has been dormant for quite some time, but I never 
got around to putting my two cents in, and since DS is out and 
everyone is enjoying the hell out of it, why not start it up again?

Fave live albums (not counting DS)
in no particular order:

Holly Cole--It Happened One Night. This Canadian chanteuse and her 
little band serve up a wonderful mix of jazz and pop standards. Nice 
and cozy sounding with great performances on every song.

Bruce Cockburn--Circles In the Stream and Live--these two sets, one 
from 1977 and the other from 1990 showcase everything that's great 
about Bruce-- top-drawer songcraft, his terrific voice and his 
astonishing fingerstyle guitar playing (the solo on "See How I Miss 
You" on Live makes my hair stand on end). He's also all the proof you 
need an artist can be a Christian, even rely on it for subject matter,
 without sounding like Michael W. Smith. 

Billy Joe Shaver--Unshaven--This Texas songwriter and his band tear 
up a beer joint in the sticks with this potent mix of honky-tonk and 
rockabilly. Long hair and longnecks aplenty, with not a stupid-ass 
cowboy hat in sight.  Produced by Brendan O'Brien (who also plays 
bass), this is NOT your daddy's country music. The one country album 
every Rush fan should own, if only to hear country done RIGHT for a 
change, as well as to bask in the raw, agressive lead guitar of Billy 
Joe's son, Eddie. Yee haw...

Steve Earle and the Dukes--Shut Up and Die Like An Aviator--Another 
album that proves that country music doesn't have to suck. Earle's 
voice is a snarl that could eat wannabes like Garth and Travis for 
breakfast and shit them out before lunch, and his songwriting is full 
of the kind of narrative detail one usually associates with rock 
songwriters like John Hiatt, Bruce Springsteen and Ray Davies. His 
band is a tight, rockin' unit that make songs like "Copperhead Road" 
and "And the Rain Came Down" singe your eyebrows. The other country 
album every Rush fan should own.

Miles Davis--Live at the Plugged Nickel and We Want Miles--Simply 
indispensible. The first is the one with Ron Carter (bass), Tony 
Williams (drums), Herbie Hancock (piano), and Wayne Shorter (tenor 
sax), and is straight-ahead jazz at its best. The second is the Rock 
Band--Mike Stern and John Scofield (guitars), Michael Brecker (tenor 
sax), Don Grolnick (keyboards), Marcus Miller (electric bass), and (I 
think) Peter Erskine (drums). This is what fusion sounded like before 
Kenny G got a hold of it.

Phish--A Live One--wow!! A clever, shifting-yet-seamless display of 
compositional chutzpah and improvisational gusto. Phish are 
musicianly, but never elitist. Any comparisons between them and the 
Dead are rendered meaningless by the end of disc one. Unlike many 
other jam-bands, Phish's jams are never static or meandering, and 
always feel like they have a sense of direction. Comparing Phish to 
the Dead is like comparing Yes and Rush.  Similar, but not the same. 
People always talked about what the Dead were like on a "good night". 
Phish have never had a bad one. 

BB King--Live at the Regal--the definitive recording of the electric 
blues played in front of a live audience.

Yes--Keys to Ascension I and II--The classic Yes lineup, older, wiser 
and every bit as good as you remember them being, recorded in San 
Luis Obispo in 1996. All the classics are here, played with the 
abandon of people half their age and musicianship of people much 
older. Cool.

There ya go,
>...don't laugh...

Subject: My burning questions!

I know it's been forever and a day since I have posted, but I've never left
ya!

1.	Did the CNN showbiz piece ever air?

2.   Why does Analog Kid recording seem so out of place?  It just sounds
different, not bad different, but just different?

3.  Does anyone know of site that might have the infamous "Hai Karate" promo
photo from the RTB sessions?

4.  I usually don't take any review with a grain of salt, but can that amateur
reviewer from Entertainment Weekly just get bent?  You either like the album
or you don't pal.  I'm sure Fred Gruber appreciates you calling the Rhythm
Method boring and amateur like.  And guess what, Rush can release a 4th live
album if they want.  After trashing the album he gave it a C+.  I'm a teacher
and when I give a C+, it has good stuff to it.  Goodbye subscription EW!  If
you don't know what I'm talking about, look at last week's issue.

5. Is there a transcript to Sonicnet's Webcast and when is the replay.  My
cast was going great until Alex's humping and someone's brilliant question
about "Sound" and why Rush is so dedicated to sound.  Somebody probably asked
if they have ever been to Cygnus X-1.

If anyone would like to respond in private, feel encouraged to do so.

Thanks

I hesitated before writing that because I figured
someone would bite at it, and thus continue the
thread, which at this point has a tenuous connection
to Rush at best.
This will be my last contribution on this subject; if
anyone would like to continue it (I certainly don't
mind interesting discussions), please do so through
email to me, not TNMS.

I used to hold the same opinion you do... and for
all practical purposes it works fine.  However (and
this is simplifying matters greatly in order to help
make this clear), according to quantum theory, you
cannot know both the location and the speed of any
particle at that level.  Thus, if *everything*
stopped at absolute zero, you would know both the
velocity and location, which isn't possible...

>Would make a GREAT basis for a CX1 or NS type Rush song.....

Now *that* I agree with.

It is very interesting idea--TNMS/RUSH Convention.
I think many of you who are interested in organizing this event should
start NOW because you need to block rooms for hotels and also look at the
site where majority of fans could attend without spending mega bucks so
that we have best attendance.

But first I recommend that you have a name to coin it. I like TNMS/RUSH
but you may want to take a poll as in "Signals vs TNMS"!!!
The place I recommend is some place or city where a radio station is
huge, I mean HUGE fan or supporter of Rush. I can think of South Bend,
Indiana. When I was out there for few days 3 different stations played
Rush tunes in 1 day!!! Also I experienced very cool hospitality there. 

But take a poll so that you have an idea how many fans will show.

Subject: 4-Letter Rock Groups

For my first post to the NMS I'll begin with the obligatory:  been a Rush
fan since PWaves, first show was Signals (at the ripe age of 12), seen
every tour since and they are absolutely at least as impressive now as I
can recall from those chaparoned days.....and what compliments can I say of
DS that haven't already been said?  I just can't seem to get it out of my
cd player.....

Now for a flashback I had while listenting to 2112 on DS:

It's around 1991 and I'm watching Jeopardy between my Calculus and
Astronomy classes.  Alex (Tribek, that is) is looking as sharp as ever and
I notice that one of the categories behind him is "4-Letter Rock Groups".
So after waiting for these clowns to clear out every other possible
category, finally Alex reads the "answer":

Alex:		This Canadian power trio is best known for such songs as "Tom
Sawyer", "New World Man", and 			"Two-One-One-Two"   [HUH?]

Loser:		Who is REO Speedwagon!	[WHAT?]

Alex:		Oh, I'm so sorry, that's incorrect

Needless to say, the other 2 avoided their buzzers after this guy.  

I find it encouraging that my musical tastes are almost never represented
in network game shows, and when they are they even stump the host!

The feeling is mutual. Do the words European Union (of which the UK is

The recordings the original poster referred to were partly made in Glasgow

Subject: Re: The Magic Note in Limelight

This is a brief remark on the lovely Michael Skurka-Ray Lambert 
discussion about the magic note in the Different Stages version of 
Limelight.

I am quite certain that the magic note is there! However, it is not 
sustained. I love Ray's demystification of the magic note for I like 
to think of Alex Lifeson as a guitar player on the edge where things 
are bound to go wrong. That's when smiles and imagination must save 
the day ;-). Furthermore, to those who feel the magic is gone with 
Ray's excellent technical explanation: the fact that the magic note 
can actually be played live, doesn't make it aesthetically any less 
"magic".

Just a philosopher's thought.

Subject: Simmer Down! It's "Entertainment Weekly"! "Entertainment Weekly"!!!

So EW called 2112 & NS "masterbatory"? Big deal. Why should any of us
care? "Masterbatory" is simply music-criticspeak for "has a lot of
notes". They reviewer was correct in that sense. DS still got a C+. This
isn't bad considering Rush is not normal EW fare. Someone said in a
recent NMS that the reviewer didn't listen to DS. I think the reviewer
DID listen to DS, he/she simply hadn't listened to the studio versions
(or older live versions) of most of the songs on DS. He/she basically
said that Rush performed their classics exactly like the studio
versions. Anyone can tell that 2112 is SO, SO, SO different from the
studio version (& the ATWAS version). In my opinion, TS, CTTH, Trees,
etc. are all significantly different from past versions (studio OR
live). So, everyone should just calm down. EW obviously didn't have any
background, and hey a C+ still isn't that bad in the long run. Anyways,
we all bought it & love it so that's what counts. Besides, the other
publication's reviews (Rolling Stone comes to mind) have been LARGELY
more positive. Rush is getting recognition for DS, just not from EW;
which is fitting, don't you think?

CMW

P.S. Please don't send them all sorts of emails telling them they suck.
It makes us all look like a bunch of goddamn trekkies.

Subject: A story of 3's (and stuff)

Hello again from the (even wetter) Great Pacific Northwest!!!

Yesterday was my 3rd anniversary with my better half & she bought me the 
DS set!!!!  Hmm..lessee....3 cd's, 3rd anniversary, fav #=3, 3 guys in 
the band, 3 levels on the tinkerlith (I'll get to that in a minute), 
TRI-fold packaging....woo-hoo!!  I finally got the DS set!!!(oh, yeah, I 
said that already).
I haven't listend to it yet, but thought I'd offer my 2 cents worth 
about the packaging.....
True to form, the boys have put together a package that's nearly as 
entertaining as the cd's in contains...
In regards to the tinkerlisk:
Explanations are on the diagram on the back of the package...it 
represents 3 distinct stages in their career (as well as the 
semi-traditional representation of 3 of something symbolic of the boys 
themselves...HYF, DS, CP are prime examples.)
The kids shirt:
2112 logo with F II K, no doubt about it.
Here's my question:
Anybody know what it says on the shirt of the guy (on the right) that's 
hauling Alex away???
ALso, I'm no math wiz, but something tells me that the equations on the 
back of the package in the diagram might yield something interesting!??  
(like the answer 3 or some such)  Any body work them out yet???
One last thing, it is my sincere hope that we can allow Neil, and 
ourselves, to move beyond his loss.   We cannot be selfish and beg for 
new releases and all that, if they do they do.  If not, then we thank 
them for all they have given of themselves, and we get over that too.  
I've been a huge fan for 20 years now, but even they have lives they'd 
like to lead & since Neil has lost the two people most important in his 
life, I am sure he's trying very hard to find himself again.  The 
sentiment on the inside cover (of DS) is all that need be said, let's 
all respect Neil and "Leave that thing alone".

Hi everyone,

The Japanese version of DS was out today. It has "Force Ten"
(June 4, 1997 Riverbend Music Center, Cincinnati, OH) as a 
bonus track. Also has CD size replicas of AFTK and T4E tour 
books. Too small to read Neil's comments, though :^(

Say, does anyone know how to get the Cluster Works program to "react"
to the music on the CD?  I was under the impression that it would
respond TO the music.  I can only get it to interact with the sounds
that are part of the CW program.  I'm guessing that it is up to the
user to control the effects manually.

Also, does anyone have the web address to Scarred Records?  Thanks!

Well today is different with the release of Different Stages...and I 
truely believe tomorrow will be the same!!!  (Since like I shall thrash 
upon my air guitar as Dreamline hits the headlines in my mind!)
Just as I've done every chance I've had since the release of Different 
Stages!!!  So just as I gave all the guys in my wedding some titanium 
mugs with the inscription "Thanks Mate!", I say "Thanks Mates!"  And yes 
I believe I'll join you in your toast on CP!!!

I truely believe that no live release captures a band better than this 
one captures RUSH through time!!!  Yeah there's been the gripes and 
complaints from some fans who want to hear this song or that song done 
live from the past four stages...and I as well would LOVE to hear some 
of them as well...however, this is Thanksgiving weekend here in the US 
of A, and while much of the nation focus' on Detroit and watching the 
Lions and Steelers...I will think of the band from the land just north 
and say in my mind "Thanks Mates!"

Thanks for enduring, persevering, intellectualizing your brandish rock 
that begins our days with a friendly voice and companions unobtrusive!!!  
Even though we RUSH fans know more than half the world is REALLY MISSING 
OUT on a GEM of a band...we personalize it, put it on file and say 
things like "Like Bevis...what are you using that issue of Rolling Stone 
as toilet paper for?....wait what am I saying...why isn't all Rolling 
Stone magazine toilet paper?"  

And in the words of Bob & Doug (Like my other favorite Canadians ... the

Subject: Thanks to Rob Miceli

I want to say a public "thank you" to Rob Miceli for his hospitality
towards me at The Orbit Room on the night of the 13th.

I was in Canada on business, and took the opportunity to see Toronto.
As luck would have it, Alex was there that night.  I met him shortly
after dinner while things were still calm, and expressed a brief
"thanks".

The place got very busy and crowded, but I did also get to meet and chat
with a few really big fans.  It was a great experience.

Later,
Pete

Subject: Rock Hall

Hey, I'm sure we all know that Rush was not selected to the Rock Hall
induction for next year.  Okay, fine, we will keep plugging away.  I'm sorry
for the long post, but as I read the Rush Related posts on the Rock Hall web
page, It sickens me.  We can't get in little band wars with people, it is
just idiotic.  Not only that, but this "Rush Rules" stuff and "Rush can kick
your bands Ass" stuff is sophomoric and it makes Rush and their fans look
like a bunch of losers.  Now, I know that other people do it on that group
with other bands, but we should rise above that.  This is a message that I
posted to the Rock Hall page.  I would love fan feed back, and let me know
if I'm way off, or dead on. THE FOLLOWING IS NOT ABOUT TNMS....IT IS ABOUT
THE ROCK HALL PAGE.....PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE THE TWO!!!!!!!!!

This page boggles my mind.  I read it hoping to catch some worthy discussion
on Rock music, and all I see are silly little band wars.  I also hate seeing
people "busting" on other people, just because they have a different taste
in music.  I could do that too, but what is the point.  I have a love for
music, and that is what brings me to this page.  I'm just trying to broaden
my perspectives.  I understand the choices the Rock Hall has made this year,
and all though I may not listen to everything by those particular artist, I
can understand and respect their contribution to Rock.  Sure, I think there
are plenty of people out there deserving to be in, under the criteria, but
they are not there yet, and that is that.  Now, Rush is my favorite band,
period, but some of you Rush fans have been really sophomoric and idiotic.
Do I think they should get in, of course, am I totally bummed that they are
not in yet, no.  They will get their shot, someday, I hope.  If not, oh
well, I like them and I have their CDs to listen to, Rock Hall or not.  As
for Kiss, sure they deserve to go in for maybe the image they brought to the
world of the "Over-Sexed Rock God" stuff.  Give it time people.  Certainly,
these are not the greatest rock musicians to walk the planet, and arguing
that they are would be futile, because there is just no way to prove or
disprove any of it.  The last time I checked, induction was an honor, not a
contest.  Now, those of you who don't see the talent (whether you like the
music or not) of the artist already inducted, I feel sorry for you, because
you are really leading sheltered musical lives.  Like I said, Rush is my
favorite band, but if I never at least exposed myself to the talent of
others, then I never would have gotten my degree in music, and my love for
the entire world of music.  Although we have favorites, I can realize that
there is an entire musical world to discover beyond Geddy, Alex and Neil.
Of course, If you ask me personally, I would tell that Rush rules and that
these guys are gods, but this is not really the place for that type of
stuff.  A little more why and a lot less who is what this forum needs.

If someone has already posted this review, sorry, just scroll down its 
from Rocktropolis, one of the most positive reviews of Different Stages 
that I've seen:

                 Rush is worshiped by a lot of
                 musicians -- including the members of
                 Metallica, Gang Starr, Smashing
                 Pumpkins, and nine inch nails -- but
                 especially drummers. Yet on this
                 three-disc live album, specifically on the
                 two discs recorded mostly during last
                 year's Test for Echo tour, it's not Neal
                 Peart who stands out but guitarist Alex
                 Lifeson. He tears through the opening
                 riff of "Limelight" like the song is butter
                 and he's a chainsaw, then cuts through
                 such tracks as "Driven," "Animate," and
                 "The Trees" until they finally come to
                 "2112," which he plays like his life
                 depends on it. And that's just the first
                 disc. The guitars may have the most
                 bite here, but they'd be nowhere without
                 some solid rhythms to back them up,
                 and bassist/ singer Geddy Lee and
                 Peart are as solid as they come. They
                 even loosen things up a bit (something
                 they should do more often), ending
                 "Closer to the Heart" with a rhythmic
                 jam that would make Blues Traveler
                 proud. As if that wasn't enough, the
                 third disc comes from 1978, and
                 includes a number of the longer songs
                 ("Cygnus X-1," "Farewell to Kings")
                 they don't play anymore.

Pretty cool how they singled out Alex, especially in light of the recent 
thread about him being in the background of Neal and Geddy.

Subject: The Rhythm Method

Greg,

  I did something fun - converted all Rush to MP3 on my
PC.  I edited the drum solos out from the 4 live albums
and made a playlist for these 4 "songs".  Listening to 
them right in a row like that gives such a fantastic
sense of the GROWTH of Neil's playing.  You can hear 
elements from the ATWAS solo change through ESL and
again in ASOH and again in DS.  If it was left out on
DS the progression would be lost.  Personally the way
that Neil chooses to modify his solos as the years go
by is a telling sign of the band's progression.  I will
leave it up to others to decide for themselves which 
version is "better", I say they're all awesome and the
changes are a cool progression, none is better than the
others, just different.

 -Subject: I was there!/ Geddy's bass solo in Driven

 -For a short time during a song, which my brother and I believe was Driven,
 -Alex's guitar sound went out.  We believe that this is the reason behind the
 -guy saying "shake it off" to Alex- Alex did seem a bit peeved about it when it
 -happened.  

 -Geddy's bass solo, we also believe, happened as a direct result of Alex's
 -sound going out- the band needed to do SOMETHING while they fixed Alex's
 -sound.  This brings up an interesting question- Did Geddy play a bass solo at
 -other shows than this one during Driven?  I'm curious as to if the solo was
 -planned and a regular part of their set on this tour or if was only done out
 -of emergency, as this one appeared to be at the time it happened.  
They played at the Rose Garden Portland, OR show and the show at The Gorge at
Gearge Washington show as well. But I believe these were after your show.

 -ps- Does anyone else out there miss not having the second guitar solo in
 -Natural Science?  
That was the first thing that I noticed too!!! As this is on of Alex's best
solos(OK there all good!)

I keep reading/hearing about bootlegs (like The Fly).  Do any have Between 
the Wheels on the setlist?  I missed the Grace Under Pressure show in '84 - 
they didn't come to Jacksonville FL that year (probably because someone had 
wanted to get to the stage so badly at their Signals show two years earlier 
they - the insane fan, not the band - had drawn a knife).  I've never heard 
it live but always wanted to hear Alex's live treatment of the solo in it. 
 Any answers?

Subject: Re:NMS#2147, Alex's "ending" to Limelight.

Just adding my comments to a few of the posts about the "missing" sustaining
high note on "Limelight".  Both posters have the idea, it's a delay with a
fed-back note "sustained" by a delay.  What or how, I dunno.. But funny 
thing,  I was playing the other night ( goofing really ) and after playing 
that song for years, and trying to get "that note" I finally achieved it.  
With my Peavey Wolfgang through the Good ol' Marshall.  It hit the pitch and 
I sustained it forever.  ( The Wolfgang is a WONDERFUL axe! ).  I was
shopping for a Paul Reed Smith ( which Alex and others use now ) and played the
Wolfie and never looked back!

Anyway, about the comments about sequencers.  I wrote this before but will
repost for others that haven't seen it.  RUSH does not use sequencers live.
Yes, thats right.  They use samplers.

They sample sequences, not sequence samples. ( if that makes sense! ).
ALL the info could be found in the July '97 EQ magazine.  All of the old and 
new ) parts are "sampled".  These samples ( of, well might *be* a sequence ) 
are played back by either keyboard or floor pedals.  Neil needs to keep all 
this in time..  VERY INTERESTING article.  Explains all the mystery!

DS hasn't come out of my cd player since I got it.

Neil on Test for Echo ( double bass ) is just mind-blowing!
I think this is the greatest thing on the CD.
( and I'm a guitar player! )

Well, replies to my post about the Rhythm Method are flooding in, giving 
me much to think about.  Anyway, I just thought I'd mention that I'm 
sick of not hearing any Rush on the radio here in the UK, so tonight I 
decided to use my regular slot on the local student radio station 
(GCR1602AM in Guildford, Surrey) to broadcast pure, unadulterated DS. :)

I had to cut 2112 (played it last week), LTTA and the Rhythm Method (no 
comment) to fit two cd's worth into my showtime, but it was worth it, 
from the 2001 intro, right down to the last four notes of YYZ.

Congrats to Eric Gusek, who will be receiving a ClusterWorks insert from 
me in the mail shortly.

Subject: DS's Poor Showing in Billboard Charts & Record Executives

Hello RUSH fans,

I was just looking at the December 5 issue of the Billboard to 200 
albums.  For your information, Different Stages sits at 97 on the top 
200 albums.  It's not that I am influenced by chart action.  However, I 
am kind of surprised that such an incredible live album (music & 
package) has done so poorly only two weeks after being released.

For 20 years (circa. 2112 in '76 to T4E in '96), RUSH supporters have 
been the most loyal in the galaxy.  Some of you may blame Atlantic 
Records' marketing strategy.  I have not seen much DS publicity in music 
/ trade magazines.

For fact, I know that RUSH's contract with Atlantic is not a multiple 
record deal.  As we all know, since moving from Mercury to Atlantic 
Records in the US, the boys have not had a «big selling» album.  Presto, 
Roll the Bones, Counterparts and Test For Echo all sold around 600,000 
copies: gold certification.

Record company excutives, as we all know, are accountants, lawers and 
suits with an MBA.  They are not music lovers like Cliff Burnstein who 
presured Mercury Records' president to sign RUSH in 1975.  Uncle Cliff 
later became a big time manager in the music business.  He and Peter 
Mench started working for CCC or Lebber & Krebs (Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, 
New York Dolls, AC/DC, Scorpions, Michael Schenker, Def Leppard, etc.), 
and afterwards he and Mench branched on their own with Def Leppard, 
Metallica, Tesla and Queensryche.

There you go, we can not count on Atlantic to push DS.  Therfore, all of 
you on the National Midnight Star have to promote the album by calling 
your local radio stations, convincing a friend, et cetera.

Regards,

Frank

No, no, no! Queensryche is not breaking up. Chris DeGarmo has left the
band, but they've recorded about 25 songs and will use 12 or more of them
for a new album, they're going to be working on artwork for the album soon
and will be having a fanclub-only show in Seattle on January 16th. Their
new guitarist, Kelly Gray, will be in the show.

So, do not fret, Rycheans. There will be more music from Queensryche.

There's been alot of talk here about clusterworks but i haven't heard
it mentioned that there are special features of it that may be causing
the problems on windows based machines..I found this at a web site
which is listed below....The new "RUSH: Different Stages  
features an enhanced CD (on disk 1) that contains a very cool
interactive 
art/screensaver application by Hisashi Hoda (too hard to describe - you 
have to see it). Not only was I happy to see that the program is both 
Windows and Mac compatible, but it is built upon Quicktime 3 and has a 
Mac-ONLY feature that allows the program to "react" to the music of any 
audio CD playing in the drive! Hopefully you will purchase it for the 
music and enjoy the art as a bonus. The documentation lists a website
for 
more info on the software at 
<http://www.wonderlab.com,> but I found it 
to be "Under Construction."
btw..i think one of the reasons for this is that rush as a band or
individuals, are know to use macintosh computers..i found this out at
a web site called celebrity mac users....was rather odd to see rush
next to the likes of tom cruse and nicole kidman:))

I was talking to my boss the other day about the new live album and he

the show and that there were no chairs - that everyone sat on the floor or

Subject: Re:  RUSH & Queensryche (no Rush content)

I don't post here often but I would just like to clear up something. 
Queensryche is NOT history.  While it IS true that Chris DeGarmo left
the band, the new album is just about done and reports from people who
have heard 4 of the songs is that it sounds like a cross between Empire
and Mindcrime, or a Mindcrime sound with a more bassy sound.  It is
slated for an early '99 release.  They have also changed record labels
and the band is also planning a January fan club concert to debut their
new guitarist Kelly Grey.  

The report on KISW has already been dismissed by the band themselves as
erroneous at the recent Seattle '98 fan club meeting.  I have heard many
rumors about why they broke up but nothing has ever been substantiated
by ANY of the band members.  Things were a bit nasty at first, with
Chris supposedly excercising his "rights" and trying to tell the band
they couldn't play the tunes he wrote in concert anymore.  This has
since been resolved and by all accounts everything is well.

I for one was not happy with their recent turn(HITNF) and everyone
connected with the band has said that Chris wrote the majority of the
album.  Perhaps the band also wasn't happy with the new direction that
Chris was taking the band.

I for one am looking forward to their new release and hope they
recapture the sound and attitude of old.

Subject: Replacement Songs

It's amazing to see the level of content in these newsletters.  Being an
avid Rush fan since 1980, I shake my head at the free time we seem to
have.  I would like to make a suggestion:  I too feel that songs should
not have been repeated in DS, so I am suggesting a movement for us all to
Return DS, so that they can start over, with just songs that have not been
on the other 3 live albums.  My first suggestion for a never heard live
song would be Rivendell, followed by Tai Shan, then Madrigal (I mean why
not, it's the only AFTK song that is not on DS), and finally Tears.  If
the band doesn't have any of these songs recorded, I suggest we start a
movement to make them get back on tour and play those songs ... 

We can call this movement the Back On Work, Empty Lives movement, or
the B.O.W.E.L. movement for short.

Please send all flames to the band, directly

Subject: Entertainment Weekly Story

While we're all sticking little pins in little Entertainment Weekly =
Reviewer dolls, I thought I'd share a little story that embarrassed the =
crap out of the magazine and may make you all feel a little better.

Anyone heard of Shania Twain?  She's just about the hottest thing around =
today in country music (No, I don't like Country Music either, but her =
stuff AIN'T bad!  Her producer/husband is Mutt Lange who produced such =
excellent groups as Def Leppard, AC/DC, Foreigner and The Cars to name a =
few).  Anyway, Shania took the country by storm with her previous album =
entitled "The Woman In Me" which came out about three years ago.  Well, =
before anyone had gotten a chance to listen to her, our dear friends at =
EW reviewed the album and gave it an F !  That's right, an F !  Well, =
funny thing is, is that when Shania's album when quintroplatinum or =
whatever, they RESCINDED the review and re-reviewed it!  Talk about a =
bunch of cheesy losers!

Here's another story that puts music critics in their place:
The original host of the Tonight Show was a comedian named Steve Allen =
who is also a great jazz pianist.  Well, since Steve is a funny =
comedian, the critics never took his music seriously.  One time, many =
years ago, his album got a nasty review.  So, he re-released it a year =
later and got his black maid to dress up like a piano player and pose at =
the piano on the new cover and released under the maid's (unknown) name. =
 The SAME critic, mind you, gave it an excellent review!!

The moral of this story is don't let bad reviews get to you.  The only =
way some of these critics can make themselves look good is to knock =
other people down, gives em' a feeling of power.  Just remember, YOU =
love Rush, so does about a million other people, you got lot's of =
companions on the web, lots of albums and the guys are so gosh darned =
nice that they released what could be called a "Box Set" of live music =
that you could buy as cheap as $16.99!!  I'm happy.  You should be too!

Peace and Happy Thanksgiving!

Rush got:    NO, NO, 2 stars, and "Great band, but 4th multiple live set =
is 3 too many."

Heading up the list was:  King's X with yes,yes, 4.5 stars and "Comeback =
complete. Pop-metal crown is theirs again."  Other groups ahead of Rush =
were Local H, Galactic Cowboys, The Offspring, DLR (David Lee Roth) =
Band, Kiss, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, The Donnas, The Living End, Eve 6, =
Less Than Jake, Monster Magnet, Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Kid =
Rock, Fear Factory, Judas Priest, and Mud Honey.

You make the call.
I also get Entertainment Weekly (free subscription) and I think I want =
to cancel both and I didn't even pay for them.
